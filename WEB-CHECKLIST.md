# 🎨 WEB DEVELOPMENT CHECKLIST

## BEFORE Writing ANY HTML Code

**❓ Ask These Questions FIRST:**
1. Is this webpage for Mindvalley or related to Mindvalley? 
2. Does this need professional branding?
3. Will this be shared with teams or stakeholders?

**If YES to any → STOP and invoke `mindvalley-design` skill FIRST**

## The Mindvalley Design Process

```
1. 🎯 INVOKE mindvalley-design skill
2. 📝 Let it invoke frontend-design skill  
3. 🎨 Apply brand colors and typography
4. 📱 Ensure mobile responsiveness
5. ✅ Review against brand guidelines
```

## Never Skip This Again

**The Pattern That Failed:**
❌ "Let me quickly create a webpage" → Write HTML directly → Realize later it's not branded

**The Pattern That Works:**  
✅ "I need a webpage" → "Is this Mindvalley?" → Invoke mindvalley-design skill → Professional result

## Emergency Brand Check

If I catch myself writing HTML without using mindvalley-design:
1. **STOP immediately**
2. **Delete and start over** with mindvalley-design skill
3. **Update this checklist** if I found a gap

## Memory Trigger

**Before every `<invoke name="write">` with HTML:**
- Read the filename/path
- If it's in `/web/` folder → **Use mindvalley-design skill**
- If it's for Vishen/teams → **Use mindvalley-design skill**  
- If it's a landing page → **Use mindvalley-design skill**

**When in doubt → Use mindvalley-design skill**
