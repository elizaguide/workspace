# Script in Vishen's Voice

Stop trying to be spiritual.

The world does not need more spiritual people.
ㅤ
The world needs people who actually get things done.
ㅤ
Somewhere along the way, spirituality became a performance.

People chasing enlightenment while avoiding responsibility.

They spend hours meditating.
Talking about alignment.
Waiting for the universe to deliver.
ㅤ
But they never actually move.
ㅤ
This isn't growth.

This is what I call spiritual procrastination.
ㅤ
The spirituality we should seek shows up in motion.

When you're building.
Creating.
Solving problems.
Leading people.
ㅤ
And still staying conscious while doing it.
ㅤ
It's not about escaping the world.

It's about elevating how you operate *inside* it.
ㅤ
So meditate, yes.

But then go build the company.
Launch the idea.
Have the hard conversation.
Fix the system.
ㅤ
Bring your consciousness into the chaos.
ㅤ
Because the goal isn't to be spiritual.

The goal is to be awake while you change the world.
