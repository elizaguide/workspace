Preparation 2: Welcome to A Yogi's Guide to Joy
--------------------
<v ->Well, my fundamental purpose is to move people</v> from heaven to earth, religion to responsibilities. That is, human experience the quality of how you experienced this life is determined from within, not from above somewhere. So this whole habit of looking up for everything has become the norm in large parts of the world that somebody up there is managing our life. But the problem is we are on a round planet, which is always spinning and obviously we do not even know which is up and which is down in this cosmos, that's the fact. So human experience, whether it's joy or misery, agony and ecstasy, even pain or pleasure happens from within us. So if you take charge of your interiority, managing the quality of your experience on this planet is very simple. If this one thing happens that you are in a pleasant state of experience, because you determine what happens within you. If you determine what happens within you, obviously you will choose the highest level of pleasantness. When you're in a pleasant state of experience, let's say you're joyful now I don't have to tell you don't harm anybody, don't do this nonsense, don't do that nonsense because when you're feeling wonderful, you do wonderful things around you. When you're feeling horrible, you want to share it. When you're feeling frustrated, you want to share it. When you're feeling some kind of pain, you want to share it to others. But when you're feeling wonderful, it is natural your life finds an expression as a wonderful place. So we don't really need a morality for this. We just need an outpouring of humanity. So my whole effort is just this, to move people from religion to responsibility. This does not mean any irreverence to anything, any disregard to anything, it is just that coming to the facts of life, human experiences occurs from within. If you're concerned about a beautiful experience for ourselves, it's very, very important we take charge of our interiority. So this is why in our engineering, engineering yourself in such a way that you are the way you want yourself to be. I may not be the way you want me to be, but I'm the way I want to be. And this is wonderful because when I make myself the way I want, naturally I'll make myself as pleasant as possible within myself. Because I'm feeling so pleasant naturally I will do pleasant things around me. If I was feeling nasty, I'm sure I will do nasty things, which is what is happening in the world. All these people here, there are lots of them here and I took the responsibility of all these millions of people and since then, I don't know when I will go to sleep when I will wake up. So there is no regular day in my life. Every day is, it changes. The only thing about me every day is a different day. Every day is whichever way it is. So I don't have a standard day. Maybe in a few years, they'll give me some standard days. I've been petitioning for a longer day, and I've never been allotted that longer day. I said, "At least make it 26 hours, 28 hours for me." But even though I'm a yogi mystic, whatever nonsense, nobody is giving me one hour extra, same 24 hours. So I've never had a long day. So the question is only this, how do I manage this playfully, joyfully? The most important thing is we must understand you cannot manage your life playfully and joyful. You can only manage this one playfully and joyfully. Outside is just an expression. You're trying to manage your expression. Don't do that. You manage the source, which is this. If you manage this well, activity will happen in coherence with who you are. If I'm miserable, my activity will find a certain type of expression. If I'm very joyful, it'll find a certain type of expression. Now people are trying to be joyful. They're trying to have a joyful family, loving friendship. It doesn't work like that. You are joyful, you are loving so wherever you are, it happens, otherwise how will it happen? So the problem is, when I was farming way back, a few decades ago, somebody came to my farm and they said, they've invented a new spray. I had a mango farm and they said, "This spray, if you spray it on the mango, the fruit will become much bigger." Then I said, "Why don't you spray and spray it on your brains and show me that it becomes bigger. Because as far as I'm concerned, it's always the root we nourish, not the fruit."

====================

Part 1: Transcend Suffering

====================

LESSON 1: The Source of All Suffering
--------------------
<v ->I know the eastern minds have also absorbed this,</v> in a horribly, hmm, distorted way. But, right now, if you told your friend or your relative, I'm going to the ashram for three days, they would become very kind towards you and ask why and what went wrong? Something must be wrong with your life. You're going to ashram, to heal a wound, to solace yourself. Something must be really wrong with your life or you must be too old for life. Otherwise, why would you go to an ashram? So this has crept into this culture also, Essentially, If you're alive only in parts, or if you're partially alive. To be partially alive, to be partially alive, is a terrible torture. Many of you have been through the science classes. I'm sure you opened up frogs and cockroaches, did you? They were nice lively beings, but you open them up because you wanted to find their heart and liver and kidney. Half alive, being half alive is torture. Have you seen this? Always being half alive is torture. This is the torture that a large segment of humanity is going through right now because they're half alive. Only one part of them has become alive. Only their physicality and mentality has become alive. The rest of it is yet to become alive. Half alive people will suffer everything. They will suffer ignorance. They will suffer education. They will suffer poverty. They will suffer affluence. They will suffer being alone. They will suffer being in a relationship. If they're not married, they suffer. If they're married, they, they... If they don't have children they suffer that. As if. Children if they are there, they can come and bite you. They do. No children, what are you suffering? But then also this. Just show me one thing that human beings are not suffering right now. Just show me one aspect of life that human beings are not suffering right now. They're suffering just about anything, Not just life. They're even suffering death before it happens. He's thinking of building a pyramid for himself. That which is and that which is not, everything they suffer. This is not. You are not suffering, loneliness. You are not suffering company. You are not suffering money. You are not suffering poverty. What you're suffering is, you're half alive. You're desperately trying to make yourself fully alive, through money, through drink, through sex, through going on a trek, coming to the ashram. In so many ways, you're somehow trying to make yourself fully alive. Which is yet to happen fully. Here and there you feel a burst of aliveness, but again, it ebbs down. So when people are constantly half alive, pleasure becomes an important part of your life, very important part of your life. Without it, you cannot exist. Pleasure becomes paramount in your life, when you're only half alive. When physicality is all that you know, pleasure becomes of immense importance in your life. If you become fully alive, you will become so blissful, joyful, ecstatic without reason. Burst of ecstasy without, within you, without any reason. It's almost embarrassing. Now the thought of pleasure, just evaporates. Looking for a drink, looking for some kind of pleasurable pain. Just evaporates out of your mind because you're fully alive.

====================

LESSON 1: Complementary Video - What Does Responsibility Mean?
--------------------
<v ->What does responsibility mean to the individual?</v> <v ->Say, you are...</v> We know you're alive only because you have an ability to respond. If there is somebody around here, no matter what you do to him, if there's no response, if you call him, if you shake him, if you poke him, if there's no response, you will naturally think he's dead. So, the sign of aliveness is in response. Response need not necessarily mean verbal response or physical response. There is response. Even if a doctor wants to find out whether somebody is alive or not, they will tap them on the eyeballs. There must be response. If there's no response, then you're dead. So, your ability to respond is your ability to be alive. Now, the question is only: How alive do you wish to be? If you want to be half-alive, if you think it's safe to be half-alive, you must do one thing. And maybe you have some experience from your science classes, where you opened up and nailed a frog on a wooden plank and open up his stomach and his heart and you saw how wonderful his heart was beating, that was study for you. But the frog was looking at you, "What is wrong with you?" Because you're keeping him half-alive. Keeping anything half-alive is torture. Death is a relief. Full aliveness is fantastic. Half-aliveness is torture. If you want to make anybody suffer, you must keep them half-alive. This is what a whole lot of human beings have done. What is comfortable? They're responsible. What is not comfortable? I'm not responsible. This makes them half-alive. What you think is mine, you respond. What you think is not mine, for that you do not respond. So, in the world, you're always calculating what to respond or what to not respond to. In this, you become half-alive and without knowing why. From your childhood, from the age of five, if you are so joyful by the time you're 30, you should have been ecstatic. Instead of that, you have become half-alive because you are calibrating your responsibility, your ability to respond. Your ability to respond should be unbridled. Your ability to respond is unlimited, but your ability to act is limited. If you just understand that physical response or physical activity is always limited, no matter how powerful, how strong, how equipped you are, still it is limited. But your ability to respond as a life is limitless. If you know this difference, then ability to respond is on all the time. Whether you see an ant or an elephant, you respond absolutely as you should, as a life. In this, you will be fully sparkling alive.

====================

LESSON 2: Resisting Change is Resisting Life
--------------------
<v ->One reason why change is becoming difficult</v> as you get older is, you have found cocoons of comfort. There are many comfort zones you created. Any disturbance of that, you're disturbed now. When you are young, you are not looking for comfort, you were looking for life. Now you're not looking for life, you're looking for comfort, safety. So when you were 16, 18, you had wild dreams as to what you want to do with your life. But at the time you became 25, you cut down on the frills and thought, this is all not practical, I'm becoming practical now. All that happened is you are becoming a coward, but you said I'm becoming practical and cut down many things and said, if I get a job, if I earn my living, this, this, this is okay. By the time you're 35, you're thinking, if I don't get into any trouble, that's enough. You're not looking forward into anything great happening. If I don't get into trouble, that's enough. But that's when you started getting into trouble. So, you are not looking at life with zest. You're looking at life as safety. The more security oriented you are, the more disturbed you will be with every change that happens in your life. The essence of physical existence is change, isn't it? Isn't it so? Everything is changing. Is there anything that's not changing? Everything in existence is changing, isn't it? The physical existence is constantly changing. The very essence of physical reality is change. Nothing is constant. Even the so-called static states are dynamic in nature. Everything is changing. So, if you resist change, you are resisting life. If you want an unchanging life, there's one beautiful place where nothing changes. That's your grave. Either, you must go to your grave or you must get enlightened. If you don't want change. Then somewhere inside everything is same. But otherwise, as long as you are a part of the physical process of the existence, everything is change. There is nothing that is not change. So at this moment you're inhaling. Next moment you're exhaling. It's change, isn't it? If you don't want change you stop it. So when you resist change, you must understand you're resisting the very process of life. Not just your life. You're resisting the very fundamental process of life. Invariably, you will invite all kinds of suffering. If you are living and you want to be dead, you will ask for trouble, isn't it? You must be living. When you are living, you must live totally. If you want to die, you must do that efficiently. There is inefficient ways of killing yourself. Really. Unhappiness and depression, are inefficient ways of killing yourself, isn't it so? At least be efficient. I can give you 10 different ways to die. Anyway, Hussain Sagar is dead. Is it still water in it? So, you need to understand this. Once you resist change, you're resisting the whole process of life and you will create unnecessary suffering. So once you resist change, depression is a natural process. Frustration, when change happens, frustration, depression. Frustration and depression. On a certain day, the devil decided to retire. Because he's retiring, he decided to put all the tools of his trade for a garage sale. So he opened up, discount sale. All the devil's tools. There is a huge rush. There are all kinds of things, anger, hatred, jealousy, this one, that one, everything on the table, all of you people went and bought it up in no time. Everything was sold out in the first hour. All his tools. The whole humanity has bought it, isn't it? But he had still one more bag. Lena went and asked the devil, "What's in that bag? Isn't that for sale?" He said, "No, no. These are the price tools. Just souvenirs I want to keep them because they have worked best to do my job." Lena said, "No, I want it please, would you sell that?" Devil said, "No, no, no. These two tools that I have in this bag, they work so wonderfully well in my whole career and I would like to keep them as my souvenirs." Once Lena said, many other people joined behind her, and please put it on sale, put it on sale, put it on sale. Then the devil pulled out and said, "Okay, if you're giving me a good price, let me put it on sale." Then he pulled out frustration and depression and put it on table. These two are the best of the devil's tools. If you want to destroy your life, frustration, you'll start with frustration, develop into depression. You're there. There's nothing worse than that. You will work against yourself. And the moment you resist change, frustration is natural. Once frustration comes, it'll naturally evolve into depression. So, you put it on sale.

====================

LESSON 2: Complementary Video - How Do We Move Into a State of Being Able to Accept and Move With Change?
--------------------
<v ->How do we move into a state of being able to accept</v> and move with change? <v ->See, to understand the nature of our own physicality</v> and our own psychological process, you need a little bit of a distance. So, it's like this, there have been arguments on this planet, whether this planet is round or flat for a long time. And people were died for these, people were killed for this, you know, all kinds of things. Even now recently there's a WhatsApp video going on about how a teacher in some West Asian country is teaching the children how planet is static, it is the sun and moon which are moving. By God's will that's what is happening, whatever. So, there are still people arguing about it. We would all continue to argue, when did this argument stop? Because in our experience, if we walk up and down, you know, on the ground out here, you can clearly see it's flat, it cannot be round. But when we started flying, when we went sailing in the oceans, we realized there seems to be a curvature but we still did not know. The moment we flew, it's 100% clear. When we went and stood on the moon and look down, 100% clear, there's no doubt anymore because of the distance. This is all that's needed. The body that you have gathered, let me stress on that, the body that you have gathered because it's the food that you've eaten which is accumulated like this, and the impressions that you have taken which is accumulated in the form of your mind. So, both your body and your mind are accumulations that you gather over a period of time. Anything that you gather can be yours, but it cannot be you. So, if experientially, if you can hold a little distance between you and your body, between you and your mind, then you clearly know the nature of your body and the nature of your mind and how to conduct them. Right now, people are 50, 60 years of age and they still don't know how to handle their thoughts and emotion. Just imagine you're 50 years of age and you don't know how to handle your five fingers. Wouldn't that seem stupid? At 50, 60, you do not know how to handle your thought and emotion, when are you going to learn? What is your lifespan? I like to understand. Are you going to be here for a million years that slowly you're learning? How come we have not figured how to even use the basic faculties that we have. This has happened simply because you're stuck in it. You cannot see it. Only if you create a little distance you will be able to see the nature of what it is. It is like you enter the stage, you start a drama and after sometime you forget that it's a drama and then your drama becomes tragic because you can't take off your costume. <v ->So, change then is inevitable and we should accept change?</v> And the way to accept it is to gain mastery over our thoughts and emotions? <v ->So, let's understand change</v> from a completely different perspective. See, right now, the most fundamental fabric or stage of life is the time in which we are. In yoga we do not see, hmm, I want to say time and space, we see time and time, okay? Time is space, that's how it is seen. It's called Kālá. Kālá means time. Kālá also means emptiness or space. Kali you know means emptiness. So, both time and space have the same word to describe that because it's the same thing. Only because there is time. There is point A and point B. Maybe modern science looks at it this way because there is point A point B, there is a time factor between the two. But how we look at it from our inner experiences only because there is time. Time is the stage. This moment is the stage upon which we are existing right now. We are not existing in space we are existing upon the stage of time. Because of time there is space or let us say they're two faces of the same thing. They're not two different things. So, time is the basic stage. Now, how do you look at time? The moment that you experienced just now, one moment ago, there is no way for you to bring it back. Do what you want. Or in other words, let's talk this way. You cannot bring back in yesterday nor can you fix yesterday. But yesterday was there no denying. And what we think is today will become yesterday. So, the fundamental fabric of life is time and that's always moving. You don't have a stagnant clock anywhere. A clock is a clock only because it's constantly moving. So, from that fundamental, every other aspect of life is dynamic and changing. If it is not changing, it is static. If it's static, we usually say it's dead.

====================

LESSON 3: The End of Suffering
--------------------
<v ->So we need to understand this.</v> People are coming to conclusions by looking at certain limitations. For example, the psychiatry and other things. People like Freud, they'll come to many conclusions about humanity, which are totally nonsensical. It is just that because they studied only sick people. They never got to study a Buddha, isn't it? They studied only mentally sick people. With that they're making conclusions about whole humanity. It's not so. Now, if you can create suffering, you can also create something else, isn't it? Do you see who you are, whatever you may think you are right now, your personality, your identification. So all these things are fine, but fundamentally, if you're really alert and listening to me, you cannot sit here as a man or a woman. You can only sit here as a certain life energy, isn't yes? If you're aware I'm a man, I'm a woman. That means you are not here totally. Do you see your big identities just fall off so easily. If you don't pay attention to it, they fall off. If you get focused on something else, they fall off. So people are trying to experience this in many ways, playing a game, jumping off a mountain, singing a song, dancing, doing this, falling in love with somebody. These are all different ways that people are trying to get involved in something to such a point that they can forget all the other nonsense that they have created. Yes? But none of these things can you sustain for 24 hours of the day. Now, we are exploring a technology where you don't have to do anything and still be that way. Because if a certain state of being is related to a certain activity, nobody can maintain that activity 24 hours a day, isn't it? Any kind of activity, whether it is playing or singing or dancing or music or love or meditation, you cannot manage it for 24 hours of the day. It's not possible, not practical. Isn't it? So that means if you can create something for one moment. So you're able to create a certain sense of freedom from suffering for one moment. If you create one moment, can't you create one more moment? Can't you create one more? One more and one more and one more. That's the way you create your life. Fortunately moments don't come at you in bunches. They're coming only one at a time. Isn't it? Are they coming in bunches? Only one at a time. If you know how to make this moment blissful, you can live blissfully, isn't it? Now suffering, please look at it and see people are capable of suffering just about anything. Is it so? People are suffering their wellbeing. People are suffering their illness. People are suffering loneliness. People are suffering togetherness. Is it so? People are suffering poverty, people are suffering affluence, is it so? People are suffering discomfort. People are suffering comfort, is it so? So they are capable of suffering anything. So obviously they are creating suffering. Yes? If you look at yourself, this life energy which you call as myself sometimes has been very blissful. Has it been joyful and blissful at certain times? Sometimes it's been absolute turmoil. Sometimes peaceful, sometimes agony, sometimes ecstasy. Has it gone through all this? So it is capable of finding all these various expressions. So if it is capable of all this, if only if you had little mastery over your life energies, what would you instruct your life energies to be? Misery or joy? So people who have no control over their systems, they're talking suffering is inevitable. No, suffering is not inevitable. Suffering is self-created. If you are aware, if you take your body into control, if you just have little mercy over your body, at least 15 to 25, 30% of your life, and destiny will be in your hands, please see, just your body physical mastery, is it so? If you take your mind into your control, if you have mastery over your mind, at least 40 to 60% of your mind will be, 40 to 60% of your life will be in your control. If you take your life energies into your control, 100% of your destiny will be in your control. The very way you live and the very way you die will be decided by you. So technology because the technology is subjective. Now, the technologies that you're handling are objective technologies. No, I'm talking about a subjective technology. It's about you. Here you are the software that you're trying to handle. Fundamentally if you look at yourself, right now you're operating according to the software that you have become, please see, what kind of family you were born in, what kind of parents, what kind of school, what kind of friends, what kind of atmosphere, what kind of religion, what kind of society? That's the kind of person you are right now, isn't it? So software was written into you haphazardly where anybody and everybody that you came in touch with, not by trained professionals, just about anybody who came, they're putting something, wherever you went, somebody stuffed something into your head. You had no choice from where to receive, where not to receive. If you say I don't like this, man, I don't want to receive anything from him. You will receive much more from him than anybody else. That's how this one is. So right now, the very way you think, feel, understand, and act in your life is just the way your software is. Isn't it? The very way you move your body is the way your software is. I want you to understand this. It is so deeply conditioned. If you are somebody you know very well. Somebody whom you're very familiar with is walking one mile away. You can't recognize anything about that person, but just the way he moves, you know it is this person. Isn't it? Because the very way his body moves only moves whichever way his software is written. But this software is written unconsciously. Now if we want some freedom to happen. If we want some transformation to happen, we have to create a little space between you and your softwares. You're too identified with it, you're just lost in it. That's all you become. And you will have to create a little distance. You've heard of a word called Buddha, hmm? If I say Buddha, probably you always think of Gautama Buddha, is not the only Buddha, that's not his name. He became a Buddha. There have been thousands of Buddhas and there still are. What Buddha means is Bu means Buddhi or the intellect. Dha means Dadha, one who is above, one who is above his intellect is a Buddha. Once you're above the intellectual process, suffering is finished in your life because all suffering is manufactured where, in your logical mind. When you are into your intellect, when you're stuck in your intellect, you are a non-stop suffering human being, wherever you put, you have a way of creating some kind of suffering. You fears, your anxieties, your tensions, you are stressed, just see people are capable of suffering just about anything. Isn't it so? People are capable of suffering just about anything in the world, please see. If you are not educated, you will suffer that. If you get educated, you suffer that. If you don't find a job, you'll suffer that, if you find a job you'll suffer that. If you're not married, you'll suffer that. If you get married you'll suffer that, you don't have children, you suffer that, if you have children you suffer that, isn't it? People are capable of suffering just about anything. This is the nature of the intellect. Once you're into the intellect, this is how life is. If you're below the intellect, you won't suffer so much. Animals don't suffer as much as you suffer. Physical things, if they're taken care of, they're quite okay, they don't have the kind of suffering that human beings know, isn't it? So if you're below the intellect, you don't suffer so much. Like you asked that question. If you're below, if you're above the intellectual, you're a Buddha. If you're below the intellect, maybe we can call you Budhu. If you're in the intellect, nonstop suffering. So to avoid suffering, people are inventing many ways to go below the intellect, excessive eating, alcohol, in excessive indulgence in physical pleasures. These are all the ways you're trying to avoid the torment of the intellect for some time, you'll get drunk and you feel good for a few hours, but then life will catch up with you with more intensity. It won't let you go. Now, this being, which was below the intellect somehow evolved into the intellect. The only way out for this is to evolve beyond the intellect. So the fundamentals of yoga, the technologies, how to go beyond this? So how to do it now? Subjective technologies cannot be explored in uncommitted atmospheres. You need a very committed, focused atmosphere. Otherwise it will not be in your grasp. It's not a teaching. It's a method. To implement a method you need to be in a certain way, in a certain level of commitment, in a certain level of receptivity otherwise it doesn't work because see now if you go into your chemistry laboratory, you take this chemical, this chemical. If you put it into it, something happens. But if you're not willing to put it into it, if you sit here and think and think, and think, what will this do, what will that do? You will come to all kinds of wrong conclusions. Till you put it there, you won't know. Maybe it will explode in your face, but till you put it there, you will not know what it is about, but now you are the chemical, you are the chemist and you are the experiment and process. Everything is you. Now you need a different kind of laboratory. Otherwise it doesn't work. If it was objective, we could have just written a book and given it to you. But because it's subjective, you have to be taken a step by step because it's a completely different dimension of perception and experience altogether. But is it possible for me? It is possible for every human being. Internally all of us are equally capable. We are not capable in different ways. All of us are capable of joy, isn't it? If you've ever been joyful for one moment, that means you're capable of joy, isn't it? It is just that you're unable to stay there. That's the whole thing. There is no human being on the planet who has never been joyful. Every human being has been joyful at some point, that means he's capable of joy. It is just that he's unable to stay there. So he needs a technology as to how to maintain the atmosphere within himself. It's possible.

====================

LESSON 3: Tool for Transformation - Above The Intellect

- [Sadhguru] Just work at removing from the mind, the idea, that thought is intelligence, the whole process of creation from a single atom to the cosmos is a fantastic expression of intelligence. Right now, within your own body, there is a throbbing intelligence that is the very source of creation. With the overrated intellect that you own, can you even understand, the activity of a single cell in your body, in its entirety? The first step towards moving from the trap of intellect to the lap of a larger intelligence is to recognize that every aspect of life, from a grain of sand to a mountain, a drop to an ocean, from the atomic to the cosmic, is a manifestation of a far greater intelligence than your minuscule intellect. If you take this one step, life will start speaking to you, like never before.

LESSON 3: Complementary Video - How Are We Making Ourselves Suffer?
--------------------
<v ->How are we making ourselves suffer?</v> <v ->See, there are two kinds of suffering,</v> or people think there are two kinds of suffering, but actually there's only one. Generally, we talk about physical suffering and mental suffering. See, physically, we can only have pain. Pain is a defense mechanism. Pain is the basis of our survival. If there was no pain in our body, we would have cut ourselves into ribbons. All the fashions that are there, you think they would just cut a mustache or a beard. They would cut their nose in many shapes. They would pull out the intestines and roll it all over the place in the name of fashion. Yes. Maybe they would make their stomach bag into their handbag. Who knows? Anything they would have done if there was no pain. So pain is a safety. Without pain, most human beings don't have the sense even to survive. So pain is necessary and pain is very essential. Unfortunately, it is so. But suffering, that is something that you manufacture in your mind, in reaction to either what is happening in your body or what is happening around you. So what kind of suffering you go through is not relevant to what is happening either in the body or in the world around you. It is relevant to how you react to situations or physiology or social situations around you. So your reaction is entirely yours. You can react the same way, or you can react some other way. In a given situation, you will see for the same situations one set of people will be suffering. Another set of people will be enjoying the same thing, simply because of the way they react to it. So suffering is entirely a psychological process. There is no other suffering. People say there is solely suffering. No, there's no such thing. You suffer because of the kind of thoughts and emotions that you generate. And what kind of thought and what kind of emotion you generate is 100% yours if you are hands-on with yourself.

====================

LESSON 4: Live a Life Without Fear
--------------------
<v ->If you try to control the</v> variety of situations that may pop up in your face tomorrow morning, all that will happen is you will become a very limited life. You would step out into the world and do whatever that needs to be done. Only if you have an assurance, no matter what you walk into, you will not lose yourself. You will walk full stride. Otherwise you'll only be a half a step. Most human beings are half steps because the fear of suffering. If this happens, what will happen to me, that happens what will happen to me. If you're a well-managed within yourself, you know how to manage. Your thought, you know how to manage your emotion. You know how to manage your body, your chemistry, your energy. If you know how to manage all this, what does it matter? If you walk into hell, I'm asking, if you are well managed. If you are a heaven within you, what does it matter? Where you go, hell also will be an interesting place to go. But if you are ill managed, then you want to be in a nice place all the time. You will not step out into anything. I'm not saying this is wrong. This is against nature because in nature, every life is aspiring to be as much as it can be. Isn't it? Yes or No? Every life is naturally aspiring. This is not a philosophy. This is not an ideology. That you must do this or that it is natural and intrinsic for every life that it will do. As much as it can, from an earthworm, from a worm to an insect, to a bird, to an animal, to a tree, every one of them are trying to be full-fledged life. If you go against this, simply because of the fear of suffering, then all possibilities of exploring the nature of being human. The tremendous immensity of being human is just lost upon humanity. Today, you will see this everywhere. When people say, I am only human, they are talking about the limitations of being human. They're not talking about the possibilities of being human. Isn't it? When, if we are the most intelligent species on the planet, if we are the most capable species on the planet, should we be talking about all possibilities? Or should we be talking about our limitations? Whenever anybody writes or says, oh, we are human. They're always referring to their limitations. Never to the possibilities of being human. This is because , the most fundamental things have not been taught in our education systems. How to handle your thought and your emotion. Your psychological drama has gone out of control. It's a badly directed drama. Believe me. If it is a well-directed drama, you would take it to the conclusion that you want. Isn't it? Because it's a badly directed drama, just about anybody can take charge of it. Who is the director of your psychological drama? Just about anybody isn't it? Anybody can make it into a tragedy. The reason why, people have not even learned to manage their thought and emotion by the time you're 10, you should have learnt it. At 60 people still don't know how to manage their thought and emotion. They're standing up like ghosts in their life. They don't need anybody's help. They can go on endlessly, creating, suffering for themselves. You have normal hands and you do not know how to use it. What would you call yourself? No, you, you tell yourself, don't tell me. It's okay. Whatever you think. If you have a normal process of mental faculty and you do not know how to use it, it means the same thing. Yes or no? Does it mean the same thing or No? You don't have a normal hand then you can't use it. That's different. We will look at you compassionately, but you have a normal hand and you don't know how to use it, whatever word you use to call yourself, don't tell me. But the same thing goes, if you don't know how to use your thought and emotion, towards your wellbeing, isn't it? Because ill managed. Because the fundamentals of life are not grasped. What is the nature of my existence? If you don't know this, how do you manage it? Only if you grasp the nature of something, then you learn to manage it. Isn't it? You don't even see what it is, how to manage it? There is no way to manage it. So the first and foremost thing, that's why it's called realization. You must understand this in this country, in this culture, we never refer to any kind of spiritual realization as an attainment. We only said it is a realization. Realization means you simply saw what is already there. You did not invent anything. You did not climb the top of a mountain. You are beginning to see everything just the way it is, but that has become such a rarity. That it is being hugely valued. Someone was asking me three days ago, I was in Kerala. Sadhguru you seem to know everything, I said, see, there is only one thing I know. I know this one thing, from its origin to its ultimate. <v ->Why? I said, I know only one thing.</v> And what are you clapping your hands for? I know only this one thing.

====================

LESSON 5: Suffering or Joy – You Choose
--------------------
<v ->Is it a fact,</v> that in evolutionary process of life upon this planet, you okay with evolution? Okay, because I come from Tennessee, so I'm asking you. In the evolutionary process, is it true that we as human beings, we are on top of the pile? Of all the creatures, we are supposed to be the peak. Maybe there's something more to be done but right now we are on the top. But is it also true, that whenever human beings utter the word human, they're always talking in terms of, oh, I'm only human. The word human is always related to the limitations of being human. Very few people ever have used this word, I'm human referring to the immensity of being human, always the limitations of being human. So, somewhere we missed the fundamental point. The point is this, is it true that every other creature on this planet, a worm, an insect, a bird, an animal with a millionth of our brain, they're conducting their life process quite well. When I say life process, we are born, they're born, just like that. We grew up, they grew up. We make a living, they make a living. We may reproduce. They reproduce. We do all this with enormous fuss. They simply do it. Yes or no? Every simple thing, we're doing it with enormous fuss. They're simply doing it. Different, various processes of life and death, they're doing it without fuss. We're doing everything with great fuss. Is this a sign of highest level of intelligence I'm asking? We are supposed to be the most intelligent. And there is no question that we have the most evolved neurological process on the planet. Yes? We have the most evolved neurological system that we must be able to sense and feel, and experience and perceive, understand, and express things in the highest possible way. But no other creature on the planet is struggling like the human creature right now. This is simply because you have been given our super super computer. Do you agree with me that this is the most sophisticated gadget on the planet? Not the iPhone, the I. But now the question is, have you read the user's manual? That's all. People have not read the user's manual for the most complex machine on the planet. And, somehow blundering through, somehow trying to use it. Everything is a problem. Tell me one thing that human beings are not suffering. If they're poor, they suffer their poverty. You'll make them rich, they suffer the taxes. If they're not educated, they suffer that. Put them to school, lot of suffering. Not married, they suffer that. Get them married, I didn't say anything. I didn't say a thing, okay? No children, some people suffer that. Children, daily suffering. So you seem to be suffering every aspect of life. So if you're offered death, will you go joyfully? No, you will suffer that. So tell me one thing that we are not suffering. Now, people weave philosophies. Life is suffering. No no, life is not suffering. Nor is it a joy. It's simply there. It's a phenomenon. If you ride it, it feels fantastic. If you're crushed by it, it feels terrible. So are you riding the wave of life or are you being crushed by it? That's all the question is. So for this to happen, what is it that human beings are suffering? So I'm saying, I'm asking you how much suffering for any individual is actually coming from outside? Minuscule. Isn't it? The rest is all on self-help. If they sit, they will suffer. If they stand, they will suffer. If something happens, they suffer. If nothing happens, they suffer. So what they're suffering is their own psychological process. One's own thought and emotion has become such a huge suffering. How you think and feel, how you think and feel, should it not be determined by you? What happens within you? Should it happen? Not happen the way you want it. Can you see me, Sky? Where am I? Tell me. Use one hand and point out where I am. Ah, you got it wrong. You know, I'm a mystic, huh. Now, these lights are falling- this light is falling upon me, reflecting, going through your lenses, inverted image in the retina, you know the whole story, right? Where do you see me right now? Within yourself. Where do you hear me right now? Within yourself. Where have you seen the whole world? Within yourself. Everything that ever happened to you, pain and pleasure happened within you. Joy and misery happened within you. Agony and ecstasy happened within you, even light and darkness is actually happening within you. What happens in the world may not happen the way you want it, but at least what happens within you must happen your way. Isn't it? So what happens within you is not happening your way. Fundamentally, we have not figured what is the nature of our life. Without understanding, without understanding even the fundamental of our existence, we are trying to live. Is it true, both pain and pleasure originates from within you? There may be a stimulus from outside, but all human experience comes from within you. Isn't it? What's coming from within you, must happen your way. Otherwise you're just an out of control situation. So my entire work and the fundamental nature of what's offered is called Inner Engineering. That is, we have engineered the world in so many ways. This has brought us enormous levels of comfort and convenience. Do you agree with me that we are the most comfortable generation enjoying most incredible conveniences that no generation could ever dream of? Yes or no? What even royalty did not have a hundred years ago, today, ordinary citizens are enjoying it, isn't it? So, all this is going waste on humanity, simply because their experience of life is not enhanced. Because your wellbeing will never come from outside. From outside, you can create comfort. You can create convenience, but you cannot create well-being Well-being can only happen from within you because human experience is created from within. Doesn't matter what is the nature of your experience. Whatever it is, unpleasant or pleasant, both are being made from within you. But, if you are in charge of yourself, would you create pleasantness for yourself or unpleasantness for yourself? Highest level of pleasant. If there was a choice between misery and blissfulness, what would you choose for yourself? Please, you must make a choice. I'm going to bless you right now. Misery or blissfulness? Yeah, at least for yourself, it's definitely highest level of pleasantness. What do you want for your neighbor may be debatable, depending upon what they did today. But what you want for yourself is hundred percent clear. Isn't it? Why such a simple thing is not happening? Simply because this cerebral activity in the process of evolution, it is new. It is a new happening. This, this big brain. When I say new, just a few million years, but in the evolutionary scale, it is new. So we have an intelligence for which we don't have a stable enough platform. You don't need anybody to torture you. Isn't it? Hello? You're on self-help. You don't need any outside help. You can sit in one place by yourself and make a hell out of it. Because your own intelligence has turned against you. You can call it by many exotic names. You can call it misery. You can call it depression. You can call it by variety of diagnosis, but essentially, your intelligence has turned against you. Once your intelligence turns against you, nobody, no power in the universe is going to save you because wherever we take you, you will be miserable. Some people are thinking one day they will go to heaven and they will be all right. I'm asking you, do you have any proof that you are not already in heaven and messing it up? Do you have any proof? No. Maybe you're already in heaven and making a mess out of it. Because if you have an out of control mind, no matter where you're taken, you will make a mess out of it. Isn't it? Just imagine, hundred years ago, how people lived in this same place and how you're living? Is there any damn thing to complain about in comparison? Hello? Oh, but we're whining like crazy. We're whining, like nobody else on the planet. So the problem is not of the outside. Outside situations are there. Some situations will go the way we want, Some will not go. That's how it is. Even if you're just two people in the family, does everything happen just the way you want it? No, that can never happen. Outside will never happen a hundred percent the way you want it. We can manage it to some extent, but at least what happens within you must happen the way you want it. If right now, what happened within you was happening the way you wanted, would you keep yourself at the highest level of pleasantness or no? That's all that happened to him. Even though death confronted, it didn't matter because what's happening within you is happening the way you want it.

====================

LESSON 5: Tool for Transformation - Inner Reflection

- [Sadhguru] When you realize that all your material achievements are of value only in comparison with those who do not have them, this is joy that springs from another's deprivation. Can you really call this joy? Isn't it actually a kind of sickness? It is time everyone address this. If you were alone on this planet, what would you want for yourself? Ask yourself this question and see where it takes you. Try this: Sit alone for five minutes and see what your life would be like if you were absolutely alone in this world. If there were nobody or nothing to compare yourself with, what would you truly long for? What would really matter to you if there were no external appreciation or critique? If you do this every day, you will become aligned with the longings of the life that you are, rather than the accumulated karmic mess that you believe you are.

====================

Part 2: Conquer Your Thoughts

====================

LESSON 6: You Don't Need to Manage Stress
--------------------
<v ->The first time I came to United States,</v> wherever I went, I heard this term 'stress management.' I could not understand. Because in my understanding, we manage things which are precious to us, our families, our businesses, our money, our property. Whatever is precious to us, we will manage that. Why would somebody want to manage stress? I couldn't get it for some time. Then I realized people have made a conclusion that stress is an extra limb that they have in their body. Stress is an appendage that they cannot get rid of. Stress is not a part of you. You get stressful because you do not know how to handle your mind. No attention has been paid as to how to handle this mind, how to handle this emotion, how to handle this body, how to handle these energies. Nothing has been done about it. You're managing such a sophisticated system accidentally. So your being stressful is a natural outcome of such unconscious living. There is no other way to be. Don't think your job is stressful. Now, you're a student. Being a student is stressful. If you don't find employment when you come out of the college, that is stressful. If you get a job, even more stressful. If you don't get married, that is very stressful. If you get married, I don't want to say anything. You don't have children, that is stressful. If you have children, you pull your hair out with stress. So it is not your job or your life situations which are stressful. Stress is happening to you because of your inability to manage your own system. Not knowing how to manage the system is stressfulness. If this happened the way you want it, you wouldn't be stressful. If you do a simple inner engineering process, just 21 minutes a day. Today, you take your pulse rate before and after food. Do it for six weeks. Check your pulse rate and see it will be considerably down, which essentially shows, with the same level of activity, this is a simple indicator. There are many other parameters that you could check, but this is an extremely simple indicator for which you don't have to go to any laboratory. You can check it yourself. The lowering of the pulse with the same level of activity indicates that your system is going at an easier pace. That means it's working much more efficiently. If you drive your car at 2,000 RPM, the engine may last a hundred thousand kilometers, or miles. If you drive the same engine at 5,000 RPM, it may last only 50,000 miles or less, simply because it's unnecessarily revved up. So if this can do everything that it has to do at an easy pace, that means it is happening efficiently. Any machine which has least amount of friction within itself happens efficiently, naturally produces more with least amount of stress. It is definitely time you do some inner engineering. So put your right hand gets up and does funny things and smashes you, pokes your eyes. Do you have an ailment or not? Yes. Isn't it? For sure, you have. That's exactly what your mind is doing. Isn't it? It gets up, pops around, hurts you, pokes you, makes you cry, makes you suffer. Do you have an ailment or not? If your hand started poking at you, hitting you, beating you up, definitely you are sick, isn't it? Yes. So I'm asking. Hm? By your own definition, I'm going. So because this sickness is on, it will manifest in so many ways in the physical body. There is no question anymore. Every thought, every reverberation on the level of the mind, depending upon the type of reverberation you'll create, the whole chemistry is going through change. It's all been measured. Right now, you sit here and think about tigers. You have one kind of chemistry, chemical changes happen. You think about flowers, another kind of chemical change happens. All this has been measured. So for every thought, if the whole chemistry is going through a thing, if your mind is in this state, you know what kind of soup you're making? You're a lousy soup. Not just lousy, poisonous. If you soak in this poisonous soup on a daily basis, how to know wellbeing? It'll not happen like that. We don't have so much control today in the world as to what we eat, what we drink, what we breathe. All of it is somewhat poisoned. Modern societies have started treating disease, ailment, as a natural process, which is a serious mistake. Ancient societies always saw disease as something wrong. That's not how a man should be. A human being should not be in any state of illness. Illness means something fundamentally wrong. But modern societies have started treating this as normal because there's an industry which thrives on you. Really major industry. The second largest industry on the planet is pharmaceuticals. So if the second largest industry on the planet is pharmaceuticals, there's too much lousy soup. Isn't it? Every day, you have to add something to this to make it. No. If you're willing, we can make this into a very wonderful soup. The chemistry is in a fantastic state. To be blissful is natural. If you do this, believe me, 70% of the ailments will vanish from the planet. Another 30%, there are many external influences which are not always in control. You cannot control that, only to some extent. So if you're constantly creating a nasty chemistry within you, how is life within you supposed to understand you're seeking well-being? How? Is it unfair? Life is into things. He likes ailments and gives it to you. Yes. If you're poisoning your system from within, for which there is substantial proof, for every thought and emotion, the chemical composition of your body is changing. If you're creating poison from within you and you want to live well, how is it? Life doesn't work like that. Unless you do right things, right things will not happen to you.

====================

LESSON 6: Complementary Video - How Do We Manage Our System, so Stress Is Less?
--------------------
<v ->How do we manage our system?</v> So stress is less. <v ->Why do you say stress should be less?</v> I'm asking why the hell is there stress? There is no stress in the air. The stress is only in your head. Simply because your thoughts and emotions, are getting mixed up, with the realities around you, and above all, the significance, self significance syndrome that you have as to who you are. In this vast existence you're not even a speck of dust, but, you're here for a speck of time. In that little bit of a pop up life that you are, before you pop out, how many myriad of problems are you creating? There is no such thing as stress in the world. It is only in your mind, your inability to manage your own thought, emotions, energies, and chemistry. So now there are simple processes, with which you can create a chemistry of blissfulness. See, right now, both the pharmaceuticals, and the other kinds of people who are, either bringing plant based stuff, or they're doing it in their kitchen. Whichever way, there are all kinds of chemicals floating around in the world. Some by prescription, some in the backstreet. All right. All these things are supposed to be stress busters. All these things are supposed to be in some way, create joy in you, peace in you, put you to sleep, wake you up. Whatever kind of things. But is it true, that this body that you carry, is the most sophisticated and complex chemical factory on the planet? It is. So when you have such a complex chemical factory, you need to be a good CEO. If you are a lousy one, you will produce things which you don't need. When you produce chemicals that you don't need, you become stressful. If you produce the right kind of chemistry, you would be blissful. So little more attention is needed, rather than trying to reduce stress. Why you like stress? Now, I must tell you this. When I first went to United States, many years ago, everywhere everybody was talking about stress management. I could not understand this, because in my understanding, we manage things which are precious to us, our family, our business, our money, our work. Why would somebody want to manage stress? Then it took me some time to realize, all these people have concluded. Stress is a part of their life. Stresses are not a part of your life. It is just that, you have not figured out, how to handle your own thought and emotion in a very basic level. See, it is like this. Suppose you're a forefinger. You must show me. This finger is not, there is no obscenity to this finger. You know, this is a good finger. So suppose this finger wants to pluck out your eyeball. It gets such a thought. It starts to pluck out your eyeball. Now what we should do, we must hold it down. If it doesn't listen to instructions, what do you do? Hold it down. If it doesn't work tie it down, if it doesn't work, maybe we'll have to amputate it, because otherwise it will cause enormous damage. Right now, this is all that is, your faculties are poking you. Instead of using your thought and emotion, to live well in the world, you're using your thought and emotion, to torture yourself. Stress is the beginning, misery the next thing, depression is the next thing, madness is the next thing. Or few days ago, I was talking to people, that they have a world suicide prevention day, because it's become a massive problem. A massive problem, such a massive problem. It is killing more than homicides and wars put together. That many people are committing suicide, every 20 seconds, one person is killing himself or herself. What is the matter with us? So this mile, this worst expression, or manifestation of stress is suicide. All right? So, but anyway, even if you feel little stress, you're already on the path of suicide. It is just that you like to do it in installments, slowly you're dying. This is what has happened to most adults. When they were children, how alive they were. Today how they have become. Is just because they're committing suicide in installments. They're halfway through, by the time the 35, 40 they're halfway successful. This halfway successful people, feel tortured by anything. If you give them work, they feel torture. They say it's very stressful. If you fire them, will they happily walk on the beach? No, that will be very stressful. If they're not married, they'll be stressful. You get them married, whoa you won't believe. They don't have children, they're stressed about that. If they have children, too much stress, anything, and everything is stress. Not because life is stress simply because, without learning how to use your faculties, if you enter the world, you will suffer inevitable. You call it whatever exotic names you want

====================

LESSON 7: Step Out of the Psychological Game
--------------------
<v ->It is a fact that we have</v> the most evolved neurological system compared to a worm, insect, bird, animal, anybody, anybody. But we also have a psychological process. Whatever your psychological process you are taught, an emotion, is only happening because of a certain amount of information that you gathered, isn't it? Oh, you think she is a wonderful person. So a certain kind of thought. Oh, you think she's not nice. Another kind of thought. Oh, he would think this is somebody else. With all this information, whatever you have gathered, whether it's right or wrong, it doesn't matter. The type of information you gathered determines the type of thought and type of emotion that you have, isn't it? This is one thing. If you teach human beings to understand your psychological process is entirely your drama. It's got nothing to do with reality. Is it so? Your psychological drama has nothing to do with the reality here. Hundred people can be sitting here and everybody in their own psychological space, and they're in a hundred different worlds. They're not in this world. So I am an empty head, nothing. So I'm in this world. So because I'm only in this world, I'm paying attention to everything. I have nothing going in my head. If I sit in one place, you know once in a way, when I take a break for five days, if I close myself up, I don't have a single thought in my mind. I don't read, I don't watch television, I don't write, I don't do anything. I don't even look out of the window. Not a single thought on my mind, because psychological process is just a small drama, which has gotten magnified simply because you've gotten so identified with it. It's like this. People always come up to me and say, "Sadhguru, I want to meditate, but the thoughts are coming." I ask them, "See, I will teach another kind of meditation, where your kidney function will stop, your liver function will stop, your heart function will stop. Are you interested?" "No, no, no." Then what? You only you want your brain function to stop? Why? See? When you sit down to meditate, your kidney is functioning, liver is functioning, heart is functioning, you have no issue. Only if your brain functions, you have a problem. Yes? Why is that? Because you are not so identified with your kidney function, but you're super identified with your thought process and emotion. Because you're so identified with it, you think it's you. Because of that, now it has obliterated your experience of life. Tell me in 24 hours' time, how many moments are there beyond thought you looked at something? For most people, there isn't a single moment. Some people have few moments. I have just a few moments of thought. The rest of the time, I'm just like the sky. Your life, isn't it? Because I'm alive, I have a body, I have a thought, I have an emotion, I have a home, I have this, this, this, and so many things. All accessories. But you're experiencing the accessories. But is there experience of life on a daily basis? You are misunderstanding your psychological drama as life, isn't it? Your psychological drama is your drama. Maybe badly directed. But see, when it's badly directed, people suffer it. When it's well-directed, they enjoy it, isn't it? So your psychological drama is yours. You can play it. Nothing wrong with it. It's like we start playing a game. We are on a tennis court. But somewhere you hit the ball, you enjoy it. You hit the ball, you enjoy it. After some time, you keep the racquet down and go. Isn't it? Right now with this game, you're not able to stop. Just imagine, suppose you started playing tennis and you can't stop. 24 hours. How you would suffer tennis? That's all that's happening right now. Your psychological process has become unstoppable. It's simply on and on and on. So the simplest solution for this is don't try to stop it because you're not trying to stop kidneys and livers and heart and whatever else that's happening. You're all fine with that. Only with brain function you have a problem because of the identification you have. You have misunderstood your thought to be you. Isn't it? Hm? Whatever your thought is, you think it's you. But your thought is coming from a certain information that you gathered from outside, isn't it? If I wipe out all the memory in you, will you have a thought? No. It is only coming from the type of information you gathered. What type of information you gathered is not all by choice. If you walk in the street, everything that you see, hear, smell, taste, and touch gets recorded in your mind, you can't help it. What goes into you as information is not all in your hands, isn't it so? 90% is not in your hands. Simply it's happening all the time, because everything that you sense through five sense organs is just getting into you and recorded. There is no good, bad, ugly in this. It's just information. Now, by your recognition, you say, oh, this is nice and it becomes good. You say this is nasty and it becomes bad. You say this is horrible and then it becomes ugly. This is your doing. But information is simply pouring in and recorded. What you gather, whatever you gather, it can be yours. It cannot be you, isn't it? I can say this is my chair. But if I say this is me, you will think I've gone crazy, isn't it? Right now that's all that's happened. What you gather, you start thinking it is you. Let me go a little more basic. The body. This body, were you born like this? No. You came like this, and now you became this much. How did this happen? Just the food that you've eaten, isn't it? Or it's just the earth that we're walking upon, which became food and now it's like this. Countless number of people like you and me have walked on this planet. They were also smart people, better than us. They're all top soil. So will this become. Yes or no? Unless your friends embody a real deep feeling that you may raise from the dead. Otherwise, this will also become top soil. Well, we don't want to go today, but inevitably we go, isn't it? So this is just the soil which turned into food. We consume this food and made it into this body. Or is it true that this body is an accumulation or a period of time? What you accumulate can be yours. Can it ever be you? Hm? Whatever you accumulate, at the most you can claim it is mine. I will not dispute that right now. A day will come. But you cannot say it's me, isn't it? Whatever you accumulate can never ever be you. If this becomes a living experience for you, that what you have accumulated in the form of food and in the form of information, you clearly know this is not me. Then you will become like me. Simply looking at life as it is without being influenced by anything. Without being identified with anything. Simply life. Is that true? Fundamentally you're just a life. Then you gather a certain body, so we call you a man. Then you gather some kind of stuff and so we call you this, that and everything. But essentially are you just life? And is that the most important thing right now that you're alive right now is the most important thing in your life. Is that so? But unfortunately, that's not in focus. Today what I'm thinking has become more important than me being alive, isn't it? Hello? My little emotion has become more important than that I am alive right now. See, today, morning sun came up on time. Now, you are thinking it's the sun, okay, what about it? You know, sometime I go... We were flying a helicopter in Tennessee. It was a nice warm day. So we pulled off the doors and were flying an open helicopter because weather it's good. We went up there and suddenly hit the cold front. All that happened in sun got really blocked out by cloud, so it became extremely cold. So cold we had no control, you know, our hands are not steady on the control, so we decided to come down. As we're coming down, we're just debating. Simple sun doesn't come up tomorrow. What will happen? Maybe in three months, this will happen, in six months, that will happen. We're just guessing. Then I just came and did a little bit of research. If sun does not come up tomorrow, in 18 hours, everything that you know as life on this planet will be gone, except a few microbial life deep down in the earth, everything else will be gone in 18 hours' time. Just now I gave you a fantastic information. Sun came up on time today morning. I want to hear appropriate noises at least. It's fantastic, it came up on time. And the planet is spinning on time. You don't think it's good. No accidents in the Solar System. One planet did not clash into another. All is sticking to their lanes. In the entire universe, not a single accident. Everything is going fantastic in the universe and in the larger cosmos. But one nasty little thought is crawling in your head and it's a bad day. Everything in the cosmos is going great. One nasty little thought. Ah! It's a bad day, isn't it? The problem is we have lost perspective as to who we are. In this cosmos, this Solar System is a speck. Hm? Yes or no? It's like a speck. Tomorrow morning, the entire Solar System evaporates, nobody will notice it. In that speck, planet Earth is a microspeck. In that microspeck, Los Angeles is a supermicrospec. In that, you're a big man. That's a serious problem. This is your psychological drama, exaggerating things to a point where you think if you have one bad thought, the whole world is ruined, because we have gotten identified with the thoughts that we generate, with the emotions that we create, not understanding it's our prerogative to create the kind of thought we want, the kind of emotion we want. If you created the kind of thought you want and the kind of emotion you want, would you not do the best sort of thoughts and the best kind of emotion that a human being is capable of? Yes or no? Then you would function at the peak of humanity. Right now, our own intelligence has turned against us. We don't need any external help. We're just doing fine by ourselves. Yes or no? Simply sitting, standing, rich, poor, every kind is suffering. You ask them, childhood, big problem, diaper problem. Toddler, big problem. A lot of mischief. Adolescence, oh my God, too many problems. Middle age crisis. Old age, terrible. Tell me which time of your life is fantastic. But the problem is not anywhere else. The problem is just that we have lost control over our psychological drama. Because the existential drama of life is not in our experience. Our psychological drama is like a cloud blocking up the sun. We don't experience life, we only experience thoughts, emotions, ideas, prejudices, and all the rubbish that we can generate. Instead of living in the creator's creation, we are living in our own petty creation. That's the big thing. I didn't create anything, so I am here in this world.

LESSON 7: Tool for Transformation - Chemistry of Peace

- Peace is not the ultimate goal of life. It is the most fundamental requirement. If you hold it as the ultimate goal in your life, you will only rest in peace. If you want to enjoy your dinner tonight, or a walk in the park, or the people around you, you have to be at least peaceful. Do not make a natural aspect of your life into something esoteric. Creating a chemistry of peacefulness, is your responsibility. There are methods to create a chemistry of peace within yourself. If you are willing to invest a few minutes a day towards your inner well-being, being peaceful will be natural. What you accumulate can be yours, but never you. If human beings do not encumber that intellect with any identifications of body, family, community, qualifications, cast, creed, race, nation, even the very species that we are and the million other identities that we take on in life, life will naturally proceed towards its ultimate nature. Once you're identified with something that you are not, mind is like an express train that you cannot stop. Now, you want to apply brakes, but that does not work. First you must take your foot off the throttle, remind yourself for at least five minutes every day, that everything that you're carrying your handbag, your money, your identity card, the relationships, the heaviness in your heart, your very body, are things you have accumulated over a period of time. As this process of this identification grows with the new counterbalanced by a very deep sense of involvement in everything that you do, you will move from madness to meditativeness.

====================

LESSON 8: Relationships & Emotions
--------------------
<v ->See, these days, fortunately, it's gone,</v> when we were growing up, especially Diwali is coming, when Diwali comes, in small towns, one of the fun that people have is they will make a can full of, what to say, the firecrackers, and tie it to a donkey's tail. When it goes dum dum dum, poor donkey, runs all over the place faster than a horse. Do you think that's the way to motivate life? Well, when you feel like your tail is burning you may run. People always use this thing, if a dog is chasing you you will run really fastest. But Mr. Bolt, do you know Mr. Bolt? He did not run because his tail is on fire, he runs because he prepared his legs and lungs in such a way whichever way he runs he's faster than everybody. Isn't that the way to run? You want to run because a dog is chasing you, you want to run because your tail is on fire, is it the way you want to run? No, that's not a pleasant way to run. See, one thing, it is important that you run fast, and another thing is that your experience of running is fantastic. Isn't that important? How you experience it, what comes out of it tomorrow. Suppose we ran because our tail is on fire, now we understand the only way to make people run is to set their tails on fire, how much damage will we cost to everybody? And I've seen these donkeys running faster than a race horse because they're terrified. That's not the way to run. Please don't do that to yourself, not anymore. See, somebody can betray you, or you can think they will betray you only because you have unrealistic expectations of them. If they do what they want to do why do you think they have betrayed you? They're doing what they want to do, you must respect it. If you say, "They're beloved to me, I love them." If you love a person, should you let them do what they want to do or should they do what you want them to do? For most people love means you must do what I want. No, no, love means they can do what they want and we will love them, isn't it? You have this thing that if I love you you must listen to me. No, no, if I love you I want you to do what brings joy to you, isn't it? I'm not saying that it is never true that somebody maybe going off track and you will try to do something for them, I'm not saying it's never true, but you don't take this position that somebody is wrong and you're going to fix them. They're doing what they want to do, isn't it? What they want to do right now may not be beneficial for them, possible, but you must look at it sincerely, are you complaining because it's not beneficial for them or you're complaining because it's not beneficial for you? Genuinely look at it. It's not beneficial for you but it's good for them, please let them do it. But they are damaging themselves, yes, then you have a right to intervene and try to do your best. But not always, not always can you enter somebody's life and do something for them. If I have to enter your life and do something for you I have to earn it, isn't it? I have to earn a relationship where I can intervene in your life. If you don't earn that, you cannot intervene. So if you're unable to intervene you must just understand you have not earned that. There is a psychological integrity, there is emotional integrity, but there is a biological integrity also. Integrity does not mean morality. Integrity means you create a situation where it works best for you. So when we say integrity, suppose I say there is a certain integrity to my body, this means it's strong and resistant to a whole lot of things, isn't it? It doesn't mean I'm morally stuck in something. So I'm talking about, I want you to understand the word integrity in that context, we're talking about integrity in terms of strength of this life. So if that is the thing, is it true? Do you remember how your great, great, great, great, great grandmother 10 generations ago look like? Do you remember, no. But her nose is sitting on your face. Body remembers your forefathers a million years ago. So what you're calling as my body is a heap of memory, isn't it so? Mm? Memory or no? See, now from Nepal you came to Shillong, you eat a lot of this mega life food, your features won't change because your body remembers what is your genetics no matter what. Or you start eating, let's say cow's food or dog's food, your body will not get confused and become a dog or a cow because there's evolutionary memory in this. Do what you want, it never gets confused, isn't it? You start thinking I'm a dog and start barking like one, still the body won't change. Yes or no? Mentally you can but body has such a deep rooted memory. So this entire body, what you have, is essentially a certain integrity of memory. If that loses that memory integrity, then you will see it will become vulnerable to so many things. Now the nature of the body is such that anything that you touch with a certain level of involvement will naturally absorb that memory, not mentally, physically it'll absorb that memory. Traditionally, in this culture, we call this Runanubandha. Have you heard of such a word? What this means is, physical memory that you gather, why people... you know, you will see this with people, let's say in there home they will go and sit in one place. This, usually the older people you will see, they want to go and sit in the same place. They won't sit in another place, have you noticed this? Even your dog, he comes if he wants to sit here, he'll smell this, he'll smell that, he'll smell that, he'll smell that, and after much searching he will settle down in that particular place. Next time you chase him somewhere, he comes, he goes and sits in the same place, because there is memory. Today there is forensic equipment where you're sitting here right now, you went away, after 2, 3, 8 hours if they come, not with a dog, a dog can easily do it, but with forensic equipment we come here and just check this chair, and we know it was you who was sitting here, not somebody else. So there is memory wherever you sit, stand, whatever you touch, there is memory and transaction happening all the time. Well, you come from Nepal, in India also it's very much there, in south is very strongly there, north, maybe it's become weakened. People never give salt to another person. Do you do this here also? If somebody gives you a salt you should please keep it there because there are certain materials which transmit memory much better than others. Salt, sesame seeds, lemons, like this if you give traditional people, they'll say, "Keep it there I will take it." Because they don't want to develop runanubandha with you. Now in India, if you see older generation of people, if you try to shake their hands they'll do like this because they don't want to get runanubandha with you. Because the idea is to keep the integrity of your body's memory in such a way that it doesn't become vulnerable to other things, that you become a very integrated life. If you want to nurture yourself to be a certain possibility, then you have to maintain the memory integrity. This is what runanubandha means, you keep your physical memory to the minimum. A sexual interaction is something where a huge amount of memory is taken from one to the other. So always, not in this society, everywhere else, forever people saw the advantage of keeping that memory to the minimal. If you make that memory very complex, you will see to be at ease will become very difficult after some time. There will be pleasure but there'll be no joy in your life. You can observe people, don't go by what I'm saying. You can observe people, they will have pleasure, they will giggle all the time, but you look at them, there is no joy in them, there's no ease, because the ease will go away with excess of memory. This is not only with sexuality, there are many other things that you do like this. Right now you see this very much in the Western societies, wherever I go, especially in America, people will come, "Sadhguru, where is my hug?" I go, "It must be with you." "Why is it with me?" It is not like at a certain moment when you feel close to somebody you hug them, it's like all the time you have to touch people because today's psychiatrist are analyzing these things and saying that is because they have not been sufficiently touched by their mothers and parents at an early age, when they grow up they're desperately longing to touch somebody all the time. All these things have a serious impact on one's life. How much physical contact when the child is born, this will determine how much physical contact they will long for later on. And the memory of what an infant picks up from the mother at that time, because 'till a child becomes 4 1/2 years of age, in many ways energy-wise, it's not a separate life, it's still attached to the mother's body. Actually, by nature if people go 'till then they must be drinking the mother's milk and connected up to 4 1/2 years, that's how naturally it was. So the energy doesn't mature at that time, more and more memory that you come get from the mother is better and better to strengthen this, but once the child begins to move out and becomes an individual, life is organizing itself. People come to me and say, "Sadhguru, can you bless my daughter, can you bless my son?" The first thing I ask is, "How old?" If they say 15, 16, 18, all right. If they're over 21, I say no. Because me blessing you, blessing will not go to your child. You may still think emotionally that's my child, but as far as life is concerned it's become fully separate. Generally, the course of life is considered to be approximately 84 years or 1,008 cycles of the moon. The cycles of the moon and our body is very directly connected. Only because our mothers' bodies were in sync with the cycles of the moon, we are born, otherwise we wouldn't be born, isn't it? So a full life is considered 1,008 cycles of the moon, which we will approximately consider as 83 to 84 years. So if one crosses 84 it's considered a full life. In this, the first quarter is the only time when it is connected to parentage. After that the child must move, because energy-wise you cannot connect those two lives anymore. So that is when the longing, if you have not created enough integrity within yourself, the longing for another body multiplies, even though the hormonal phase maybe higher between 15 to 20, the longing to bind and bond with somebody increases after 21 years of age, because unknowingly you're like a satellite who fell off the main mother, you come out the motherboard, now you want to attach to something unless you find some integrity. This is why between 12 and 18 one must do a lot of Sadhana to strengthen the body so that you don't desperately bind yourself to something or somebody. You must consciously, if you wish to take a partner it must be a conscious process. If it's a compulsive process, then you will pay the price for it. This is not a question of morality. It is not that this is sin, that is sin, the question is, what is your priority in your life? If your priority is to make this life rise to a higher possibility then you must be conscious. If you want to somehow live and go, it's okay. The choice for you is this, if you are given a choice, right now for all of you, if you are given a choice that you can either live joyfully, blissfully, or miserably, or in anger, or in stress, or in resentment, what is your natural choice? You must choose, I'm going to bless you right now. Joyfully, isn't it? Because every human being is looking for highest level of pleasantness for himself or herself. You can call it joy, you can call it bliss, these are just words, essentially, we want highest level of pleasantness for ourselves. If your body becomes pleasant we call this health, if it becomes very pleasant we call this pleasure. If your mind becomes pleasant we call this peace, if it becomes very pleasant we call this joy. If your emotions become pleasant we call this love, if it becomes very pleasant we call it compassion. If your very life energies become pleasant we call this bliss, if it becomes very pleasant we call it ecstasy. If your surroundings become pleasant we call this success. Only to make your surroundings pleasant, you need the cooperation of all these people because in creating an external situation there are many forces involved, not all of them you even know, you understand. You want to create a wonderful situation for yourself, you don't even know how many forces are working in that area. If you harness a few forces, if they cooperate, things will happen, if they don't cooperate it won't happen. But for the pleasantness of the body, pleasantness of the mind, pleasantness of your emotion and energy, it's 100% you. Surroundings, creating situations in the surroundings, you need cooperation from the people otherwise it won't happen. So only for success you need cooperation, to keep yourself pleasant is 100% yours. So right now, you know well that you want to be peaceful, but somebody else is doing something. What are they doing? They know what they know best. They're abusing you. Why are they doing it? Because that's all they know. Yes or no? That is how they know their life. That's why they're doing it. If you become resentful and you think something will happen to them, see, these are things, anger, resentment, hatred, these are all poisons that you drink and you expect somebody else to die. If you drink poison you die very fair, isn't it so? I drink poison and you die, is it fair? So people who are in anger, resentment, hatred, this is their thing, they're drinking poison. When I say poison, I'm not saying in a moral sense, there is substantial medical evidence right now that we can show you with a blood test that five minutes before you take your blood test right now, five minutes you will remain in extreme anger and take your blood test, you will see you're chemically poisoned actually. So you're literally poisoning yourself thinking it's going to hurt them. No, it's only going to hurt you. So it doesn't make sense to me, that's all. It's not a morality whether you should get angry or not get angry, it's up to you if you want to make a mess out of yourself.

LESSON 8: Tool for Transformation - Namaskar Process

- The word yoga means union, union of all polarities, of masculine and feminine, yin and yang, individual and universal, Shiva Shakti, right brain and left brain, or whatever else you may want to call them. To achieve this blessed union, the simplest form is the yoga of Namaskar. Putting the two hands together in alignment with each other at the level of your heart will bring you to a certain harmony between polarities within. That in turn brings a sense of being united with whoever or whatever the Namaskar is aimed at. In placing your hands together, the dualities of your likes and dislikes, your cravings and emotions are leveled out. And there is a certain oneness to the experience of who you are. For a few minutes every day put your hands together in Namaskar. Look upon someone or something that means much to you. Maybe the sun, the moon, the clouds, the empty sky, the trees, the rock, your husband, your wife, your child, your mother, father, or a picture that matters to you. Look at that someone or something with the highest level of emotion that you can generate in an attitude of loving attention. Hold Namaskar for three to five minutes. Your life will be on a transformational mode.

====================

LESSON 9: Do You Listen to Your Head or Your Heart
--------------------
<v ->The heart it makes only two sounds,</v> lub-dub, unless the local girls are disturbing it, and it's going crazy. Otherwise, it makes only two sounds. Rest of the noise is all coming from your head. This idea that something comes from the heart, something comes from the brain, it's metaphoric, but unfortunately, a whole lot of people are taking it literally. There was a time in many parts of the world, particularly in Arabia, the medical science in Arabia believed the blood is pumped from the liver. You might've heard Urdu sayings about kalejā. You know, have you? <v ->Yes.</v> <v ->Because they believed blood is being pumped from the liver</v> because liver is a far more complicated organ then the heart. Heart is a simple pump. So do not give it any more responsibilities other than continuously pumping the blood and giving you a life. Unless somebody here breaks it. This happened. A very celebrated scientist was at the dinner. And he was not grandly dressed or anything. He was looking very ordinary. So the lady who was, you know, sitting next to him didn't pay much attention to him. She didn't know who he is. But after sometime, just to be polite, to make some conversation, "Man, oh, what do you do?" He said, "I'm studying science." She said, "Well, I finished it in my 10th class." "So you're not going to... You know, you're not in the last year of engineering, maybe the course, but not the last year of engineering because for your entire life, if you learn engineering, when you are dying after a hundred years, okay? I'm not proposing it. After a hundred years when you're dying, you would still know if you had a constant learning process, you would still know you know very little about engineering. With that little, many things happen. That's different. So don't be in the last year of engineering. I know the program may be closing, but not the last year of engineering, okay? So an engineering. Essentially engineering means to have things the way we want. Yes? When we say this building is well-engineered, I'm not saying that, if we say this building is well-engineered or an automobile is well-engineered, what it means is it's functioning the way we want. Yes? Of all the pieces of engineering on this planet, of many pieces of engineering, a tree is a fantastic engineering. Even a mountain is fantastic engineering, because it's still there for a million years. That means it must be good engineering, isn't it? Yes? Something that stands there for a million years must be well-engineered. Of all this, the most sophisticated piece of engineering is human mechanism. Isn't it so? Now, because it's a sophisticated piece of engineering, it needs a certain level of attention. Otherwise, you don't figure it. Now that we gave you such a highly, you know, high-tech piece of engineering, I'm asking you did you read the user's manual? How can that makes such a fantastic piece of engineering without a user's manual? Maybe doesn't come with a booklet attached to your neck when you are born. But indications must be there, isn't it? How to use it? Huh? Is it true somebody who's an athlete or a gymnast or someone else like that learns to use their body than a whole lot of other people? Yes? Obviously. At least one aspect of the physical engineering of the body, they seem to have read the user's manual about the physical aspects. Is it true certain people are able to use their mind better than others? Maybe they read another part of the user's manual. So now with this heart manual and the brain manual. See, the problem is most people are prejudiced against the brain. This is a question that always comes to me. "Sadhguru, I want to meditate, but the thoughts are coming." The common question everywhere. I ask them, "See, I'll make you meditate. We will stop the liver. We'll stop the kidney. We'll stop the heart. We'll stop everything, okay?" "Huh? No, Sadhguru." So you want the liver to function when you're meditating? You want the kidneys to function, you want even the spleen to function, you want the heart to function, but you don't want your brain to function for some reason. This is simply because brain is a new equipment that you got in the evolutionary process. This level of cerebral development happened more recently compared to the other systems. If you could open any mammal, they all have all these parts, isn't it? Every part that you have here, all of them have. Even if we open a frog, almost everything that you have, he also has, isn't it? It is only the big difference is only the cerebral development, which is a more recent happening. Because it's a more recent happening, most people have not figured out how to handle it. So user's manual is very important. You don't read the user's manual just before you discard the machine. You read it in the first few days, isn't it? If you buy a phone, do you want to read the user's manual in the first three days or after three years when you're throwing it away? <v ->First three days.</v> <v ->First three days, isn't it?</v> So knowing how this functions is really important. Never did ever heart generate any thought or intention. Well, when you looked at the young girl, the heart beat more, that doesn't mean it's saying anything. It's just trying to compensate for other levels of excitement that's happening. The heart is not trying to say anything. It is only compensating. You need more blood, so it's pumping little harder. That will happen even if you run up the staircase. Yes? What happens to you little panting when you fall in love also happens physiologically when you run up a staircase. Yes or no? Fear also does that to a whole lot of people. So a heart is not trying to say anything. It is just trying to make sure every part of the body gets the nourishment of blood flow. So it's your brain speaking in different tongues. So because when you know two, three languages, sometimes it gets confused, sometimes it speaks in English, sometimes in Assamese, sometimes in something else. So you're thinking different people are speaking, the heart is speaking, the mind is speaking, no. There is taught and there is emotion. People think these two things are saying different things. They're not seeing different things. The way you think is the way you emote, isn't it so? Right now, if I think, oh, she's the most wonderful person on the planet. I just have to think. Then my emotions become sweet, adoresome. Now I think she's the most horrible creature on the planet. Now my emotions become nasty. Yes or no? I cannot think she's horrible and have sweet emotions. I cannot think she's wonderful and have nasty emotions. Isn't it so? But today I thought she's the most wonderful person and my sweetness was flowing. Suddenly she did something tomorrow that I don't like. I think she's horrible. Though is agile, it changes direction just like that. Emotion is a little sappy. It takes time to turn around. So that period you struggle as if there are two dimensions of thing happening, because thought is saying one thing and emotion is still going sweet, because it takes time to become nasty. Everybody struggles, but it catches up after some time. Today you thought she's wonderful. Sweetness was flowing. Tomorrow she did something you don't like. You thought she's horrible. Mind, the thought is clearly saying she's horrible, but the emotions are struggling because they can't turn quickly. They take time to turn. But after a week or 10 days of two months, depending on how deeply you're engaged after some time, emotion catches up with the tought and the emotion also says, yes, she's nice, she's horrible, so let's be nasty to her. So they're not speaking different languages. One is agile. Another is little slow in his corners. So it looks like they're speaking different languages. When it comes to what you want to do, you must think clearly, it's very important. Thinking clearly means the question is not about what will get me this, what will get me that. Is your life precious to you? All of you I'm asking. Your life, is it precious to you? So before you invest this life into something, you must look whether today, if I invest my life into this, after 25 years, will it still mean a lot to me? After 50 years, will it still mean a lot to me? At the end of my life, you will turn back on it and look will I be proud of this or will I be ashamed of what I'm doing right now? It doesn't matter what other people say, but you should not do anything that you will feel ashamed of. Isn't it so? Huh? It doesn't matter. People say so many things. Everybody has an opinion. It's their business. But you don't do something that you will feel ashamed of, isn't it? Then you're turning against yourself. Somebody turns against you, you can leave them and go somewhere else. If you turn against yourself, you'll have to live with it forever. So this is all you have to look at it. Something will get you money. Something will get you comfort. That's not the point. What you choose to do, will it give you a life? When I say give you a life, are you just trying to make a living, or are you trying to make a life out of this? This is important. Making a living is not an issue. A worm, an insect, a bird, an animal. All of them are making their life, making a living. Isn't it so? They're even making a life out of it, but definitely they're making a living. So making the living with such a big brain is not the issue. Earning your food is not the issue. Making a living is not the issue. Only problem is you want to live like somebody else. That's an endless problem. I want to live is not a problem. I want to live like you. This is a problem. So it is important, if you consider your life as a precious life, you must make sure you make a wonderful life out of this. Hm? Whatever opens up in that direction, that is a thing you should do. But when you're under the pressure of peers, somebody is saying, "I'm going to America," somebody says, "I'm going to the gunman job." Somebody says, "I'm doing this." So one thing that all of you should do before you make big decisions in your life is withdraw from these pressures of peers, professors, parents, everybody. Just spend three days to one week by yourself. Look at it, what is it that you really want to do? Not under pressure from other people. What does this life want to do? Do that. It doesn't matter what other people think about it.

====================

LESSON 10: The Fundamental Nature of Yoga
--------------------
<v ->Generally all of us have about the same sized skull</v> to a large extent. Most human beings have enough brain material in their head. Everybody, except somebody who may be severely deformed at birth. Almost every average human being has what it takes to do life. But why is it that one person's brain spark into a genius, another person's brain sparkles with pain, and suffering, and tension, and stress and whatever else? All the ugliest things that nobody wants happens in people's minds to use it the question of higher intelligence. Is it a question of some magical implements from somewhere? Or is it a question of bringing the necessary balance within yourself so that you become available to the magic of life? The skewed intelligence, however smart it may look on the periphery cannot make this life happen beautifully. Overall balance is needed. Balance on all levels, otherwise, our very body and our very brain will function against us to a point where the only idea or the only form of relaxation today in the world either the sleep, or drink, or drug, all you're trying to do is to be brainless for a period of time because brain has become such a nuisance. If you didn't have one, you would be at least peaceful. Yes. What took millions of years of evolution to achieve, today has become a nuisance. What is the greatest miracle within this human frame has become a misery manufacturing machine. There many aspects to it I don't want to make it too simplistic, but above all the most important thing is balance or lack of balance. So, this human mechanism, which is the most sophisticated instrument on the planet, if you do not pay enough attention to it. If it turns against you, there is nothing here in the world, which can save you because nothing is more sophisticated than this one. Because this is of the highest level of evolution and sophistication. If this turns against you, nobody can save you. I want you to know this. So if this should not turn against you to know the entirety of what this is, it will take a certain level of attention. But to bring balance to this, doesn't take too much. It is just that you're doing a few fundamental things absolutely wrong. That's all. To know the entirety of what this is, that's a whole lot of attention, time, education, assistance, guidance, so many things are involved but to bring a reasonable sense of balance into you, it doesn't take much, you are doing a few things basically wrong with life. When I say basically wrong, the one thing is what everybody do understand all human experiences are generated from within, is that so? All human experiences are generated from within. So at any time, if you feel happy, or unhappy, miserable, joyful, ecstatic, in a state of agony, it doesn't matter what happens, what is your experience, pleasantness or unpleasantness, just to know that it's happening from within. And it can only happen from within. You can either take external stimuli, or you can create your own stimuli, but essentially it happens from within. this one thing if it is not grasped, when you feel miserable, if you think it's this one, you're gone. The keyboard is here, but you're punching the wall. This is not going to work. This one basic fundamental thing is something that almost 90% of the humanity is always doing it wrong. Whenever they feel miserable, they think it must be this one ,or that one, or that one, or that one. No, all human experiences generated from within. If something is feeling unpleasant first thing is to look at this, what am I doing wrong with this? Now Am I eating wrong? Am I sleeping wrong? Am I sitting wrong? Am I breathing wrong? Is my heart beating wrong? Something... My very chemistry is wrong. Something is wrong with this, not with that. So the moment you think by kicking the wall you can fix this one, then you made a fundamental mistake. The harder you try, the further away from it to you go. So this possibility of bringing balance to the system first of all, is a fundamental nature of yoga. The most basic forms of yoga, whether it is a... I know many of you are doing probably the Yoga Namaskar, Surya Maskar, Surya Kriya. These are all basic forms of yoga. The first thing is to bring balance. Once there is balance then you can build a tower on top of this. If there is no balance, whatever you build will only lead to more trouble. The more basic you are, the better it is. So this is what a whole lot of humanity is seeking somehow to remain basic. Because if you build something, it feels terrible and there is no fundamental balance. Anything standing up without balance is a big problem. So the best thing is to lie down, stay close to the ground. If you grow tall, it will be a problem so remain at the minimum. A whole lot of humanity have reduced themselves to a minimal possible thing in that life, but don't get into trouble that's good enough. A whole lot of humanity. This is a serious waste of evolutionary work. What has happened on this planet in the last few million years to evolve life from its simplest form to what it is today, just wasting the entire process and motherland is not going to let you get away with it. You will pay the price. You should try to make life go backwards. It will make sure you pay the price. So instead of trying to do this, that, so many things, first thing is to do something to bring balance. First step is just this, that everything that I generate from within me in the form of experience, sensations, painful, pleasant, wonderful, horrible, whatever I go through is essentially generated from within me and nobody else but me. Others may help. Others help. If you're miserable, some people will feel that and help you if you are joyful some people will feel that and help. The different types of people around us, they assist you as they know their life. But essentially it is you're making, this is the fundamental aspect of yoga. The first teaching that came out was that it is your karma. That means it's your making. Your life and the experience of your life is entirely you're making. If this one thing doesn't sink into absolutely, you will not make the necessary changes. You still think, yes, I know it's my karma, but you know my husband, what he did? You can't fix this. First you understand this is my making, entirely my making the moment you see it, you have the ability to change it. "I see it but, you know what they did to me yesterday?" Now you can't change it. It doesn't matter who did what. What is happening within you, your experience of your life is entirely you're making. This is your karma. Karma means, not something that drops upon you from somewhere. Karma means your action, it's your making, it's your doing. So, if you just said this one thing, creating the necessary balance will happen automatically. Once there is balance, then you would want to try many things. Otherwise I'm talking about so many things up there in the sky, you will only be a spectator. You will not be the one who flies. You will only be spectator because when there is no balance, you don't want to go three inches above the ground. So this is one fundamental thing. We've been talking about this in many forms, but if you want to make the full scope, if you want to make use of the full scope of this body in this brain of this human possibility, of this consciousness that we refer to as human being, then first thing is this: that you understand and fix it within you. Absolutely that the quality of my life is entirely my making and nobody else, and nobody else. You fix this one thing, balance will come. Once balance comes I am impatient to take you to places where only people with balance can walk. I just cannot.

LESSON 10: Tool for Transformation - Isha Kriya

- [Sadhguru] Isha Kriya is an extremely simple process, but a powerful tool. These three ingredients, your breath, your thought, and your awareness, in the right combination if you use them, your ability to use the mind and the body is so greatly enhanced that you almost look superhuman for somebody else. But I'm telling you, this is human. This is not about being superhuman. This is about realizing being human is super.

- [Narrator] Isha Kriya instructions. Preparation. Sit in a cross-legged posture with spine comfortably erect. If needed, use a backrest, but no headrest. Doing the kriya facing east offers extra benefits. Keep your hands upon your thighs, with your palms facing upwards. With your face slightly upturned, eyes closed, keep a mild focus between your eyebrows. This meditation will happen in three stages, stage one, inhale and exhale gently, slowly. With each inhalation, mentally say to yourself, I am not the body. The inhalation should last for the whole duration of that thought. With each exhalation, mentally say to yourself, I am not even the mind. The exhalation should last for the whole duration of that thought. Repeat this for seven to 11 minutes. Stage two. Utter the sound, "Aaa," seven times with mouth wide open, exhaling fully into each sound. The sound should come from just below the navel. You need not utter it very loud, but loud enough to feel the vibration of the sound. Stage three, sit for five to six minutes with a slightly upturned face, and keep a mild focus between your eyebrows. The total time of this practice is between 12 to 18 minutes. You can sit longer if you wish. Please note, when you sit to do Isha Kriya, do not pay attention to the activity of the mind or body. Whatever is happening in your body or your mind, just ignore it, and simply sit there. Do not take a break in between as it will disturb the reorganization of energies that happens during the practice. The kriya will yield maximum benefits if you do it for a minimum of 12 minutes each time. Do it twice a day for 48 days, considered as a full mandala or cycle, or once a day for 90 days. Anyone can practice this kriya and enjoy its benefits. Simply follow the instructions without making any changes. This is a simple, but very potent kriya. You can remind yourself that I am not the body, I am not even the mind, any time during the day. It would be best to use the voice in the video as a support when doing the kriya. However, you can also do it without using the voice support.

- [Sadhguru] Sit in a cross-legged posture and keep your hands open facing upward. Sit with your face slightly upturned. The moment you sit this way with a slightly upturned face, you will see naturally your focus will shift between your eyebrows. So maintain this mild focus between your eyebrows. As I utter these two sentences with inhalation, you take this thought, I am not this body, with exhalation, I am not even this mind. I am not the body. I am not even the mind. I am not the body. I am not even the mind. I am not the body. I am not even the mind. I am not the body. I am not even the mind. I am not the body. I am not even the mind. I am not the body. I am not even the mind.

I am not the body. I am not even the mind. I am not the body. I am not even the mind. Keep your eyes closed and just sit still, with your face slightly turned upward. Take your own time. Slowly, very slowly, open your eyes.

====================

LESSON 10: Meditation - Isha kriya

- Sitting across like posture and keep your hands open, facing upward. Sit with your face slightly upturned. The moment you sit this way with a slightly upturned face, you will see naturally your focus will shift between your eyebrows. So maintain this mild focus between your eyebrows as I utter these two sentences with inhalation. You take this thought. I am not this body with exhalation. I, I am not even this mild. I am not the body. I am not even the mind. I am not the body.

- I am not even the mind. I'm not the body. I am not even the mind. I'm not the body. I am not even the mind. I am not the body. I am not even the mind. I am not the body. I am not even the mind.

Part 3: Live in Joy

====================

LESSON 11: Unshakeable Stability
--------------------
<v ->On one level, in one way,</v> the spiritual process means to become like a mountain, stable, still. Because, it's only when somebody has a very stable base, many things can be done. Exuberance of life is possible, only if there is absolute stability, otherwise exuberance will lead to madness. That's what a lot of people, what are little creative, little active, little exuberant always ended up being freaky and nearly insane, because without stability, you cannot have a dance going. Shiva means stillness, Shiva means dance at the same time. Either you see him sitting absolutely still, or you see him in an explosion of dance, because an explosion is possible only when there is a stable base. An explosion, which is not destructive is possible, only when there is stability. And stability, People try to become stable by controlling and trimming their lives. This is the way your grandmother would tell you how to be stable, control yourself. Then you will be stable. Yes, if you're dead, you will be stable. I promise you that. So normally people who talk about stability are all constipated existence. You know, what's constipation. That means it happens little by little. Their joy, their love, their ecstasy happens little by little, here and there. That's constipation. So stability is not because you have trimmed your life down or pruned it down to minimal, and you're stable. That's of no consequence. Stability, because you see everything utterly, clearly. That is why, when we say Adiyogi, we're talking about stability and the same time an exuberant dance. This is possible only because he has more than two eyes, not necessarily three more than two. That means he sees much more than most people ever see, because he sees much, much more, he's able to be stable. If you see only one part of it, you cannot be stable. So the entire effort is to see better. Darshan, seeing, you know. The entire culture has always been talking about you go to temple, not for sending petitions, but for darshan, to see, to see better. Fundamentally, why people are not able to see what is there with life is simply because, identifications with so many things, starting with the body, the identifications have gone into so many things. The moment you identify with something, your entire mind understands that it needs to be protected and just works for that. So how do I break my national identity? My religious identity, my racial identity. You don't have to go like this. If you break your identification with your own body it's gone. Everything is gone because everything is rooted in that. Everything is just an amplification of your identification, with the limited boundaries of your own body. The moment you get identified with this, the rest of the identification is only multiplication. And, it multiplies pretty rapidly. The more successful you are with whatever you're doing, you will multiply much faster. And you will be able to see less and less as your identities grow, the drama, the psychological drama, raises in crescendo. Won't allow you to see anything, your own thoughts and emotions will drown you. Unfortunately, the world has been constantly been pushing people to believe that what's happening in your mind is very important. I've been trying to convince the world, what's happening on mind is just trash. "No Sadhguru, I'm thinking about God." That is also trash. Maybe a bit holy trash, but still trash. Because in your mind, God cannot come, Devil cannot come. Angels cannot come. Only thoughts come. It's a fool who identifies, for one thought as sacred, another thought that something else. Thought means something that's not real right now. Thought means, old garbage is festering in your mind. You need to think to survive about this and that. But, you don't need to think to explore something new. You don't need to think to become enlightened, because what will you think? You will only think the past data, which is hidden in your head, in many different ways maybe. How many varieties of expressions your rubbish finds, is of no value to life. Maybe socially, there is some value. In some places when I go internationally, people are saying, He's a thought leader. I say, Ohh. No thought in my head. So seeing clearly, seeing everything that your vision is not obstructed by yourself. If this one thing happens, Stability will happen. Exuberance, you don't have to worry because that's natural, that's the nature of life itself. Everything is exuberant. Stability it takes to allow exuberance to happen. Otherwise you keep curtailing your exuberance because it hurts when it's out of balance. If you're out of balance and you're move at a certain speed, you're going to hurt yourself. Whether you're riding a bicycle or you're riding the cosmos. If you're out of balance and you attain speed, you're going to hurt yourself very badly. Balance is very important and balance that comes out of curtailment is not balance, that's you know, packaged death. Yes. You package death in a certain way and it looks very decent and dignified because dead are always very dignified. Have you seen this, there never did anything indecent, did they? So essentially everything is rooted in the clarity of vision and that will not come unless there's some distance between what is me and what is my body. If this distance is not there, then multiplication of identities will just... It's an inevitable consequence.

====================

LESSON 12: Living With Freedom
--------------------
<v ->You know, Charles Darwin,</v> you heard of Charles Darwin? an Englishman. That's why I'm asking. 200 years ago born, but about 150 years ago, he said, you were all monkeys. Not me, I'm not saying, he said that. You were all monkeys, your tail fell away, you became human. You know the story. When you were a monkey, you did not aspire to be human. Nature just pushed you on. You did not choose, but once you've become human, if you want to evolve from here on, you have to consciously evolve. Otherwise, there is no other way. When I say you have to consciously evolve, what you call as human is not an established state, it's a flux. This moment, you can be God-like. Next moment, you can be a brute. You have seen with yourself. This moment, you're wonderful, next moment, you're nasty, next moment, you're beautiful, next moment, you're ugly. Is this not happening to you? So a human is not a being, he's a becoming, he's an ongoing process. Nothing is fixed. You can be whichever way you want to be. This freedom that you have, that you're not fixed Like every other creature on this planet, if you are aware, this is the greatest benediction because can make yourself whatever you want. If you're unaware, this is the greatest curse. Humanity is right now suffering this freedom. Humanity is not suffering bondage, as people are saying. Humanity is suffering it's freedom. If your life was also fixed, like every other creature, you would have gone about without any stress, you didn't have to do yoga. Isn't it? Isn't it so? If your life was fixed, like every other creature on this planet, you wouldn't be stressed. Only because it is not fixed, you can be anything you want, anything, just about anything can happen in your mind. This is why the stress, isn't it? Suppose a tiger is born, a tiger is not sitting and worrying, how to become a good tiger. Just get enough food, and he will become a good tiger. He is not worried, will I become a good tiger? Will I end up as a house cat? No such problems. You're born as a human being, but still how many things you have to do, to be a good human being, and still, you don't know where you belong. Isn't it? Only in comparison with somebody, you can say, compared to this person, I am a little better. By yourself, you don't know where you belong. Isn't it so? Isn't it so? Because what is human, is not an established state. It is a possibility, it is not a fixed state. If this possibility, has to be made use of, there is a whole system of understanding that needs to happen. Understanding the mechanics of how this life functions and what we can do with it, this mechanics, this technology, this science, we are referring to as yoga. Freedom is a territory, which needs a lot of maturing and culturing to handle. Otherwise, people doing compulsive things, they're thinking they're free. These are compulsive things. Somebody is drinking. If you say, Why don't you not drink today, You can do it tomorrow. Why, I don't have the freedom to drink? No, it's compulsive. If you're calling your compulsiveness as freedom, it's very unfortunate. You lost all your freedom in compulsiveness, so freedom is that kind of a territory, where you have to culture yourself, mature yourself to exist free. Everybody, I think at some point, we provide these opportunities for young people to come and just be by yourself. No compulsive talking, no phone, no drink, no nothing. Simple, you eat what you want for nourishment, and then simply be. Everybody must spend at least a little bit of time like this, because only then you understand how compulsive you are. Unfortunately, we are translating compulsiveness as some kind of a goal in our life or freedom in our life. No. If you want to get somewhere in your life, get somewhere does not mean be better than somebody, do this and this that. No, As a life, your experience of life should become a fantastic experience. So right now, all the crazy things that people are doing in their life, why? They drink, sexuality, temple, this, meditation, whatever they're doing, why they're doing? Because they want their experience of life to become pleasant. Yes or no? Somebody hits the bottle. Somebody hits somebody else, and somebody does something else, but essentially, looking for pleasantness. If your body becomes pleasant, we call this health. I'm talking yoga now to you, officially. if your body becomes pleasant, we call this health. If it becomes very pleasant, we call it pleasure. If your mind becomes pleasant, we call this peace. If it becomes very pleasant, we call it joy. If your emotions become pleasant, we call it love. If it becomes very pleasant, we call it compassion. If your very life energies become pleasant, we call this blissfulness. If it becomes very pleasant, we call it ecstasy. If your surroundings become pleasant, we call this success. Only for this last one, to make our surroundings pleasant, we need the cooperation of many forces around us. Many things have to fall into place, but to keep your body pleasant, mind pleasant, emotion pleasant, your life energies pleasant, it's 100% your business. Isn't it 100% your business to keep this body, this mind, this emotion, and this energy pleasant within yourself? If these things are pleasant right now, you sit here and you're blissed out. Tell me, on a day when you're very happy, are you willing to do a lot of things? Or a day when you're depressed, you're willing to do a lot of things? When you're happy, you're willing to bend backwards and do everything possible. When you're a little unhappy, how difficult it is to move you. Isn't it? So why do you say, if you're blissed out, you will do nothing? It is just that you will no more be a vested interest, you are not in pursuit of happiness. Your life is an expression of your bliss. Now what will you do? You will do what's needed. Every human being should be doing what is needed. Isn't it? Right now, they are trying to milk happiness from the world, destroying the world in the process, completely destroying the world. Today, what is it that these ecological disasters unfolding. What do you think it is? In pursuit of human happiness. Isn't it? Nothing else. In pursuit of human happiness, we've turned this planet into a bonfire, and people are not even happy. Forget about being happy, most people are in different state of struggles. So it's very, very important. What is in your hands, first all those things must be taken charge of. What do we do in the world, let us see, to what extent, the world allows us to do it. Your body, your mind, your emotions, and your energies, must take instructions from you. Isn't it so? So how the hell do you think, you will go where you want in your life, When somebody else and somebody else, can make this body, this person, do whatever they want. At least, what happens within you, must be determined by you. What happens around you, It'll never be a 100 percent determined by you. If you work hard, a little more influence, otherwise, a little less influence, but never a 100 percent. Outside situations will always be like that and they should be like that. Because if the whole world happens the way you want, then where do I go? A little bit, your way, a little bit, my way, a little bit, somebody else's way, it's fine, but what happens here, must be my way. If this one thing happens your way, will you keep yourself blissful? miserable? depressed? what? So, essentially you must understand. You can call it stress, anxiety, misery, depression, whatever you call it, essentially, your intelligence has turned against you. That's all that's happened to you. Because there is no any kind of knowledge in your education system from ABC to till this day, how to take charge of the faculties that you have within yourself. There is no addressing it at all. If you address it, people say, oh, you are an archaic. This has become the norm in the country. If you say, you need to do something with yourself. No, no, no, we do everything outside. No. You need to do something with yourself because otherwise you will not happen the way you want yourself to be. That's a disastrous life.

====================

LESSON 13: Your Inner Peace is Achievable - Here's Why
--------------------
<v ->So, people have tried,</v> excessive eating, intoxicants, excess of indulgence in pleasures, With all these things they have tried to create some kind of peacefulness within themselves. You thought you got there, but next moment, you know you are not there. Any number of times, its deceived you, isn't it? One Saturday evening, your whole family met. All of you had a wonderful dinner. You thought this is the height of the world. Everything is so wonderful and magical. Tomorrow morning you will see, Not because there is something wrong with your family. It is just that, with limited entity, You're trying to create an unlimited space. It's not going to work. It's just not going to work. Nothing wrong, It's just that, it doesn't work. There are lots of great things in the world, which don't work. I'm not interested in them, that's all. You're interested in great things. There're lots of great things. People claim, they are great things, but they don't work. They have not worked for anybody. There are great things because somebody says so. They are great things because somebody thinks too much of himself and whatever he says that must be great things, but they don't work. We are looking for something that works. If you are determining the nature of your experience right now, 100 percent, let's say, we assume that if you are, then, would somebody have to tell you, please create a pleasant experience. Will somebody have to tell you? No, So somebody telling you "be loving", "be blissful" is all bullshit. Because nobody needed to tell you "Be pleasant." The problem is you are not able to determine the nature of your experience, Isn't it? The problem is, you're unable to determine the nature of your experience, for whatever reasons. If you could determine the nature of your experience, nobody has to tell you, "Be blissful", "Be loving", "Be happy", be this. This is all coming from, you know, patchy ideas about life. You see somebody fighting, you said, "Be loving." You see somebody unhappy, You say, "blissful" It's most insulting that these are all the great teachings on this planet, which have been on for centuries. These are all great things that have never worked. So, we are only seeing how to determine the nature of your experience. If you take charge of what causes experience within you, if you are in charge of that, I am 100 percent sure, that you would make it really pleasant for yourself. And I'm also sure, If you are feeling very pleasant within yourself, you would be naturally pleasant to everybody around yourself. Unfortunately, people have taken it upon themselves, to confuse the humanity so badly. How about their own nature. See, it's very simple. It doesn't take any damn scripture, or a guru to tell you this. It is very simple, whatever the nature of your experience it's happening within you, isn't it so? you don't need some great yoga, or a scripture, or a guru, or a stone that falls from heaven to tell you this. You have the nature of your experience, whatever is, the nature of your experience, whether it is fear, anger, love, hatred, ecstasy, agony, everything is happening from within you. It would be very natural for human beings to look and see, how to make it into our most pleasant experience. Isn't it? If you had not freaked them, God loves you from up there. If you had not exported love to heaven, a lot of human beings would have been very loving human beings, but now, we have exported it out there. You have to import it, but importing it, You need permit. And there are agents here, who don't give those permit so easily. It's not coming across, because all the love is gone to happen. How to get it now, here, there's a priest standing here with the permit. He won't give it to you, Whether you want to experience blissfulness, whether you want to experience love, whether you want to experience ecstasy, whatever, whatever states of pleasantness, human beings have known, have come from within them. So, there is no need to apply for any permit from anywhere. You just have to become willing to explore, what this is, to bring this to the most pleasant state. Not because it's a virtue, love is not a virtue, bliss is not a virtue, to be pleasant is not a virtue, It's just that, that is a way you long to be, isn't it? It is not that if you're loving, you will go to heaven. it is not that if you're ecstatic, you'll go to heaven. It is just that If you're loving and ecstatic, you don't need a damn heaven. People, who made a hell out of themselves, want to go to heaven. People who made a heaven out of themselves, where do they do want to go? Wherever the hell they go, they don't care. So it's very, very important. If you want to ensure that the sounds that this one produces is good. The more you know about this whole mechanism, the better sound you produce. Isn't it so? Sometimes by chance it may happen, that's different, but the more you know about it, the better it is. If you are a sound engineer, you produce good sound. It is just that because, it's in a different direction than the way you are constantly looking through your sense perception. you need help, maybe. Not necessarily, but generally, yes. You need a certain amount of help, but that's all. "Grace" is just that help, that it creates a conducive atmosphere to slip in. If any machinery has to perform well, you know, people have started using these words, everywhere these days. You need lubricants, some lubricant, try to, whatever the great car you have, try to run it without oil, not 10 minutes, it will be ruined, isn't it? So lubricant, which is keeping it going. All this great machinery without that little bit of that, thin film of lubricant, it's all destroyed in no time. "Grace" is just that, that little lubricant, So that things happen smoothly. Now, they've started calling it liquid engineering. So, this takes little engineering, "Grace" is just a lubricant, without the lubricant If you try to work, the friction, just the friction of life has destroyed too many human beings. Isn't it? Nothing big they did, all they did was, simple things. They were born, which was not their doing. Their doing such a big thing, that just happened. They just wanted to eat well, sleep well, fulfill their basic needs. This is all they want to do in the process of doing this. How many human beings are broken and bitter, and destroyed because no lubricant, nothing wrong with them. They're trying to work their engines without a lubricant. That's all it is. Just see, even your cell phone is working because through thin air, they conducting the sound for you, isn't it? We can just disturb that. You know, those advertisements, hello, hello, hello. You seen those thing. Phones become like that, because there is a little bit of disturbance. That's what is happening with this also. This is a far more sophisticated instrument than anything that you have seen. This needs a little bit of attention. If you pay attention, it pays off.

LESSON 13: Tool for Transformation - Nadi Shuddhi

- [Narrator] The word Nadi Shuddhi literally means cleansing the nadis. When we say nadis, we're not talking about the 72,000, because these 72,000 are only a branch out of the two basic nadis, the Pingala and the Ida. 36,000 branching out from Pingala, 36,000 branching out from Ida, this is the energy physiology of a human being. When we say Nadi Shuddhi, we're talking about cleansing fundamentally the Pingala and Ida so that energy system will work in balance. There is a connection between your breath and your mental structure to bring balance to your thought is a very important step that you need to take. If you want to bring balance to your activity, your emotion and the results of your life and the impact that you have in other people's lives. Nadi Shuddhi plays an important role.

- [Instructor] Here are a few guidelines that will set optimal conditions and greatly enhance your receptivity of the practices. Please ensure cell phones are either in silent mode or switched off. It is advisable not to sit for the program with a full stomach, or immediately after a meal. Please sit with your spine comfortably erect, hands uncrossed and palms open. These conditions will prepare you to be in a heightened state of receptivity and derive the most benefits from the practices. These practices are very safe and simple and can be done by anybody. The practices we will be learning here can be done by anyone ages seven years and above. If you wear glasses, while doing the yoga practices, please remove them and keep them aside. How to do Nadi Shuddhi? She will demonstrate. Please observe. Sit in a cross-legged posture with your spine comfortably erect, eyes closed, left-hand should be loosely placed in the middle of your lap. Palm facing upwards, use only your right hand, use your thumb and ring finger, fold your middle and index fingers. The ring and little finger are held straight, and side by side touching. Now, block your right nostril with your thumb and inhale through your left nostril. After the inhalation is complete, exhale through the same. In a similar fashion, using the ring finger, block your left nostril and inhale through the right nostril, then exhale through the same. Again, block the right and open the left, inhale and exhale, continue like this. Be focused on your breath. So when you do this Nadi Shuddhi, what is most important is to breathe fully in and fully out as slowly and as gently as it is possible for you. You should not make any sound when you exhale or inhale. So for this to happen, you would just need to remember one basic point. So that Nadi Shuddhi happens by itself. You will always switch after every exhalation. So that means whichever nostril you inhale through the same nostril you exhale through. You do Nadi Shuddhi for a minimum of four minutes. A few corrections for the practice do not keep your left hand on the thigh. The left hand should be loosely placed in the middle of your lap. To clarify on the right hand, you use only your thumb and ring finger. The ring and little finger are held straight and are side by side, touching, fold your middle and index fingers. If you are unable to hold them straight, do it as best you can. Also, there's a tendency to keep the head down or turn to one side. Unconsciously, your face may tilt one way or the other. Your head should be straight. If you maintain this, your system will come to a balance very quickly. Ensure not to press too hard on the lower part of the nostril. Locate the septal bone on your right nostril. Just a millimeter beneath that, if you place the thumb with very minimal pressure, you can block the nostril effectively so that no air can escape. Ensure you are not breathing shallow, doing normal breathing or holding the breath. The breathing should be fully in and fully out. We will do Nadi Shuddhi together now. Sit in a cross-legged posture with your spine comfortably erect. If you are unable to sit on the floor, you can sit in a chair with your legs crossed at the ankles. Left-hand should be loosely placed in the middle of your lap, palm facing upward. Use only your right hand. Use your thumb and ring finger, fold your middle and index fingers. The ring and little finger are held straight and are side by side, touching. Close your eyes. Now, block your right nostril with your thumb and inhale through your left nostril. After the inhalation is complete, exhale through the same. Now, using the ring finger block your left nostril and inhale through the right nostril. Then, exhale through the same. Again, block the right and open the left, inhale and exhale. Continue to do this until we ask you to stop. Be focused on your breath. The breathing is fully in and fully out. Do it as slowly and gently as you can. Make sure your spine is comfortably erect. Ensure your head is straight. Continue to be focused on your breath.

LESSON 14: Being Playful Is the Most Responsible Thing You Can Do
--------------------
<v ->Being playful,</v> always has been understood as irresponsibility. Right from your childhood and probably to your children also you're doing this. If they just playful, you think it's irresponsible. The most responsible way to live is that you're playful with life. It's absolutely irresponsible to carry a long face and walk around on this planet. Yes or no? Isn't it absolutely irresponsible to walk around with misery? Yes? That's the most irresponsible thing you can do. So being playful is not irresponsibility. Being playful is being very responsible and responsive to life. Only when you're playful, you can do that. When you're serious, the world doesn't exist for you, you and your nonsense. Yes, when you're serious, it's just about you and your nonsense, the world and other life does not exist for you. Only when you're playful, you can pay attention to everything. You can truly respond to everything in the world, only if you're playful. Otherwise you cannot. Just the burden of it will kill you. So playfulness is not a philosophy that you have to develop, "I'm going to be playful, I'm going to be playful." No. Science is telling you that the whole existence is just a dance vantage. It looks like. The forces that create this existence are always playful. Always in this culture, creation has been described as God's play. When they said, "God's playing." Many thinking people thought, "Oh, that fool is playing with my life, that's why all this misery." The forces of creation are constantly at play. If they stop playing, you're finished. Yes? All the basic forces within the body itself, they must be playing with full vigor. Only that everything is nice. If they stop playing or they refuse to play, you're done, you're old. So playfulness, not just in your attitude, this is not your attitude, this is the attitude of the creator, this is the attitude of the creation. If you are in tune with the creation and the creator, being playful is very natural. Only when you're not in tune with that, somewhere you totally enslaved by the process of your mind, your thought, your opinions, your ideologies, your rights and wrongs, your moralities, then only lost your playfulness. If you are in line with life, if you're in line with creation or creator, you would naturally be playful. You have started ignoring the larger creation and become too attached to your petty creation, which is happening again. That is why all playfulness is gone. If you're in line with the larger creation, there is no other way to be, you will be playful. And only if one is playful, such a person can truly grapple with the problems in the world without being affected by it and do his best about it. If he doesn't know how to be playful, those problems will just eat him up. The problems that exist in the world are not simple. Yes? If you try to grapple with them without the necessary playfulness in you, don't ever think you're going to solve the problem, you will just get gobbled up by the problem, that's all that'll happen. It has eaten up any number of people, isn't it so? Any number of people with good intentions, has it not swallowed? Has it not swallowed the problems of the world? Any number of people with very good intentions have just been licked up by the existing situations. You can only handle them if you're truly playful, otherwise everything would be troubled. If you maintain just a few hours of playfulness in a day about what you're doing, you will see you, even your physical body will start functioning so much better. Your quota will come down. And meditation becomes a natural process for one who's playful because the moment you are playful, you are not entangled with the things that you're doing. Once you're not entangled with it, you are not accumulating karma, you're doing yoga. The process of living is not entangling, the process of living has become liberating. So you are no more doing karma, you are doing yoga with the activity that you perform. Once you're doing yoga through the day, definitely everything should get better, isn't? But a beginner who is not yet accomplished the activity is necessary. And if you don't make the activity playful, the activity is killing, always, no matter what is the type of activities. There are different ways of passing through a situation, you know. Mahabharat is a tremendous statement on this, how different human beings pass through the same situations. Almost everything that Krishna is going through, on a smaller scale, people around him are going through. How they go through it and how he goes through it. How different types of people go through it, the same situations. Mahabharat has a tremendous document on that, how different types of people of different levels of consciousness exist and go through the same situations. When there is some problem, you're traveling outside or you're in the office, some problem arises, and there are 10 people. How this 10 different people experience this little problem that's come up? One person will pull his hair and freak out. Another person will pounce on somebody else. Another person bangs his head. Another person, looking at what he can do. Do you see this thing happening? The same given situation. So fundamentally that's what Mahabharat is. That there are all types of people, good people, bad people, outright evil, absolutely virtuous, various types of people. If you look at it, every kind of human being that you can find in any society, they're all there in Mahabharat, a whole range of people, greedy ones, absolutely selfless ones, fearful ones, brave ones, valiant warriors, cowards, every kind are there. And they're all being put through a whole intense drama and you will look at each one's experience. It's very different than the way he handles it, is very different, and where he lands up in the end is very different. Through this whole drama of all the people, Krishna is going to the maximum amount of drama but untouched. Because he said. That means, "First establish in yoga and then act." If you act without establishing yourself in yoga, then your action to become an entanglement, it doesn't matter what you're doing. Simple things that people take up to do in their life. After all, for most of the people, 95% of the people in the world, all that they have taken up is, just to earn something for their survival, procreate, bring up their children, that's it. Just for the small drama that they have picked up for themselves. They wanted it. A little business or a job, a home, wife, children, husband, this is it, to manage this way. And they end up, many of them end up in the insane asylums too, just doing a simple job, isn't it so? Yes. They are not taken up the problems of the world. They don't want to be Dharmaguptakas, wanting to establish dharma in the world. No such great responsibility they have taken up, just to earn their living, survive, procreate and die, which every creature on the planet does. For that, see where people are ending up. How many people at ending up total mess? How many people are halfway down there? It's too many people, isn't? It has taken an unusually heavy toll, simple life process. It is not necessary, this way, but unfortunately it does go that way for many people, simply because there is no playfulness in their way of existence, there is no playfulness in the way they live. They are too dead serious. Now these two things look contradictory, on one level of you're talking about intensity of passion, devotion, another level, playfulness, that's the whole thing. If it's passion, you must burn with it. If you are half-hearted you will not know what it is, just dociles you, you will not know the benefit of it. You really have to burn. Otherwise you will not know what it is at all. If you want to walk the path of devotion and you also want to save yourself, it doesn't work. The idea of devotion, the idea of choosing the path of passion is that you want to burn up everything that is you, so that only that which you are passionate about or devote about exists within you. What do you call as myself, is burnt up in the simple process. It is, for a thinking mind, this looks like self-destructive, but unless you're willing to burn up the limited, another possibility, never arises within you. If really the other possibility has to touch you, you really have to burn.

LESSON 14: Tool for Transformation - Nada Yoga

- Modern science is proving to you, the whole existence is just a reverberation. Where there is a reverberation, there is bound to be a sound. So the whole existence is sound. The root sounds for this complex amalgamation of sounds are; "Aaa", "Ooo" and "Mmm". Without employing your tongue, you would be able to make only these three sounds; "Aaa", "Ooo" and "Ma". By placing your tongue in different positions within the cavity of your mouth, you get to mix these three sounds and produce all the other sounds. "Aaa", "Ooo" and "Mmm" are the basis of all the other sounds that you can utter. they're referred to as the "basic sounds" or the "universal sounds". If you utter these three sounds together, you get the sound "Aum". These are the only three sounds that the system can produce naturally. If you utter these three sounds carefully, different aspects of your body are activated and energized. You will notice if you utter the sound "Aaa", the reverberation starts just beneath the navel and will spread right across the body because this is the only place where all the 72,000 nadis or pathways of energy meet and redistribute themselves. This is the maintenance center in the body. Uttering the sound "Aaa" strengthens this. If you utter the sound "Ooh", you will notice this point where the rib cage meets. Just beneath that there is a soft spot. The reverberations will flow from here and then move upward. If you utter the sound "Mmm", you will see the reverberations will start from the pit of your throat and generally spread to the upper regions of your body. Uttering these three sounds has innumerable benefits. If you are suffering from any psychological disturbances like excessive fear, nightmares or unstable mind or body, if your general constitution is weak, you tend to fall sick too often. Particularly for children who have attention disorders, daily utterance of these sounds for a few minutes a day will make an enormous difference. Uttering of these three fundamental sounds activates the three lobes of your lungs separately which in turn activates the three basic segments of the body; the lower, the middle and the upper, laying the necessary foundation for the pleasantness of your being or for a joyful existence.

You utter the sound "Mmm" seven times. As you do this, notice where the reverberations are happening, in which region of the body. Sound "Aaa" generates reverberations around your navel. Sound "Ooo", at the point where the rib cage meets, and sound "Mmm" will center around the pit of your throat. Now let us do it together. Keep your palms facing upward, your spine comfortably erect. Please Close your eyes. Take your own time. Take your own time. Slowly, very slowly, open your eyes.

LESSON 15: Life Ticks Away
--------------------
<v ->What is the most important thing in your life right now?</v> You are alive right now, isn't it? Sadhguru, that's OK Sadhguru. But I have a bundle of thousand rupees Sadhguru. But I don't know where to go. That's fine. That is also important right now. But what is the most important thing right now? You're alive right now, isn't it so? Because you're alive your family has become important your money has become important your country has become important so many other things have become important. Only because you're alive right now. And this is the most important thing. That you are alive right now, is the most important thing in your life right now. You know every day nearly a quarter million people die on the planet. Natural death. Quarter a million people die, but you did not. Tomorrow morning you wake up and check, Am I alive? If you're alive, will you give yourself one big smile? <v Audience>Yes.</v> <v ->If you are alive.</v> If you're not I'll excuse you. Will you give yourself a one big smile if you are alive? <v Audience>Yes.</v> <v ->And if a quarter million people died,</v> at least 2 to 3 million people lost somebody who's dear to them. So you check those 3-4 people who are very important in your life. All of them are alive today. One more big smile? <v Audience>Yes.</v> <v ->Then you'll check time.</v> <v ->It's 11:30.</v> You're still alive. Don't think this is a joke. What is ticking off here is not the clock. It's your life. Yes or No? <v Audience>Yes.</v> It is not the clock ticking away. It is your life ticking away. And it is 12 o'clock, You're still alive. You must promise me this, every time you check the time, you must give yourself a smile, If you are still alive. But so many people are walking on the street as if they're practicing their posture for their grave. Don't worry. It'll come naturally, please. That is super efficient. It doesn't need practice. When it happens Boom! Hundred percent. Nobody ever died inefficiently. Isn't it? People live inefficiently but nobody died inefficiently. So will you promise me this? Every time you check the watch, you must give yourself a smile. You don't know how it is happening. Do you really know? Do you know how this is happening? No. And so many people who are so real just like you and me, Pop! and they are gone. Just gone. Nowhere to be seen. If you come to the idea of mortality, once in a way, it'll make you depressed. It will make you fearful. If you live with it every moment, it will make you absolutely exuberant and alive. Because, it is just this one thing. <v ->That, this is not forever.</v> This is just for a brief period of time. And the more joyful you are, briefer it becomes. If you're ecstatic, it'll just vanish in no time. Yes? So if you want to stretch it, you need to make yourself truly miserable. Otherwise it'll be just gone in no time. If you come to terms with this, if you live this way, that every moment you appreciate one thing and only one thing, because the most important thing in your life is you're alive right now. To be alive, fully alive. 100% alive is the most important thing. Because only if something is hundred percent alive, can you make it in something beautiful? So you have a little plant in your house, or let's say a mango tree in your house. They do like this, which is just imitating you. Can you make it come out with a lot of sweetness? No, it's alive in a big way. Now you can expect sweetness from that. Nobody has to teach the mango tree which is alive. Please give sweetness. Anyway it will pour out. Isn't it? Miserable people have to be taught. Please be loving. Please be nice to people. Gentle to people. Do this. Do that. Thou shall not do this. Thou shall do that. All these things are necessary because in some way you become half alive. If you're exuberantly alive it is natural for human consciousness to bleed sweetness every moment of your life. We don't know what great things you will do or not. We don't know whether you will climb Mount Everest or not. We don't know whether you will run faster than Mr. Bolt or not. We don't know whether you will become the richest man or woman in this world or not. But this one thing you must do to yourself. This one thing you deserve. This one thing is 100 percent in your hands that you can live here as a joyful human being. This much is possible for every one of us. Our ability to fix the world around us, subject to various realities. Some things work. Some things don't work. Because this involves too many forces. Sometimes it falls into place. Sometimes it doesn't. But in our lives, will we do everything, that we can do or not is determined by this, that only if you're joyful by your own nature, that is you have no fear of suffering. Only when you have no fear of suffering, will your dare to walk your life full stride! Everything that you can do, you will do. In our lives if we do not do what we cannot do, this is not an issue. But if we do not do what we can do, we are a disastrous life. It's my vision, my blessing. That you should not become such a disaster. Everything that you can do must happen in this life. If that has to happen The fundamental ambience that is needed is that you're a joyful human being by your own nature. What's the time? Still on, eh. Let's do it. Thank you. Thank you.

- What you're referring to as love, is basically the sweetness of your emotion. You sit here, you could feel love about somebody who's not even here. So it's got nothing to do with anybody. It is just the sweetness of your emotion. Now is your love affair, your ability to love, is it on self-start, or is it on push start? Once a human being becomes more and more aware of his own nature. He understands, to experience love, to experience blissfulness, to experience ecstasy. You want to experience orgasmic ways of life. You don't need anybody actually. If you just sit here, you can make it happen within yourself. Because after all, it's your body, it's your mind, it's your emotion, it's your chemistry. And you are the one who is creating all the experiences of your life. Because people are not conscious of this, that you are the maker of your life. You are the one who is doing your life the way you want it. Most people still believe that their experiences are being shaped by people and situations around them, but that's not true. Human experiences are 100% self created, 100%. So if it's self-created, right now if you sit here, would you choose to maintain sweetness of your mind, sweetness of your body, sweetness of your emotion, sweetness of your energy, or would you like something bitter? Sweetness. So you would naturally be loving. It doesn't take anybody. So a relationship when you see a man and a woman, you're talking about a relationship, because there are other aspects to it. There may be a social angle to it. There may be a physical angle to it. There may be a psychological angle to it. There may be an economic angle to it. The variety of other things to fulfill in the relationship. We form relationships with a variety of people in our lives. You have business relationships, you have personal relationships, you have professional relationships. So relationships we form basically, to fulfill different types of needs, or to fulfill somebody else's needs, whichever way it is. That is a relationship. But what you refer to as love, is just the sweetness of your emotion. You can use another person, to stimulate that within you, or you can be self on self-start mechanism. What is this need for love in a human being, constantly. A human being is longing to be something more, than what they are right now. The thing is you want to include something, which is not a part of you as yourself. That is a whole effort. If it happens emotionally on the emotional level, if you try this, we call this a love affair. You're trying to make somebody who is not a part of you, part of yourself, emotionally. This is a love affair. If you do it consciously, we call this yoga. Yoga means union. Love is not a relationship. Love is a certain sweetness of your emotion. Whether you look at a tree, or a dog, or a man, or a woman, or a child, or just at the sky. Why can't you look at it lovingly? Because it's not about loving the sky. It's about the sweetness of your emotion. If you're willing, you can become love. You can make your emotion in your very sweet space. Love is not something that you do. It is something that you can become. For five minutes every day, go sit with something, that does not mean anything to you, maybe a tree, or a pebble, or a worm, or an insect. After some time you will find, you can look upon it, with as much love as you hold for your wife, husband, mother, child, or dog. Maybe the worm does not know this. The insect does not know this. That does not matter. If you can look at everything lovingly, the whole world explodes, into your beautiful phenomena for you. You realize love is not something that you do, It is the way you are.
