Preparation 1: Welcome to Your New Life

- Hello I'm Neale, Welcome to the beginning of the rest of your life. Everyday is that of course but, not quite the way this day is, that. This day is the beginning of the rest of your life in a new way and so in a sense it's the beginning of the rest of your new life. That's because, beginning on this day, in just a few moments in fact, you're going to be challenging yourself to recreate yourself anew in every golden moment of now in the next grandest version of the greatest vision ever you held about who you are. I want you to think about those words. They capture what you are told in the Conversations with God series of books is the very purpose of life itself. It's the reason we're all here. It's why God created us here on Earth. And why physicality exists everywhere in the universe. This is the solution to the greatest mystery of all time. Why are we alive? And the solution is offered in just 25 words. So I'd like you to think about those 25 words because they're not insignificant. I'll say them again so that you can really absorb them. So that you can capture and embrace their deepest meaning at the depth of your being. The purpose of life is, okay, here come those 25 words. Recreate yourself anew in the next golden moment of now, in the next grandest version of the greatest vision ever you held about who you are. Now, if you don't have any vision about who you are you're going to be throwing darts in the dark. You're going to be aiming at a target you can't see. You're going to be reaching for a goal that isn't there, that you have not yet defined. That you've never even created. This will produce an experience without purpose and it will feel like an existence without purpose. Your time here will feel aimless and lacking in direction. It'll also feel lacking in results. For many people this is the story of their life. Get up in the morning, do what you feel you have to do. Get through the day as best as you can. Then go to bed at night and wonder, what was that all about? What was the point of it all? What's the purpose? What's the intention? What's the outcome that's most desired? You might find it amazing to know that a huge percentage of the world's people are living this way, exactly this way. They have no idea what their desired outcome in life is and they're trudging on a road to nowhere. A few years ago I wrote a book titled, The Only Thing That Matters. The first paragraph in that book contains the following sentence. 98% of the world's people are spending 98% of their time on things that don't matter. That's kind of sad when you think about it. It's also the reason that so many people experience life the way it is. On this particular day then, all of us get to ask ourselves a question, are we content with the way our life is right now? If nothing changed in terms of our forward movement in the process of our own evolution between now and the day we die, would we be okay with that? I don't know about you, but for me the answer is no. I want to move forward, forward, ever forward, in the process of becoming the fullest expression of my true nature. I'm sure you feel exactly the same way or you wouldn't have signed up to take the challenge that I'm placing before all of us today. I'd like to take just a moment right now to explain to you why I'm doing this and to share with you just a little of my story, may I? When I was 49-years-old, which is now a quarter century ago, nothing in my life was working. My career had reached a dead end. My relationship was falling apart and my health was rapidly going downhill. And one night in a fit of despair, I couldn't sleep, so I got up, found a yellow legal pad on the coffee table in the living room in front of me, picked up a pen and began writing an angry letter to God. What does it take to make life work? What have I done to deserve a life of such continuing struggle? And somebody tell me the rules. I'll play, just give me the rule book. It was then that I heard a voice over my right shoulder. Neale, do you really want answers to all of these questions or are you just venting? Of course there was no one there. I mean I looked around and there's no one there. So I thought to myself, great, great, it wasn't bad enough that I was sitting here writing a angry letter to God, now I'm going out of my mind. But then a strange thing happened. I suddenly felt very calm. My whole being was filled with a kind of peace that I'd never known before. Then I began receiving answers to all of the questions that I had asked. It was if someone was whispering in my ear or perhaps more accurately, that I was listening to what I could only describe as a voiceless voice inside of my head. It's something like the voice of your own thoughts except that these thoughts were thoughts I had never had before in my life. They were clearly coming from somewhere else, not from my memory, not from anything I had ever heard or read or been told before. So I began writing down everything that I was hearing. For me it was very much like taking dictation. And the more that I was receiving this way the more questions I had. So I found myself writing my questions on a yellow legal pad as fast as the questions came to me. And the answers would come just as fast as well. And there I was, there I was in the middle of the night writing as fast as I could, question answer, question answer, question answer until I filled up the entire pad of paper. In the days and weeks ahead I filled up many yellow legal pads with questions and answers. As a favor to me, a friend of mine who earned her living as a secretary, typed this handwritten material into a computer document, which I then sent to a publisher. You know I really hadn't started out to write a book, in fact, that was the farthest thing from my mind. I was undergoing really a personal private process. I received a very interesting message however at one point in this process. And the message was this, I mean I was told these words. This will one day become a book. And then I remember thinking, now that's something I can measure. All the other information I was receiving was conceptual in nature. It was abstract, theoretical, unprovable. But here was something that I could measure. This statement provided me with an observable outcome. It would either become a book or it wouldn't. That gave me a way to verify the validity of the information that I was receiving. So I sent the typewritten record of this dialogue that I was having to a handful of publishers. I knew, of course, that there wasn't a chance in the world that anyone was going to see my private notes and say wait a minute, hold the presses, we got to get this to print at once this guy's talking to God. But in fact, that's exactly what happened and the rest, as they say, is publishing history. The book went on to sell more than a million copies, to be translated into 37 languages and to be read around the world. Meanwhile, my conversations with God were continuing and I continued to keep a record of it and when I was asked to publish them as well I immediately agreed, because I could not have kept the information that I was receiving to myself anymore then someone could keep it a secret if they had received, in a moment of inspiration, let's say the cure for a deadly disease or a sure way to bring about world peace. And it's for this exact same reason that I created this special challenge Quest that you're participating in now. I knew that I was going to spend the rest of my life making sure that I place this information into as many hands as possible as fast as I could. And so these messages have now reached your hands. But please, let's be clear about something, shall we? This is not a course of study. This is not an individual course that you take like you would if you were in a school of some kind. This is actually an individual personal challenge. The program does not include data in the form of lessons as you might expect in a formal study course. Rather, it offers data in the form of guidance. Bits of information that can guide you on your way, placed before you to provide you with an opportunity to move closer and closer to the completion of your life's purpose, which is to express your true identity in fullness and to know your divinity. Not as a concept, but as an experience. I believe this material was placed before you by your soul. I don't think it's serendipity. I don't think it's a coincidence. Nor do I think it's a sheer stroke of luck that this very unusual program came to your attention and that you decided to signup for it. I believe it's your soul's intention that you will awaken your mind to who you truly are. That will produce behaviors which will awaken possibilities in others, to know and experience who they truly are. As we begin this journey together I invite you to eliminate all expectations for this Quest and while you're at it, for life itself. Replacing those expectations with anticipation of the excitement and the shear joy of self-expression and creation for yourself and for the world that you touch. Nothing creates pressure and moves you farther from joy then expectation. But anticipation creates exuberance. So, let go of any expectation you may have regarding this program right now and replace it with anticipation. If you've read and enjoyed or even heard about the Conversations with God books you may be excited to know that this personal challenge is built around the messages in Conversations with God, Book four, Awaken the Species. This is a totally unexpected dialogue that was published nearly 20 years after what was thought to be the final text in the Conversations with God series. This brand new dialogue contains a list of major differences in the behaviors of an awakened species, when compared to the behaviors of most of us who are living in an unawakened state. Each day you'll be given some important assignments designed to propel you forward. These are an integral part of the program. It's where accepting and meeting the challenge to which this program invites you takes place. It's where your commitment to your own evolution becomes real. Okay, here we go. that's the assignment, that's it for today. Welcome to the program. I'm looking forward to seeing you on day one.

Preparation 2 - A Reminder Of Who You Really Are

- [Neale] There's something quite extraordinary going on here. Most of us don't even know what it is. We don't know what it's about. We don't even know it's happening. But it is happening. Every moment of every minute of every hour of every day, it's happening. It's life happening all around us. And here's what not very many people really fully and deeply understand, much less appreciate, it's happening for a reason. There's a purpose behind it. There's a mechanism in place, there's a process that's being undertaken in life by life itself. And that process is a process by which we, as the livers of this life, as those who are living into the experience, create the experience we are living into as a means of experiencing and expressing who we are really are. That life exists in all of its forms, the beauty of the night sky, the wonder of a garden of flowers, the incredible expression of humanity itself, the feeling of love, and the glory of a great idea which has just come to someone and exploding within them, an awareness of something that they can't even name, but they can feel. Ah, they say, that's me. Even as they see the night sky, they see a part of themselves there, there's a way to relate. Even as they see the flowers in a beautiful garden, that they can see themselves there, there's something of beauty in me too. And look at this, I'm merely looking at myself in another form. And even as we look at other people, we can relate, and we say, there I go, being human, being wonderful, being glorious, being divine. There's something quite extraordinary going on here. It's a process, not only by which we experience ourselves in its divine, but by which we define what divinity is to us. Can you imagine a process like this? We're actually creating God through the process of being God as we are choosing to create it. That's what's happening. That's what's going on. That's the miracle of life itself flowing through you, in you, as you. And once you understand what's going on, the purpose of all of it, the divine process, you take part in it in a brand new way. Not unconsciously, but consciously. Not unintentionally, but intentionally. Not accidentally, but on purpose. And you see every golden moment of now as an opportunity to recreate yourself anew in the next grandest version of the greatest vision you ever held about who you are. And if you do that only for a short time, for an hour a day, an hour a week, an hour a month, your whole life will suddenly make sense to you, and you will touch the world in a way that brings sense to the world. That's how life itself changes and becomes the miracle it was intended to be, when you decide to be the miracle you were intended to be. So be it, be divine.

Week 1

========================================

LESSON 1: Understanding God & Highly Evolved Beings
--------------------
<v ->I'd like to start by taking a look at</v> what it is you are questing for. See my presumption is that in your life you're looking for, yearning for, wishing for the highest and grandest experience of yourself that it's possible for you to attain. And b that I don't mean that you find the perfect partner or get the ideal job, live in the nicest place or have the highest income, enjoy the best health or wind up at the end of the game with the most toys, what I'm talking about is the highest and grandest expression of yourself that it's possible to attain. I'm talking about something internal not something external. I'm talking about what's in here not what's out there. I'm talking about the metaphysical and spiritual not the physical and material reality. Physical realities are important of course but its metaphysical realities that can play a huge role in creating physical realities. It's spiritual realities that can play a huge role in producing material realities. See there's a direct connection between the two and many, many people don't know this. Others do know it but they do not pay attention to it. So the object of today's guidance is to make sure that you both know it and pay attention to it. So here's what this program invites you to know, there is a God. We'll start your quest off at the top with the first item of information you'll need to know in order to proceed. Here it is in two words. God exists. Conversations with God invites us to consider that God is not a male being with a body and a judgemental personality, living in some kingdom somewhere high in the sky. Most of you I'm sure have already given up that notion as childish and limited. Yet you may not have decided what then God is. This program is based on the idea that what we call God might best be described as a three part essential essence that is at one in the same time the source, the substance and the expression of everything in existence. It is the first force, the prime source and the natural course of all matter and energy everywhere. It is what could be called the only ingredient in the totality of the cosmos, seen and unseen, physical and non-physical, material and spiritual. In my way of putting it, God is the all in all, the alpha and the omega, the beginning and the end, the up and the down of it, the left and the right of it, the here and the there of it, the before and the after of it, the now and the then of it, the big and the small of it, the fast and the slow of it, the dark and the light of it, the male and the female of it, the cause and the effect of it. We're talking here about a complete circle that encompasses the physical, the nonphysical and the metaphysical. Because it is a circle divinity has no beginning and no end. Conversations with God tells us that all things are one thing. There's only one thing, and all things are part of the one thing there is. In my understanding God is a process not a super being or a singular entity having characteristics and proclivities mirroring human qualities, but a process. A process we call life, with a product that we call love and expression that we call creativity, and a quality that we call freedom. This is my understanding of divinity. Divinity is both the source and the expression of unconditional love. God is a shape-shifter taking different shapes at different times. Divinity can and will manifest in our experience as a father's protection, a mother's nurturance, a grandparent's wisdom, a lover's tenderness, a sibling's loyalty, a friend's devotion, a neighbor's kindness, a visitor's presence, a doctor's healing, a teacher's clarity, a minister's comfort and a child's sheer wonder in the pure delight of you. Now here is my understanding of humanity. Human beings are also composed of three parts, and as in our description of divinity we could call these three parts of ourselves the source, the substance and the expression of everything in our existence. These same words apply in smaller measures to the description of us because as has been declared by many of the worlds religions we are made in the image and likeness of God. Or to put it another way, each of us is an individuation and expression of God in singular form. We sometimes call the three aspects of ourselves body, mind and spirit. We might also call these three parts of us physical, nonphysical and the metaphysical. These facets of us are not found in a straight line configuration with one starting over here and ending over here, and the next one picking up where the previous one left off. Rather these elements are annular. That is they form and energetic circle and so we, like divinity, have no beginning and no end. We always were, are now and always will be. In this we're exactly like every other sentient being in the cosmos. Oh yes, I forgot to tell you, there are other sentient beings living in other places in our universe. I'm sure you know that, I mean there can't be much controversy about this anymore. Our explorations of outer space show us that there are billions and billions of stars around which revolve trillions and trillions of planets. And most recently we've been told by physicists that in fact our universe is not a singular reality but one of a universe of universes. In other words, we don't live in a universe we live in a multiverse. So the chances of our being the only intelligent life in this incomprehensibly, unfathomably, enormous ultimate reality are one in a septakajillion. Or to put it another way, impossible. That is the next piece of information we are given in Conversations with God. We are told that many of the entities living elsewhere are highly evolved beings. Further, we are told in book four of the Conversations with God series that these highly evolved beings are living in a way that is far more advanced socially, psychologically and spiritually than the way most people are living on Earth, and that they are actually helping us move forward in our own evolutionary process. The text of book four then offers us a list of 16 major differences in the behaviors of awakened beings and beings, like us, who are living in an unawakened state. That list, that list of 16 differences forms the basis of this program. I'm going to share that list with you now so you can have a quick peek at where you'll be going in the days ahead, at the challenges you'll be facing, and the behaviors you'll be embracing if you accept the invitation we'll be placing before you here, okay. Are you ready? All right. Here are the 16 differences in the behaviors of highly evolved beings and human beings living in an unawakened state. And awakened species sees the unity of all of life and lives into it. Humans in an unawakened state often deny it or ignore it. Number two, an awakened species tells the truth, always. Humans in an unawakened state too often lie to themselves as well as others. Number three, an awakened species says one thing and will be what they say. Humans in an unawakened state often say one thing and do another. Number four, an awakened species having seen and acknowledged what is so will always do what works. Humans in an unawakened state often do the opposite. Number five, an awakened species does not embrace a principle in its civilization that correlates with the concepts that we refer to as justice and punishment. Number six, an awakened species does not embrace a principle in its civilization that correlates with the concept that humans refer to as insufficiency. Number seven, an awakened species does not embrace a principle in its civilization that correlates with the concept that humans refer to as ownership. Number eight, an awakened species shares everything with everyone. Humans in an unawakened state often do not, only sharing with others in limited circumstances. Number nine, an awakened species creates a balance between technology and cosmology, between machines and nature. Humans in an unawakened state often do not. Number 10, an awakened species would never, under any circumstances, terminate the current physical expression of another sentient being unless asked directly by that other being to do so. Humans in an unawakened state often kill other humans without that other human requesting them to. Number 11, an awakened species would never do anything that could potentially damage or harm the physical environment that supports the members of that species when they are physicalized. Humans in an unawakened state often do so. Number 12, an awakened species never poisons itself. Humans in an unawakened state often do so. Number 13, an awakened species never competes. Humans in an unawakened state are often in competition with each other. Number 14, an awakened species is clear that it needs nothing. Humans in an unawakened state often create a need-based experience. Number 15, an awakened species experiences and expresses unconditional love for everyone. Humans in an unawakened state often cannot imagine even a deity who does this, much less do they do it themselves. And finally number 16, an awakened species harnesses the power of metaphysics. Humans in an unawakened state often, largely ignore it. Okay, that's the list. Do you think that you can make those behavioral changes? Are you ready and willing to try to make those changes? Your answer to both questions could change your life forever.

====================

LESSON 3: Understanding the Purpose of Life
--------------------
<v ->Physical life offers the soul the opportunity</v> to not only know that it is divine, but to express it. Many people call this process self-realization, and it is that for which every soul yearns. It is that for which every life yearns. It's what makes birds, fish, and even the tiniest insects migrate thousands of miles, what makes ocean waves roar with majestic power on thousands of beaches, what makes stars shoot silently and stunningly across thousands of light years in the night sky. It is God not simply knowing itself, but expressing the wonder and the glory of divinity. And to do so consciously, deliberately, intentionally is the privilege of humanity and of all sentient beings in the universe. Sentience is the gift of God's presence in the fullness of self-awareness. There's no better way I could describe it. This is what makes life sacred. I was told in the Conversations with God dialogue that there are what we would call three realms in the kingdom of heaven. The realm of the spiritual, the realm of the physical, and the realm of pure being. We too migrate, moving between realms in a never-ending cycle that we have called the eternal journey of the soul. It's a remarkable journey, no less spectacular than any other expression of life in which we turn our knowing of divinity into our expression of divinity, our concept of God into our experience of God, our contemplation of the divine into our actually being divine. This is a process of which we never tire. And if you can't imagine never tiring of the same thing, think of loving and being loved. It's the same over and over again and all we want is more of it. The process that I've been describing eventually changes us from one who is spending most of one's time doing to one who is spending most of one's time being. This shift is what some people have called transformation. I've said before that the largest percentage of the world's people are spending the largest percentage of their time on things that don't matter. And given what we now understand to be the agenda of the soul, this observation is right on the mark. Self-realization is not achieved through what an individual is doing, but through what we are being while we're doing whatever we are doing. Divinity is a state of being, not an action. An action may show what we're being, but it's what we are being that produces the action, not the other way around. Sadly and perhaps because the human species is so very young most people don't know this. And so most humans are spending their time focused on what they are doing. They believe that it is what they are doing that will bring them happiness. They believe that it is what they were doing that will produce fulfillment. Many even believe it is what they are doing that will put them in God's good graces and allow them to be welcomed back into the kingdom of heaven. Yet what your soul is not focused on is what you are doing for a living. It's not concerned with what activity fills up the days and times of your life. It uses your body and your mind as tools with which to produce ample and rich opportunities to reflect a state of being that expresses divinity. You understand, yes, that you're not really your body. Your body is something you have, it's not something you are. It's the same with your mind. It is the soul of you that is who you are. And the soul's agenda is to be in its experience what it is in ultimate reality. So when I use the phrase "state of being" I'm referring to a quality or an essence that characterizes the energy that is projected from you into the universe at any given moment. Is this more often than not a quality or attribute that you would describe as divine? If you could recreate yourself anew in the next, grandest version of who you are in every moment would the state of being that you inhabit and project when you are doing whatever you are doing be described by you as your highest self? To remind you of what was said earlier in this Quest, Conversations with God tells us that the whole purpose of life is to, remember those 25 words, recreate yourself anew in each golden moment of now in the next, grandest version of the greatest vision ever you held about who you are. Of course you can't do that if you don't have a vision of who you are, or if your vision of who you are is all wrapped up in what you do in your life. What no one ever told us until now is that your divinity has nothing to do with your profession. You can play first base for the New York Yankees or first chair violin for the Vienna Philharmonic Orchestra. You could be a baker in China or a maker of China in Bakersfield. You can be His Holiness the Pope in Rome or roam the world to create holiness through some job or career, occupation or activity. The agenda of your soul is and always will be about who you are being, not what you are doing. I know that I'm making this point over and over again, but I'm doing so on purpose for a reason. This is the central issue in all of life. This is the pivotal proposition to be placed before you every day, indeed in every minute of every day of your life. I was invited in the dialogue of Conversations with God to ask myself a single probing question. Whenever I'm about to do anything, whether I'm about to do something large like make a career change or something small like just go out for the evening or take in a movie, whether I'm about to say something that is important to someone who is important in my life or to share something unimportant to a stranger on the street. Whether I'm about to read a book or watch television or listen to a song on the music app on my cell phone, whatever it is that I'm about to do, anything at all I'm invited to ask myself this question. And what does this have to do with the agenda of your soul? I've come to call this life's magic question. It's a question the answer to which can create a context for everything that I think, say, and choose to be. And now listen up because what I'm going to say here is significant. It's critical that you become aware that what you are being is a choice. Are you being happy? Are you being sad? Are you being joyful? Are you being angry? Are you being compassionate, constructive, and caring? Are you being critical, corrosive, and condescending? What are you being and why? Many people think that what they're being is something over which they have little or no control. They see it as a reaction to something that is occurring, yet what you are being can be a decision, not a reaction. I created a device, a little mechanism that I use to make that last statement real in my life. I like to use it to show myself how easy it is when I think about it to choose a state of being arbitrarily to be something simply because I decide to be. Here's what I do to demonstrate this to myself: I take out a piece of paper and I make seven columns on the page. Then I draw three lines across those columns which produce what I call the grid. At the head of each column I write a day of the week. At the far left of the lines going across I write the time of day, morning, afternoon, or evening. Then in each of the squares on this makeshift calendar I write a one-word state of being. It could be creative, helpful, happy, inspiring, uplifting, or whatever state of being that I think I might like to adopt for that time period. Now what I've done here is decide ahead of time rather than after something has happened what I want to be during that morning, afternoon, or evening. I try to think of what kinds of things might be taking place on those days during those times based on my appointment calendar. Then I pick ways of being that would compliment or enhance the experiences I expect to encounter. Once in a while I might choose a way of being that has nothing at all to do with my scheduled activity, just do it as an experiment just to see if I can be what I choose to be no matter what's going on around me. This is a great exercise that stretches my mood muscles. The mental discipline that this process takes helps me to train myself to step into aspects of divinity at will. Between using the grid and asking myself life's magic question, I've got a couple of tools that can turn my concept of myself into my experience of myself at the snap of a finger. Now, here is today's assignment.

====================

LESSON 4: Reflect & Digest - The Choice of Being

N/A

====================

LESSON 5: Behavior #1: Unity
--------------------
<v ->The fact that a majority of human beings</v> deny the unity of all of life is not a small thing. I believe, in fact, that the idea that everything is separate from everything else is the greatest obstacle to the rapid expansion of human potential and the rapid forward movement of human evolution. An awakened species sees the unity of all of life and lives into it. Humans in an unawakened state often deny it or ignore it. Right now, most people who believe in God, and that is, by the way, the largest number of people on the planet, still embrace a separation theology, this is a way of looking at God which declares that we are over here and God is over there. The story of separation had its origin in the first attempts of our species to understand that the life we are experiencing is what it is, what we call self-consciousness arose when we began to see, or to know ourselves, individually. Perhaps it was seeing our reflection in a cave-side pool that sparked this perception, we raised a hand to scratch our head and saw the man in the pool doing the exact same thing and soon we began to conceive of the self. The next step in producing the perception of separation came, perhaps, as we sat around a campfire with our clan and found ourselves startled by a sudden flash of lightning in the sky, followed by a booming clap of thunder, we looked around anxiously and we asked everyone at the campfire by whatever way we could, whatever facial expression or sounds we made, did you do that? And when everyone in the clan shook their head in a panicked no, we came to a startling awareness, there's something else out there, something other than us. This something other also seemed far more powerful than us, it could cause wind and rain and violent storms, heat and dry spells that lasted forever, a frightening shaking and even an opening of the very ground on which we walked, it could even start fires in the forest all by itself. It became clear to us that we needed to find a way to control this something other or our lives would forever be at its mercy, yet we could not conceive of or imagine a way that we could do this. We tried everything, we knew we had to find a way to appease the Gods, we didn't call the elements of life Gods of course, that word came along at a much later time, but we did think of this something other as an aspect of our existence that was both powerful and uncontrollable. We experienced some memories of our clan, by the way, in exactly the same way, the biggest and the strongest and the most brutish among us ran rampant through the collective lives of the clan and efforts were continually made to appease them. They were often brought offerings of every kind, from nubile virgins to plentiful food to beautiful things from the richest of the earth. Once, when the most brutish among us became more sullen and angry than usual, because of an unending drought that had occurred and the sacrifices it imposed on them, we joined others in our small group to do whatever we could think of to calm them down lest they take out their anger on us, which they had done before. We threw a campsite party, and we sang and danced for them, someone in the group tore a dying branch from a nearby tree and shook it as part of his dance, its dry leaves making a rhythmic matching sound in order to catch the vibrations as he twirled around the fire. As it happens, at that exact moment, can you believe this? As it happens, at that exact moment, the sky is opened up, the drought was over, a sudden rain drenched the site, everyone was shocked, and given the limited intellectual development of the clan at the time, the dance with the branch was credited with having produced the water from the sky. A way had been found to please and appease something other, a way had been found to get something other to do as we asked, everyone was so excited, the rain man was elevated to a position of highest status, ritual and a class, a class of people who performed it was created. The clan believed that the dance with the branch by the rain man actually created the rain and so it did in the future, more often than not. And by the way, this was not by coincidence, metaphysics being what it is, the formula worked, for the metaphysical process, whether modern or ancient, produces in physicality whatever is fervently believed that it will produce. In that first instance it was, no doubt, the ongoing fervent hope, the deeply earnest wish of the clan, that the drought would end and this generated that result, but the coincidence of the rain falling at the exact moment that the noisy dance was performed could hardly be ignored, so the two were put together and formed a false conclusion. Now the narrative I've just shared is, of course, all of my imagining, it was a vision of what might have been, a fanciful insight perhaps, maybe even an inspiration of the possible that I received years ago, the entire story could be unreal, but I believe that either this or something very similar to this is what occurred in the early life of human beings and what produced our sense of separation, our sense of something other and our sense that there might be, after all, a way of at least influencing that something other. To me it seems clear that the earliest humans were dealing with the alchemy of the universe without knowing it, thus was born what later came to be called Religion. As our species grew more sophisticated in its understandings, we sought a more sophisticated way of seeking to appease the Gods and later, the single God that the vast majority of us ultimately decided must surely exist. We were, of course, right about that, a single God does exist, not a multiplicity of Gods, but our idea about God that is something other is what was inaccurate. That first conceptualization was in our not yet fully developed minds is what created what I have called Separation Theology. Now this idea that we are over here, that God is over there, would not really matter if it began and ended there, but the problem with a separation theology is that it produces, too often in too many people, a separation cosmology, that is a way of looking at all of life, that says everything is separate from everything else. This wouldn't be so bad if it was just a point of view, but the problem is that a separation cosmology produces, too often in too many people, a separation psychology. That is, a psychological viewpoint that says I'm over here and you're over there. This would also be something we could live with if this was all there was to it, but the problem is that a separation psychology produces a separation sociology. That is, a way of socializing with each other that encourages everyone within human society to act as separate entities serving their own separate interests. Now we've entered into truly dangerous territory, because a separation sociology inevitably produces a separation pathology. That is, pathological behaviors of self-destruction, engaged in individually and collectively and producing suffering, conflict, violence and death by our own hands, evidenced everywhere on our planet throughout human history. Only when our separation theology is replaced by a oneness theology will our pathology be healed, a oneness theology recognizes that we have been differentiated from God, but not separated from God, even as the fingers of our hand are differentiated but not separated from the hand itself. Humanity is now being invited to understand that all of life is one thing, it is the first step, it is the jumping off point, it is the beginning of the end of how things are today, it is the start of a new creation, a new tomorrow, this is the new cultural story of humanity. Here is a statement from Conversations with God that I invite you to internalize. Oneness is not a characteristic of life, life is a characteristic of oneness. Let me repeat that, I said, oneness is not a characteristic of life, life is a characteristic of oneness. This is what we have not understood about our existence on earth, the understanding of which would change everything. Life is the expression of oneness itself, God is the expression of life itself, God and life are one, you are a part of life, you do not stand and cannot stand outside of it, therefore you are a part of God, it is a circle that cannot be broken. I believe that when we begin acting in harmony with this truth, our entire experience of life will be altered forever, there will, in fact, be war no more. That will not be simply a song lyric, violence in all forms will disappear, depravity and insufficiency will end, abject suffering and poverty will vanish, cruelty will become unthinkable, insufficiency insupportable, indignity unacceptable, starvation impossible and intolerance intolerable. We will have civilized civilization at last. What are the implications of adopting oneness as a way of being in humanity's collective and individual daily life? Well, let me share some thoughts about that, we would probably not let 842 million people, that's one in eight in the world, go to bed hungry tonight, much less would we allow 656 children to die every hour on this planet of starvation, we would probably not make over three billion people have to survive on less than $2.50 a day, we would probably not let 1.7 billion people go without clean water or 1.6 billion people, a quarter of humanity, live without electricity or 2.6 exist without basic sanitation, that's right, over 2.6 billion people today do not have indoor bathrooms. These conditions exist because we think that we are over here and all those other people are over there. The day we embrace the truth that we are all one, all of this could disappear, we would not allow anyone else to be forced to live under conditions that we would never allow ourselves to be subjected to, we would, in fact, do unto others as we would, no doubt, have it done unto us, because we would realize that there are no others, that there is only us, that we are all one. Let me tell you about the I Am tool, this is a little strategy that someone gave me nearly 20 years ago to help me embrace the notion and to absorb the reality that I am one with everyone. It was a spiritual mentor of mine who suggested that I take a 20-minute walk down the street every day for 30 days and say silently inside of my head three words every time my eyes landed on something, it didn't matter what I happened to be looking at, she said, whatever I caught a glimpse of, I was to say to myself, I am that. I am that tree, I am that flower, I am that trash bin, I am that person who's acting very badly, I am that person who's doing something very wonderful. I was to challenge myself to identify everything I saw with myself, everything that I encountered. The point of the exercise was to see if I could identify any part of me, even a tiny, almost hidden aspect of myself, that I was observing in someone or something else. Was I seeing something beautiful? Was there something beautiful in me? Was I seeing something not so beautiful? Was there something not so beautiful in me? Could I remember feeling what another person seemed to be feeling when they were doing something very nice? Could I remember feeling what another person was feeling when they seemed to be doing something that was not so nice? How willing and able was I to find in myself what I was finding in another? This turned out, for me, to be a truly fascinating test of whether I understood what it meant to say, we are all one. I did this for 30 days and I can tell you that it changed my experience of other people and of the world outside of me. I became much less judgmental of other people, places and things and I became much more loving and accepting of myself as well, so I wanted to end this installment by sharing that tool with you. Now, here is today's assignment.

LESSON 7: Behavior #2: Truth
--------------------
<v ->We're going to take a quick look today at the second</v> of the 16 behaviors that define the difference between highly evolved beings and humans who are living and in an unawakened state. This is a behavior that, if all of humanity were to adopt it, would change the world for the better in a hundred ways overnight, and what is fascinating about this is that no one disagrees. The fact that it would change life for the better for everyone is obvious to everyone. Then why don't we just do it? Why don't we adopt this behavior? Fear. We're simply afraid to. So let's look at the behavior we're talking about here, and then let's see what this fear is all about. An awakened species tells the truth always. Humans in an unawakened state often lie to themselves, as well as to others. Now, that might seem like a fairly agreeable idea, don't you think? Yet, truth as a lifestyle, I'm talking about absolute truth, about everything all the time, in politics, in economics, in business, in relationships, in every social interaction, in all human encounters of any kind. That's not something that anyone on this planet is used to. On the contrary, we're used to being lied to, and most of us are used to lying to ourselves. Hopefully, our lies are not big lies. Hopefully, they're harmless lies, what we call little white lies, having to do with why we can't make it to a birthday party or calling in sick for work when we're perfectly healthy, but there are a very few of us who have never told a single lie in our entire life. In fact, there's an old joke that says if you claim to have never lied one time in your entire life, you're lying, and you may not even know it. That's the insidious thing about lying. Some people believe what they say when they lie. They want it to be true so badly that they forget the real truth and embrace the fabrication as their reality. Then there are those who engage in lies of omission, in which it isn't what they say but what they don't say that deceives others. Now along comes Conversations with God Book 4, Awaken the Species to make clear once again, that what we have heard a thousand times from a hundred different sources throughout the years, is true. Lying is not an acceptable behavior in any species of truly evolved beings. Not even lying about things that don't matter or telling little white lies that we think will save someone else's feelings is okay. First of all, there's no such thing as things that don't matter. If they did it matter, there'd be no reason to lie about them. As for saving someone's feelings, the person whose feelings we're trying to save is usually us. It's we who do not want to feel the discomfort or the awkwardness that often comes from telling the truth, and if we really think we're trying to protect the feelings of another, somebody should tell us that few things are more hurtful to others than finding out they've been lied to, which by the way most people inevitably do sooner or later. Now, what Conversations with God proposed 20 years ago is what is being proposed in this Quest today. It's a new worldwide social standard captured in two words. Total visibility. I've spoken about this before in lectures, articles, and interviews around the world, and I have included it in this program because I know that this is the only way to live a life of integrity that produces the highest mutual benefit for everyone. So let's examine this idea of transparency as a lifestyle and the difference between transparency and truth. Conversations with God has something quite astonishing to say about truth. It says that there is no such thing as objective and, therefore, absolute truth. All truth, CWG says, is subjective. That is, it is true only in the eyes of the observer, and now, modern science has taken this one step further. Quantum physics tells us that nothing that is observed is unaffected by the observer. This means that the very act of looking at something creates an impression in our mind, which is unique and individual and experienced in precisely a certain way only by us. Well, here's something that is both remarkable and fascinating about that. The effect is circular. In other words, how our mind perceives something, how we think about something sends energy to the thing that we are thinking about, and that this energy affects and impacts the thing about which we are thinking in such a way that it becomes more and more a reflection of our thoughts about it. This is what metaphysics. This is when metaphysics. This is how metaphysics. This is why metaphysics. This is where metaphysics takes over from quantum physics. This is the place where you become the creator of your own reality. So let's be clear as we discuss truth and transparency, that the two are not one in the same. Truth is your subjective perception. Transparency is defined as total openness and complete honesty about the reality that has been created by subjective truth. Now, with this as our understanding, we see that there are five levels of truth telling, and you can engage in total visibility and complete transparency at any one or all of these levels. First, you can tell your truth to yourself about yourself. Then you can tell your truth about yourself to another. At the third level, you tell your truth about yourself to another. Then you tell you truth about another to that other, and finally, you tell your truth to everyone about everything. The first level of truth telling was the hardest for me. There was a part of me that did not want to hear the truth about myself, least of all from myself. As long as I could avoid admitting to myself that the criticisms and observations of others about me were true, I could go on with my life and be happy with myself. Yet, how could I continue if I wants to acknowledge within my own heart and mind, that I was behaving exactly as others said it was behaving, that I was doing exactly what others said I was doing, and that I was very much the person that others said I was. So yes, level one was the most difficult for me. Yet once I mastered it, my whole life changed. I found that most of the pain of my life had been caused by my holding on to my illusions about myself and not by letting them go, and when my false image of myself began to drop away, I could start directing all the energy I had been using to hold it together toward others toward much more useful pursuits, as well. Then I faced the next big test, telling the truth to myself about another. You would think this would be easy, but not so. I found that I had been holding out on myself, refusing to admit or acknowledge what my true feeling about another really was, and I discovered that I had a number of reasons for doing this. In some cases, I simply didn't want to own the feelings I was experiencing but not naming it because I had convinced myself that it was very not okay to feel that way. I saw myself as a bad person for having such feelings, so I pretended that I didn't have those feelings or that they were just passing feelings that meant nothing. In this way, I found myself in self-denial. In other cases, I didn't want to come to grips with my true feelings about another because I was afraid that doing so would force me to reveal them to that other person. So I figured as long as I could hide them from myself, I could hide them from the other, and the reason I wanted to hide them from the other was often complex. Sometimes, as I said before, I felt as though I really didn't want to hurt the other person's feelings, but the fact is it was my own best interests that I did not want to threaten. So I had to work hard to get to my true sentiments, even just with myself. Looking at this closely after I was told in Conversations with God about the five levels of truth telling, I found that I had fallen into a pattern of sharing my true feelings with another with every person except that other. In other words, I went around talking to everyone else about my feelings except the person I was talking about. I did this under the guise of getting advice. The truth is I was simply offloading the energy generated by my feelings, which allowed me to get through another couple of weeks or days without carrying them around inside of me, but finally, it got to the point where the heaviness was just too great. I was actually making myself sick by not sharing what was in my heart directly with the person that I was having those feelings about. I had to come clean. I had no choice. I had to come clean, first with myself, fully and completely, and then with the other. This brought me to the third and fourth levels of truth telling, which was to tell the truth about myself to another and then to tell my truth about another to that other. I found the third level surprisingly easy and the fourth level surprisingly hard. Adopting truth telling at level three, I began telling the truth about myself to anyone who ever asked, to anyone who had a need to know. I told them about my past, my present, my hopes for the future. I told them about my successes and my failures, my wins and my losses, my ups and my downs, my joys and my sorrows. I told them about the times I got things right and the times I got things wrong, the things about which I was correct and things about which I was mistaken, the things about which I was proud, and the things about which I was ashamed. Now, I obviously didn't just blurt all this stuff out the moment that I met someone, but I did find myself being utterly transparent with others when, as I said, they had a need to know, a reason to know something about me we or when I had a need to tell them something that I thought was important for them to know about me. As I said, this all came fairly easily to me. I wish I could say the same thing about level four, telling the truth about another to that other. This level turned out to be the next biggest challenge for me, and here's what most interesting about that. It wasn't the telling of my truth about another that was so difficult. It was finding a way to do that with love and understanding, gentleness and compassion. I had to learn to tell my truth softly, gently, nicely with sensitivity to the feelings of others and to the situation and circumstance in which I found myself. There was a master teacher whom I had the privilege of knowing while he was still alive who used to say speak your truth but soothe your words with peace. I don't think I've ever developed that skill at the highest level. I'm working on it as hard and as fast as I can, and I want to always be truth telling at level five, tell the truth to everyone about every thing all the time. How about you? Do you want to help change the world? You can start by continuing to employ the five levels of truth telling. I use the word continuing there because I'm sure that you already have begun this process. You've already started this work, so here are some things you might want to consider as you continue on the path of transparency, things that you may want to think about doing if you're not already doing these things. If you run a business, tell your employees exactly what everyone else is making, including benefits and severance packages. Tell your customers exactly what your products or services are costing you to provide. Give them two figures on every price tag, our cost, your price. If you're in a relationship, tell your significant other everything you think they need to know so that you are not holding five cards to their four. Is there something you have not shared, something you have not said? What, if anything, are you holding back? If you're in government, tell your constituents the real reasons behind all of your choices or your agency's decisions. Reveal everything. Hold back nothing. Just tell the truth. If you made a mistake, admit it. If you changed your mind, say so. If you lost the election because of it, so what? Better to lose an election than your own integrity, yes? If you're in education, teach your students all there is to know, in an age-appropriate way, on all the subjects that the class is exploring. Don't give them one side of a story or a bended view of history or only that part of the data that supports your particular point of view. Bring your classroom a rare brand of intellectual integrity. Allow your students to think, rather than telling them how to think or what to think. If you're a rabbi or a minister, a priest or an ulema, tell the whole truth about God. Open up your rituals. Throw wide the doors of your temples and mosques, churches, and places of worship. Admit that it is possible, just possible that there's something that we don't fully understand here about God and about life, the understanding of which could change everything. Whatever you do, don't tell those who are listening to you and looking to you for answers that you have the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth so help you God. Don't tell them that it is your belief system which provides all of the answers, every single one of them. Throw the door open to honest inquiry. Pull up the shades. Let the sunshine in. Whatever your job or occupation, whatever your position or station in life, speak openly and forthrightly in every moment to every person. Practice total visibility and utter transparency all the days of your life. So here's your assignment for today.

LESSON 9: Behavior #3: The Say and Do Congruence
--------------------
<v ->The next behavior you're being invited to adopt</v> is something that as with some of the other behaviors in this quest, you may already be doing. If it is, take this time as your opportunity to move up to the next level in its implementation. Almost all of us can move one level up on all of these challenges, so here's the challenge for today. An awakened species says one thing and will do what they say. An unawakened species often says one thing and will do another. Now you might not see yourself in this second category, and if you're truly not, you can use this day to recommit to staying in the first category, to always be someone who says one thing and does in every single case, every single time, exactly what you said you would do and exactly how you said you would do it, unless of course there's some overriding reason why you can't, in which case you would act in good faith to see if you can change any agreement you have made that may involve another person, rather than simply breaking the agreement. The reason that Highly Evolved Beings do what they say with great purpose and say what they're going to do with great clarity is that the very basis of their being is total integrity. They conceive of themselves as being the out picturing of total reliability. The result is that when they make a promise to themselves, they know without a doubt that they're going to keep that promise. If they make an internal commitment about something, they know they're going to hold to that commitment to the letter. When they talk to themselves, correct themselves, admonish themselves, encourage or praise themselves, they know that they're not speaking empty words that could wind up being ignored and meaning nothing. They know that their words carry a certainty. They know that they can count on themselves to mean what they say and say what they mean. Highly Evolved Beings understand that reliability is the foundation of all functional civilization. It is therefore of primary importance to them to be known as beings who are dependable, steadfast, and stable, who keep their word when they give it, follow through on an offer when they make it, and stand by an idea when they share it, and who live by their truth when they announce it. It's clear to even the casual observer that the civilization on Earth is not quite like that, and one of the reasons is that so many human beings sometimes say one thing and do another. Why? Why do we do this? We do it because the largest number of humans move through their lives in an unawakened state and are therefore functioning at the lowest of the three levels of awareness. The result is that we often speak in terms of what we hope rather than what we know. Conversations with God teaches us that there are three levels of awareness, hope, faith, and knowing. Some teachers talk about expanding your awareness, but they are actually referring to consciousness raising. In strictest terms, an expansion or growth of your awareness is not possible. Awareness doesn't expand because you've experienced it. It is what it is, and it doesn't grow larger and larger. That's because your awareness rests within your soul, and your soul does not get bigger or in some way become more than it always was, is now, and always will be. It is your mind's attention that expands as a result of where you place it. To bring this down to one sentence, awareness rests in the soul, and attention resides in the mind. So the idea is to direct your mind to pay greater attention to your soul's awareness. It's one thing to be aware, but it's another thing altogether to pay attention to what your soul is aware of instead of ignoring it, which many people do much of the time. The process of mixing the two, of blending the mind's total attention to the soul's total awareness is what is most accurately called consciousness raising. When your mind pays attention to your soul and your mind and your soul thus carry the same data, hold the same idea, and possess the same perspective, you can be said to be fully conscious. So in real terms, it is consciousness that is expanding as the awareness held in your soul comes to the attention of your mind. Let's look at these three levels of awareness on the pathway by which your soul may experience a higher level, a higher state of consciousness, because understanding these three levels will help you to never again say one thing and do another. Like, I'm going on a diet beginning next week. Or, that's it, I've had my last drink. Or, I'll be glad to help you move out of your apartment. What you say every single time will be what you do without exception. The three levels of awareness again are hope, faith, and knowing. It's important to identify which level of awareness you're functioning at when you make promises, promises to yourself or to another. Hope is the first level of awareness. Now I've heard hope described as the energy that runs between the eyes and the tail of a dog. Hope is a wonderful energy. It's my wish that you never abandon hope, because it produces, initiates, and sponsors all sorts of positive actions, choices, and decisions, and generates enthusiasm and excitement along the way. Having said that, we note that it is only the first stop on the path to higher consciousness. And why isn't it the last stop? Because hope is a place where we openly acknowledge that something may or may not happen. If we're sure that something is so, we have no need to hope that it's so. A person who hopes is a person who wonders whether what she is he is hoping for will come about. This is not a sense of assurance. This is a sense of wishfulness, a sense of optimism that it could happen, and that's good. That means that one hasn't given up hope. One hasn't said to oneself, there's no hope, there's no chance in the world. Yet hope is the weakest energy in the process by which outcomes are created. Again, this doesn't mean that it's ineffective or a useless energy, but simply that there are even stronger energies that God has given us to work with as we seek to create what we say that we are going to create. Faith is the second level of awareness. Faith is not about wondering whether something will occur, or thinking that it could occur. It's about feeling sure that it will happen. This is a quantum leap from wishing or hoping. It's a much higher energy, a much more powerful one. If we think of energy as a magnet, a tool that draws certain outcomes and experiences to us, then faith has more pulling power than hope by a factor of 10. It strongly pulls outcomes to us from the contextual field in which all outcomes exist. What my friend Deepak Chopra calls the field of infinite possibilities. Speaking metaphorically, faith lies inside the state of awareness, but not at the center of it, yet we have crossed the border of doubt, and that's very good. We have come a long way, and we long ago left the place of wondering or conjecturing or speculating about outcomes. We have faith that particular outcomes will ensue, meaning that we trust that they will. We hold a conviction that they will. We have confidence that they will, and this generates a higher level of optimism about it. Still, faith is an announcement that there remains the possibility that a particular outcome may not materialize. It's important to understand that trust, which is faith by a different name, is well, it's not necessarily in the space of a certainty. The definition of faith is complete trust in someone or something, and the definition of trust is a firm belief in something or someone, yet belief is still a belief. It's not absolute certainty. Believing is one thing. Knowing is another. A person should not have to trust or believe that the outcome of a particular event will turn out right. They should be certain, so certain of it, that trust is not even part of the equation, and belief has long ago been left behind, having given away to simply knowing it. Let me give you an example of how all this works, from my personal life, so I can make these conceptualizations real. As I make this video, I've been happily married for 10 years. You see, I know that my wife loves me unconditionally, and my wife knows that I love her unconditionally. We don't hope that we love each other unconditionally. We don't have faith that we love each other unconditionally. We know that we love each other unconditionally. Wishing that this is true is not part of our experience. Neither is trusting that it's true. We have an experience of knowing that it's true, and this is what I mean when I say that knowing is the highest level of awareness. When you reach this level of awareness about everything that's important in your life, you'll find yourself saying one thing and doing exactly what you say every single time, for a good reason. You'll be watching what you say much more closely than ever, making sure that your words never reflect what you hope will occur, but always reflect what you know will occur, not what you have faith is true, but what you know is true. This is how you create people knowing, not hoping or having faith, but knowing that they can rely on you, and this is how you create knowing that you can rely on yourself. This last level of awareness is the most powerful place that a person could ever be. Here is found a perfect peace. Here is found a gentle joy. Here is found the kind of deep assurance that births total tranquility and sacred serenity. This is not about feeling sure about what you say. It's about being positive. There's a difference. The initiate hopes. The student has faith. The master knows. And the master's level of awareness includes a certainty that all outcomes are perfect just as they are, exactly as they arise, precisely as they present themselves, and the master knows this because the master understands that all outcomes in the physical world are co-created, collaboratively manifested, jointly produced to exactly serve the agenda of every soul in every situation in every moment in every place in all the when wheres of existence, to borrow a marvelous phrase from author Robert Hinely. Okay, I said a lot here. The sincere seeker traveling the pathway to awareness may now be expected to say, you know, I now have these questions. How do I get to this last level you describe? Can I hopscotch across the first two, or do I have to go through a process step by step? The answer is yes, you can go straight to knowing. It's not necessary to stop at hope or faith any more than it's necessary to step on every rung of a ladder to get to the top, but this can sometimes make the climb easier. So let it be okay with you if you're not at the place of absolute knowing yet, or if you've found yourself there and then found yourself not there, and then there again, and then not there again. That's been my experience, and that's okay with me. Every time I arrive at the place of knowing, I stay a little longer. I know that one day I'll arrive there and never again leave. I know that I will. I don't hope that I will, and I don't have faith that I will. I know that I will, and so I will. And while I'm on this journey of the soul, I work very hard to mean what I say and do what I say, and never again say one thing or do another, not even with the promise that I made to myself, which of course is the easiest promise to break. And if some circumstance makes it absolutely impossible for me to do what I said I was going to do, I mean if I simply can't keep a promise for some really good reason, a very valid reason, not a flimsy one, I will do whatever I can, as I said earlier, to make sure that I stay in integrity by asking, if the promise involves somebody else, if I can revise my agreement in a way that allows everyone to win. I try never to break an agreement, but only to change it in a way that will allow me to keep it. Then I know I can rely on myself and others can rely on me, and that's not a small step in my personal transformation. So, here now is your assignment for today.

LESSON 10: Reflect & Digest - The Say and Do Congruence

LESSON 11: Behaviour #4: Do What Works
--------------------
<v ->Hello.</v> Today's challenge is a bit unusual, a bit different from some of the others in the program because it's not about adopting a behavior, but about stopping one. Here's the statement that describes the challenge. An awakened species, having seen and acknowledged what is so, will always do what works. Humans in an unawakened state often do the opposite. Now when I first heard this in Conversations with God Book Four, Awaken the Species, I wasn't quite sure that I understood what was being communicated here, so I asked for some examples. Here's what came next at the dialogue. If your objective is to live a life of peace, joy, and love, violence does not work. This has already been demonstrated. If your objective is to live a life of good health and great longevity, consuming dead flesh daily, smoking known carcinogens continuously, and drinking gallons of nerve-deadening, brain-frying liquids like alcohol regularly does not work. This has already been demonstrated. If your objective is to raise offspring free of violence and rage, placing them directly in front of vivid depictions of violence and rage during their most impressionable years does not work. This has already been demonstrated. If your objective is to care for Earth and wisely husband her resources, acting as if those resources are limitless does not work. This has already been demonstrated. If your objective is to discover and cultivate a relationship with a loving deity, so that religion can make a difference in the affairs of humans, then teaching of a god of righteousness, punishment, and terrible retribution does not work. This has already been demonstrated. None of these things work, but our species keeps doing them anyway. Now I understand completely what was meant by the statement, an awakened species, having seen and acknowledged what is so, will always do what works. Humans in an unawakened state often do the opposite. I also came to an immediate understanding of why we so often do the opposite of what works. We have no idea what we're trying to do, I mean here on Earth. When, as a species, we don't know what we're trying to do, how can we make an assessment of what works? But we can't, of course, and that's why we don't. That's why we so often do the opposite of what works. We have no idea what we're doing here, what we're trying to accomplish, what our goal is as a species. What is your goal as an individual? You may find this hard to believe, but when I was a child just going into adolescence, I thought that the game of life went something like this. Get the car, get the job, get the girl, get the spouse, get the house, get the kids, get the better car, get the better job, get the better house, get the better spouse, get the better spouse, get the better spouse, get the office in the corner with your name on the door, get the gray hair, get the grandkids, get the retirement watch, get the cruise tickets, get the illness, and get the hell out. I know, I know, that sounds like a joke, but it's not really a joke. That's what I was observing all around me, and nobody seemed to know what the point of it all was. Nobody seemed to know what they were actually trying to achieve with all this stuff they were doing. Most human beings are just trying to get by, just trying to get through it all, without making too many mistakes along the way, trying to at least do what's right and not do what's wrong, but the problem is we don't even know what's right and wrong anymore. Surely, we think, surely there must be some guidepost, some standard or criteria, some yardstick with which we can measure or determine whether particular choices and behaviors are appropriate or inappropriate, good or bad, or are best taken or best ignored, but the difficulty and the problem is that our lives don't give us ideas of right and wrong that are clear to us. These ideas change from time to time, from place to place, and from culture to culture. The result is that when one person or culture says a thing is right, another person or culture says the exact same thing is wrong, and this is the source of more than a small or trivial amount of the conflict and violence, killing and war, that we have seen on the planet, much of it, ironically, in God's name. Not only can we not get clear, not be sure, not able to agree on what is right and wrong, we can't even agree to disagree about it. We don't even seem able to observe our differences and simply call them that. We apparently feel the need to make each other wrong for holding views different from our own. We can't even agree to explore the topics on which our beliefs diverge, with all possibilities on the table, with compromises at least considered. No, no, there can be no compromises when we are right. One does not compromise one's principles. One does not bargain with the devil. We have already demonized each other, so compromising with each other is seen as bargaining with the devil. So there you have it. We're left with our disagreements and our absolute inability to overcome them. Worse yet, we are left with our righteousness about it. We imagine that we are so right about what is right and wrong, that we're willing to belittle others, to criticize others, to persecute others, to judge and punish others, to attack others, and yes, even to kill others. All of which we would consider wrong if others did it to us. The interesting thing about right, of course, is that it's always on our side, so our model of the world leaves no room for discussion, no room for debate, no room for explorations of any possibility other than what we hold to be true, yet here's the great joke. Talk about jokes. Even God can't get things straight from one culture to the next, or from one moment in history to the next. In one culture, we are told that God said we are to take adulterers to the town gates and stone them to death. In another culture, we're told that God said to forgive people their sins and have mercy and never kill anyone deliberately. What then to do? How to resolve these kinds of contradictions? The answer is to build a new model of the world based on a new understanding, and that new understanding is that there is no such thing as right and wrong. There is only what works and what does not work, given what it is we are trying to do. This is what we are told in Conversations with God, and it offers us a daring and challenging new way to live. Our decisions and choices in life should have nothing to do with moral righteousness, but simple and practical effectiveness, given our agenda and our intention regarding the outcomes we wish to produce in our experience, and even that, we can and will disagree on, but at least we've taken the moral absolutes out of the equation. Substituting for them is simple observational inquiry. Is it working? Is what we have chosen to do working to produce the outcomes we say we wish to produce? Should results make a difference? Let that be our question for the day. Should results make a difference? Have are moral absolutes produced results? Have our beliefs brought peace to the world? Right now, very little of what we are doing on this planet is producing the outcomes for which they were designed. What is astonishing about this is not that this lack of desired results has occurred, but that it doesn't seem to make any difference to us that it has occurred. The utter lack of intended results is having no effect on the actions that we continue to take. Humanity doesn't seem to care. It would rather suffer unintended results, even results that work in direct opposition to what we say we wanted to experience, than to change its beliefs. What God is advising us to do is take a close look at what it is we are now intending to do in our world. Do we intend to create peace? Do we intend to produce prosperity? Do we intend to guarantee our safety and the safety and the security of others? Do we intend to generate the kind of life that can offer basic dignities to all? What are we trying to do here? And do we see any difference between what we say we're trying to achieve and what we're actually achieving? Are we capable as a community of sentient beings to admit and acknowledge to ourselves that how we are going about what we say we are intending to do is simply ineffective, and that it has been ineffective now for thousands of years? Do we really think that following the old rules from millennia ago about what is morally right and morally wrong is all that we need to do to create the kind of life on this planet that we say we wish to create? Which shall it be, morals or function? It is not morally wrong to head toward Italy if what you say you're trying to do is to get to Norway. It's simply functionally ineffective. We'd do well to not confuse morality with functionality. Things are not inherently right and wrong, and that is an idea we would benefit from releasing. So let me repeat it. Things are not inherently right or wrong. There is no evidence to suggest that people who play volleyball naked on the beach in the sunbathing community are somehow less moral in the eyes of God than people who wear coverings from head to toe and don't allow a single inch of their body to be seen by anyone outside the home for any reason or any time whatsoever. We have no reason to conclude that people who eat only vegetables are somehow morally more advanced or can be depended upon to make higher critical and spiritual choices than those who eat the flesh of dead creatures, such as Jesus, by the way, who apparently ate fish and gave away tons of it to people while he delivered his Sermon on the Mount. There is nothing in our experience to suggest that people who are gay are inherently, inevitably, and invariably morally, emotionally, intellectually, philosophically, and spiritually abysmal, while people who are not gay are inherently, inevitably, and invariably, morally, emotionally, intellectually, philosophically, and spiritually advanced. As absurd as these and other notions are, countless people call them truth and live by them. There are, they say, rules and regulations regarding proper behavior, and those who don't follow them are wrong for not doing so. This, however, leads to an interesting question. Could we survive without rules? Well, it turns out that sometimes the very lack of rules and regulations works better. Anyone who's ever driven around the Arc de Triomphe in Paris understands this perfectly. There are no pavement markings or traffic lays. There are no signs or signal lights, yet this is one of the busiest, most congested travel routes in the world. With hundreds of cars whizzing in and out of that circle every minute, and yet there's nothing at all to indicate where one is supposed to go, when one is supposed to go, what one is supposed to do, or how one is supposed to do it. People enter that wild conglomeration of vehicles at their own risk. I used to call it suicide circle, and that's the point. When they themselves are at risk, they take care of themselves and others. They don't need police. They don't need traffic lanes. They don't need painted signs, and they don't need flashing lights. They know what it is they're trying to do. They're trying to get to the other side of the circle in one piece. It's all very simple. When you know what it is you're trying to do, the preferable and beneficial action to take becomes instantly obvious and very clear to you. And as this Quest has made it clear, what you're trying to do, what you say you're doing here on Earth, your purpose in life is put into 25 words. Have you memorized them yet? The purpose of life is to, here come those 25 words again, recreate yourself anew in every golden moment of now, in the next grandest version of the greatest vision ever you held about who you are. That's why you came here. This is what we're trying to do. This is our spiritual journey. So today we get to ask ourselves, are we seeking to create the experience of divinity in, as, and through us, or are we merely trying to make it from birth to death with the least amount of damage or difficulty? Does our spiritual experience have anything to do with what works and what does not work in our life? Are we seeing what's so and doing what works, or are we ignoring both? Your challenge today is to ignore neither. So here is today's assignment.

LESSON 13: Behavior #5: Justice and Punishment
--------------------
<v ->I want to stop here for just a moment</v> before plunging into the next challenge, to just congratulate you on making it through the first week as you explore the differences between the behaviors of an awakened species and of humans in an unawakened state. Look, this has not been easy, this Quest, and I know that. So let me just give you a verbal hug or a pat on the back, well done! Good job. It's not easy to live your moments holding the consciousness of oneness with all others and with God. It's not easy to tell the truth to everyone about everything all the time, and it's not easy to say what you're going to do and then do it every single time. It's not easy to stop doing what clearly does not work in your life. To see what's so, and to do what works. These four behaviors alone could change your life. Actually, fully adopting even one of these behaviors is all it would take, all that would be required to create a new you. You can end this program with just that, right now and you would have transformed your entire experience. But this is not just about any program encouraging personal and spiritual development. This is a Quest. This is the next level up in such programs, and it's not going to end here. Indeed, it's going to get even tougher, even more challenging starting now with an extremely challenging topic. All on board? Okay. Here's today's guidance. An awakened species does not embrace a principle in its civilization that correlates with the concepts that humans refer to as justice and punishment. Now this would bring up for anybody a very fair question. How could any civilization live without a code of conduct that regulates their behavior? Can I, as an individual do so? The answer is that an awakened species self-regulates. In fact, the degree to which a species is living in an awakened state, and the degree to which you are living as an awakened person can actually be measured by the degree to which members of the species and you self-regulate. Do you have to have laws to stop you from doing harm to yourself and others? Do you have to have commandments to keep you in good graces with God? Do you have to be told what to do before you know what to do in critical moments and key situations? Have you come to understand and to honor your basic instinct? Let me explore that one item for just a moment because I think it deserves to be highlighted in a program such as this. Survival is the basic instinct of many chemical or biological life forms. It is what makes flowers turn to the sun. It's what makes birds and fish and even tiny insects migrate thousands of miles to warmer climates. It's what makes turtles recede into their shells. It's what makes lions roar and rattlesnakes shake their rattle. Survival is not, however, the basic instinct of human beings, nor of any sentient creatures in the cosmos. For such beings, the basic instinct is the expression and the experience of divinity. If your basic instinct was survival, you would run away from the flames of the burning building when you hear a baby crying inside. You wouldn't run into the building. But you do. You actually run into the building, because in that moment, survival is not the issue. Something deep inside of you, something you can neither name nor describe calls to you in such moments to act in accordance with the highest thought you ever had about who you really are. People have done this when interviewed by the media later, they never put it that way, of course. They decline to accept the label of hero. They say they've done what anybody would do. They say they simply acted on instinct. And they did. What they may not have known is that their basic instinct had nothing to do with survival. Perhaps to their own surprise, their actions actually defied survival. Yet, they had no fear. Not even a thought of fear in the instant they took action. Because who they really are knew that survival was not the issue. The question was not whether one will survive, but how one will act as long as one is still here. These become, in moments of self-realization, life's only inquiries. And in moments of self-realization, the mind and the soul answer as one, instantly. The trick then, in creating a transformed life, is to consider every moment a burning building moment. Then you will always act in accordance with the highest thought you ever had about who you really are. As a human, your basic instinct is in evidence, when the complete being that is you, is completely remembered, recreated, reintegrated, and reunited with divinity. Even as the tiniest cell within you is a member of your body, so is every element of physical life a member of the body of God. When the mind's experience and the soul's knowledge combine to produce expanded consciousness, human beings choose to experience themselves once again, as members of the body of God. They are thus said to have remembered themselves. They don't have to be told to run into the building to save the baby. They don't have to be ordered, or commanded. They self-regulate, and their actions do justice to their highest thoughts of acting out their highest impulse. The code of conduct of an awakened person and an awakened species is elegantly simple, self-regulate. Make every moment, to speak metaphorically, a burning building moment. Make every minute a minute in which your highest idea about yourself and about life is on the line. And in terms of your day-to-day hour-to-hour behaviors, do not have a thought regarding anyone, do not have a word regarding anyone, do not do a thing regarding anyone that you would not want thought, said, or done regarding you. This is, of course, not a new idea, every religion on the face of the Earth teaches some version of what has been called the Golden Rule. The difference between humans who are unawakened and entities who are fully awakened is that the second group actually applies this principle of reciprocity in their lives, rather than just giving it lip service. Now you might say that's all very nice, all this talk of self-regulation, but what happens if or when someone else does something to another that they would not like it if it were done to them, what happens when someone commits a crime? How does that work in this civilization of so-called Highly Evolved Beings? But here's the good news. There's no such thing as crime and punishment in the culture of an awakened species. And there will not be in our culture either when we are fully awakened. No one commits a crime in this society of fully awakened beings, because everyone understands that they're all one, and that an offense against another is going to be experienced as an offense against the self. There's no need for such a society to impose justice on its members, because justice will have already been done. If justice is payback for an action that someone has committed, one who lives in a civilization where the culture accepts and practices oneness, experiences justice immediately if they think, do, or say something negative regarding another. Because their level of empathy is so high they automatically experience themselves what they have caused another to experience. So you see the concept of justice in such a society is therefore deeply rooted into what you would call right action. Your challenge in today's quest is to know that justice is not something one experiences after one behaves a certain way, but because one behaves a certain way. Justice is an act, not punishment for an act. An awakened species understands this. The problem with our society is that we seek justice after an injustice has been done, rather than doing justice in the first place through the choices and actions of every single human being in every single moment. Again, for emphasis, justice is an action not a reaction. When everyone in our society acts justly as every entity in an awakened species does, we'll have no need for judgment and punishment as part of our civilization's moral constructions. The reason why justice and punishment need have no place in your thinking is that it is impossible for you to be hurt, damaged, or injured by anyone or anything given who you are, but it's not impossible to think that you have been. I invite you to consider that all sense of hurt, damage, or injury is a product of the mind. It has no basis in ultimate reality. Your true identity is that of an eternal being, an individuation of divinity, who even death cannot touch. When you know this as your innermost truth, when you live this as your highest reality, it will amaze you how little can actually impact you in a continuing negative way. Now I'm not going to sit here and try to convince you that you can't find yourself temporarily stepping into an illusion that you have been injured or hurt, but what I am going to say is that this is an illusion, and more than one person who has lived through such an experience has looked back on it months or years later, only to describe it as one of the best things that ever happened to them. Nothing in the event, nothing in what has occurred has changed, only their point of view about it has been altered. This shifted point of view has transformed their entire experience and the reality that they have created around it. People who have encountered such a transformation have found that they do not even feel the need to forgive the person or the people who have done something to them, by which they would have once felt damaged. They have come to understand at a deep level that forgiveness is not necessary. It's replaced in the process of divine balance with a more searingly powerful energy, understanding. This occurs as we understand that the person who offended us had no idea of who or what they are, and so they have acted like children in a temper tantrum. A lot of people like to think of humans as highly evolved. In fact, humanity has just emerged from its infancy on this planet. Did you know that? In their book, New World New Mind, Robert Ornstein and Paul Ehrlich placed this into perspective in one mind-boggling paragraph. "Suppose," they wrote, "that Earth's history "were charted on a single year's calendar, "with midnight January 1st representing "the origin of the Earth "and midnight December 31st representing "the present moment. "Then each day on Earth's year "would represent 12 million years of actual history. "On that scale, the first form of life, "a simple bacterium, would arise sometime in February. "More complex life-forms, however, come much later. "The first fishes appear around November 20th. "The dinosaurs arrive around December 10th "and disappear on Christmas Day. "The first of our ancestors recognizable as human "would not show up until the afternoon of December 31st. "Homo sapiens, our species, "would emerge at around 11:45 P.M. "And all that has happened in recorded history "would occur in the final minute of the year." Knowing this, God has no need to forgive us even if God could somehow be heard. And we have no need to forgive anyone else who we have allowed ourselves to imagine for a moment has hurt or damaged us. As we mature spiritually, we also come to yet one more understanding that makes forgiveness unnecessary. We understand that every act is an act of love. This is true categorically and without exception, now and throughout human history. You cannot point to a single act, choice, or decision that did not arise out of love. Even the most heinous crime, the most horrible offense or misdeed is or was an expression of love for something. When you think about it deeply, you'll see that this is true. If you didn't love something intensely, you would never be angry about either not having it or having it taken from you. If you didn't love something desperately, you couldn't even begin to think of using desperate measures to get it, or to keep it, or to protect it. Thieves act out of love. They love something so much that they desperately want to have it, and because they know of no other way they can get it, they steal it. The same is true of people who commit crimes of the most horrific nature, all are acts rooted in the love of something. Deeply distorted love, for sure, not condoned or approved of by society, and not excused by the explanations here, but understood. And so we come upon this remarkable staped from the conversations with God cosmology. Understanding replaces forgiveness in the mind of the Master. I'm going to repeat that because I want you to really absorb it. Understanding replaces forgiveness in the mind of the Master. The message here about justice and punishment now becomes very simple. In the mind of an awakened person, justice is contained in the actions that we take every day, not in our punishing responses after some action has occurred. And punishment is not part of any enlightened response of a being or a society to a person's distortion of love. I know that right now on our planet, given humanity's current level of group consciousness, our species is not really ready to apply these principles as a collective. But that does not mean that we cannot apply them individually in our personal lives. Indeed, we are being invited by this Quest to do exactly that, to create a new personal ethic, a new personal expression, a new personal experience. We're being invited to stand as an exemplar, a living and continuing presentation of the highest truth of love. Love is all there is. Love is who we are. All we have to do to step into such a possibility, such a demonstration, such an extraordinary expression is to invite our mind to move into a place of deep understanding of the why behind the what of every human event. We then take a giant step toward the place where divinity dwells. Here now is today's assignment.

LESSON 15: Behaviour #6: Do Not Experience Insufficiency
--------------------
<v ->We're going to take a look today</v> at an idea that has been the cause of virtually every major disagreement, clash, conflict, or war in the history of humanity's habitation of this planet. Here is the guidance upon which today's quest revolves. An awakened species does not embrace a principle in its civilization that correlates with the concept that humans refer to as insufficiency. We'll begin our exploration of this subject with a look at a flat statement made about all of this in the Conversations with God dialogues. We are told repeatedly in those texts that the idea that need exists is an illusion. It is in fact the first illusion of humans. It is also the most dangerous. If we felt that we needed nothing, all fear, all worry, all anxiety, all upset, all anger, all attack, all war would disappear from the face of the earth. Our lives would forever be changed, our experience would forever be joyful, our expressions would forever be loving. An awakened species understands this. It holds an awareness as well of a great secret. That great secret is that life will never end. This may not seem like such a great secret to us because so many of our religions teach this, but it is not the idea that is a secret, it's the fact that it's true, the fact that it's absolutely and positively true that life has no end is what is a secret. This is the belief of many human beings even those living in an unawakened state, but it is not the belief of an awakened species, it is the knowing of that species. It is not something that an awakened species hopes is true, it is not something that an awakened species has faith is true, it is something that an awakened species knows is true. Those who have awakened have moved to the third level of awareness with regard to this understanding. And this has enormous implications in daily life. For example with regard to the topic at hand, awakened beings understand that there's always enough of anything that someone may think they need to survive because they know that you can't not survive. In other words when survival isn't a question, the idea of sufficiency or insufficiency ceases to have any significant meaning. The most important question in anyone's experience is not whether they survive, but how, a question that you may remember we raised here before when discussing the burning building moment. In the burning building moment, the issue is not survival. And in the minds of all members of a civilization that's fully awakened, the awareness of guaranteed eternal existence results in sharing completely and fully all that exists with all who exist and the mutual conserving of any element or item that might be in less than endless supply in any particular setting, situation, or circumstance in the realm of the physical. The result is that insufficiency is unheard of as whatever in the physical environment may not be in endless supply is either easily done without or substituted for with the creation of an equally useful and beneficial replacement. Now you might say that it's nice that there are places in the universe where nothing essential ever runs out, but here on earth we're not that lucky. But actually we are. There's no essential element that we need that we should run out of on this planet. Insufficiency is simply an illusion, but it is made very real by the action or inaction of the human species. Take water for instance. A huge percentage of humans to this very day have no access to clean water, yet that is not a problem of lack of water, but lack of will. There are not enough people among our species who care about making clean water available to those who have no immediate access to it. If there were, this would not be a problem. To bring the point home, let me share that the World Resources Institute reports on its website that armed with the right information, countries facing extremely high stress can implement management and conservation strategies to secure their water supplies. Unfortunately a country at the bottom of the economic scale may not have that capacity. So it would be up to the richer nations of the world to help make this happen. It's simply a matter of a civilization caring and sharing. I assure you there needs to be no place on earth where people can't get access to clean pure water or whatever else is needed to make life work if the people of earth simply cared enough about each other. But of course we have to remember as we spoke of earlier that we're talking about a species which lets 656 of its own children die of starvation every hour. We are primitive species for sure. Our actions or lack of actions demonstrate that. Primitive or not, earth's people shouldn't die of insufficient food for goodness' sake. Of all things on a planet where we scrape off enough food from the plates of diners tonight in restaurants from Paris, to Los Angeles, to Tokyo, more food than would be needed to feed a small village in some areas of our world for a week, no child needs to starve to death. The US Department of Agriculture estimates food waste in the United States alone to be about 30 to 40% of the food supply. Did you hear what I said? Let me tell you that again. I said food waste in the US alone is between 30% and 40% of the food supply. An estimated 133 billion pounds of food from stores, restaurants, and homes was wasted in 2010 according to official government statistics. I'm not making this stuff up. We're talking here about situations that would never, could ever occur in the civilization of a species that's awakened. One of the ironies of the point of view of many in our human society is that because they think there is not enough of the things they need to survive and to be happy, they collect and hoard all the things they need or that they think that they need. This of course actually creates insufficiency. Not everyone has the financial or physical ability to collect and hoard so they're left at the mercy of those who purchased and stockpiled everything that they think they need, including by the way money in huge amounts. So long as collecting and hoarding continues, the global experience of insufficiency will continue as well. Now I'm going to share with you a way to use just the opposite behavior to end any experience of insufficiency that you or anyone you know may be encountering in life. This tool is going to be counterintuitive so be careful. But the fact that it's counterintuitive is what makes it so powerful because it goes against the energetic signature of the feeling of not having enough. And it changes that energetic signature. Doing so is the first step in changing the experience itself. So here's what I want you to do or that I advise anyone else who you know who may be facing this problem of apparent insufficiency. Whenever you think that you do not have enough or whatever you think you don't have enough of whatever it is, money, time, love, laughter in your life, companionship, whatever it is, be the source of it in the life of another. This is a three-word formula that I received in Conversations with God Book One and it works like magic and for a very good reason, for a very sound reason, foundationed in metaphysics. The act of giving something away causes you to experience that you have it, and not only that you have it, but that you have enough of it to actually give some away, to share some with another. You have enough money, you have enough time, you have enough love, you have enough of whatever you think you do not have enough of to actually supply it to another who has even less than you. You won't have any problem by the way finding someone who has less. All you'll have to do is look around you, just walk down the street and look around you. This little act alone, just the act of looking around you and seeing, observing how many people have less than you, in some cases a lot less will go far toward dissolving the illusion of insufficiency in your life. Then the act of giving some of what you have away will do the rest. Let me extend this guidance a lot further with a little tidbit from Conversations with God that I'd like to share with you here. It has to do with how you see yourself, how you position yourself in life. I was told in the dialogue that there are two ways to see myself in the experience of life. I can see myself as the seeker or see myself as the source. To the degree that I see myself as the seeker, to that degree I will be dependent upon another for that which I am seeking. My boss perhaps if I'm looking for more money, my spouse perhaps if I'm seeking more love, a member of the clergy perhaps if I'm looking for greater clarity, spiritual insight, a member of a fraternal organization if I'm seeking acceptance and companionship. Whatever it is I'm seeking, I'll be looking to someone else to provide it for me. Most of us see ourselves as the seeker in life because that's how we started out. As a baby, as a child, we didn't have much choice in the matter. Whatever we wanted, we had to get from someone else. But when I was given this little tidbit in Conversations with God in the dialogue, it changed everything for me. I realized that if I see myself in life as the source, I will turn everything around, everything will turn around. I will generate a whole new energetic signature. Suddenly I experience everything I desire as coming from me not to me and through me to anyone else who needs it. I tried this turn around and I discovered that what comes through me sticks to me. Did you catch that? What comes through you sticks to you. So I offer this little formula to you. Be the source. And believe that you will find that even after you give some of what you have away, you will still have enough left for you to be perfectly content, perfectly happy, perfectly at peace with your life. Then you will move into gratitude for what you do have and this energy too will produce a signature in the contextual field that can be very powerful to enlarging your awareness and your reality of sufficiency. Now I'd like to offer you a final tool that can be very effective in dealing with these energies or helping other people deal with them. Notice that there's a difference between need and desire. Start using this new vocabulary when you're tempted to feel that there is not enough of something in your life. Instead of saying I need this or I need that, begin saying I choose this and I choose that. And think of what you'd like more of as something that you desire, not something that you need. You may think this is just a matter of semantics, but I assure you that your thoughts and your words are very powerful. Again this may all seem very elementary, like elementary metaphysics to you, but not nearly enough of us use these simple metaphysical tools in our lives so their power is lost to us, the power of these tools is lost to us, a point that will be made later in this quest. So remember that there's a difference between needing and desiring, between requiring and choosing. Notice that you actually require nothing to be happy right now. There are things you may choose to have or to experience in your life but you do not require them to be happy and at peace. So stop requiring and you will find yourself feeling far more wonderful about your daily experience. Say you know what? I'm going to change my requirements into my desirements. Okay, now here is today's assignment. Number one, think of at least one thing, more if more come to mind, that you once thought you needed and could not do without, then found yourself losing or never acquiring. Ask yourself how have you gotten along without that? Did you ever really need it? Make an entry about this in your awakening journal.

LESSON 16: Reflect & Digest - Insufficiency	

N/A

====================

LESSON 17: Behaviour #7: Practice Stewardship Not Ownership
--------------------
<v ->The principle we'll be discussing today</v> focuses on an aspect of humanity's experience that's fundamental to the daily expression of nearly every person on Earth. To lead us off, here's today's guidance. An awakened species does not embrace a principle in its civilization that correlates with the concept that humans refer to as ownership. That's right, we're going to be talking today about ownership, about the right that we have to call anything our own. Let's explore this now. Do we really have that right? Do we really need to have such a right? What useful purpose does it serve? What's the point of owning anything? These are all good questions, and one might even ask, "Wait a minute, what's so non-functional? "What's wrong? "What's so bad about having something we can call our own?" Seems to work just fine for most people. And not just most people who own most of the stuff, even most people who don't own most of the stuff want to own more. But of course this is true, because many of the people who do own most of the stuff are largely keeping it to themselves. The economic systems we put into place on this planet virtually guarantees that. There are exceptions of course, but they are exceptions, not the rule. We talked about hoarding before in this quest when we explored the topic of insufficiency. It's easy to see that this is occurring and it's easy to see that there's a direct connection between insufficiency and ownership as human concepts. The correlation is this: the higher the percentage of ownership by the smallest number of people, the higher the percentage of insufficiency in the highest number of people. You want proof? A recent report on wealth distribution shows that under 100 of the world's richest people hold more wealth than 3.5 billion. That's half of the world's population combined. Ownership does not inflate wealth distribution, it deflates it. Still, all of these inequalities and inequities aside, most people would not want to give up the idea of ever owning anything or ever being able to call anything their own. So how would human beings get to that point, even if everyone was, as we've been putting it, awakened? Well, first of all, we would understand that since we are all one, everything that exists belongs to everyone who exists. And how would that function as a practical matter? Everyone in our world can't till the soil or plant the seeds or harvest a crop and earn the income from every farm on the planet. Every person can't just walk into everyone else's house as if it was their own and just hang out there. First of all, there wouldn't be a space big enough and even if there was, there wouldn't be any place for privacy. Is there to be no privacy? Is everything to be shared, including husbands, wives, children and all possessions of any kind? How can that work? Again, very good and very fair questions. And Conversations With God, Book 4: Awaken the Species answers them all. It says that when our civilization becomes a society of fully awakened individuals, the idea of ownership will be replaced by the concept of stewardship. Entities will mutually agree on who shall have stewardship of what, who shall partner with whom, who shall raise offspring and who shall perform what functions in the physical world. No one will take anything or anyone that's being cared for by someone else, through a stewardship or partnership agreement. Those who create offspring will not imagine that they own their offspring, and those who partner with others will not imagine that they own their partners, and those who accept stewardship of anything, anything that's physical, be it land or some particular physical item, will not imagine that they own that item either. They would be clear that they're merely loving and caring for these other entities and these other items. No one would imagine, for instance, that because they are stewards of a particular parcel of the planet, the planet that they've embodied on, that they own the minerals and the water and whatever else is under that parcel down to the center of the Earth. No one will imagine that they own the air or the sky above a particular parcel, as high as the sky can go. So there will be no arguments about how high is up or how far is down or who owns the rights to whatever is up or down there. Such discussions would seem pointless and totally out of keeping with who we are when we understand that we are all one and that no single entity or group of entities can possibly own a chunk of planet, much less what's high above or far beneath it. Currently, of course, we have arguments between governments and individuals all the time over air rights and water rights and mineral rights on our planet, raising the question, where does ownership begin and end? How high is up? How far down is down? To the center of the Earth? Clear to the other side? As I said, we've had political struggles and have actually fought military battles over these seemingly silly questions. So the time must come when our treaties and our UN resolutions and our peace agreements and our climate accords finally give way to an overriding, overarching view, a global understanding of who we are in relationship to each other. It's been said that if one day we were suddenly visited and threatened by malevolent beings from outer space, we would, in about a quarter of a second, give up our need to claim individual rights and draw sharp lined boundaries that our need to build fences and walls to declare what is ours and what will never and can never be yours, we would give that up for sure. And we would also, we are told, experience our oneness immediately were we confronted with such a common enemy. Well, we are being confronted with a common enemy. It is widespread pain and widespread suffering. Our common enemy is widespread poverty and widespread hardship. Our common enemy is widespread disease and widespread death. I've shared some statistics before in this program about the state of our world today, but I need not mention that 20.9 million women and children are being bought and sold into commercial sexual servitude every year, or that billions of people today have no access to healthcare. Most of us are not aware that 19000 children die from preventable health issues such as malaria, diarrhea and pneumonia. 19000 children dying from those preventable diseases every year. No, I'm sorry, I mean every month. I'm sorry, I mean every day. 19000 children dying every day from preventable diseases. Could this occur on a planet of truly evolved beings? Do we consider ourselves evolved on this planet? By what measure? By what standard? But now, just for now, let's leave this topic of worldwide misery and bring today's subject down to a level that all of us who live in plenteousness and abundance can relate to, business. How would this whole concept of non-ownership work in the economic realm? If people didn't own anything, how could they make a profit from anything? And if they didn't make a profit, how could they earn a living? The answer is that when humanity has fully awakened, it will take the word profit and give it a whole new definition. Humans will not consider it profitable if they benefit at the expense of another. They will not consider it acceptable if they win while another loses. And they especially will not consider it honorable if their winning causes another to lose. In this new human civilization, it would be understood that no one benefits unless everyone benefits. The allure of attachment and the seduction of possessions will disappear from our experience. We will live as if we owned nothing and are owned by nothing. We will clearly see that the biggest obstacle to self realization and the root of all false identification is the concept of mine and yours, which generates the need for control. Let's notice something, shall we? Let's notice that when people are in love, the idea of personal and individual ownership all but disappears. What's mine and yours becomes what's ours. That's because love asks for, yearns for, pines for, indeed lusts for a melding, a meshing, a merging. The beauty and the wonder of love is all that it takes to end our isolation at last, giving way to oneness in a truly and purely loving melding, in a really wonderful marriage. The stuff in the house is not my stuff and your stuff. It's not my TV and your TV, or your bookcase. The refrigerator doesn't belong to one person while the dining room table belongs to another. Such an idea would seem silly to even contemplate because the purpose of marriage and the reflection of love is manifest in the blending of lives and the ending of separation. For the people living in such a relationship, it's heaven. I promise you. It's heaven. And so we see that all we have to do to create heaven on Earth for all of us is for all of us to love all of us. And then, as we do in all unconditionally loving relationships, we give up our need for and our claim to ownership of stuff and things. As many of you may be aware from my personal history, I spent a year of my life living on the street. I mean, I lived on the sidewalk for a year. Not for a week, not for a tough month, not for a bad winter, for a year. I won't bother going here into how I reached that point, but I can tell you that this experience was remarkable in what it taught me and brought me in terms of wisdom and clarity about how life works. I can also tell you that this unique episode shifted my major life activity from gathering to distributing. All of my life until then, I had been gathering. Reaching for this and reaching for that, striving for this and striving for that, yearning for this and yearning for that, collecting this and collecting that until I had collected so much stuff that you could fill a warehouse with what I had accumulated. Then, through a unique series of events, including an automobile accident in which I broke my neck, I lost it all, every single thing that I had. Every single thing I thought was mine. Every single thing I owned. Everything that I owned, I lost. Suddenly I owned nothing. Nothing except two pair of jeans, three shirts, one pair of shoes and a backpack. Even my, can you believe this, even my car was stolen right off the street in front of the place where I was staying a few nights at a friend's house, couch sitting. They stole the car right out from under my nose. So I know all about ownership and the pointlessness of it. Now look, look, I'm not saying for a minute that none of us should own anything. What I am saying is that I've learned not to become attached to what I own. Boy, have I learned that. And I've learned also not to be owned by it. And I've changed my major life activity from gathering to distributing. When I move through, when I move through my days and nights, I'm not looking to see what, if anything, I can gather. I'm looking to see what, if anything, I can distribute. Can I distribute love? Can I distribute compassion? Can I distribute money? Can I distribute wisdom? Dare I think that I have the ability to do that, to do any of this? What if I thought my whole purpose for being alive was to distribute stuff? What if I never really needed to gather anything, except maybe the courage to distribute everything? Did you hear, let me say that again. I want you to catch what I just said. I said, what if I never really needed to gather anything, except maybe to gather the courage to distribute everything? Can I gather the courage to act as the source rather than the seeker in my life? What if I decided that I really don't own anything except the me that I am? And what if the me that I am has nothing to do with the stuff I own? Nothing whatsoever, nothing at all? What if I didn't even have the right to claim that I owned it? Could I walk away from all of it and take me with me, totally together and completely intact? A wonderful spiritual teacher that I know named Mooji, who I've come to love as a friend, invites us to consider living in a breathtakingly daring way. "Have no rights", he says quietly and gently. Think about that for a moment. Please just think about those words. Can you imagine living like that? Now that doesn't mean that you literally have no rights as a human being, or that it's okay to treat everyone else as if they didn't have any rights, but it does invite us to consider, might this be a path? Might this idea be a way to move to a level of inner peace and mental tranquility and emotional serenity that we have never known before? What if you didn't think that you owned the mineral rights or the water rights beneath your property, down to the center of the Earth? What if you didn't think that you have a right to tell people they can't play your grand piano because it was bequeathed to you by your third cousin on your mother's side? What if you didn't think it's your right to say what you want to say, do what you want to do, be where you want to be, wear a T-shirt that says "Don't tread on me" to prove it? What if you decided, hypothetically, that you have no rights at all? Could you see that as a useful, fascinating and powerful tool with which to get through the day? Do you think it might, in any way, reduce the amount of impatience, upset or emotional disturbance that you may experience in your life? I'm just wondering, just asking. What if you just said to yourself, "I have no rights", just as an experiment? Wouldn't that be interesting? Okay, here's today's assignment. Look today at what you now own and may feel that you need to hold on to in order to feel secure, functional or happy. Deeply explore how you ever felt secure, functional and happy before you acquired that stuff. Ask yourself, "How did you do that?" And write your reflections in your awakening journal.

LESSON 18: Stewardship vs Ownership

LESSON 19: Behavior #8: Sharing
--------------------
<v ->Today is a day that you're going to love</v> because today is a day on which you'll be exploring something that you're already doing, at a very high level. So this challenge will not be one in which you're going to be asked to make a huge alteration in your normal behavior. The guidance for today's quest is this, an awakened species shares everything with everyone all the time. Humans in an unawakened state often do not, only sharing with others in limited circumstances. Now to many people on this planet, this seems to be simply impractical, unworkable. But that's not the case with you, you've been sharing freely all your life. You share your time, you share your energy. You share your talents, you share your abundance. You share your knowledge and you share your love. You're not holding back on anything, you never have and you never will. That's what makes you an accomplished person. This is what makes you a sought-after person, in both professional and social circles. How do I know that this is true about you? I know that this is all true because I know that only a person for whom it is true would or could be participating in a program such as this. You see, it takes a very particular kind, a very special kind of person to accept the challenge of a quest like this. A quest for an even grander version of the self, to be created and revealed, to be demonstrated and expressed, to be experienced and fulfilled. It's true, in fact, that many of the challenges which have been placed before you in this program have already been met by you. This is not been nearly so much about opening you to new behaviors as it has been about inviting you to even grander demonstrations of ideas about yourself that you have held and shown to others for a very long time. But there are those who have not been living in many of the ways that have been described here over the past several days. For those members of our global society, this can be a fascinating moment because you can be a model. See there's a special invitation being offered by this program, an invitation being offered directly to you. And the invitation is to self-select. Wait, wait, to do what? To self-select. That is to choose oneself, to be among those who commit to moving forward their own individual and personal evolution by embracing and demonstrating behaviors that serve to awaken the species to who and what human beings everywhere really are. Individuations of divinity. And to how that may be made manifest in our collective experience. So suddenly this quest can take on a whole new dimension, rise to a whole new purpose, a purpose involving not just you as an individual, but you as a model. You as an exemplar, you as a leader in the larger process by which others on the planet grow and expand and evolve. And I hope that doesn't make you nervous or get you to start wondering whether you've taken on more than you thought here. All of us are models, you know. Everyone is watching everyone else to get their cues about life. That's what fashion is all about. It's a way to give us cues. That's what television ratings are all about. It's a way to give us cues. That's what polls and surveys and even elections are all about. We're all taking our cues from each other. Who are we? Where are we now? Where do we want to go? So when I say that this program offers you an invitation to be a model, I'm not saying that you have to do anything that you're not already doing. What I'm saying is that this quest invites you to do it consciously, rather than unconsciously. Deliberately rather than unintentionally. Purposefully, not accidentally. And by choosing to be a model, consciously choosing that, you're defining what a true leader is. A true leader is not one who says, hey, follow me. A true leader is one who says, I'll go first. So what this quest offers you is a chance to be among those who go first. To go where very few people have gone before. And there is no question in my mind that as you complete this quest, and move to the next level in embracing the behaviors that we been exploring here, you will be one of those individuals whose way of moving through the world will become very attractive to others. And that this could help the people's whose lives you touch to move to a place of their own awakening. Simply because they've seen what it's like to be an awakened person through knowing you. Simply through knowing you. And watching you. Now this may be an outcome that you never anticipated. That you never thought of in this way. But it could give your life a whole second level of meaning and a whole second level of impact. And wouldn't that be something? So now if you should ever find yourself in a place of discussing this idea of sharing with some of your friends and if they should say that it just can't work at the highest level, that we are describing here. Just tell them this, nonsense, you make it work all the time. You experienced this right now in your own limited way, in your families, for instance. You would never consider walking down the street in a rain storm and holding an umbrella over your head and just your head alone. Saying to your partner or your children, too bad, too bad you don't have an umbrella of your own. But, we only have one umbrella between us. It's only big enough to cover one of us. In fact, you would go further. Not only would you not say such a thing, you would actually cover them first. And make sure they're protected from the rain, even if that means that you yourself would get soaked. You would never think of eating the last piece of apple pie by yourself without sharing with your partner or your children. You wouldn't sit there and say, too bad there isn't enough for all of us but I'm sure going to enjoy mine. This is good pie. Sorry you can't have any. No, you would cut into that pie, making it into as many little pieces that you had to to make sure that everybody got a bite. Even if it meant that there really was none left for you. Show your friends to themselves. Tell them this about themselves. Tell them what I just said to you. Say you wouldn't do those things. And you know you wouldn't do those things. Show your friends the best side of themselves. Show them that they too are already practicing this behavior of highly evolved beings, of sharing. Use some light-hearted examples like I just used to help them see that they understand perfectly well the concept of refusing to profit or benefit if they are the only ones profiting or benefiting. When it is their own family or loved ones who are suffering because they're not sharing. Show them that the only difference between how they act normally with their own family and how most human beings act most of the time, is that awakened beings consider everyone to be their family and their loved ones. They would see then that the solution to so many of Earth's problems is obvious. Treat everyone as family. Your friends would see too that the only reason everyone on Earth does not behave this way all the time is that people don't think there's enough for everyone, so they have to make sure that they get theirs. It's the idea of scarcity that stifles the idea of full and complete sharing. We all know what lack of sharing is producing on this planet. I've read you statistics a couple of times now that make it abundantly clear that the construction of our global economy and the simple decision of some people to gather and hoard rather than distribute and share has produced conditions that no civilized species should even for a moment tolerate. 656 children an hour die of starvation. On a planet where more food is thrown away in all the restaurants of New York, London, Paris, and Tokyo in one night than it would take to feed an entire village in some parts of the world for two weeks. Visitors from another galaxy could be forgiven if they took a look around here and said, what kind of a planet is this? What kind of a planet is this? What kind of sentient beings are these? What kind of entities do this? Let's get out of here. What's sad about this is that there's more than enough for everyone, more than enough food, water, energy. And nearly everything we say we need to stay alive. We have a problem of distribution, not a problem of insufficiency. A point that I have made before in this program. I know, I keep saying some of the same things over and over again because I want to make this Quest impactful in your lives so that you can make it impactful on the planet. What's even more sad than all that I've been saying is that most of the folks who gather and hoard don't understand or appreciate the metaphysics of doing exactly the opposite. The remarkable and powerful metaphysical truth is that the more we give away, the more we draw to ourselves. This is because as we have also discussed as part of our exploration in previous topics here, the act of giving away whatever it is you have is an announcement that you believe you have plenty. You know the universe that we live in is nothing but a great big Xerox machine. It copies your evidence of this belief that you have and it sends that evidence right back to you. It's not a coincidence that virtually every spiritual master who has ever walked this planet has made the same statement. As you give, so shall you receive. This is why the Golden Rule has become so golden. "Do unto others as you would have them do unto you" is a great deal more than a simplistic high-sounding aphorism. It's a crystal-clear description of the mechanism of the cosmos. It's the instruction sheet that comes with the box. It reveals to us the great secret of life. That sharing is not only enhancing others but also enhancing the self. I understand, of course, that you already know this. As I said at the outset, you're already practicing this behavior and using this metaphysical tool. I know that you share freely and lavishly all the gifts, talents, skills, knowledge and abundance that life has given you. And that you have watched life circulate back to you everything that you require to be happy and to stay alive, I know this about you. I also know that you have no doubt surprised yourself with your own experience that you actually require much less than you may have thought that you needed to stay in a particular form intact as a body. And nothing at all to stay alive as a soul. Given that staying alive as a soul is something you will always do and cannot not do. It's merely a matter of what form your existence will take. That is, of course, the question you answer with every choice, every decision, and every action of your entire life. What form shall my existence take? Right now, our planet could really benefit from having a few more humans who are willing to demonstrate and model a new form that humanity could take. A form based on a belief in sufficiency and sharing. And in this way, helping to awaken the species. Those who are intentionally modeling this behavior will have to self-select, however, as I mentioned a minute ago because no one's going to appoint them or anoint them. Hence, the invitation that comes to you as part of this Quest. So now, here is today's assignment. Make a note in your awakening journal of the biggest thing in your life that you ever shared with anyone else. The biggest moment of personal giving you ever experienced. Write a brief paragraph describing how you felt when you did that. And why you felt that way.

LESSON 21: Behavior #9: Machines and Nature
--------------------
<v ->Today our topic is balance</v> and the challenges I'm going to place before you in your assignments later on may be among the toughest that this program has invited you to take so far. So get ready because you may be surprised to find how difficult it is to complete these assignments. That's because for many people it's become rare to bring a true sense of balance to life. The result is that they've lost touch with their inner most self, their true self, and with some of the real joys of life. The guiding statement for today is the ninth of the 16 differences between the behaviors of Highly Evolved Beings and those who are moving through life at a lower level of consciousness. An awakened species creates a balance between technology and cosmology, between machines and nature. Humans in an unawakened state often do not. Now, this may not seem like a very big deal in the overall scheme of things but it actually has more impact on your quality of life than you may realize. The question of balance in your life affects your health, your relationships, your job performance, your income, your sense of inner peace and throwing all of that together, your happiness. We like to think that today's modern technologies have brought great improvements to our lives and of course in many ways they have. But in many other ways they could rob us of our personhood if we're not careful. By personhood I mean the total experience of who you are, all the small pleasures of the body and sweet expansions of the mind that build upon one another and add to the ultimate composition of a relaxed yet productive, tranquil yet energetic, focused yet well-rounded self. Modern technology can bring us closer to God by making us more like gods, putting more control, more capability, more power in our hands, literally in the palm of our hands than we could ever have dreamed of 25 years ago. Yet, in some surprising ways these new capabilities have rendered us incapable of relying upon ourselves to perform basic functions and supply ourselves with simple delights that equip us with the poise and equilibrium that we need to meet life's most hectic moments. It can start to feel as if every moment is a hectic moment if we don't guard against technology inadvertently affecting the cosmology and the psychology of our lives. On a recent Sunday my wife and I did something striking in its simplicity. At her suggestion, by the way I find that wives are almost always the ones who suggest stuff like this, we piled a couple of folding chairs and a cooler stocked with sandwiches, sodas and potato chips and drove off to the wonderful public park that graces the center of our town. There we found an expansive lawn, lush green lawn, parked ourselves under the shade of a huge oak tree, unwrapped our sandwiches and had a wonderful little picnic, talking quietly with each other about nothing important for a change, just remarking of the splendor of the sun dappling the landscape before us and of the sweet chirping of birds all around. And when we'd finished eating, do you know what I did? I took out a book and sat there in the sun for over an hour reading it. I mean, I actually held a book in my hand, not a screen or a device. I read off of the pages of the book, pages that were made of paper, you know, paper that I turned, that I could smell. Is there anything nicer to a bibliophile than book pages you can smell? But I have a more interesting question, when do you think the last time was that I spent a whole Sunday afternoon in the park quietly reading a book? Try 20 years ago. I mean, it's been 20 years since I sat in a park doing nothing but reading a book. See, 'cause I'm busy. Hey, I'm busy. Yes, even busy on a Sunday, you know how it is? The computer calls. The cellphone dings. There are emails to be opened, texts to be read, website pages to be updated, entries to be posted, projects to be moved forward, data to be gathered, yes, even on a Sunday. Time waits for no man. A few years ago I had no laptop glued to my legs. Years before that I didn't even have a computer on my desk, can you imagine that? There wasn't a computer in the entire house a few years ago. Business communications came in the mail. Mail is that stuff that's delivered by hand. It comes all the way from the person sending it to the person receiving it, delivered by hand, can you imagine that? And since the mail was not delivered to our house on a Sunday there were no communications, no business letters that had to be answered that came in until Monday. That meant I could have the whole Sunday off. Oh my gosh. The other day I thought I would have a whole day off and my wife came to in the house and she said I dare you not to open your computer once today. Wow. But that's not the only pleasure from my past, I mean, a whole Sunday off that today's technology has robbed me of. I remember from the days of my youth the pleasures of putting my hands in warm water and actually washing the dishes. I recall cutting the grass with a mower that I pushed under my own power, which meant that I'd be outside two or three times as long. Imagine being out of doors and smelling the fragrance of freshly cut grass instead of kerosene? And speaking of the outdoors and the wonderful smells, can anyone remember what it smelt like to put a shirt on your body or place your head on a pillowcase fresh from the clothes line outside? I mean, a shirt that was dried by wind and sun. I'm an old person so I can remember these things. But today if you want to have that experience you have to put a sheet, it's a sheet with artificial fragrance that they place in it to pretend that the laundry was dried outside. The sweet balance in those days was part of my life where not everything was done indoors and by machines. What I have observed over the past 60 years of my life is that in my experience there's a direct connection between the technologies now available to us as well as the newer and newer and newer technologies that crop up every hour of every day becoming available to us, a connection between that and the quality of our lives. And that connection is not always a positive one. Every aspect of our lives, physically, emotionally, psychologically, socially and spiritually is touched by this technology that's all around us. One of the biggest challenges we're facing as an emerging civilization is the bringing of our philosophies, beliefs and understandings about the world and our decisions about who we are up to speed with our technology. The advancements in our weaponry have allowed us to strike targets, both concrete and human, with drones remotely controlled thousands of miles away or explosives able to be hidden in laptop computers, on sheets as thin as paper and carry it aboard an airplane. Those technologies have the potential of removing humans so far from the sights and sounds of death that they almost see battle and war in the way we once saw video games as a child. And if you think that does nothing to have an impact on the psychology behind decisions that kill people, think again. Our genetic altering of crops in ways that increase the speed of their growth and the volume of their yield has the potential of removing humans so far from the source and process by which nature intended to produce and provide nutrition naturally that our food is becoming less and less organic, more and more processed, less and less wholesome, more and more additive-laden, less and less pure and more and more artificial. And if you think that does not have a psychological impact on the healthfulness or a physiological impact as well of the healthfulness of what we're putting into our bodies, think again. Our cloning of animals and within a generation or less of the first human has the potential of removing humans so far from the moral underpinnings that guided the reproductive decisions of our species for millennia that our world of tomorrow is threatening to look like a science fiction nightmare. And if you think that does not have an impact on the spiritual underpinnings of the next generation, think again. Look, it's becoming more and more clear every moment that there must be some melding of, that we would benefit from some integration of producing a balance between technology and cosmology, between machines and what they're capable of producing and what nature produces all by itself. The additional impact in our world of instantaneous global communication, the use of social media to freely spread ideologies of intolerance and to even plant the seeds of hatred and terrorism, the undeniable impact of all the latest life extension medicine, all of these realities, every one of them leave us ill equipped to deal with the ethical, moral and spiritual dilemmas that our old beliefs and standards and guidelines have left us unable to resolve. You see what we're trying to do? We're trying to take our guidelines and our standards from 20 and 30 and 40 years ago and overlay them on our society today, a society that's been so radically altered by technology that we can't keep up in terms of our moral understandings and our societal guidelines with what we are able to do. Our technologies have placed the information of the world at our fingertips but left cashiers unable to make change without a calculator. Our technologies have given us access to all the numbers of Einstein's equation but left us unable to remember the phone numbers of our own family. Our technologies have given us the ability to do more work in one hour than we used to do in one day and accomplish more in two weeks than we used to accomplish in two months. There's no question that our productivity has increased but we must ensure that we have not decreased our humanity. Remember when a long plain ride gave us a chance to read a couple of feature articles in a wonderful magazine or maybe catch a really good movie that we missed when it came through town because we were just able to do that on the airplane? Remember that? Well, now there's talk of banning laptops in airplane cabins on overseas flights, and now that that's being discussed everybody panics. Corporations testify before congress of the economic impact of how much productivity will be lost. Remember when you left your house or office and how you got away from the telephone for 20 minutes or for a blessed hour at lunch? Now if you don't answer your cellphone or at least respond to a text instantly the only acceptable excuse is that you were in the washroom. Where will this all end? How much of our quality of life will we allow our technology to take from us? Well, in your life that's up to you but this Quest offers this, let us not confuse accomplishment with enrichment, achievement with fulfillment, and what we are doing with what we are being. Sound good? On this day squeeze a blade of grass between your fingers and rub it until its juice permeates your skin. Smell the fragrance of its nectar. Then touch the bark of a tree. And finally, look into another person's eyes for 10 seconds, dare you. Look into another person's eyes for 10 seconds. Don't look away. Don't talk. And make a note in your awakening journal of any difference you feel between this 10 second experience and looking at your computer screen for 10 minutes. Here's the challenge, don't think about these things. Don't just think about these things, oh, interesting assignment, actually do them, dare you. And I'll see you tomorrow.

LESSON 23: Behavior #10: Killing and Death
--------------------
<v ->The subject of this challenge focuses on a part of life</v> that's very unusual to talk about, and a subject that needs to be approached with delicacy, and sensitivity. We're going to be talking today about killing and dying. Let me read the guidance statement that creates the context for this exploration, An awakened species would never, under any circumstances, terminate the current physical expression of another sentient being, unless asked directly by that other being to do so. Humans in an unawakened state often kill other human beings without that other human requesting them to do so. In other words, beings who are awakened simply don't kill each other for any reason, other than being asked to do so by someone who wishes their current physicality terminated. If human beings were sufficiently awakened now to embrace this notion, it would produce a massive shift in our behavior. It would obviously eliminate war of any kind. It would eliminate the convention in certain societies called the death penalty. It would even eliminate ending the life of another in self defense. Does this mean we wouldn't have the right to defend ourselves? Nearly every human being might be expected to ask that question these days, what with all the attacks, all the negativity, all the anger, and hatred that seems to be at a higher pitch now than most of us can remember seeing in our lifetime. So yes, most people would ask that question, do you mean we shouldn't even defend ourselves? Even our most sacred traditions, our religions and our laws tell us that self defense can justify ending the life of another. But the problem is that even attack is called a defense. People attack others, because they say they are defending something else. So what is a defense? What is an attack? We see them that it's not a question of what we have a right to do, it's a question of what we are doing. It's not a question of not defending ourselves. It's a question of how to best defend ourselves. Do we best defend ourselves with more attack in the other direction, or is our best defense no defense at all? You see, the question we have to ask ourselves is, what is the purpose of our defense? Are we defending ourselves in order to experience peace? Or are we defending ourselves in order to experience revenge? Conversations With God invites us to remember that every act is an act of self definition. If we wish to define ourselves as a species that kills its own kind in order for others of its kind to survive, we may do so, and no one will stop us. Notice that no one has stopped us to this very day, but the day may come when we will choose to stop ourselves if only out of seeing that in our frenzy to protect ourselves, we're threatening to destroy ourselves. Now along comes book four in the Conversations With God series to tell us that if we can awaken ourselves, awaken our species fast enough, we will no longer create situations in which humans have to defend themselves against each other. When we awaken, we will lay down our arms, all of us at once, and abandoned forever the ways, and the means of destroying each other. Our competitions for everything will end, and we'll find ways to share everything that there is to share, including all the world's natural resources, and all the amazing miracles of medicine, science, and technology that our civilization has produced. For an awakened species, sharing everything in this way will be a patently obvious and appropriate thing to do. Humans will also, once we have awakened, never do anything to interfere with the free will of another, nor try to convince, coerce, capture, or control any person, or group, nation, or region for any political, economic, philosophical, social, or religious reason. With these changes in our behavior, we'll have no need to defend ourselves, because no one will ever again have any reason to attack us, physically, emotionally, financially, or in any other way whatsoever, since all attack is a call for help, and since no one will need any help when we are all already helping each other. In other words, self defense will be eliminated as a rationale, or justification for violence. Now what does any of this have to do with us, individually I mean, as we move throughout the challenges of day to day life, and what does it have to do with you as you move through this Quest? Well, it's all about setting a larger context, creating a larger mental, and spiritual arena, within which we might consider not just killing, and dying in the literal sense, but the killing of love, and the dying of caring, of compassion, and gentleness with each other, as we journey together on this path called life. If before the time of our global awakening, we are attacked individually, and collectively, verbally, or physically, we each have the choice to respond in a way that defines the highest thought we ever had about who we are, and who we choose to be. That's why we're discussing this here today, because in making this choice we have the option to use, or to ignore the wisdom offered us by those who have walked among us, who we have called masters. I am particularly impressed with the guidance that we've received from Buddha who said, monks, even if bandits were to attack you on the road, and rob you, and savagely sever you limb from limb with a double handed saw, even then, whoever among you harbors ill will at heart would not be upholding my teaching. Monks, even in such a situation, you should train yourselves thus, neither shall our minds be effected by this, nor for this matter shall we give vent to evil words, but we shall remain full of concern, and pity with a mind of love, and we shall not give in to hatred. On the contrary, we shall live projecting thoughts of universal love to all those various persons, making them as well as the whole world, the object of our thoughts of universal love, thoughts that have grown great, exalted, and measureless. We shall dwell radiating these thoughts, which are void of hostility and ill will. It is in this way, monks, that you should train yourselves. What shall we think of those words when we talk about the death penalty, or when we hear leaders of nations speak of blowing people off the face of the Earth, and what is our response to the words of another master as well, whose words have lived through the ages? He said, bless, bless, bless your enemies, and pray for those who persecute you, and use you violently, subjecting you to score, and and ridicule, and when a man slaps you on the right cheek, turn, and offer him your left. And what shall be our reaction tomorrow, when something occurs to anger us, and we hear this thought echoing in our ears? Raise not your fist to heaven, and curse the darkness not, but be a light unto the darkness that you might know who you really are, and that all those whose lives you touch might know who they are as well. This is a challenging topic, isn't it? It invites us to step out of what for many of us is our comfort zone, to abandon many of our normal behaviors, to change our usual patterns, and to alter our way of moving through the world, and of responding to it. And we barely touched the surface here on this subject of killing, and dying. So let's dive into it even further in these moments that we share today as part of your quest. Let's move forward today, looking back at something that has been said here before, since the start of this program, there's no such thing as death. Human beings are eternal beings. We always were, are now, and always will be. We are sentient entities who are moving back, and forth between the physical plane, and the metaphysical on an eternal journey of the soul. The purpose of this process is to provide every individuated expression of sentient life, an endless opportunity to, here come those 25 words again, recreate ourselves anew, in every golden moment of now, in the next grandest version of the greatest vision, ever we held about who we are, or to put it in even fewer words to express our true nature, and our true identity, and to put it in even fewer words than that, to experience our divinity. We see then that death as we think of it, as the end of our existence cannot be real. What we call death is simply a process of re-identification. The day we do the thing we call die, is better described by Conversations With God as our continuation day. This idea must bring up another question in the mind of every single person. If no one dies in ultimate reality, what would be the spiritual, or temporal reason to invite you, and all of humanity never to kill anybody? Of course, there is no one single answer to this, or any other question of importance to the soul. If I've learned one thing in my Conversations With God, it's that there is no one size fits all answer to the great inquiries of life. I think that the downfall of many of the world's great belief systems is their insistence that there is a single, and specific answer to every question on spiritual matters, an answered that you must accept, or be condemned for all of eternity. My experience, however, is that the God of unconditional love, who is the God of my understanding, encourages all of us to be our own authority in these matters. My own answer then to the question is this, even though I know that on a spiritual level, a human soul can never die, ending another human being's physical experience is still something I would not do, or that I would do whatever I could to avoid, because it recreates me in a way that I do not wish to be, because it makes a statement about who I am that I do not wish to make, and because by extension it does the same for my entire species. I see myself, and every member of my species as an individuation of divinity. I understand that knowing this, and more important, modeling it to make it easier for all of us to embrace it as our true identity, can change everything in the way we continue our lives in our present physical form. It can alter our goals, our objectives, our larger purpose, our intention, our ambitions, and our aspirations. The question is not can it, but will it? The challenge of this day of your Quest is, will it? What would it be like to hold all physical life as sacred? Yes, even the life of the murderer, the terrorist, the one who does not hold our life as sacred at all. What would it be like to honor as if it were the prime directive, every form of life in the physical universe? What would it be like to sit down with a terrorist, or murderer, and ask a simple question? What hurts you so much that you feel you have to hurt others in order to heal it? That's a profound question. I'm reminded of an experience in the life of a wonderful author, and teacher named Byron Katie. Walking down the street one night in a big city where she had given a lecture, she was pulled into an alley by a man. He demanded that she gave him all her money, and anything else of value that she had in her handbag. He told her, don't look at me. I don't want you to see me. I don't want you to be able to recognize me, or identify me later if I'm caught. But when she gave him the money, she happened to just glance up at him briefly, and that's when he pulled a gun on her, and said, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. But I have to kill you. You got too good of a look at me. I told you not to look at me. And as he was putting the silencer on the barrel of the gun, she simply said quietly, do the best you can do. If that's the best you can do, you need to do it. Always do the best you can do. The robber looked at her in complete astonishment, dropped the money, dropped her jewelry, and muttered lady, you're crazy, and ran away. That's a true story. I know the author that this happened to personally, and that's a true story. So I'm going to end the guidance message of today's Quest with her most remarkable words. Do the best you can do. Always do the best you can, and while you're at it, here's today's assignment. Stop for a moment right now, and ask yourself, what is my thought about death? What do I think happens if anything after I die? And I'll see you when we meet again for our next exploration.

LESSON 25: Behaviour #11: Nurture the Environment
--------------------
<v ->We're going to look today at the world you live in</v> and how you live in it. Here's the guiding statement for today from Conversations with God, Book Four, Awaken the Species. "An awakened species would never do anything "that could potentially damage or harm "the physical environment that supports "the members of the species when they are physicalized. "Humans in an unawakened state often do so." Once again, this is that I know as a conscious person, that you are already doing. I don't have to sit here and pontificate with you about protecting the environment. But this program that we have called The Quest is not so much about inviting you to new behaviors as it is about challenging you to raise the consistency of your present behaviors. To raise them to the level of mastery. It's a challenge that I believe has been placed before you by your own soul. The challenge to rise to the level of an exemplar, modeling behaviors that will inspire those close to you. And in that way, awaken the species. So right now, you have a chance to look at any of your last behaviors, any final habits, any hold-over patterns from your past that you have yet to release or let go of. That you may still choose to alter or correct. You still have a chance to alter or correct some of those behaviors with regard to the way you're interacting with the environment. And in what you may be able to do on a larger scale to help protect the environment. Let me take a moment here to give you some examples of how I think all of us can move to the next level in this. Looking at my own life, I thought I was living as a pretty conscious person. I don't see myself as running around, damaging the environment at every turn. But I just wanted to see how well I was really doing so I went online and I typed in a few simple words into one of the search engines. The five words I typed in, "ways to protect the environment". That's pretty simple, right? To my surprise, a long list of resources popped up on my screen. List after list appeared, each of them from a different organization, each of them offering wonderful suggestions on ways that I could move to the next level in helping our planet to survive the onslaught of one billion human beings, the majority of whom may not be consciously avoiding doing any damage or causing any harm to the environment in which we all live. I'm going to read some of those to you now. And let's take a little test together, 'cause I know that you too are a conscious person. I know that you too are not going around carelessly and deliberately injuring the environment. Frankly, I don't think that any of us are doing that on purpose, deliberately. But there are things. There are things that we may be failing to do that we could do. Some of them rather easily, and without a great deal of effort. To protect the air, the land and the sea around us. So let me just give you some examples. Let's have a little fun here and take a little test. How many of these things are you now doing? Use compact fluorescent light bulbs. They can save tons of energy and they last eight times longer. Shut things off. Don't leave the sound system on all day and all night if you're not using it. Switch off the lights while you're at it, when you leave the room. I mean every time you leave the room, even if you know you're coming back in a short while. That may seem like a small thing but if everybody did it, it would create a remarkable worldwide energy savings. Walk or cycle. Driving is one of the biggest causes of pollution, I'm sure you know that. If you're going just a short distance, why not walk or bicycle? If your destination is further away, see if you can take public transportation. If possible, try carpooling to work or events or even to the grocery store on regular days. If no one's going your way, join or start a local car share program to find a passenger. Here's another good clue. Use less detergent. Did you know that most people unconsciously use more than they need to wash the dishes or clean their clothes? And while you're at it, use low phosphate washing liquids. Phosphates stimulate algae growth when discharged into the water supply, that lowers oxygen level and kills plants and fish. Oh and speaking of washing things, only use the dishwasher when it has a full load. It uses 12 gallons of water whether it's full of dishes or not. And only wash a full load of laundry. Your washing machine uses 40 gallons of water. Run it on full or adjust the water level to the size of your load. Here's another idea. Collect rainwater. Not every ounce of water you use has to come out of the local water supply or even out of your own well. Rainwater can be used for a lot of things. So how are we doing on the tests? Are most of these suggestions part of your behaviors? Here are some more from the Environmental Protection Agency of the state of Ohio in the United States. First, some ways to make sure we are continuing to have clean air. Getting ready to paint your house? Use only latex paint. Oil-based paints release hydrocarbon fumes. And by the way, donate your leftover paint to a community project. Most people fail to use as much as a half gallon, or 6.2 liters of the paint they buy each year. Multiply that by the number of people who buy painting, we're talking about eliminating a lot of waste. Get your car tuned-up, it'll get better gas mileage and emit fewer pollutants. And when you buy gas, don't top off the tank. Overfilling causes spills that release hydrocarbons and other toxic chemicals into the air. Here's another good idea. Water your lawn in the early morning when the water will soak in and not evaporate in the heat of the day. And remember that established lawns need only one inch of water a week. And the sidewalk and the driveway don't need any. Set your sprinkler to keep the water on the lawn. Use that rainwater you collected to wash your car. Have a couple of extra buckets near by to rinse it off. And use a broom to clean your driveway and sideway instead of spraying with a hose. Don't let water run while you shave or brush your teeth. Turn it on only when you need it. Every minute the faucet runs, five gallons of water go down the drain. Did you know that? Take a shorter shower. And install faucet aerators. You can cut your water usage by up to 6%. Keep the land clean by carrying everything that can be taken to the recycling center. Take a canvas bag to the grocery store and you re-use it every time you shop and say no to plastic bags as much as possible. Use both sides of your copy paper. Set your copier and use your printer in a way that makes double-sided copies wherever practical. And you'll substantially reduce your paper use. Oh and here's another idea. Use rechargeable batteries. Many batteries contain metals that are better kept out of landfills. If you're noticing that some of these ideas are suggestions you've often heard but simply do not do, or do not do on a regular basis, this is your chance to move up to the next level and become a real protector of the planet on which you live. It's sometimes hard to convince people that these kinds of conservation measures can really produce any serious outcomes or actually generate meaningful results. And the truth of it is, that if only one or two people do use them, they can't and won't produce meaningful results. But if more and more people use them and if eventually we can reach critical mass in the number of people who use them, then the up-shift in the quality of our ecology can be enormous. The fastest way to create critical mass, if you have an interest in doing so, is to allow yourself to be a model of the behaviors that can produce it. And you'll find that it really is easy to demonstrate these behaviors because it truly is the little things that you do differently that can make a difference in the big things that you do daily. Examples? Well The Guardian newspaper published in Great Britain offers its own list of 50 on its internet site. Here are a few of those. Wrap gifts in fabric and tie them with a ribbon. Both are more easily reusable. Drive slower and you'll use 25% less fuel. Use airtight food containers which can be reused. Obviously sandwich bags and plastic wrap can't. Grow as much of your own food as your situation in life will allow or obtain as much as you can from your local growers' market. So energy is not wasted on long haul transportation to get food to you. You see what I'm saying? We're talking about small things here. Really small things that are easy to do. For instance, grow plants to give to friends instead of cut flowers. Bring a mug to the office instead of using polystyrene cups. Cook for friends or extended family. Large quantities of food use less packaging than the same quantity in individualized portions. And they also take less energy to cook. Drink tap or filtered water, not bottled water. Invest in a washing line. Tumble dryers devour electricity. And as I noted in an earlier installment of this program, you'll find there's nothing quite like the fragrance of wind and sun dried clothing and bedsheets. Improve the ambiance and dine by candlelight twice a week, all year long. It'll amaze you how much electricity this would save if everyone in your city did this. Insulate your home. Cavity wall insulation can cut heat loss through the wall by up to 60%. Buy from companies with eco-friendly policies, boycott those without. So okay, we've made the point. List is long enough. There are a hundred things you could do to help the planet, to protect the earth, to save your home from the continuing ravages of its inhabitants. And if you don't think that the members of our civilization are ravaging their own environment, take a look around. Then decide, as one who has taken the quest, to play your gentle but obvious to all who see role, in demonstrating what it means to care for this place that you and yours have called home as far back as your family's history extends. And never think that little can come of the small actions you take, arising out of the big decisions you make to be the personification of love, not just for all living things, but for Gaia herself, a part of life that is as much a living thing as any living thing on it. Now then, today's assignment. Do something specific in the next 24 hours to protect and preserve the environment in which you live, be it in your home, your neighborhood, your community, or the world at large. And thanks for caring. And I'll see you on the day of our next Quest.

LESSON 27: Behaviour #12: Never Poison Yourself
--------------------
<v ->Hello, and welcome to the closing days of your Quest.</v> The challenges of these past days have been, in some cases, extremely personal to your experience and, in other cases, may have seemed related more generally to the broad-based experience of humanity as a whole. They have, nevertheless, been relevant to your own journey because, of course, you are part of the broad-based experience of humanity as a whole, and perhaps far more exciting and inspiring to your soul, you are part of that which can assist in re-creating the experience of humanity as a whole, a role that, as I've mentioned early in this Quest, you may never have thought of playing until now or that you may, in fact, have often thought of playing but did not know how in specific terms that you might have a chance to do so. This Quest was designed to offer you that chance, to move in 21 days into a new and grander experience of yourself, yet advancing not only your own evolutionary process but playing a role in the awakening of our species. I spent 50 years as an actor in semiprofessional and professional theater, and while I may never have made it to the big time in the houses of London or New York, Paris or Sydney, Moscow or Tokyo, I did play enough of the stages in regional theaters to have heard over and over again the ancient theater maxim there are no small roles, only small actors. So I know that in life itself, as well as on the stage where life is portrayed in ways that give us a better understanding of it, even the smallest role can have the biggest impact on the outcome of the plot. William Shakespeare had it exactly right when he wrote, "All the world's a stage "and all the men and women merely players. "They have their exits and their entrances, "and one man in his time plays many parts." What part shall you play now, my friend? In what role shall you cast yourself as the plot thickens with twists and turns we never thought it would take, either in our own script or in the script of the world? That's what this Quest is about, and so today, another challenge, one where just a small change in your behaviors could benefit many of those who look to you to model for them a wonder-filled way of moving through the world. Here is the guidance offered today from the list of 16 behaviors that mark the difference between Highly Evolved Beings and those humans living in an unawakened state. An awakened species never poisons itself. Humans in an unawakened state do so often. We'll begin by understanding and acknowledging the many forms that our poisoning of the human body takes. Our self-inflicted poisons are mental, emotional, and physical. First on our list is our thoughts. We have already explored earlier in this program the advisability of eliminating any negative thoughts as a response to the sudden arising of unwelcome situations or circumstances in our life or even any attacks from other people. We were offered the immortal words of two masters, Buddha and Jesus, on how we might best respond when darkness visits as it does in every life and, in most cases, far more than once. We have learned through the years from other teachers and sources, as well, many times and in many ways that negativity can only breed negativity, that the universe is nothing but a Xerox machine making immaculate and crystal-clear copies of what whatever we put into it. We've heard from teachers like Emile Coue and Norman Vincent Peale in the early part and the middle part of the last century to the producers of the movie The Secret and spiritual author and teacher Esther Hicks in the beginning of this century. You've heard from all of them, all about the power of positive thinking and by inversion about the danger of negative thinking. It is a toxin, for sure, powerful enough in its impact to rank at the top of the list of ways in which human beings poison themselves. To rid ourselves of this poison, we are invited to look at our own thoughts as they arise throughout each day. What is the first idea that comes to mind when you receive a notice that the boss wants to talk to you? Do we think that she's going to surprise us with a raise, or do we think that she's going to give us a promotion and place a greater responsibility on us, giving us a place in management, or do we think, uh oh, what have I done now? What have I done wrong? Is the company in trouble? It is my job being cut? What's the first thing that overcomes you, the first feeling that rises within you? One of joyous anticipation or one of nervous concern, and how do you react to other things in your life, to a rainy day or the toast that burns or that important item you can't find or the computer that just erased all of your work? How do you react to people of whom you do not approve, to events that do not go exactly your way, to outcomes that don't manifest as you planned, to simply hearing a song that you don't enjoy or a joke that you didn't think was very funny or a story, the story of woe of someone with whom you have run out of patience? What's the first thing you think of and respond with when an idea is proposed by someone else, any thought or solution to a mutually held problem? Is it more often than not a positive response or more often than not a negative response? Is it one that provides another with encouragement or offers discouragement? Are you one who almost always thinks first of the best possible outcomes or one who always considers first all of the worst-case scenarios? Only you can answer these questions, and only you can know how much of the poison of negativity you are allowing your mind to manufacture and to send out into the world with its automatic guarantee that it will come back to you. So let's talk more specifically now for just a moment or two here about these most powerful poisons of all, your negative emotions. Many people get their stomach churning and their minds in turmoil over what turn out to be some of the smallest things, and when you ask them about it, they say I couldn't help it. I was just overcome with emotion. Yet, here is something that I think is very important for us to understand. All emotions are chosen. Emotions are not things that happen to us. They are things that happen through us. We don't lose our temper. We choose our temper. We experience the emotions we experience because we want to. We do so by choice. Now, not many people see it that way. They would tell you that emotions are the things that happen to them. Why would anybody deliberately choose to have a negative emotion, they might ask. I can't help the way I feel. The way I feel is the way I feel. Am I supposed to pretend that I don't feel that way? Well, my answer is no, I believe we should never pretend. We should always be true to our feelings and never be inauthentic, but I also believe that we can choose our feelings. First, in response to the majority of life's events, we can actually choose the way we're going to feel ahead of time. So you don't have to be surprised by our feelings or controlled by them. We can decide beforehand what emotion we're going to express. How's this possible? Well, it's because most of the events that generate emotions in our day-to-day experience are predictable. We can know ahead of time that many of these events are going to occur. Someone is going to disappoint us. Someone is going to frustrate us. Something is going to upset us, or at least, it'll have all the potential to do so because that's what similar events have done in the past, but since we can predict that events which usually generate a certain kind of emotional content are very likely to occur in the average life, you can almost make a list of these events. You could decide ahead of time how you're going to respond in a new way the next time something similar occurs. This is when you truly take charge of your life. This is how you truly create your reality because your reality is not produced by events outside of you but by events inside of you, and by deciding ahead of time that you're not going to entertain negativity in response to predictably unwelcome occurrences, both big and small, in your life, you can stop poisoning yourself by letting negative energy flow through you and from you. This could save you all sorts of health complications, from simple headaches to ulcers to heart attacks. So it's a good thing to pay attention to. Another way that humans poison themselves is through not what comes out of their mind and mouth but what they put in. What kinds of movies do you go to? What kinds of television shows do you watch? What kinds of books do you read? What kinds of food do you eat? What kinds of liquids do you drink? What kinds of things do you inhale? How, if in any way, might you be poisoning yourself? Be honest. You don't have to talk to anyone else about this. Just conduct a simple self-assessment, a private self-assessment, but be honest. Tell the truth to yourself about yourself, and if you're poisoning yourself in any way that you can quickly and easily identify, ask yourself what stops you from stopping yourself from doing that? As we move into the final days of your quest, commit not letting one more day go by without looking deeply and honestly at whether you're treating your mind and your body as the sacred vessels they are, designed as the carriers and expressions of the soul during this journey through life, or whether you are, as some people do, actually taking better care of your car than you do of yourself. Before I conclude our exploration of the subject, I'd like to talk about the connection between the many ways in which we poison our body and a particular practice among human beings that's very common. It's called self-sabotage. It's a kind of self-defeating behavior that can include, not only what you're doing, but what you're not doing, failing to exercise, for instance, even though your doctor has told you that exercise is what's needed by your body right now, jamming too many things into your appointment calendar, even though you know it's going to create more stress than you really should be asking yourself to handle, skipping meals and making up for them by grabbing snacks in the middle of the day because you're too busy to stop to eat nutritiously, not getting enough sleep and running your tank on empty way too much of the time. Make sure you're not engaging in a subtle form of self-sabotage, stopping yourself from reaching the highest level of success, joy, and happiness in what you are capable of doing in this lifetime. If any of these behaviors are familiar to you, just take a look at what you're doing to yourself, and ask yourself why am I doing that? Then tell yourself, okay, okay, I'm done with it. I'm done with sabotaging myself. I'm done with hurting myself. I'm done with poisoning myself. Sound like a good idea? Sure, it does, but remember a point we made in an earlier exploration in this program. The easiest promises to break are the promises we make to ourselves. Allow yourself to be a reliable person around all of the challenges that ending self-poisoning would require. Okay, so here are today's assignments. Number one, name at least three self-poisoning behaviors that you can identify as occurring in the world today, and commit to undertaking personal participation and specific involvement in both organized and individual efforts to curb those behaviors. Number two, bring to an end the most damaging of your own self-poisoning behaviors this day, and challenge yourself to never repeat them again. Got it? Good, and I'll see you on the day of our next Quest.

LESSON 28: Behaviour #13: Never Compete
--------------------
<v ->We're going to discuss today a behavior that is engaged in</v> by virtually every business, every religion, every educational institution, every doctor, every lawyer, every sibling in every family and frankly, just about everyone you know. It's surprising just how widespread this behavior is, given the fact that it never produces happy outcomes for hardly anyone involved. Here's the guidance for today that helps us to capture the essence of what we want to explore. An awakened species never competes. Humans in an unawakened state are often in competition with each other. Competition became a staple of human behavior in the earliest days of human experience. And for a very simple reason. They didn't see that there was enough to be happy, enough to be content, or even enough to survive. This was a mistaken notion, of course, but primitive humanity had no way of knowing that. Only as we have matured as a species has it become apparent to us that there's more than enough of all that we need. We still don't have the experience of this as a species. But that's not because there's not enough, it's because, well, there's no will within the collective human heart to share in a way that no one has to go without. Where there's a will, there's a way. Where there is no will, there is no way. But in the earliest days of our time upon the Earth, we didn't know that there was enough. It looked for all the world to us that there was simply not. So we began to compete with each other for the stuff of which there's not enough. Those competitions go on to this very day as we all know. And come to think of it, the reason today is the same as it was back then. I said just a moment ago, that as we have matured as a species, it's become clear to us that there's enough of all the things we need to be happy, but you know what? As I think about it, I realize I was wrong. Even today, human beings live under the illusion that there's not enough. We've actually created the experience of insufficiency in the space of sufficiency. We've touched on this before in this program so we're not going to go over it again here but we'll simply note, that our competitions have never ended. Competitions for money, our competitions for power, our competitions for resources, our competitions for love, for sex, for members of our group, our competitions for just about everything. We're even in competition for God! We call those competitions religion. We call our other competitions, good business, or sport, or fair game. But whatever we call them, this behavior creates winners and losers. And when what the losers are losing is their dignity, their equal standing, their equal opportunity, or their very lives, it no longer feels very much like fair game. In fact it feels like just the opposite. Nevertheless, humanity continues its competitions. It's another one of those behaviors that don't work but we just do it anyway. We just keep on doing it. What would serve us on this planet is to create a new definition for winning. In a society of Highly Evolved Beings, the definition becomes obvious and simple. Nobody wins unless everybody wins. We talked about this on the day that we explored the concept of ownership. It's even a bigger part of this conversation because the whole point of competition is to create losers. Now when the point of anything is to create a loser, how elevated can that activity be? What level of wonderfulness can such an activity claim? There are those who would say that the purpose of competition is not to create losers but to create excellence, being in competition with another, they say, makes people and organizations strive for a higher level of performance. Which, it is claimed, will produce a grander outcome. But is this in fact what competition is producing in most human endeavors? In most human endeavors, business, relationships, political activity, religious outreach, non-profit undertakings, wouldn't cooperation produce a better outcome? Wouldn't it produce the best outcome of all? Of course it would. That's patently obvious to anyone who looks at it honestly and objectively. That's why in highly evolved societies, there is no place for competition. There's no place for any activity that produces what is not so good for some, in order to produce what is very good for others. It either produces what is very good for all, or it doesn't happen. Competition is understood in human terms to be a rivalry that arises whenever at least two parties are striving for a goal which cannot be shared. And so, where one's gain is the other's loss. In a species that is fully awake there's no such thing as a goal which can't be shared. That's because in a species that's fully awake, everyone understands that they're all but individual expressions of the same single being. Humans have still not come to an understanding of this, therefore they find it quite easy to do to others what they would never want others to do to them. Hence, competition feels perfectly okay. Even ruthless competition is embraced as part of our society. Even if it does produce big time winners and big time losers. This is so often called a zero-sum game, but it's not game at all to those who wind up with a zero. It's very often, as I said before, a matter of survival. And this leads to the question, what would happen, what would occur, if we gave up all forms of competition and replaced them with cooperation in working toward a common goal? Such a radical notion could change everything on Earth. It could change everything in one's own household. Conversations around the breakfast table could be changed from a battle of words to an exchange of ideas. Could shift from being an effort to win the point, to an effort to win the heart of the other. Here then, is today's assignment. Wherever you go today, and whatever you do today, repeat the following five words in your mind over and over again. I don't need to win. I don't need to win. I don't need to win. And I'll see you next time.

LESSON 30: Behaviour #14: The Illusion of Need
--------------------
<v ->We're going to look today</v> at one of the most fundamental concepts affecting the daily life of human beings, the idea that you need something. Now, here's today's guiding statement with regard to this. An awakened species is clear that it needs nothing. Humans in an unawakened state often create a need-based experience. Conversations with God tells us that the idea that need exists is one of the 10 illusions of humans. It's the first illusion. That single misunderstanding has created more negative impact in the human experience than any other idea human beings have ever had. The thought that we need something is born of the complete misunderstanding or what might more accurately be described as the total lack of awareness of both our true identity and our true purpose. A complete transformation occurs in our lives when we reach clarity on these matters and begin to live from that place, the place of absolute knowing with regard to all of this. We have already looked at these topics in this Quest so let's just do a quick review of them here. Who you are is a three-part being. You got that? We are all three-part beings made up of body, mind and soul. And your being is an aspect of divinity and individuation of the divine, a singularization of the singularity, a derivative of the essential essence. You are a part of God, an expression of God even as a wave is a part of and an expression of the ocean. You're not separate from God nor are you other than God. Such a thing would be impossible given that God is all there is. All things are one thing. There is only one thing and all things are part of the one thing there is. So that is your true identity. Now, as for your true purpose, you have physicalized in order that you might demonstrate and experience your true identity, your true essence and your fundamental nature. You exist and all of life exists because it is God's desire to produce the highest expression of itself in physical form. Because you do not know this or because you may know it but may not believe it, you have found yourself living inside of the illusion of need. You imagine that there are things you need to be happy. And more important that there are things you need to simply survive. Although this appears to be true, it's not true because with you, survival is not the issue. Continuance of your physical life, in your physical form presently may be a desire but your survival is never in question. You are an eternal being and your soul will live forever. It always was, is now and always will be. Therefore what you are doing here on the earth is not trying to survive but rather seeking to express and thus to know in your experience who you really are. Because survival is not the issue, there's nothing in particular that you need. There may be some things that you desire as you seek to express your true identity but that's not the same thing at all as having a need. You may desire to have a life made but you do not need to have a life made. You may desire to have a high income but you do not need to have a high income, you may desire to have a beautiful home and a good car but you do not need to have a beautiful home and a good car. There is in fact very little that you actually need in life to be totally happy, absolutely content, completely peaceful and fully expressed. Our human culture, of course, has told us otherwise. And that is the basis of our discontent, of our lack of peace and of our frequent unhappiness. Now, I'm going to ask you to grant me the indulgence here of repeating just a little bit of my personal history to remind you of the context within which you may consider how I know what I'm talking about. For me, the idea that you don't need a bunch of possessions, a beautiful home, a big income or a life mate to be perfectly happy is not a theory. This is not an idea I have which may or may not be true in actuality, I know it is true in actuality because I lived it. As I shared with you when we talked earlier in this program about the concept of ownership, remember? I told you that I spent a year of my life living on the sidewalk, living on the street, a series of events produced this circumstance. It's not necessarily to get into that right here. What does matter is that I was there living on the outside in the weather with no roof over my head, no possessions, no income, no money that I could have saved or could fall back on and nobody close to me to hold me in their arms and give me comfort. So I know what it means to live without any of this. And I know that experientially, not conceptually. I also know that on many of the days that I was living this way, especially toward the end of that year there were days and times when I was totally happy, absolutely content and completely peaceful. So I learned from that experience that it was not the exterior aspects in my life that produced happiness and peace but the interior aspects. It was what was happening inside of me not what was happening outside of me that made the difference. I want you to know that I'm very much aware as we move forward with this discussion that what I'm saying now may sound trite and cliched to you and I apologize if it does but I can't change the truth simply because it isn't very original. There you have it. There's really very little that you need, if anything, to be perfectly happy in your life and absolutely nothing at all that you need to be fully expressed as an individuation of divinity. In fact, there's a reason why most of the saints and sages we have honored through the ages have had very little in the way of personal possessions. They allowed themselves to be in this world but not of it in the sense that they were not striving for, yearning for or reaching for fame or fortune, success or achievement, property or possessions, love or companionship, nor any of the things that so many people find themselves striving to experience or wishing to acquire. Does that make these things wrong? Are we somehow less spiritually advanced, less spiritually developed if we desire these things? No. No, there's absolutely nothing wrong with having a desire for some of the good things in life. We may want to be careful however about how we define what those things are and we may want to pay attention to our emotional state of being as we seek to achieve them. Are we nervous or upset much of the time? Are we feeling pressured and anxious more than we would like? Are we exhausted and depleted much too often. If your answer to any of these questions is yes, if you want to take a look at the priorities that you've established in your life and see if rearranging some of them may be in order. I've got a question that I routinely ask members of my audience when I'm giving a lecture. Can you think of time, I say to them, can you think of a time when you felt there was something you had to have in order to feel secure, content, or happy? And can you think of a time when you felt that way but didn't actually get what you felt you needed? And can you think of a time when having not experienced what you felt you needed, you found yourself later feeling secure content and happy anyway? If you've had this experience, raise your hand. And you know what? Nearly everybody in the audience puts their hand in the air. It's a very common experience to imagine that we need certain conditions to manifest in our lives in order for us to be happy only to find later on that we have no problem being happy without them. That should tell you all you have to know about this business of need. And if as a result of this reassessment you do in fact begin rearranging your priorities, you may want to start by saying to yourself, "Whoa, wait a minute, what am I doing here? "Why am I on the earth? "What's the real purpose of my existence? "And how will I know that I have achieved "what I came here to experience? "What's my yardstick, what's my measuring device?" The spiritual masters, the gurus and teachers I was mentioning a little while ago, they were not addicted to having any of the things that many people have set as their priorities today. You know that you are addicted to something as opposed to simply preferring something if the absence of it robs you of your happiness. The trick in life is to change your addictions into preferences. I owe that phrase to a marvelous author and teacher named Ken Keyes who wrote an extraordinary book before he celebrated his continuation day called 'A Handbook to Higher Consciousness'. If you've ever found yourself caught up with the idea that there are things you really need to be happy, I strongly encourage you to find and read this book. 'The Handbook to Higher Consciousness' can change your life for the better overnight. For now, here's today's assignment. Change your requirement if you notice yourself having any of every present moment. Let everything you think, say and do today, arise from an inner conviction. There's nothing other than what is here right now that you need to be totally content, utterly peaceful and completely happy. Demonstrate this in your state of being no matter what occurs on this day. Make an entry in your awakening journal before going to sleep tonight of any moment or situation today in which changing your requirement of a moment became a challenge. Ask yourself and deeply explore why that felt the way it did. What was challenging about that and why do you think it was? And I will challenge you now to be here tomorrow.

LESSON 32: Behaviour #15: Unconditional Love
--------------------
<v ->This could be one of the most interesting</v> days of this entire program. It could be also the single most challenging. Here's the guidance statement around which today's exploration will revolve. An awakened species experiences and expresses unconditional love for everyone. Humans in an unawakened state often cannot even imagine a deity who does this, much less do they do it themselves. It's sad for me to notice that from the beginning of time, all we have ever wanted is to love and be loved. And from the beginning of time, all we have ever done is create rules and regulations, guidelines and criteria, cultural traditions and social customs, religious instructions, and the legal definitions telling us who, when, where, how, and why we may love, and who, when, where, why, and how we may not. We have created on this planet an experience called conditional love that is, I love you if... For most of us, that experience began when we were very young. Our parents didn't tell us that in so many words, of course, they simply demonstrated it in a very powerful way with their actions. I love you if, they told us with their actions. I love you if you go to sleep without nagging to stay up when it's bedtime. I love you if you don't talk back when I ask you to do something, or when I ask you to stop doing something. I love you if you don't keep teasing your sister. I love you if you cut your hair and don't wear those clothes, and get good grades, and don't hang around with those kids who call themselves your friends. Parents, of course, did not see themselves as withholding their loving during these instances. They simply withheld their approval. But to us during this fragile time in our lives, the withholding of approval felt like the withholding of love. We couldn't tell the difference, we were too young. And so we conflated the two and turned them into one. It's a small wonder that when we became adults, many of us did the same thing. We found ourselves receiving love and giving love to others conditionally. This evidence is itself in any examination of the behaviors of the human race. Yet as we mature, we remember how to express love purely. What does pure love mean? Purely means with nothing intended or needed as a return for the self. Pure love is an act of selflessness foundationed in the self's awareness that it needs, requires, must demand nothing to be perfectly happy, a point we have continued to make throughout this class. This is the natural state of godliness, which incidentally is why God requires, demands and commands nothing at all from us, least of all abject subjugation, or degrading, debasing, demeaning, groveling, and fearful worship. God doesn't need those things. So you know that you have found love purely and given love purely when there's nothing in it for you, or when it is actually non-beneficial to you. In truth of course, such a thing would of course be impossible. Every pure expression of love brings benefit to the lover, in that it brings all those who purely love the highest and fullest experience of who they really are, the highest experience it's possible for life to provide. The ultimate purpose of life itself is the ultimate experience of divinity itself through the ultimate expression of love itself, which is the ultimate definition of God itself. Did you hear what I just said? Let me repeat that. I want you to really take in what I just said. I said that the ultimate purpose of life itself is the ultimate experience of divinity itself through the ultimate expression of love itself, which is the ultimate definition of God itself. Wow. How beautiful. But is it possible for a human being to express and experience this? Is it possible to ever really feel this kind of love? Not only is it possible, every human being has done so. There is not a human being on the planet who has not felt it already. Perhaps they felt it when holding a baby in their arms. Perhaps they felt this kind of love for a place, or for some physical object, even something as seemingly insignificant as a favorite pillow or a stuffed animal. Perhaps they've felt this kind of love for a plant or a tree, or a sunrise, or the night sky. Have you not ever felt love for the night sky? I mean really, have you never looked up at the night sky and felt your whole being filled with love? Now you might call that awe, awe and appreciation, but this is the highest form of love. Awe and appreciation is the highest form of love because it wants and needs, demands and receives nothing in return. Everyone has felt this kind of love. And this is the love God has for us, every single one of us, regardless, by the way, of what we have done or not done, of what we have mistaken or not mistaken, of what we have believed or do not believe. Humans are capable of loving the way God loves. Each of us has already done so. When you love something for the sheer beauty of it, for the sheer wonder of it, for the sheer joy of it, for the happiness it brings you to feel that energy that glows inside of you and they sent out from you when you've loved that way, you have loved purely. And if you're looking to get something back as your reward for sending it out, then you're not loving something or someone else, you're loving yourself, and simply using something or someone else as a means of doing so. Now you might say, hold it, wait a minute, what's wrong with loving yourself? Doesn't all love begin with self-love? And the answer, the answer is yes, but self-love is not love that is received from anything outside of the self. Self-love is love of the self by the self for the sheer beauty, the sheer wonder, the sheer joy of the self being who and what it truly is. See, this is how God loves God's self, and this is how God invites you to love each other and to love yourself. I recall when I was told this in my conversation with God. My reply? I recall what I said exactly. I said, I wish I could do that. I wish I could really love myself that way, I really do, I mean wholly, completely, all the time. But it's hard for me to do that with all my faults, all my foibles, all my feelings. And God said to me, "Here we go again. "I'm telling you again as I've told you before, "as I've told you many times, "you are perfect just as you are. "You are perfect. "Even as you see nothing but beauty "and perfection in a one-day-old newborn, "or a one-week-old infant, or a one-month-old baby, "or a one-year-old child, so do I see nothing "but perfection in you. "And I would see this, by the way, "if you were 100,000 years old, "for that would still be less than a single heartbeat "in the life of the universe. "You are growing and expanding and enlarging "and completing your experience of your true self "through your expression in the realm of the physical, "here on this magnificent planet you have called earth, "and we will meet in perfect union again "when you return home. "And as I have promised you through all of your lifetimes, "you will never, no, not for a moment "be without me while you are away. "I love you now as I have loved you always," says God, "with a purity that asks, "needs, and demands nothing in return, "for you and I are eternally one, "and the experience of this is all that our self desires." That response that I received from God filled my heart and healed my mind, as you can imagine. Such it is to be loved without condition, to be loved without limitation, to be loved without stipulation or constraints, without requirements or specifications of any kind, to be loved simply because I am, and to love another simply because they are. You know that you are truly loving that very special person in your life in this very special way when you need, request, demand, require, and expect nothing, nothing from them at all in order to receive your undying devotion and your unlimited love. When you give of yourself completely and totally to them without even subtly hoping to get something out of it, something in return, not because you don't desire to receive something in return, but because that's not the reason that you are giving what you are giving. I only wish that someone had told me that when I was young. When I was a young man, I thought I could earn someone else's love. I really did, I thought that love was something that I should be earning, not something that I should be taking for granted. And you know what, my motivations seemed to be so pure to me, but of course in the end, they were still entirely self-serving. The love of another cannot be earned, nor should another be required to earn your love. When we enter into this kind of arrangement, we have simply set up a trade agreement, much as nations enter into such an agreement with each other, you give me this and I'll give you that. Then on Valentine's Day, we'll look everywhere for just the right card to give to our beloved. Oh, my darling, my dearest, on this special day, I want you to know, my beloved, that I trade you very much. I will never stop trading you. I will trade you until the end of time. But of course, inherent in relationships built on such an unspoken promise is a clear understanding: if you stop trading me, I'll stop trading you. If I'm not getting out of the relationship what I got into the relationship for, I will need to be out of the relationship for good. But the purpose of relationship has never been to see what we could get out of it, but to see what we could put into it. It's all very wonderful to say to another, my life was not complete until I found you. But the purpose of love is not to find completion, it's to demonstrate that you're already complete, and to share your completion with the other. Unconditional love says to the beloved, my will for you is your will for you. I want for you what you want for you. I will never stand in judgment of you, nor will I ever stand in your way. I'll never stop you from getting your way, because when you're getting your way, I'm getting my way. This is my way of loving you. And that's what's meant by pure love, unconditional love. And this is what is experienced by beings who are fully awakened. I was tempted to conclude the message of today's quest by saying that I hope you will find this kind of love in your life with another, but I don't. I don't. I hope that you will provide this kind of love in your life to another, then you will be fulfilled. Then you will have completed your agenda here on earth. And there will be nothing left for you to do but to experience it over and over again, and then you will be in heaven. Now here is today's assignment. Remember a time when someone demonstrated that they loved you unconditionally. Write a note about that in your Awakening Journal. If your experience is that you've never been loved in this way, write about that, describing how it feels and what this tells you about how you choose to love others. And I know that I'm going to love being with you for our next quest. You got to love it.

LESSON 34: Behavior #16: Metaphysics
--------------------
<v ->On this day,</v> you'll be invited to empower yourself in a way that you may never have thought possible. In a way that you may never have felt before. The guidance supporting the exploration of this day is this: What's being said in this item is that the scope and breath of universal wisdom and creative metaphysical power is largely unused by humanity. Let me offer you an example. A little while ago, I told you that a man named Emile Coue proved the effectiveness of autosuggestion in the early part of the 20th century. Working with troops who have been wounded in the first World War, he conducted an experiment. He went from soldier to soldier and asked everyone of them to say one hundred times from morning till night, every day in every way, I get better and better. Every day in every way, I get better and better. Every day in every way, I get better and better. What do you think happened? Of course, I'm sure you already know the answer. To those who he gave the suggestion and who repeated it, one hundred times from dawn till dusk, their wounds were healed more rapidly and more completely than those who did not receive the instruction. Since you already knew the answer that I was going to give you, let me ask you a question. Have you heard of this process before? Have you ever used it? Have you used it as a tool? Or, any similar process as a tool, in dealing with your own physical ailments? I can tell you that in the early part of my adult life, I never used it, even though I had heard of it. I can recall people telling me about the power of autosuggestion. Emile Coue's marvelous statement. "Every day in every way, I get better and better." I believed at that point in my life, that the energetic power, power of the mind, can affect the energetic signature of cells within the body. But you know what? Even knowing that, I never used this method to address any of my physical ailments or conditions. Case closed. At least for me, case closed. Now it may be true that our human society is simply not ready on a grand scale to grapple with metaphysics. To deal with what some have called alchemy and to rigorously apply what so many have called the power of positive thinking. So many visuals have done it. And some spiritual groups, relatively small as a proportion of the whole population have done it, but as a civilization, we have not come anywhere near harnessing the power of metaphysics. Humanity is however becoming more and more aware of it, and is moving step by step in that direction. You might remember that there was a movie and a book out a few years ago called, "The Secret." That book, that movie talked about the power that lies within us to create our own reality, and as an illustration of this, the movie showed a man finding a car, the car of his dreams in the driveway. It showed a woman suddenly noticing a diamond necklace adorning her bodice. Even a nine year old boy rejoicing over the shiny new bicycle just outside the back door. But these are just our first baby steps. I couldn't help but wonder if the secret was so powerful, why wasn't it being used to create say world peace? This idea wasn't even mentioned in the movie as a possible application, pretty much letting us know where the members of our species place world peace, vis-a-vis new cars, diamond necklaces and shiny new bikes on the scale of importance, or at least where the movie's producers assumed that we place it. But we could of course actually create world peace using basic metaphysics. I've got a wonderful friend named John Hagelin who has traveled the globe making this exact point. A renowned quantum physicist, scientist and public policy expert, Dr. Hagelin offers us this from his writings, and I'm going to quote him. "Most people don't know how deeply their own consciousness "is connected to the collective fate of the planet, "or how they can use a powerful, "scientifically-tested technology of consciousness "to help create world peace on earth virtually overnight. "More than 50 demonstration projects and 23 studies "published in leading peer-reviewed journals "have shown that this consciousness-based approach "to world peace neutralizes the ethnic, political "and religious tensions in society "that give rise to crime, violence, terrorism and war. "This approach has been tested "on the local, state, national and international level, "and it has worked every single time, "resulting in highly significant drops "in negative social trends, "and improvements in positive trends. "Large groups of peace creating experts, "practicing these technologies of consciousness together, "dived deep within themselves "to the most fundamental level of mind and matter, "which physics called the unified field. "From that level of life, "they create a tidal wave of harmony and coherence "that can permanently alter society for the better "as the research confirms. "And this consciousness-based approach is holistic, "easy to implement, non-invasive, "and of course, cost effective." So the question is what would it take for us to use this? To use what I call this spiritual technology? I'm not quoting Doctor Hagelin anymore. I'm asking the question. And the answer is simple. It would take nothing more than us awakening. Even just the beginning awareness of these things could get things started on a larger scale. I was struck by one of the video programs that John Hagelin made about this which ended with this quote. He said, "There is more evidence that group mediation "can turn off war like a light switch, "than there is evidence that aspirin reduces headache pain." Did you hear that? There you have it. Tell everyone you know and have them tell everyone they know metaphysics works. It's the linchpin of the universe. And highly evolved beings know this. So I invite you to begin using metaphysics on a regular basis in your life if you're not already doing so. Let me give you some tools that could be very useful in this regard. These tools are thought, word and deed. Now I suspect you've heard all of this before, but are you using these tools to maximum effectiveness? Are you clear that every thought is a prayer? Are you certain that your words are instructions to the universe? Are you aware that everything you do in life is being done unto you? Maybe not in this exact moment, but sometime in your life it'll all come back to you exactly as you meted it out. This is not a form of punishment or retribution. This is a form of metaphysics playing their effect. This is the only way that life has of showing us that there's only one of us, only one moment as well. There's only you, there's only here, there's only now. There's only you, here, now. If you all know this, and if you practice it, you'll use everything that you think, say and do, not simply as a tool, but as a gift, a marvelous empowering present from the universe that allows us to be present in the universe, bringing us the wondrous and the glorious opportunity to announce and declare, express and fulfill, become and experience who we really are. God did not put us here in this reality adrift on a raging sea with neither a motor nor an oar, nor even a paddle to steer the boat of our life, to get us to the other shore. No, no, no. God would never do that to us and has not done that to us. She's given us all the equipment we need. He has supplied us with all the power that's required to get us safely back home. My wife, the American poet, Em Claire, captured this perfectly in her poem, Long at Sea. I'd like to close this quest with a reading of that poem. "I left home so long ago now "that I would not recognize my own face. "I constructed the boat of my life, "and I set out into the open sea, "waving to all who knew that the seas "would give me everything I could handle "and everything I could not. "And yet they waved and I set out into the open sea, "in the boat of my life, "built from soul, crafted by heart. "And with great innocence, "I pushed out into the open sea. "And I've been away from my home so long now, "I would not recognize my own face, "but I know that home, "home remembers me." And so now today's assignment. Stop moving through life, stop paddling through the sea of your life without specific purpose or intention for every moment. Use the statements I find, I create, I will, I am as commands purposefully and with intention, and look to see if it changes your experience of daily life in any way. Track this experiment in metaphysics in your awakening journal. Number two, if any negative thought comes into your mind today, change your mind about that immediately. Don't give it a second thought. Don't give it a second thought. Use this day to begin training yourself in this spiritual practice. Challenge yourself to rigorous training, knowing that it will require vigilance and discipline. And know this, as you continue on your journey, even though you've been away from home for so long, that you may not recognize your own face, always remember that home remembers you. I'll see you next time.

LESSON 35: Self Knowledge
--------------------
<v ->So I'm really, really proud of you</v> for taking a look at all of that really, very important stuff. Very important things to know. In today's message, we're going to be looking at what might be the most important single aspect of the entire Quest. It's something we've touched on before, talked about before, in the days that have just passed. But I want to really put a lot of emphasis on it right now, maybe more emphasis than I've placed on anything else, because it really is at the top of the list of things that it's important for us to grasp, to understand, to take in, to embrace, to express, to experience, if we really want to complete that quest, which is the quest to move to the next level in our expression and experience of who we really are. So, the guidance for today's message is this: Knowledge of the self and of its true identity lies at the heart of all spiritual transformation. There's nothing more important for you to know, for you to explore deeply, than this. Knowledge of the self lies at the heart of all true spiritual transformation. So I know on and off now, for the past several weeks, I've been touching on this and exploring this and sharing this with you. Let's get real clear what I mean by knowledge of the self, who and what you really are. That you're far more than just a human being. You are a human being, but a great deal more than that. You are an aspect of divinity. A singularization of the singularity. You're a demonstration of God in physical form. That's very difficult for some people to accept, for some people to believe, for some people to embrace, you know, because it sounds a bit grandiose, it sounds almost pretentious. It sounds to some people, actually, inappropriate. Some people would call that blasphemy, and would actually say that's apostasy or heresy. God would not say that. God's response to our statement, I am part of that which is, I am an aspect of divinity, I am an expression of God in human form, God would say, yes, yes, you got it, you finally got it. So to embrace that fully, and to know that completely, is in fact the most important aspect of this entire Quest. Now, there are some ways that you can know that. There are some ways that you can be aware that you have fully awakened and begun to really embody your actual identity. You don't have to walk around on the Earth wondering what that feels like, what that looks like, because God has given us in our Conversations with God Dialogues, ways for us to know completely that we have in fact finally awakened to our true selves based on our behaviors and on our responses to the physical life that we're living. I want to share that with you now, because my hope is at the end of this particular message, that you will have a specific way of measuring the degree to which you have awakened. I hope that you will embrace, actually claim as your own, a deep commitment to adopting the behaviors that demonstrate full awakening. So let's take a look at those behaviors, and see what it would feel like. I've identified five ways, as a result of my Conversations with God, that we can all know if we are fully awakened, or the degree to which we are, so shall we take a look at them? Number one, if you're fully awakened, you would not entertain negative thoughts in your mind, ever. If a negative thought did happen to slip in, you would get it out of your mind immediately. You wouldn't give it a second thought. You would think of something else, deliberately. You would simply change your mind about that. This is not a small thing, this is a major discipline in life. I have found it to be a personal discipline to simply decide that I'm never going to have a second thought about anything that's negative. Now, and I don't want you to think that somehow you're doing something wrong if some negative idea, or some negative energy should flow through your mind. It happens to all of us, of course, we're all just human. So this is not about going through life and never having a negative thought. It's about never dwelling on the negative thoughts that may occur to you. It's about letting that thought go right through your mind. I like to say, you know, how they say, in one ear and out the other? It's like letting it go in here and out there. So it's when we dwell on those negative thoughts, when we stay with it, when we give it a second thought, that's what we're talking about here, in terms of never hanging out with a negative thought. So just watch yourself, watch what you're thinking. We've talked about this earlier, watch what you're thinking, watch how you're thinking. And if you really aren't clear what you're thinking, that is, sometimes we don't even know what are thoughts are, we haven't thought about our thoughts, so to speak. I could tell you a way to know what your thoughts are, to measure your energy. It's how you're feeling. Feelings are the language of the soul. If you find yourself feeling down, you know how they say, feeling down and out, feeling blue, feeling less than totally vibrant, totally excited, totally happy, totally joyous to be alive, totally invigorated, and totally loving with regard to everything that's going on in the world and with regard to yourself. If you look at yourself in the mirror in the morning and you find yourself not totally loving yourself and all that's going on, then you know that somewhere along the way, you've picked up a negative thought. You've picked up some negative energy, and not only picked it up, as I mentioned, but you've hung onto it. You're hanging onto it, you're holding it. That's what you don't want to do. And you'll know it by the way you're feeling. When you've let go of all of your negative energy, negative energy that, I want to make this point again, because you're going to have negative thoughts because you're picking it up from all around you, look. We're in a milieu, we're in an environment, where there's negativity all around us! A movie we saw, or a comment that a person makes, or that we maybe even overhear, something we witness on the street or something we see on television, or something we read about in the news, whatever, negativity is all around us. It's virtually impossible to ignore it. And you know what's interesting? You wouldn't want to ignore it, because negativity is part of the contextual field. Positivity, negativity. It's part of the contextual field, which has been created for us by us, to allow us to know, to express and to experience who we really are. So in fact, in a way, when negative energy, negative thoughts, negative ideas, negative feelings, come into your experience, the fastest way to get rid of them is to be grateful for them. Oh, thank you, there's my fear again, there's my worry again, there's my anxiety again, yay, thanks, make friends. My lovely friend Debbie Ford, who has since celebrated her continuation day, but I knew her well and she's just a sweet, sweet soul, she used to say, "Make friends with your shadow." I think she actually wrote a book by that title, Make Friends with Your Shadow. and that's what I'm suggesting that we do here, make friends with what we would call your shadow. Don't try to push it away, because you know why? What you resist persists. Remember that teaching from Conversations with God, always. What you resist persists. It's what you look at and hold and own and closely embrace that disappears. So the very act of resisting something places it more firmly in your experience. You can't lean on something that's not there. So if you are thinking about it, you start to solidify that energy, and you literally place it there more firmly in your reality. So don't resist it, just welcome it, and then allow it to pass right on by. So you say, thank you, thank you, thank you, God, thank you for that fear, thank you for that worry, for that concern, appreciate that, that's very real. I can find that in me. As my friend Byron Katie says, I can find that. And then let it pass right through, okay? So that's how you know, that's the first way that you can know that you're truly awakened, when you welcome the negative energy and then let it pass right on through you, as if it had no importance at all, and you change your mind about what and how you are thinking. You literally change your mind. All right, oh, by the way, I wanted to mention one other thing that I forgot. Fear is sometimes thought of as a negative energy. People have sometimes said, fear is the opposite of love. It is not, fear is love expressed. You realize that if you didn't love anything, you'd be afraid of nothing. If you didn't love yourself and if you didn't love life, you wouldn't be afraid of losing it. If you didn't love someone else you wouldn't be afraid of losing them either. If you didn't love your car, you wouldn't be afraid of damaging it. If you didn't love anything, is the point, you wouldn't be afraid of anything. So fear is love announced! Did you ever think about it that way? That's why we want to say thank you, even for the fear, 'cause it helps us identify what we love and how much we love it. So just smile in the face of it. Hey, thank you, fear, come on in! And then keep on goin', right on out. But don't resist it, because what you resist persists. All right, number two. The second way that you know and can measure whether or not you're fully awakened is that you would love yourself fully, just as you are, and you would love everyone else fully just as they are. Then you would love life fully, just as it is, needing nothing to change, nothing to be different from the way it is. Seeing everything as simply something you are moving through and that is moving through you, just as I mentioned a minute ago. Something that you can look at closely, and know that it's moving through you so that you can know all about that, and create a contextual field providing you with that opportunity I spoke of a minute ago, to demonstrate who you really are. Let me explain what I'm trying to say about that, 'cause I haven't talked a lot about the contextual field in this Quest. In the absence of that which you are not, that which you are, is not. In other words, in the absence of big, small is not. In the absence of fast, slow is not. In the absence of what you are, what you are is not. In the absence of what you are, you cannot experience what you are. I'll give you a really good example. Some people say, I am the light, and I love it when I hear that, because they really feel really strongly about that, they want to be the one who brings the light to the world. What a great, great commitment, what a great self-reference, I am the light. But if there's nothing that's not the light, that is, if you're surrounded by the light, then you're like a candle in the sun! I mean, you can be there, of course, but you wouldn't know yourself, you can't experience yourself as the light any more than the candle in the sun could experience itself, because there's nothing else but the sun, a billion, kajillion, kazillion other candles. So the sun is there, all right, but it can't be experienced. In order for the candle to be experienced as the light, it would have to be in the what? Obviously, in the darkness, which is what the light is not. But in the absence of what you are not, what you are is not experienceable. So that's really a simple formula for you to remember. That's how the contextual field is created. And that's why everything that's unlike you shows up in the space! The moment you declare yourself to be anything, everything unlike it shows up in the space. That's what's called the law of opposites. When we welcome it, and say, ah, my friend, the opposite, suddenly it becomes part of the tools that we use to create who we are. That's why all great masters say, bless, bless, bless your enemies! For that very exact reason, because they give you the opportunity to be and express, to announce and declare, to become and fulfill who you really are. That's the second thing you would do if you find yourself wondering whether or not you have fully awakened. Number three, the third element that you would embrace if you were fully awake, you would forgive no one and nothing ever again, and you would do that knowing that forgiveness is neither necessary nor natural for humans that are aware they are awake. You would clearly see that holding an idea that there is a need for forgiveness means holding an idea that injury has occurred. And as a human who is fully awake, you would be aware that injury is not possible in the experience of divinity, which is who you are. Are you following this? Listen carefully. If you are that which is divine, you would know that you can't possibly be injured, not in truth. You could, how would I say this, experience the illusion of injury, that's true, but you would understand that at a metaphysical, spiritual level, you can never be injured, you can't even die! You never die, you live forever! Therefore, forgiveness is not necessary. In the mind of the master, understanding replaces forgiveness. Let me give you a simple example if I might. Let's say you're at a birthday party and your three-year-old grandchild knocks over the milk, because she's reaching anxiously for the chocolate cake, and her glass of milk knocks over the glass of milk of the next friend next to her, and that one, the next one, and the next, and pretty soon the entire birthday table is a total and royal mess. You don't say to that three-year-old grandchild, it's okay, sweetheart, I forgive you. Forgiveness is not part of the equation, it's not part of the experience! You simply understand how a three-year-old child, so excited on her birthday, so happy to get that chocolate cake, you understand how she could do that, because she's just three, and her emotions got the best of her. That's true whether the emotions are positive or negative. When emotions get the best of people, they start acting like children. And masters understand that, and so understanding replaces forgiveness in the mind of the master. And when your understanding replaces your forgiveness and your need to forgive, that would naturally lead to compassion for others as you experience a full realization of the pain, the anger, or the sadness that they must have experienced, that they must have felt at such a high level as to cause them to abandon their true nature and behave as they did. So understanding replaces forgiveness in the mind of the master. Fourth, the way you can measure whether you're fully awake? A person who is awake would never mourn the death of another, not even for a moment. You might mourn your loss, but not their death. But in fact, you would celebrate both the moments of love and the joy that they have shared with others, and the fact that they continue to live on in free and wondrous expression of their evolutionary process. You would neither fear nor mourn your own death as well, for precisely the same reason. You would know that death is nothing more than your continuation day, and the continuation day of all those who you love. And the fifth and final way to know whether you're fully awake, if you are fully awake, you would be aware that everything is energy and vibration, everything! And so you would pay much more attention to the vibration of everything around you, everything you eat, everything you wear, everything you watch, read, or listen to, and most important, of everything that you think, say, and do. And you would immediately adjust the vibration of your own energy and the life energy that you're creating around you, if you find that it's not in resonance, if it doesn't resonate with the highest knowing that you have about who you are and who you choose to be, and about the experience that you choose to demonstrate. So those are some ways that you can know whether you're really fully awake. Those are some tools you can give yourself, some measurements, some yardsticks, you can kind of look at your behaviors and your reactions, and the way you're moving through life from moment to moment, from hour to hour, from event to event, and give yourself an idea of, gee, I wonder what it would be like to live as a person who's fully awake by embracing those five behaviors. So here are your assignments for today. One, memorize the following 30 words. You will understand why in a moment, so just commit them to memory. Here they are: I love you so much! And I forgive you for all of your transgressions. I honor all the goodness you have brought, and I am with you always and will never forsake you. Memorize those 30 words as if you were saying them to yourself. Number two, standing in front of your mirror, look deeply into your own eyes for 30 seconds. At the end of 30 seconds, spend the next 30 seconds saying to yourself, in the silence of your mind, the 30 words that I've asked you to memorize. Commit to using this 30-30-30 Formula every day for the rest of your life. If you do, it'll change your life, because you'll at last move into full knowing and a wonderful expression, a glorious experience of who you really are. And that's what this Quest is all about. And I'll see you tomorrow, for the last day of this Quest.

LESSON 36: Your Life is Not About You
--------------------
<v ->Hello, welcome to the final day,</v> the final day of your quest. A Quest that we hope has meant as much to you as it has to me. And it does mean a lot to me, I promise you. All I've wanted to do, since the Conversations with God material came through to me is find some way that I could share this with you. More than just read the books, or even come to a talk or catch a lecture, I mean, share it with you in a way that was functional and dynamic, and moves through your life. Such that it could change your life if you really applied the messages that have come through this extraordinary material. So I'm really glad that we've spent this time together. And I'd like to end this delicious program with our final message of guidance. And that's this. The most important message of Conversations with God is that your life is not about you. It's about everyone whose life you touch and the way in which you touch it. I hope that as a result of completing this program, you will understand at a deep level what your life is really about. Because 98% of the world's people are spending 98% of their time on things that don't matter. And things that have nothing to do with what their life is really about. See, life is not about, what we were told when we were younger or at least what I was told when I was younger, get the guy, get the girl, get the car, get the job get the house, get the spouse, get the kids, get the better car, get the better job, get the better house, get the better spouse, get the better spouse, get the better spouse. Get the grandkids, get the office in the corner with the window, and the office with the name on the door, get the name on the building. Become really hugely successful, then get the gray hair. Get the retirement watch, get the cruise tickets, get the sickness and get the hell out, that's it? That's it? That's what we're doing here? I don't think so. I think there's more going on than that. Or as my friend Bill Shakespeare likes to say, there are more things in Heaven and Earth, Horatio, than are dreamt of in your philosophy. So I hope that you will embrace as a result of your participation with me in this program, a deep commitment to your own evolution and also to awakening the species. The invitation here, is to awaken the species by changing the way you are moving through your own life. The purpose here is not to ask you to get out there and proselytize or, start giving programs of your own, you can do that if you want to, wouldn't stop you but that's not what we're talking about here. So I don't want you to feel that now your job is to somehow get out there and be this huge person in the space that has to make this huge impact that's going to make the huge change in the world, that's not it. You can make a huge change in the world, I promise you, but not in that way unless you want to. But you're not required to. Here's the invitation. The invitation of this program and of the book, by the way, from which it emerged, Conversations with God book four, Awaken the Species. The invitation is to self-select. That is, to choose oneself to be among those who decides that you're going to move forward your own evolutionary process. Not someone else's. Not that you're trying to convince anyone else of anything. But that you're going to move forward your own evolutionary process in such a way that your behaviors will demonstrate what it means to be truly awakened. People will see that. They'll be watching you. They'll be observing you, they'll be experiencing you and they'll say wait a minute, this person knows something that I don't know. What is it that I don't know, the knowing of which would change everything? And they'll ask you about it, they'll talk to you about it. And then you become an exemplar. You become a model, you become one who knows. And one who knows that you know. You know? And that's your opportunity here. And in that way, you can, and I promise you, you will, change the lives of those who's lives you touch. Well I ask God, what's the most important message? Why isn't my life working? Just give it to me in one sentence, just, what is it that I don't understand? God said it's very simple, Neale, it's very simple. You think your life is about you. Yeah I did, I thought, I mean, yeah. What's it about? And she said your life has nothing to do with you. It's about everyone whose life you touch and the way in which you touch it. Now you tell me! So old so soon. So smart so late. Ah, but not you. You're not an old geezer like me. You're young enough yet, to make a powerful, meaningful difference. What's the only thing that matters? Completion of your agenda. Of the agenda of the soul. And the agenda of your soul is the same as the agenda of every soul, of every sentient being in the cosmos. To use every golden moment of now to recreate yourself anew in the next grandest version of the greatest vision ever you held about who you are. What an adventure, I promise you. If you just decide that's the only reason you're here. What an adventure. And that doesn't mean that you have to give up relationships or a good career or having fun in whatever way you want to, it doesn't mean that. Doesn't mean you can't engage life with all the vim and vigor you want to, we're not talking about separating yourself and living in a cave someplace or in a convent or in a monastery or somewhere, it's not it. Get out there and live your life. And live it fully and richly but have a different reason why, that you do everything. A reason why you get up and go to work. A reason why you hug that person that you love so much. A reason why you do anything. And let your reason be because you choose, through that action, of loving and working and enjoying life, of expressing, to use that action as a means of recreating yourself, brand new. In every golden moment of now. In the next grandest version you ever had about who you are. Forget about your life, try it for a week. And if that doesn't become the most exciting week you've lived in very long time. I'll be very surprised. And that's what this Quest has been all about. That's the whole point of it. Is to bring you to this moment. This moment of decision. The moment when you announce to yourself, who am I? Who do I choose to be? Ah, now all of this suddenly makes sense. Even the bad days suddenly make sense. Creating a contextual field within which I could experience myself and express myself and know myself. That's who I really am. So how about some final assignments as we close down? Number one. As of this moment, alter your entire reason for living. Put your new reason into writing in your awakening journal. Number two, create at least three ways, before this day is over, in which you consciously and actively demonstrate that your life is not about you, but about everyone whose life you touch and the way in which you touch it. Choose to be among those who self select to exhibit behaviors that reflect full awakening and thus serve to awaken others. If you want a tool with which to do that, you can simply go to ihaveselfselected.com. ihaveselfselected.com. There you'll find all the resources you could possibly ask for, that I've created for you. Well then, our time together in this extraordinary way is over. I'm not going to close out our program without saying thank you to all the wonderful people at Mindvalley. Who have put this together. Vishen and his extraordinary team of dedicated, committed people. People who've decided to put into action some of the grandest thoughts they ever had about life and about who they are. They're demonstrating what I'm talking about right here. And they do it every day and so I'm inspired by that. I'm inspired by them. And I know now, that I'm going to be inspired by you, stay in touch, will you? Stay in touch. And inspire me. Show me who you are. And we'll be together. Even after I'm out of here. Can't get rid of me. For now, blessed be.
