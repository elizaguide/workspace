Preparation 1: Welcome to A Journey to Infinitheism
--------------------
<v ->I will never forget that moment</v> in my life when I had committed a mistake and my boss in the organization pulled me up for the mistake that I had committed. And in order to justify myself I told him, "You will have to understand I'm only 19." To which he said, "That's a choice that you will have to make. Do you want to be a typical 19-year-old? Or do you want to be a 19-year-old where all other 19-year-olds will look up to you? You want to be a typical 19-year-old, then continue to live your life whichever way you are living your life; commit the mistakes everybody commits; execute the choice that everybody executes. But if you want to be a 19-year-old where all other 19-year-olds will look up to you," he said, "then you have to execute choices that nobody else executes." Everything about my life changed. Not just in terms of what I became in life changed, but I realized the mind of the man is the man. When you change the mind you change his entire life. And all that was needed was I change the way I think. And the manifestation of that is it's changed the way I live my life. For 18 years I had only been average or below average in my academics. And one day my father cried, seeing his son fail again and again, again and again brought tears in my father's eyes. Some of those tears of my father moved me. I experienced a fear in life like I've never experienced before because there was this earnest desire in me that I wanted to be a super success in life. I wanted to do legendary things in life, but all I had was 18 years of failure in my past. Is it too late to begin in life when you're already 18? Today I can teach you. Today I can tell you Jesus Christ began his life only at 30. Prophet began his life only at 40. Mahatma Gandhi committed himself to freedom movement only at 45. And Colonel Sanders started KFC only at 65. Today I can tell you all this, but that day I had nobody to tell me this. But one gentleman I met told me, "The harder you press the spring and release it, the faster it bounces back in life. Your life has been pressed by failure for 18 years; just decide to bounce big in life. No force of life will stop you" he said. And I decided to bounce in life, and the sort of success that came in search of me ever since. Once again, life taught me a very, very important lesson in life. Something in my mind changed, and the transformation of my life began. The mind of the man is the man. You change the mind, you change his life. Ever since this has been my life. I work every day. I wake up every day to use myself and be useful to the world, to transform human lives by simply asking them to change the way they see themselves, change the way they see fellow human beings, and change the way they see God, and thereby change the way they see life. I just give people a new perspective to life. And as a result here we are: over a million people in over 135 countries are not just living a better life. Living their life of holistic abundance. You're just an awakening away from legendary possibilities in your life. And this entire wisdom, the quintessence of this through Mindvalley, through this Quest, I bring it to you to tell you life hinges on three relationships. And in that order, you'll have to get it right. Relationship with yourself, me. Relationship with fellow creations, we. And relationship with the creator, Thee. And getting these three things right, and holding onto this transformation long enough, like it had happened to me it can happen to you. You don't have to be a typical 19-year-old. You can be a 19 year old where all other 19-year-olds look up to you; you don't have to be the crowd. You can become the benchmark to the crowd. Your life can become a living role model, a living inspiration for humanity, for generations to come. The team of Mindvalley is asking me to introduce me to you. Instead, I'm saying, I will introduce you to you like you have never, never known yourself before. Let me introduce life to you. Let me introduce God to you. Let me introduce fellow humanity to you, but most importantly, I wish to introduce a new you to you through this journey. Have faith and come with me in this journey. And I will live up to your trust. I deliver; I always deliver. And that's a promise. A humongous future is awaiting you, and let's go and embrace it. This is not a series of motivational talks. It's going to be the highest designs explained to you in the simplest language. True to the name Mindvalley, there is a valley of potential inside your mind, and I'm going to unearth all this and unfold it to you. Deep inside the core of earth, there are rocks and there is diamonds. And as long as they remain in the earth, both have no value. Only when they are brought to the surface, a rock is only a rock, a diamond is priceless. Too much potential is within you. And through this entire journey, life the Infinitheism way, this journey into infinitheism, I want to unearth all that unmanifested potential within you to the surface. The best days of your life are just about to begin, and together let's celebrate this journey of growth. It's going to be entertaining. It's going to be enlightening, and together we are going to grow higher, deeper, beyond. Come, I love you so much, thank you.

Me - Empower Your Relationship With Yourself

====================

LESSON 1: Hey World, I Am Coming
--------------------
<v ->What a blessing it is</v> to be born as a human being. The best thing that could happen to you in life has already happened. You got created as you, as this unique, original one-of-its-kind self. I've been working with people for over three decades now. And one of the things I cherish the most is that I've never met anybody seeing whom I didn't feel, "Wow, what a creation of God." By whatever name you want to call it, God, infinite intelligence, universal consciousness, nature, nouns and proper nouns don't matter to me. All these forces of existence came together to create this unique you, and here we are in this journey to see how we retain this originality. and yet discover the best version of ourselves. Not only for your own individualistic good but also for the larger good of the world. We can be inspired by everybody, but we are not here to become anyone else. We cannot be anyone else. You can only be the best version of yourself. This entire journey of breakthroughs, this journey of transformation, this journey of infinite possibilities that we will discover together. So that you can live your life with heightened self-awareness, from a state of elevated consciousness, with a maturity that you are able to respond to every situation in life as the best version of yourself. And this journey begins by you first celebrating your originality. If this medium called technology was not there between you and I, I would actually take your hands in my hands and look straight into your eye and tell you, "This wisdom that created you ensured that in the history of humanity, there has never been another you, and to the infinite of times to come, let billions and billions more human beings be born, but there will never be another you." I'll look straight in your eye and I'll tell you, "You are rare, you're unique, you're original, you're different, and you're the only one of your kind. You're a masterpiece, master's piece." While I respect, truly appreciate your commitment towards growth, and that's why you are here in this program, but it all starts by you celebrating your originality. Visualize along with me. This magnificence of who you are. We live in this mighty universe made up of millions of galaxies of which our galaxy Milky Way is only one speck of dust. And in Milky Way, there are millions of solar systems in which our solar system is only one speck of dust in terms of size. And in our solar system, planet earth is just another speck of dust in terms of size. And in planet earth with 3/4 water and 1/4 land and billions of life forms, humanity as a whole over 7.5 billion population. Humanity as a whole is only one speck of dust. And in this human population, you, you are just a speck of dust. And yet, this speck of dust you are, you're the only one of your kind. There's nothing else like you in the entirety of this universe. Just reverse visualize you the speck of dust over 7.5 billion people around you. Planet earth, solar system, Milky Way, the universe. You're the center of this universe, and this fragile 600 muscles and 206 bones that you are, a fleeting lifetime of 70, 80, 90, 100 years. And in this fleeting lifetime starting today you can live the rest of your life and not only become a turning point unto yourself, but you have the powers within you to change something about this world. What does this mean? If Taj Mahal and Eiffel Tower and Great Wall of China can be called as wonders because they're the only one of their kind, then you are wonder of all wonders because you are also the only one of your kind. Uninhibited, I think you need to kiss yourself for who you are. Cherishing yourself is cherishing the wisdom that created you. Celebrating yourself is celebrating the wisdom that created you. My request to you in this entire journey together is this: I'm going to ensure every day I'm going to be with you for less than 20 minutes. That's it. But I want undivided attention from you for this maximum 20 minutes. But I believe undivided attention is devotion. And I ask this undivided attention from you where you not only forget everything around you. I want you to even forget this medium called technology that exists between you and me. I want you to feel as if I'm with you. Don't take your eyes off me. Except for those sessions where I might ask you to close your eyes and guide you through certain processes. Don't take your eyes off me. Just for this entire series and Quest. Dedicate 20 minutes every day, some fixed time; discipline yourself for that. And please be with me. In return I promise you a very beautiful you. The best version of you in return. I don't know you personally yet. So, I don't know what you have done with your entire past. Maybe you have already had a glorious past. Maybe you're sitting on a bed of success. So, what? Your future is infinitely more promising than your entire past. Life is not about where to where. Life is about here to where. In Infinitheism we often say, "Come, let's go the other way." In a world that says, live every day as if today can be the last day of your life, my call out to you is this, "Come, let's go the other way." Why live every day as if today can be the last day of your life? Why not live this truth: today, is the first day to the rest of your life. Your future begins today. Today is the first day to the rest of your life, with elevated consciousness, with deepened self-awareness, with heightened maturity. Let's call out to the world, "Hey world, I'm coming." And live the best version of ourselves. Whether you are a student or a political reformer or a social revolutionary, an entrepreneur or a CEO, whatever you are. Let's make our future count. For your own individual good, and for the larger good of the world. And the starting point of this entire journey of transformation is self-appreciation, self-image, self-esteem intact. It's starting by loving yourself, loving who you are. That doesn't mean there is not scope for change. That doesn't mean there is not scope for improvement. We shall. But we begin by you loving yourself. Why? I can only give the world what I have. If I have chaos, I can only give the world chaos. If I have clarity, I can give the world clarity. If I have poverty, I can only share poverty with the world. Only if I have prosperity, I can share prosperity with the world. If I'm full of hatred, I can only spit hatred to the world. If I'm full of love, I can spread the fragrance of love into the world. So, if you want to love the world, and if you want to be loved by the world, it all begins by you loving yourself. And why wouldn't you? They say the lines in your palm are unique. Everything about you is unique. Right now even if you're watching along with someone else, the truth remains nobody can get behind your eyeballs and perceive life the way you perceive life. So, celebrate this unique you. Celebrate this original you. Celebrate that you were created as you and as one else. Celebrate this moment of life when you and me have come together to travel in this journey towards Infinitheism, in this journey towards infinite possibilities. Can you do something? I want you to write a love letter to yourself today. I know the world has always asked you to express yourself to others. I want you to express your self, your self-appreciation, to yourself today. I want you to cherish and appreciate 11 things about you. Maybe certain transformational moments, your strengths, your moments of selflessness, what is so unique and original about you, your talent, whatever it is. Some of your successful milestones in this journey. I want you to write at least 11 things in your love letter to yourself, and on that, let's begin the rest of the journey. Even without knowing you, I want to tell you, I wish the best for you. I wish holistic abundance for you. I wish most and more for you. And I love you so much. Thank you.

====================

LESSON 2: My Life Is My Responsibility
--------------------
<v ->The difference between insights</v> and actionable insights is implementation. I truly believe you did highlight those 11 things which you cherish about yourself, and you have been loving yourself a little more today than you loved yourself yesterday. I told you I've been working with people for more than three decades right now. There is this element of incompleteness in everybody. From the billionaires that I have seen, to people who are still at school, political leaders having millions of people following them, celebrities in sports, entertainment, I had the privilege of working with all kinds of people. But there's this tinge of incompleteness in everybody. Life seems to be this continuous striving from incompleteness to completeness. What's missing? Why this incompleteness? Life hinges on three relationships. Everything about life can be brought into three relationships. Relationship with myself, Me, relationship with others, We, and relationship with that force, Thee. So life basically hinges on these three relationships, me, we, thee. Any form of incompleteness in any one of these three relationships, no matter how qualified you are, no matter how successful you are, no matter how much following you have in life or in social media, any one of these three relationships, me, we, thee, if there is an element of incompleteness, you continue to feel incomplete in your life. So through this entire experience of Quest, we are going to see how we can improve the quality of our relationship with me, we, thee, in that order. Because without improving your relationship with yourself, without finding peace with yourself, you cannot improve your relationship with others. If you don't love yourself, you cannot love others. If you don't love yourself, you cannot cherish being loved by others. So without getting your relationship with yourself right, without discovering peace and being yourself, you cannot improve the quality of your relationship with others. And without getting your relationship with the creation right, you cannot get your relationship with the creator right. So we go in this sequence: me, we, and thee. To get my relationship with myself right, if there is one sentence that I wanted to become part of your psyche, it is, I understand my life is my responsibility, and no blaming is allowed. All succeeding transformation has to be preceded by you taking complete responsibility for your life. The quality of a painting is a painter's responsibility. The quality of a sculpture is sculptor's responsibility. The quality of your life is yours and your responsibility alone. No blaming is allowed. Irrespective of what you have gone through in life, irrespective of what you have braved through in life, irrespective of the challenges that you're facing or faced in life, pointing a finger towards the world is not going to get your life here right. Fixing the blame does not fix the problem. As long as you think there is problem out there and only when that gets sorted out, my life will become okay, you're completely at the mercy of circumstances outside of you. It's a form of disability. On the contrary, when I take complete responsibility for my life, responsibility is derived from responding with the ability. You take charge of your life; you take complete control of your life. Infinitheism is all about science. Like how A plus B whole squared is equal to A squared plus B squared plus 2AB. Like how water is H2O. There is a science to life. So it's not just mere motivating words. Everything is rooted in deepest equations of science. And one such equation is to realize the unit of measurement of life is experience. Like how we measure height, weight, volume with different forms of measures. If there is a measure to life, that measurement will be called experiences. Experience by experience by experience, life accrue. But what is an experience? Experience is the meeting point between I and my world. Right now, I'm going through a teaching experience, so I am in contact with you. You are my world. If yours can be considered a learning experience, you coming in contact with Mahatria, Mahatria is your world. You're going through a learning experience. The meeting point of I and my world creates an experience. And series of experiences constitute life. So let's reverse engineer this. If I coming in contact with the world creates experiences, and series of experiences constitute life, if I have to improve the quality of my life, I have to improve the quality of my experiences. If I am to improve the quality of my experiences, I have to improve my interaction with the world, of which, the world is not in my control. So however harsh it may be, but this is the harsh reality of life, and that is, life is not because of, life is in spite of. In spite of the world, I have to get my life right. Because of the world, I will get my life right: you are at the mercy of the world. Apartheid will be there, yet I have to turn this into an opportunity to discover the Nelson Mandela. Slavery will be there, yet I have to turn this into an opportunity to unfold Martin Luther King. The mighty Britishers will be ruling the country, yet I have to turn this into an opportunity to unfold Mahatma Gandhi. Poverty will be there, and yet I have to turn this into an opportunity to unfold to the world a Mother Teresa. All history makers, all legends, all those who inspire you, all those who lived outstanding human life, the common thread in all of them is in spite of the world, they got their life right; they got their experiences right. How? By taking complete responsibility for their life. I understand my life is my responsibility, and no blaming is allowed. I have have to ask myself this question because I'm the only one in my total control. The world is not. Where can I change myself? In certain areas, I cannot change myself, but I can change my approach towards the world. In me discovering the right approach to the world, and somewhere, in me lifting myself through my own awareness to a better version of myself, I improve the quality of my interaction with the world, by which I improve the quality of my experiences, and thereby, contribute to the quality of my life. If you ask me, "Mahatria, how are you?" I would spontaneously tell you, "I'm on top of the world." My life is on top of the world. My life is on top of the world because I have filled my life with top-of-the-world experiences. And I have top-of-the-world experiences because I never blame the world, but I take complete responsibility of how I can change my approach towards that world and get my life right. It seems there was a father who was reading a newspaper when his six-year-old daughter called out to her dad saying, "Dad, come and play with me." Just then, the father saw there was a full page advertisement of an international courier company where the world map was printed, and they had shown that they can deliver the goods anywhere in the world. In a moment of situational brilliance, the dad tore that entire sheet of paper, tore it further into multiple pieces, scattered it all over the floor, and told his daughter, "Honey, this is your jigsaw puzzle. Put all the pieces together. And once you get the world map right, I'll play with you." And believing he bought time, he went back to reading his newspaper. In less than a few minutes, the little one called out to the dad and said, "I got it." He had a stunned expression on his face when he saw that everything was in place. Looking at his expression, the little angel said, "Dad I must confess to you, when you were tearing the paper, I saw there was a face of a man on the other side. I don't know where each of the countries should be. I don't know where Canada should be, where New Zealand should be, where India should be. But Dad, I know where forehead should be, I know where nose should be, I know where ears should be." And it seems with a lot of innocence, the child said, "Dad, I got the man right, the world became right." The first step to life is recognizing if you can get yourself right; that is a starting point of your world becoming right. And the only way you can majestically march into this journey of getting your life right, by getting yourself right, is by stop blaming and start taking complete responsibility for your life. I understand my life is my responsibility, and no blaming is allowed. My call to you is, till you experience me again, at the slightest thought of wanting to blame anybody outside of you, anything outside of you, I want you to give a gentle whack on your head. The moment you become aware that you are getting into blaming mode, I want you to give a gentle whack on your head. And every time when with your awareness, instead of blaming, you are ready to take complete responsibility for the situation, I want you to give a gentle pat on your back. Seems like simple gestures. But trust me, by just practicing this for a few days, it'll become your innate nature never to blame again, and to always take responsibility for your life. Let's step into the first rung of getting your relationship with yourself right by taking complete responsibility for your life. Once again, I'm reminding you, your future begins today. Once again, wishing you most and more. Once again, reminding you, let's discover the best version of yourself for your own good and for the larger good of the world. Come, let's go the other way. I love you so much. Thank you.

====================

LESSON 3: There Is No Such Thing as Easy Growth
--------------------
<v ->There are no small changes in life.</v> Every small change on the long run is a monumental transformation. The simple steps of loving yourself, celebrating yourself, cherishing your uniqueness, looking forward to the future, believing the future is going to be infinitely greater than your entire past. To completely say, "No, no" to blaming in life and a big "Yes, yes" to take responsibility for your life. Seem small changes, but they aren't small changes. On the long run, they all turn out to be monumental transformation. And one such reconciliation in your own head is recognizing the truth: there is nothing called easy growth. It takes what it takes to drop a few pounds of weight. It takes what it takes to drop an inch of waistline. It takes what it takes to memorize a poetry. To complete a painting, it takes what it takes. So when the aspiration is one of revolution, when the aspiration is to change the world, when the aspiration is to build a global brand, when the aspiration is to build a billion-dollar organization, when the aspiration is to create new social consciousness, there is nothing called easy growth. There is no easy way to the top, and those who made it to the top did not make it easy. See, this is the design of life. You were born immobile, completely dependent on your environment. You didn't even know how to turn around; for everything you need mama's help. But because the environment was taking care of you you were comfortable. At some stage in your life, the impulse of life, you began to crawl, you began to move, and this transition was not comfortable. You fell flat on your face, you hurt your nose, your lips, you cried, and you needed help again. You turned onto your tummy, and you didn't know how to get back on your back. You needed help. But one day you mastered this movement, and you came on that side. Before change you were comfortable; after change you were comfortable, but the transition was never comfortable. But there is one difference: before the transition, you were of lesser comfort. And after the transition, now that you are able to move, you are experiencing a higher comfort. Same as the case from there to standing, from standing to walking, walking to running. And in every aspect of life, it's like this. I've never taken care of my health and life, no exercise, no diet, comfortable. Then you had a resolve that you're going to transform your body. The transition of now regimenting what you eat and what you don't eat. Sweating it out, pushing the body. And this entire transition would not have been comfortable initially. But then at one stage, it became such integral part of your life, it became your very nature, you came on that side. Before change you were comfortable; after change you are comfortable again. The transition was never comfortable, but there is one difference: before change it was lesser comfort; after change, you are experiencing a higher comfort. So in essence, growth is nothing but going from lesser comfort to higher comfort through uncomfortable transitions. I repeat, growth is nothing but going from lesser comfort to higher comfort through uncomfortable transitions. Because there's pleasure in comfort called comfort zone, a lot of us never want to leave our comfort zone. But within comfort zone, there is no growth. Unless you are ready to break your comfort zone, there is no growth. A lot of people live a mediocre life. A lot of people stagnate in life because they don't want to come out of that comfort zone. And when you don't want to come out of your comfort zone, you imprison yourself within that comfort zone. Why? Because they don't want to give up the pleasure of a comfort zone; transition seems painful. And yet all those people who became what they became in life, not because they are more capable than those few people, but they're dared to step into that uncomfortable transition. Knowing very well transitions are going to be enduring, demanding, arduous. And yet they've braved into these transitions knowing very well that's the only way to experience the higher comforts of life. If you have to become what you can become, you have to give up what you are, where you are. If a caterpillar is comfortable being a caterpillar, it'll never become a butterfly. It's in giving up being a caterpillar, it becomes a butterfly, that is discovering the best version of yourself. So what are some of the transitions, that we shall not procrastinate anymore, but we'll brave into these transitions to embrace the higher comforts of life. In fact, the life of a legend is always in transition. Legendary people do not seek this feeling of wanting to feel settled in life. In fact, they seek transitions in life. They don't need a separate adventure sport in life; for them the way they live their life itself is an adventure sport. They thrive on transitions. Growth needs change, change needs transitions, and transitions are never comfortable which means there is nothing called comfortable growth. So the assignment itself for you is just to train yourself in this direction for a day or for a week or for 21 days. What is one pleasure you can stay away from? And what is one thing to which you associate pain but you know that's the right thing to do in life? You associate pain, but you know you need it for you to become a better version of yourself. And now you are going to volunteer and embrace it. It could be avoiding exercise for such a long time, but now you are not going to. Could be bringing the regimentation of some diet which you have been postponing because you have been associating pain to it, but now we are not going to. Anything, could be completing the assignment which you can do it in the next two months but you're going to do it in three weeks time. Could be rising before sunrise; anything. But you're just going to avoid something to which you have associated pleasure and embrace something to which you have associated pain just to bring about the shift in your mindset so that the effective transformation in you is transitions in life are no more avoided but voluntarily embraced. And you know, when you start embracing transitions, you bring transition acceleration into your life. And when you bring transition acceleration into your life, you bring acceleration of growth into your life. And when you bring acceleration of growth into your life, yours is the life to watch. Press the speed button. I told you earlier, legends keep their life in transition. I'm telling you the other way around right now: keep your life in transition; you will become a legend. Wishing you most and more, and I love you so much. Thank you.

====================

LESSON 4: Your Attitudes Will Make or Break You
--------------------
<v ->God designed human being</v> with the power to design their own life. The creator created you, the creation, with the power to create your own life. That is why you can become the architect of your own transformation. It is on this premises I'm taking the freedom and liberty to ask you to cherish your uniqueness, celebrate your originality, love yourself, take responsibility for your life, stop blaming anybody or anything for where you find yourself in life, and most importantly, asking you to go against the very instincts of resisting transition to embracing transition so that you can accelerate this entire process of growth and transformation. Just to know that a higher version of myself is a possibility is motivation enough for us to embrace it. Essentially what is living your life with elevated consciousness? Realizing that if I can live my life with deepened self-awareness and heightened maturity, and thereby I have an edge over the rest of the world. Let me gift myself the transformation. And the beauty in being a human being is one incident, one insight, one paragraph in a book, one story heard, one scene in a movie, one session in this Quest series, one sentence that you caught from Mahatria, one wisdom of Infinitheism, if it can just create one simple shift in your mindset, that'll change the way you live your life. The mind of the man is the man. When you change the mind, you change the man. And one such aspect that all of us use when we discuss human behavior is this word attitude. But what is attitude? Attitudes are the mental spectacles through which I live my life. And if I can change the spectacles, it changes the view of my life; it changes my very perception of life. And this is about attitude. Attitudes do not care where you shape them. Once shaped, they become your behavior, either creating you or destroying you. Some of your attitude is elevating you, and some of your attitude is depreciating you. For us to become aware which of my attitudes is pulling me down and overcoming that and also become aware which of my attitudes is lifting me in life and strengthening them further, you expediate growth. To know I can change my attitudes, and I'll change my mindset. And to know that change of mindset will change my life is reason enough for you to gift yourself this transformation. Since we know attitudes do not care where you shape them, let's get our attitudes right on the small things of life. And believe me, by just getting your attitudes right in the small things of life, the big things of life will take care of themselves. And one simple shift in that attitude is to bring about this attitude for excellence in everything and will not compromise on anything. I will bring this attitude where whatever I do, small or big, whether it'll be noticed by the world or it's a very private experience of mine, let me strive for excellence in everything. Not to pass the judgment of the world. For the simple reason now that I know attitudes do not care where I shape them, and once shaped, they become my behavior, and it has the potential to create me in everything big or small, let there be a stamp of excellence. Right from how I keep my footwear to how I keep my wardrobe or my bookshelf, or how I compile an email or send a text message, or how my work table is maintained. In everything, let there be a stamp of excellence. Excellence has no finishing line. Like how an artist would perceive his art, like how a painter would perceive his painting, let's bring this artistic touch to everything you do with a stamp of excellence. Mahatria, what will be the effect of that? First of all, everything in life need not be done for an ultimate reward. Sometimes getting your life right itself is a reward in itself. But even if you want motivation for this, let me tell you this, the greatest setback in life is to fall in your own eyes, and the greatest pride in life is to grow in your own eyes. By bringing this attitude for excellence in everything you do and an attitude that says no compromise in anything, with your mere day-to-day life and doing everything with panache, bringing a sense of style and class to everything that you do, you grow in your own eyes. That so much transforms the way you see yourself. Getting the me right. Excellence in everything. And two, one more attitudinal shift, you'll become a compulsive good finder. And every day, ensure at least five people are appreciated, either through text or through email or through a phone call or in person. You live your life as a compulsive good finder and more importantly, express this appreciation to the world because the more and more I start finding good in others, the more and more I start celebrating good in myself. The more and more I make other people feel beautiful, the more and more I start feeling beautiful about myself. Let's use the power of social media to broadcast good to the world. Tell the world what is beautiful about your country. Why should everybody use media only to talk about what is not right? Here you are, you're going to use the power of social media to tell the world what's so beautiful about your country, what's good about the weather, what's lovely about your city, what are some of the relationships that you cherish the most in life. That you know something good about anyone, anything, you're going to broadcast it to the world. Let good make noise, and let good make noise through you. And the more and more good makes noise through you, the louder and louder becomes the whispers of self-appreciation within you. Looks like simple attitudinal shift, excellence in everything and being a compulsive good finder, but you'll be stunned at how many other transformations on their own accord begin to happen in your life because that's the beauty about attitudinal shift. A shift in attitude creates a shift in mindset, and a shift in mindset creates a shift in your life. Attitudes do not care where you shape them. Once shaped, they become your behavior, creating you. I don't want you to even speak about destroying you; creating you. And if these are two go-up attitudes, let's also take one more transformation. No more give-ups on all the small things of life, whether it's untying a knot or opening the cork of a bottle or somewhere not able to figure out something in technology, small things we easily give up saying that I can't. The language of life is "I can." The language of death is "I can't." If small, small things, we start saying, "I can't, I can't, I can't," then tomorrow when you pursue your education, tomorrow when you have a fitness goal, tomorrow when you have a success goal in your profession, tomorrow when you're pursuing some spiritual aspiration of transcendence, because you have shaped this attitude to give up in the small things, you'll start giving up even on the big things. No more give-up on the small things of life. You have taken it, you'll complete it. Period. In all the small things, display this resilience that you shall not give up. If you have taken it up, you'll complete it. Take help, take assistance, take guidance, but don't leave anything incomplete. Complete it. It's not over till it's over. To the last inch, make it count. And just see the manifestation of this that tomorrow when you have those ambitious goals and aspirations in life, no matter what sort of challenges you face, you will not even know how to give up. You will do it every time; you'll complete it every time, and that is how you become the architect of your own destiny. Looks like three simple changes, but like I told you in the beginning, there are no small changes. Every small change held long enough creates humongous possibilities in you. Attitude for excellence, attitude to be a compulsive good finder, and no more give-ups in your life. A phenomenal future is inviting you. Together, come, let's go the other way and conquer it. Wishing you most and more, wishing you holistic abundance. And you know I love you so much, and I believe you are also beginning to love me session after session, isn't it? Thank you.

LESSON 5: Transform Your Beliefs
--------------------
<v ->I've been interacting with you for such a long time</v> without even introducing myself to you. Even though I'm not going to introduce myself to you, but I want to talk about one incident in my life which was a turning point in my life. I had lived a very average life till I was 19. I had committed a mistake which came to the attention of my manager. And when my manager was trying to correct me, almost as a self-justification, I told my manager, "But you'll have to understand that I'm only 19." To which my branch manager said, "Oh that's a decision that you will have to make. Do you want to be a typical 19-year-old, or do you want to be a 19-year-old where all other 19-year-olds can look up to you?" There are very few times in life when you're ready for transformation. And I think that day I was ready for transformation. Transformation: transcending the old formation into a new one. The moment I heard the words, "Do you want to be a typical 19-year-old or a 19-year-old where all other 19-year-olds can look up to you?" There was a shift in my belief system. I told myself, "I'm not here to be the crowd, but I'm here to live my life as one above the crowd." Not for any self-fulfilling prophecy, but that's my way of saying, "I want to do justice to myself, to my potential, to this life of mine." And with that one shift in belief, that I will be a 19-year-old where all other 19-year-olds will look up to me, I took it up in every role, in every dimension of my life, that I will live a life where I can be an inspirational role model to others, rather than just be the crowd. That I will become a benchmark for others in every aspect, in every dimension of my life. And everything about my life got transformed. In seeing from a student to a billionaire, everybody is searching for peace. In working with people, I brought about the shift in my belief system, the goal of every goal is peace. Whether you want to pursue further education or you want to grow in your professional career or you want to reform the society or do something for the environment, no matter what success goals we all pursue, but end of the day, we all want peace, happiness. And with this one shift in my belief system, the goal of every goal is peace. There is no way to happiness; happiness is the way. Nothing for happiness, but everything out of happiness. What I teach, the way I teach, everything changed, and it helped me to build a very different world around me. It helped me to shift human consciousness in this direction. With half-baked knowledge on religion, lot of people still seem to see money as if it's a sin and rich people as if they are sinners. I know enough has been told that money cannot give you everything in life. Agreed, but isn't this also true? What money can, only money can. You want to build a great educational institution? You need money. You want to create life-saving hospitals? You need money. You need to build a place of worship for congregation towards God? You need money. You want life-saving medicines, and for that research and development, you need money. What money can, only money can. So part of my teaching is this belief system. Every good human being has the moral responsibility to be rich. Why? Financial surplus in the hands of a bad human being destroys the world. If all the money is there in the hands of terrorists, they will destroy this world. On the contrary, money in the hands of good people will create industries, will create employment, will build universities, will create healthcare systems, will elevate the standard of human life. Financial surplus in the hands of a bad human being will destroy the world. Financial surplus in the hands of a good human being will build a beautiful world. So here I started this empowerment in the world, telling everybody, every good human being has the moral responsibility to be rich. Financial adequacy is not our goal. Financial surplus is our goal, so that we can use this financial surplus in creating a beautiful world. A simple shift in belief system: Let me be a 19-year-old where all other 19-year-olds can look up to me. A simple shift in the belief system: The goal of every goal is peace. A simple shift in the belief system: nothing for happiness; everything out of happiness. A simple shift in the belief system: EVery good human being has the moral responsibility to be rich. Not only resulted in the transformation of Infinitheism, but through Infinitheism it created a very beautiful world within this world. And a world where I keep seeing one-role wonders, satisfied if they get one aspect of their life right. And yet seeing everybody's feeling incomplete about their life. A very detailed analysis of human life, because I get the privilege to work with people across the world, and I've been doing this for almost three decades. I realized unless there is abundance in all the five dimensions of your life, health, wealth, love, bliss, peace, a healthy body, a wealthy life as a proof of success, meaningful, loving relationship, the ability to celebrate life, and all this with spiritual rootedness of peace. And only when there's abundance in all these five dimensions, healthy, wealthy, loving, blissful, peaceful, will there be completeness in your life. Any one of these, you're not seeing enough progress, you still live an incomplete life. So in a world where abundance seems to be synonymous only with monetary wealth, Infinitheism redefined abundance in all these five dimensions. A simple shift in belief system, not only what I teach changed, the world that got created through this wisdom also changed in the true essence, "Come, let's go the other way." What am I trying to drive through all these examples? The beliefs you hold in the beginning of a journey define the journey. When we spoke about an attitudinal shift, attitude for excellence, attitude of being a compulsive good finder, attitude never to give up, the most important attitudinal shift is the shift in your belief system. You think small, you live small. The greatest wisdom called by a name called God has created you. The child of a king cannot be a beggar. You as the creation of that abundant God is not here to be another statistical entity in the world population. You got to make your life count. Much before your life changes in the physical plane, it has to first change in your psychological plane, and what transforms your life in the psychological plane is transformation of your beliefs. Your future is not equal into your past. There is nothing in a caterpillar that suggests that it can become a butterfly, and yet it becomes a butterfly. Ordinary people in embracing extraordinary beliefs, go on to live an extraordinary life. When your beliefs expand, your mindset expands. When your mindset expands, your life expands. Even God cannot give you more than what you deserve. Even God cannot give you more than what you believe you deserve. Rain fills the size of the vessel. I stand with a spoon, that's all it shall fill. I stand there with a glass, that's what it shall fill. If I have an artificial pond, that's what it shall fill. Same is the case with life. It simply gifts you to the size of your beliefs. And if life has to gift to you that holistic abundance, you have to first gift to yourself this transformation of beliefs. It seems a man was jogging when he saw somebody fishing. Just to observe the whole experience, he went close to that fisherman to see something astonishing. Every time he caught a small fish, he put it into his ice box, and every time he caught a big one, he put it back into the lake. The guy who was jogging, told the fishermen, "I find this amusing. Why would you throw the big ones back into the lake?" To which the fisherman said, "I also hate to do that, but what can I do? At home I have only a small frying pan; the big one won't fit into it." And this is the story of many people's life. They do not pursue ambitious goals because they believe they have a small frying pan. Nobody said it better than Bill Gates when he said, "We underestimate what we can do in ten years' time, and we overestimate what we can do in one year's time." There are no ambitious goals, there are only ambitious timeframes. If you give yourself enough time, nothing is beyond human potential. While one man said, "I cannot handle the big ones because I have a small frying pan," another day the same person who was jogging saw at a seashore one solitary man, picking up every starfish that has been washed ashore by the high tide and throwing it back into the sea. The man who was jogging asked that solitary individual, "Do you even think that you can save all the starfish? There are thousands of them here that are dying." Even without replying that noble-hearted individual simply picked up the next starfish, and holding it in the palm of his hand he told the guy who was jogging, "I don't know whether I can save them all, but I definitely know I can make a difference to this one," and threw it back into the sea. Here is a man who believed, one at a time. I can save so many starfish one day at a time, one choice at a time, one decision at a time, one goal at a time. Humongousness is awaiting you. You open the floodgates of life by expanding your beliefs. You have a very important assignment today. You have to take take the time. And what do you think as an ambitious goal, an aspiration worth human life, whatever, personal, professional, social, spiritual, financial. I want you to write a dream sheet, want you to write in a sheet of paper one goal that truly does justice to your potential, that you believe that you'll be able to pat yourself in achieving it. Because based on that we are going to have a guided process in the next session. And it'll be very important you have this dream sheet ready. Think big, enough of a life as a caterpillar. Hey butterfly, are you ready to fly? The future is awaiting you, and I love you so much. Thank you.

====================

LESSON 6: The Psychological Shift
--------------------
<v ->Consciously,</v> I have been avoiding jargons, terminologies, complicated words. Consciously, I have been speaking everyday language, everyman's words, in this entire interaction I'm having with you. But believe me, it's all based on very deep researched science. And one of the sciences that we are going to put into effect today is to create a confluence between Western science and Eastern wisdom. We're going to do a guided process, something on which not only I have a lot of personal faith in but I know hundreds of thousands of people will vouch for how they magnetized abundance into their life. By practicing this guided process, it's called Purna Shakti. In the language from where I come, Purna means holistic, Shakti means power. How do I leverage this holistic power in the fulfillment of my personal aspirations? Let's first discuss the Western science. Creative visualization. What is creative visualization? Creative visualization is achieving a comfort between your left brain and right brain. Your left brain is the logical side of the brain, and your right brain is the creative side of the brain. Now, unless they work together, it becomes like a cart being pulled by horses in two different directions. It's only when they work together, the left and the right side of the brain, the cart is being pulled in that integrated power in one direction. While the left brain is logical and absolutely important for execution, the right brain is creative and necessary for imagining a future. Setting ambitious goals, aspiring for dreams like you can change the world. Now what happens when the right brain comes up with a monumental goal, sometimes the left brain because of its logical nature starts implanting doubt in terms of how is it possible to achieve it? So a lot of dreams remain dreams in not achieving this mental comfort zone where the right and the left brain can work together. So what happens with creative visualization? In creative visualization, I'm simply visualizing time and again those goals, those aspirations in the present continuous as if I'm already living my dreams. Not as if I will achieve them, but as if I'm already living my dreams. Through repeated visualization, creative visualization, so the right brain is visualizing as if I'm already living the dream, I've already achieved that goal. It's already mine; not sometime in the future. Right now. By repeatedly doing it, this left side of the brain which initially keeps doubting eventually reaches a level of comfort zone familiarity. And that creates a congruence between the left and the right side of the brain. The belief is even if I can do a creative visualization once without doubting it, now, the question is no more will I achieve it? Now, the question is only by when will I achieve it. The Eastern wisdom is that when you dream in a heightened state of energy levels, you get forces, by whatever name you call it, universe, existence, God, you get forces beyond you to collaborate with you for the fulfillment of those dreams, but only if you dream those dreams in heightened energy levels. So in order to ensure that I dream those dreams at higher energy levels, there is this process of Purna Shakti where you activate the point between your two eyebrows. Forget the jargons and terminologies. It's called Ajna chakra. By simply activating it and creative visualization as if we are drawing energy from existence through this gate between your two eyebrows onto yourself. You reach a higher level of energy from where you dream your dreams and thus get the higher forces of existence to collaborate with you for the achievement of the dream. You can have your own fixations, but just go through this process along with me. Just as an experience, go through this process along with me. And I urge you to watch this particular session on guided process at least three times. And if possible, practice this creative visualization which is just going to take you few minutes every day for another 21 days. And one day, share your story of triumph. Share your story of accomplishment with the rest of the Tribe; share your stories so that you inspire others in this tribe that are growing together. I'm sure you'll come back and say it works because it works. So right now, just as an experience, or as an experiment, whichever way you want to see it, let's go through this experience. All this I'm assuming you've already written your dream sheet. If you haven't, pause now; go back to the previous session. Experience it. Take a day more. Write your dream sheet, and then come back to this session. I know you are experiencing me through technology. I know you're connecting me through the video, but please just for a few minutes, close your eyes, just close your eyes. Beautiful. For three times, you're going to take a deep inhalation. And when you exhale, holding your entire mind at the point between your two eyebrows, I want you to make a humming noise. It's a nasal noise. It comes through your nostrils. I want you to make humming noise. Listen to me once. And then together we can do it three more times. I'm inhaling, and my exhalation is... Sure enough, when you do it, now you'll also experience it. You'll start experiencing certain sensations between your two eyebrows: that is opening the gates for you to later receive energy. So let's do it three times together. Inhale, take a deep inhalation. And as you exhale, exhale by making the humming noise. Stay lip tight. Only then the humming noise will happen through your nostrils. And to that extent you create that nasal sound, you'll create sensations in the point between your two eyebrows. Second time, take a deep inhalation; exhale with the humming noise. One last time. Inhale. Keep your eyes closed. Now this is the starting point of creative visualization: visualize you're drawing energy from existence onto you through the point between your two eyebrows. Let your Ajna chakra, the point between your two eyebrows, act as a gate through which the energy that is running this entire existence, let it all flood towards you. Through the point between your two eyebrows, elevate you to higher energy levels from where the Eastern wisdom says, dream your dreams from higher energy, and you get the higher forces of existence to collaborate with you for the fulfillment of your dreams. Just let the intent be that you are drawing energy from existence through this gate between your two eyebrows onto you. Just be creative; visualize as if you're magnetizing energy from existence through the point between your two eyebrows onto you. And now with this heightened energy levels, live your dream, whatever you'd written in your dream sheet; creatively visualize in the present continuous the entire dream as if you are already in it. Get all your senses involved. See, smell, taste, feel, hear; get all your senses involved. Feel those emotions. Smile. Let those tears ooze from your eyes. Visualize your well wishers, friends, family, celebrating along with you, you living your dream. Vividly visualize every detail. Blossom in celebration. Hey, you're living your dream. You deserve the best, and the best is happening to you. Feel a profound sense of gratitude to God, life. That this moment is as real as it gets in your life. Feel special, feel blessed, feel wow, and very, very gently please open your eyes. Feeling on top of the world, isn't it? The question is not will you achieve it? The question is by when will you achieve it? It's only question of time. On the proof of hundreds of thousands of people, I can tell you, Purna Shakti works. At least three more times, go through the session again. And those of you who have been connecting to me, believe in my teachings, and you're in this journey. I wish you can practice it for 21 days. Now that we have got, by loving ourselves, by taking responsibility for our life, by braving the transitions of life, by getting our attitudes right, by expanding our beliefs, and now through creative visualization, now that we have got our psychological self ready, how do we turn this entire vision into reality in the materialistic plane? Let's see it in the next session. I love you so much. Thank you.

====================

LESSON 6: Meditation - The creative visualization of "purna shakti"

- Close your Eyes.

- Just close your eyes. Beautiful. For three times, you're going to take a deep inhalation. And when you exhale, holding your entire mind at the point between your two eyebrows, I want you to make a humming noise. It's a nasal noise. It comes through your nodules. I want you to make humming noise. Listen to me once and then together we can do it three more times. I'm inhaling, and my exhalation is Mm. Sure enough, when you do it now, you'll also experience it. You'll start experiencing certain sensations between your two eyebrows that is opening the gates for you to later receive energy. So let's do it three times together. Inhale, take a deep inhalation, and as you exhale, exhale by making the humming noise. Mm. Stay lip tight. Only then the humming noise will happen through your nostrils and to that ext extreme, you create that nasal sound. You'll create sensations in the point between your two eyebrows. Second time, take a deep inhalation exhale with the humming noise. One last time. Inhale.

- Mmm.

- Keep your eyes closed. Now this is the starting point of creative visualization. Visualize you are drawing energy from existence unto you through the point between your two eyebrows. Let your agia chakra the point between your two eyebrows. Act as a gate through which the energy that is running this entire existence. Let it all flood towards you through the point between your two eyebrows. Elevate you to higher energy levels from where the Eastern wisdom says. Dream your dreams from higher energy, and you get the higher forces of existence to collaborate with you for the fulfillment of your dreams. Just let the intent be that you're drawing energy from existence through this gate between your two eyebrows unto you. Just be creative. Visualize as if you are magnetizing energy from existence through the point between your two eyebrows unto you. And now with this heightened energy levels, live your dream. Whatever you'd written in your dream sheet. Creatively, visualize in the present, continuous the entire dream, as if you're already in it. Get all your senses involved. See, smell, taste, feel, hear. Get all your senses involved. Feel those emotions. Smile. Let those tears ooze from your eyes. Visualize your wel wishes, friends, family, celebrating along with you. You living your dream vividly. Visualize every detail. Blossom in celebration. Hey, you're living your dream. You deserve the best, and the best is happening to you. Feel a profound sense of gratitude to God, life, that this moment is as real as it gets in your life.

- Feel special, feel blessed, feel wow,

- And very, very gently. Please open your eyes.

====================

LESSON 7: From Desires to Deservingness
--------------------
<v ->Vision into reality is this journey into Infinitheism.</v> If every dreamer would have all their dreams fulfilled, they must be ruling that world. But a lot of dreamers remain dreamers, and very few dreams come into reality. Not because you don't have the potential to turn your vision into reality but because we don't do what it takes to turn vision into reality. 10% only is idea; 90% is execution. Lot of great ideas that could have changed the world, lot of phenomenal human potential that could have transformed the world, have all been lost in this journey of life because they did not commit themselves into execution. It's the law of life: you do not get in life what you desire; you only get in life what you deserve. Everybody desires to be healthy. Do you deserve to be? Everybody desires to be super rich. Do you deserve to be? Everybody desires to have meaningful, loving relationship in life. Do you deserve it? Everybody wants to experience that transcendental spiritual state, but am I doing what it takes to reach there? It's an unquestionable law of life: you do not get in life what you desire; you only get in life what you deserve. But we don't have to play the victim card because desires become deservingness. Does not depend on God; does not depend on some external force; it depends on you. My desires become my deservingness through CDSIE: Consistent, Directed, Self-motivated, Intelligent Effort. That's the X-factor. Show me anyone on any goal of theirs, any desire of theirs, any ambition of theirs; show me anyone who's able to put in CDSIE, Consistent, Directed, Self-motivated, Intelligent Effort. And I'll show you a legend in the making. Anybody can be a CXO. Anybody can be a leader. Anybody can reach the top, provided there is Consistent, Directed, Self-motivated, Intelligent Effort. And the greatest potential in life can amount to nothing in life. Unnoticed, they will live and go because they lack the discipline of Consistent, Directed, Self-motivated, Intelligent Effort. Effort. Nothing happens without effort. Even when you admire somebody for the effortless excellence, effortless expression of talent in anybody you see, I want you to know so much of effort has gone in to attain that level of effortlessness. Even effortlessness is achieved only through effort. But mere effort will be labor. Intelligent Effort. There has to be competence in that effort. There has to be skill in that effort. There has to be best practices in that effort which is what Intelligent Effort is all about. You put the best practices into your effort. Self-motivated Intelligent Effort. A lot of people rely on external motivation. New year comes, they will do a few things for a few days. In fact, there is an Italian saying that goes, "Let all your miseries in life be as short-lived as your new year resolutions." Because everybody makes a new year resolution. Nobody even pursues them beyond 10-15 days because externally motivated. After I went through the entire process of learning yoga as a form of fitness, when I said thank you to the person who taught me yoga, the teacher said, "Don't thank me today. One year later, if you can come and tell me you're still practicing it, that day I will accept your gratitude," he said. What was he saying? He wanted to know whether I was motivated by the teacher and hence, practicing it when I'm learning, or am I a self-motivated individual where, 365 days later, I'm still consistent with my practice. If motivation has to come from outside, you are a follower. When motivation comes from within, you are a leader. Self-motivated, Intelligent Effort is integral to all leaders in the world. Directed, Self-motivated, Intelligent Effort. Focus is everything in life. Focus is not only my passion to say yes to one thing but also my discipline to say no to another 99 other distractions in life. We get so easily distracted in life. If my goal is to reach a target in the East and I get distracted by something that's happening in the West, when will I ever reach there? How will I ever reach there? Directed, Self-motivated, Intelligent Effort. Consistency: that's the crowning glory in this entire thing. Because anybody can do an occasional act of greatness. Truly great are those who can consistently practice the higher practices, the best practices, the higher ideals of life. And as long as I put in that Consistent, Directed, Self-motivated, Intelligent Effort on my desires, any desire turns into deservingness. And that is how I magnetize what I want in my life. I don't have to run in search of it. It comes in search of me. The agony of a teacher is the number of people that I've seen in life with historical potential in them but lack the discipline of CDSIE. And the fulfillment of the teacher in me is the number of people that I've seen who've been meticulous, religious, about Consistent, Directed, Self-motivated, Intelligent Effort, and nothing is more gratifying for a teacher than to see and participate in the transformational journey of people. Obese to super fit. College dropout to one day being an entrepreneur who could provide employment opportunities to thousands of people. Cancer survivors being motivational speakers across the world, amputees, visually impaired people, doing work at a global level. And in all these people that from a very close proximity I've participated in the journey of their growth, it's not because they were made up of some very special potential, but in all those cases, there was Consistent, Directed, Self-motivated, Intelligent Effort. A child was standing with a battery operated torch light in the hand, and it was getting dark. A passerby who came there asked the child, "Why are you standing here?" And the boy said, "I have to reach the top of the mountain, and it's so dark ahead of me, all I can see is just a feet of light that I can see, which my torch light is providing." And the wise old man advised, "Take a step forward, my boy, and that light shall move with you. Great journeys of life are nothing more than one step at a time, taken consistently, long enough, and even a Mount Everest can be scaled." And with the wisdom of that old man, the boy began to move one step at a time. So did the light, till he reached the top of the mountain. Speaking about Mount Everest, the legendary Sir Edmund Hillary, the first man to scale Mount Everest, had failed in three of his attempts. And one day in his tent, there was a painting of the portrait of Mount Everest. And it seems the legend told the painting of Mount Everest, "The more and more you reject me, the more and more I'm becoming determined that one day I'll stand at the top of you, and I know I will. You know why?" said Sir Edmund Hillary. "Even as Mount Everest, you cannot grow any further, but I as a human being will continue to grow." There is no limitation to a human being who's ready to dream big, desire big, and invest Consistent, Directed, Self-motivated, Intelligent Effort. Maybe one day, I will see you face-to-face, meet you eye-to-eye, and you'll share this journey of you reaching the top with me. And that will be my moment of celebration with you. Come, we deserve the best. Come, for your own good and for the larger good of the world. Let's hit the top. I love you so much. Thank you.

====================

LESSON 8: Deep Positive Emotions
--------------------
<v ->Having traveled together</v> through a series of sessions, it may not even be apt for me to say this, but I will have to say this: even if you have missed all the sessions till now, but if this one session can become an integral part of your life, the transformation from all the other sessions will automatically become a part of you. We want to discuss a very deep science right now. I won't go too much into the detail, but let's just have a peep into it. Human mind is divided into conscious mind and subconscious mind. Mind is a conceptual entity. So we cannot use the language of measure there, but just to put a sense of proportion in your head, one-eighth of human mind is conscious mind, and seven-eighths of mind is subconscious mind. All your knowledge, memory, everything is sitting in the conscious mind. Even right now, you're listening to me and I'm talking to you, is a conscious interaction between your mind and mine. But seven-eighths of the mind is the subconscious mind which means the power of the man is in the power of the mind; the power of the mind is in the power of the subconscious mind. That's the reason a lot of people with very good education, extraordinary qualification, humongous potential, still do not achieve what they're capable of achieving in life because they don't tap into the power of their subconscious mind. And if sometimes, we are always astonished to see the sort of success some people are able to bring into their life and wonder how? They've got the seven-eighths of their mind right. We will discuss one aspect of getting your subconscious right. And that is your subconscious does not understand the difference between love and hatred. It doesn't know the difference between happiness and unhappiness. It doesn't know the difference between success and failure. Your subconscious only understands the difference between shallow emotions and deep emotions. Emotions that you feel superficially and emotions that you feel deep. And here's the important science: that to which you associate deep emotions, positive or negative, that to which you associate deep emotions, your subconscious will conspire every fact of existence, every form of existence, to cause the recurrence of the same in your life. There will be repetition of anything to which you associate deep emotions. So the challenge is this: negative emotions are inherently deep. Sadness is deep. Hurt is deep. Losing something in life is deep. Failure hurts your ego deep. Missing someone is deep. Your ego being dented is deep. Negative emotions are inherently deep. So what happens is whenever we go through any negative emotion, we go through it to the depth of it, and it creates a reinforcing pattern in our life. And that is why when you go into a bad phase of life, when you experience tough times in your life, and things begin to go wrong in your life, one after another keeps following in your life. Because that to which you associate deep emotions, your subconscious will cause the repetition, the recurrence, of the same. We need to get over this. How? By ensuring we keep our negative emotions shallow and turning our positive emotions deep. So it's not about love: depth of love. It's not about happiness: depth of happiness. We have to deepen our positive emotions. Before I even go further into the science, let me give you a simple practice that should come into practice with immediate effect. Starting this moment in your life, anything negative, you'll communicate about it or you'll talk about it or you'll text about it in one sentence. Anything positive, five sentences. At an action level, this is the easiest to implement. Anything negative in one sentence, anything positive in five sentences. Not feeling well, somebody ask you, how are you? Whatever you want to say, only one sentence is allowed. Feeling fit? Feeling at the peak of your energy levels? Just completed a marathon? Finally got your six pack? The sculpted muscles? Achieved the flexibility you always wanted with your body and you've got that? Reached your ideal weight? And somebody's asking you, how are you feeling? Either texting or emailing or on the phone or in person, you will speak five sentences about it. Disease in one sentence; health in five sentences. You are to share a failure of yours? One sentence. You want to share a success of yours? Five sentences. Learn from the athletes. Every time they win a race, they'll run a victory lap. The victory lap is nothing but an experience to deepen their positive emotions. So every success of yours, every milestone of yours from now onwards, will have a victory lap. In whatever way. You want to treat yourself; you want to treat others. You want to celebrate alone; you want to celebrate with your loved ones. But there will be celebration. You'll deepen your positive emotions. Love is no more just a feeling. It has to be made visible. You'll hug people. You'll squeeze people. You'll get them to snuggle into you. You'll cuddle them. Buy them gifts. Write poetries about them. Sing their favorite song. Hold their hand and listen to their favorite song. But you will deepen your love. Happiness is no more a subtle emotion. No more just sending smileys. Smile. Laugh. Belly laughter. Laughter is a gift for a human being, a reverberated laughter. Dance. Don't have to go to a discotheque for that. You don't have to party for that. You can do it when you're still sober; just from your bed to the basin to brush your teeth, dance your way. Dance in the shower. Whistle your way to work. Sing a song and come back from work. Play with your body. Be uninhibited about your physical expressions. Bring that sense of celebration with your body. Deepen your happiness. Bring enthusiasm into your life. Life follows enthusiasm. No more a dull moment in life. No more zombie-like. Enthusiastic, excited, euphoric, exhilarated, excited to be alive. Be energy on the move. Let the mantra of your life become "Celebration is life and life is a celebration." For every reason celebrate; for every excuse celebrate. Deepen your positive emotions. Live your life to the point of positive tears. People think you need to be emotionally weak to cry. Who said so? The inability of the mind to handle a deep emotion of yours comes out as tears. Tears are gift to a humanity. I'm not talking about those tears that come when you yawn or when there's an infection in your eyes or when there is a piece of dust particle that gets into your eyes. Those tears are different. The chemical property of those tears are different. I'm talking about those tears where, depth of emotions, deep emotions cause what it is to live your life, to experience tears of gratitude, tears of love, tears of happiness, tears of success, tears of feeling touched, tears of feeling blessed, tears of experiencing divine intervention. Lot of people always tell me, "I don't know why I cried." And I always tell them, "If you know why, you won't cry" because inability of the mind only causes those spontaneous tears. So once in a way, experiencing deep positive emotions to the point of tears is a confirmation that you are deepening your positive emotions and thus programming seven-eighths of your mind to draw more and more repetition, recursive of positive celebrations into your life. The next time there is a resignation from your organization, one sentence, shallow emotions. But every time a new person joins the organization, a five sentence welcoming message. Celebrations. Even if it means simply sharing a toffee, but celebrations. When you see the marks of your children, first read the highest marks, and celebrate that. Let's discuss about the lowest mark and what corrections need to be done in the future preparation later. But first, celebration of the highest marks. Each one of us has strengths and weaknesses. Let's deal with the weaknesses, but let's celebrate our strengths. Even this particular session or any session as you go through this journey into Infinitheism, in this Quest series. Something didn't appeal to you, something did not create an impact in you, a negative feedback in one sentence. It impacted you, it was an actionable insight, it was transforming, life changing, share in five sentences, 55 sentences with the rest of your Tribe and inspire them to grow along with you. At a simple level, anything negative in one sentence, and everything positive in five sentences. And at a much deeper level, discipline yourself to keep your negative emotions shallow, and resolve to deepen all your positive emotions. Let the eternal mantra of your life be "Life is celebration and celebration is life." And with this, we complete celebration of Me, and we are ready to put our life in a different branch of maturity to see how we get the best out of loving the world and being loved by the world. Let us see how we get the We dimension in our life right as we move forward. I love you so much. And since you have decided to deepen your positive emotions, even though it is through technology, I want you to right now express your love for Mahatria. Say it. Think I will hear it, and say it. Thank you. I assume you said, "Love you Mahatria." Thank you. Loving you so much.

We - Build Lasting Relationships With the World Around You

====================

LESSON 9: The Importance of "U-Turns" in Life
--------------------
<v ->If I have to divide this world</v> into one minor group and one major group, the minor group that is happy in life and the major group that's not happy in life, this is what I would discover. The major group that's not happy in life is not happy in life not because too much is going wrong for them in life but they're not happy in life because a relationship that truly matters to them the most in life is not going right. The minor group that is happy in life is happy in life not because everything is going right for them in life but they're happy in life because a relationship that truly matters to them the most in life is going right. That is how direct a bearing the role of relationship is in the life of individuals. Now, the question is how do I get relationships in life right? Since we have already taken this decision that my life is my responsibility and no blaming is allowed. And we also have understood life has to be right in spite of everything, not because of everything. I'm actually going to turn it back to you. to get your relationships in life right, you'll have to get some aspects in you right. And by getting some aspects in you right, the manifestation of that will be your relationships will become right. What do I mean by getting something about you right? There are no good relationships and bad relationships in life. There are only mature relationships and immature relationships in life. There are no good relationships. There are no bad relationships. Having established in the very first session of this Quest that you are rare, you are unique, you are original, you are different, you are the one of your kind, so is the other; so are others. The challenge in relationships is each one of us being these unique individuals have to still come together, harmonize our differences, and still find a way to celebrate our togetherness, and this calls for certain maturities. And it's only with those maturities we can achieve this. I repeat, there are no good relationships and bad relationships. There are only mature relationships and immature relationships. And the good news here is as long as you are mature enough you can handle the immaturities of others and still create great relationships. So what is the first step of maturity towards not only getting your few immediate relationships right, but mastering this art of thriving in this world of We? I'm not only a teacher, but I'm also a very good student. I love to learn from everyone. And I love to learn from everything. I feel everything teaches you something. And I learn a lot from the road. For example when I learned driving, my driving instructor first told me this is A-B-C of driving. Accelerator, not the gas pedal. Brake. Clutch. And I think in his own way, he said, "In any aspect of life you'll have to get the fundamentals right if you are to get your life right." There is a rearview mirror in my car, which is all the time reflecting what is behind me. And there is a windshield, huge windshield, which is showing me what is ahead of me. I think there is a message here. My rearview mirror can only act as a reference. I have to drive by focusing on the windshield. Similarly in life, my past can only act as a reference from where I can learn my lessons. I have to be futuristic in life. I have to focus on my life ahead and flow with life. There are those side mirrors, and in the side mirrors, universally one sticker is stuck: "Objects in the mirror are closer than they appear." And I think there's a message for this. The challenges we face in life are appearing larger than they actually are. We have an exaggerated perception about our challenges. The more and more you realize it's not as big as it seems, it's easier to manage them. Each one of us drive at our own pace. There are those behind us. There are those who are ahead of us. There are people who always overtake me in life, and sometimes they overtake me and in the next traffic signal, I see them wait. I've taken a little longer, but I also reach there. And I think there's a message from the road for me in life. Sooner or later is the question. There's no question of will we arrive? Some people will reach the destination faster than us. And some of us may be a little slower than them, but we all can reach our destinations. Every vehicle has a unique number plate. No other vehicle in the world has the same number. Connects to our very first session, rare, unique, original, one of its kind. So is every vehicle's number plate. Stop, Look, Proceed, such a fabulous road sign. And I think it's a spiritual philosophy. Anytime the rhythm of your life is disturbed, either in relationship or in health or in your decision making or in your professional growth, anytime the rhythm of your life is breaking, stop, look inwards, make whatever realignment is required, and then proceed. You'll get back the rhythm in life. And one of my all time favorite road signs is U-Turn. I've got the best out of all relationships in my life because of this one road sign. It's telling me, you turn. Instead of all that time expecting others should correct themselves, others should change themselves, this one road sign is all the time telling me, you turn. And it has had such a profound impact on my life. I think I was in my 30s. And one day, there was this argument with my wife, and things did not turn good; things did not turn right. The next couple of hours, every time I tried to pick up a conversation with her, she was not ready to speak to me. She was still hurt. I forcefully brought her to sit next to me. And on a piece of paper, I did the following calculation I wish to share with you. It resulted in both of us having tears that day. I wish it has the same U-Turn in your life. I told her right now, I'm 30. Assuming I live up to 70, I have another 40 years of my life left. One-third of my life, eight hours a day, will go in sleep. Take away 13 years of my life, I'm left with 27. Another one-third of my life will go at work. We work at least eight hours a day. Take away another 13 years; I'm left with 14. My daily chores, brushing of teeth, then drinking my coffee, reading the newspaper, breakfast, lunch, dinner, and in between teas and coffees, and a high tea and a snack here, the washroom, the shower, just the daily chores of life will take away at least another four hours every day. That takes away another seven years of my life; I'm left with seven. Anybody who lives an urban life, two hours a day goes away in travel, in commuting, home to work, back, or whatever, socializing, traffic jams, bumper to bumper traffic. Two hours a day goes in commuting. And even assuming television, internet, the mobile phones, they all take another one-two hours, whatever. Even assuming commuting and all these things put together is only two more hours a day, another four years of my life is gone. Holding her hand, looking into her eye, I wrote there in the piece of paper, three years of life is left beyond the daily chores of life, sleeping, working, commuting, daily chores, basic entertainment, technological distractions. When I was 30, assuming I live up to 70, 3 years of life was left, which is 1095 days. Looking into her eye I told her that day, we don't have enough time left even to love each other. Where's the time to fight? That day, I wrote in my personal notebook, It's not the question of whose mistake, It's the question of whose life. Even assuming I was wrong here, by proving the other wrong, you don't get relationships right. It can give a lot of ego fulfillment. But this need to prove the other wrong will never get our relationships right. It's not the question of whose mistake, it's the question of whose life. In every meaningful relationship, if we are focused on proving each other wrong, then the love gets disturbed, happiness gets disturbed, peace gets disturbed. Then what are we filling our life with? Shamelessly, uninhibited, unapologetic. I'm ready to say, "Sorry." I'm ready to ask for forgiveness. I'm ready to ask you to give me another chance; whatever it takes, but I'm ready to take the U-Turns of life. Like having resolved my life as my responsibility, wherever I can, I will change myself, or I will change my approach, which is essentially U-Turn. This is my way of showing the world that I love, instead of being obsessed with being right. I want to show you you are much more important to me, instead of asking you to change your approach towards me, let me take this mature approach of taking the U-Turns. I'm ready to change my approach towards you because I have nothing to prove, whether you are right or I am right. Who is mightier here? I just want to cherish the love of my life. I just want to cherish the relationships in my life. And my way of cherishing is climbing one rung of ladder in the maturity of life, in choosing maturity in relationships in life, by one, reminding myself again and again, 1095 days left to live; 1095 days left to die. We don't have enough time left even to love each other; where is the time to fight? My second rung in maturity will be it's not the question of whose mistake. It's the question of whose life. And the fact that I share this life with you, I'm ready to surrender this obsession to be right and focus more on getting the relationship right. It's not about you or I; we have to become right in life. And the most important third run of maturity I will take in relationships is I am ready to take the U-Turns. I want you to take this daring step after today's session. Any one relationship that truly matters to you the most in life, but because of these ego issues, there has been no communication between you and the other. Can you take the U-Turn right now and initiate a communication with them? Your ego will try to stop you; go past your ego. Let your love triumph over your ego. Let your maturity triumph over your ego. Take the step forward; take this U-Turn. Initiate a communication with a relationship. The worst thing that will happen is you won't get a response. The best that'll happen is you might get back a precious relationship in life. And in case you do, please come back and share with us and inspire us that you did it. And if you did it, I'm so proud of you. I love you so much. Thank you.

====================

LESSON 10: To Love & to Be Loved
--------------------
<v ->The most right thing to do in relationships,</v> the most beautiful thing to do as a human being, and the most spiritual thing that you can do in life is to love the world the way the world has never been loved before. Next to God, human being alone has been bestowed with this ability to love the world. Human beings alone can feel the sense of responsibility towards the world. To love and to be loved is the most purifying of all human experiences. Lot of people do external makeup to look good. Make love the fragrance of your personality, and that will make you more beautiful than what any external makeup can do. The bottle must be clean from inside, not outside. And love is that purifying element that cleans the bottle from within. I'm not even giving you a religious sermon. I don't even touch religion in this interaction with you. I'm saying that's the right thing to do. I think that's the most human thing to do, and that's the most spiritual thing to do. That energy called God created you out of love. So what else can you be but love? Yet somehow, a sense of judgment, prejudices, hurt, ego, they all tend to tarnish the very nature of your being which is love. I just can't even tell you how beautiful you feel in not just being loved by the world, but in loving the world. Let it be one, let it be five, let it be 10, let it be 11, let it be an entire crowd. But some part of this world, some part of your world should be loved like they've never been loved before. And the greatest beneficiary through this is you, because in loving the world the best version of you, the most beautiful version of you, manifest in your life. There was this man who gifted a new car to his wife on her birthday and gave her a beautiful pouch and said, "I put all your driving license, some cash, your credit cards, everything in it. All the papers related to the car is also there in it. So please keep it safe in the dashboard, and go, honey, go and take a long drive and come." On the very first day she took the car out, she did meet with an accident. The damage was only to the car; no damage to any form of human life. The police did arrive, asked her to lower the window glass, and reached out to her saying, "Ma'am, your driving license." And this lady was guilt ridden. Very first day, a new car. I have got into an accident; I've dented the car. It's a gift from my husband. What will I go and tell him? Guilt ridden. She was so psychologically stunned. The police repeated, "Your driving license, ma'am." She remembered the husband saying the driving license is inside the pouch. So she opened her dashboard, opened that pouch, reached out to her driving license around which there was a note. And in the note the husband had written, "Honey, in case of an accident, I want you to remember, it is you that I love, not the car." I think, one, the husband was a visionary. He anticipated his wife will create an accident, but most importantly, he must have been a loving sweetheart. What does it do to anyone in your life to read a message like this. "In case of an accident, I want you to remember, it is you that I love, not the car." I think this materialistic world, we all have become more and more loving things and using people. But that's not how we were designed by the Creator. We should be using things and loving people. No matter what that material is. Everything that money can buy is a toy, expensive toy, million-dollar toy, but a toy. The fact that money could buy, it's a toy. And all these are meant to be there in your life for us to use it. People are there in your life for you to love them. I can hear you say, Mahatria, I am ready to love everyone, but they are not reciprocating that love to me. You don't love for reciprocation of love. You love because you love. The reward of loving is in loving. In every moment you love the world, you're nothing short of a divine manifestation. If divinity is love and in you loving the world, you're allowing the divine manifestation in you to manifest itself. And also remember this: starvation for love does not cease by receiving love. Starvation for love ceases only by giving love. If there's anyone of you starved for love, it is not because enough people do not love you. If anyone of you is starved for love, it's only because you are not loving enough people. You are not expressing your love to enough people. Starvation for love does not cease by receiving love. It ceases only by giving love. Live to give. Live to love the world. Love all; love all the time. Even in your professional engagement, let there be this love that you have for your team, for your colleagues, for the people who work for you, for the people who work with you. That you are not only all the time striving to lift yourself, but lift all of them. From love, it's easy to forgive. From love, it's easy to overlook the inadequacies of other people. From love, it's easy to celebrate the differences. The master card to life, the master key to life is love. I want you, before you experience Mahatria again, before you engage yourself to the next session of Quest, I want you to tell at least five people in your life how special they are, how much they mean to you. Didn't we decide, anything positive in five sentences; 55 sentences! Write personal letters to them if you need to, Expressive, demonstrative of how special they are. In fact, as you write those expressions, you should have tears of love. And as they read your expressions of love, it should cause tears in them. That is loving to the point of tears. And the way you will live and express love in your life is by remembering the language of love is touch. We don't touch each other enough. Technology has come in and done something. It's made all our distant relationships feel close to us, and it has brought a distance to all our close relationships. It looks like even within the family, if we have to communicate, we need to communicate with each other only through technology. So much so, we are becoming alien onto each other. The challenge of the modern age is not that technology is becoming as intelligent as human, but humans are becoming as unemotional as technology. We no more express emotions; we type emotions. Emotions have become a text for us. The language of love is touch. When you were in the womb of your mother, the only sense of your five senses that was active was the sense of touch. You experience a sense of oneness with your mother. So the language of love is touch. So I want you to bring back love in your life by bringing back the huddle, the hugs, the squeezes, the cuddles, the snuggles with your little ones. I want you to bring back nonsexual touch with your best friend, with your spouse, in your marriage. I never want you to alienate yourself from the elders in the family. You know what it is to lie down in somebody's lap or to take someone in your lap and stroking their hand. You know what it is to rest your head on someone's shoulders. You know what it is to hold someone's hands, not speak a word, and yet feel so much of togetherness. We used to do all these things before technology invaded our life. We used to throw our arms around our friends. We used to hold hands and walk. The best cushion used to be leaning on a loved one. The best pillow used to be lying down on the lap of a loved one. And what has happened to all those? You want love in action, then it has to be the language of touch. It's not about the gifts you buy. It's not about the cards you sign. It's not about the messages you text. It's about bringing the magic of touch back into close relationships in life. The magic of nonsexual touch back into relationships in life. So the next Rung of Maturity in relationships is to recognize to love and to be loved is the most purifying of all experiences. Another step in the Rung of Maturity of relationships is in recognizing starvation for love does not cease by receiving love. Starvation for love ceases only by giving love. Love all; love all the time. Another Rung of Maturity in relationships is to consistently remind yourself that you love people and use things and not the other way around, using people and loving things. And a very, very important step you need to take is to bring back the language of love, touch, into relationships. I dare to challenge you on this: at least a few people in your life should feel so secure in your love. So secure that they should feel as if they're once again in the womb of their mother every time they are with you. Let a few people experience this divine manifestation from you of being loved like they've never been loved before. And reminding you of the engagement that you'll at least let five people know, before you experience the next session, how special they are to you in as many ways as you can express; you'll express and let them know how special they are. Maybe one day, somewhere in this planet, I will bump into you and you'll dissolve in my hug. For the time being, I'm giving you a virtual hug through technology. Find yourself in my embrace. I love you so much. Thank you.

====================

LESSON 11: Forgiveness & Dropping the Ego
--------------------
<v ->If by creation, man is love,</v> why are there so many challenges and complications in relationships? Two things act as a barrier. Hurt and ego. They are such big barriers. Immaturity in relationships is to become a victim of hurt, is to become a victim of ego. So I'll put it this way. If there are a few scratches in my spectacles and through which I see life, everything will appear scratched, and ignorantly, immaturely, I will think all these scratches are on the objects that I see, not realizing these scratches are actually in my spectacles. All I require is a pair of new spectacles through which I can see life devoid of these scratches. And how true. We do not need new horizons, we just need new spectacles to look at our existing horizons, and we realize life is beautiful. We don't need new relationships in life. We only require new spectacles through which we can look at our existing relationships in life, mature spectacles through which we can look at our existing relationships in life, and we'll realize how beautiful life is. So we need to take two mature steps, two mature U-turns from our end, to bring back magic in relationship. One, drop guilt by forgiving yourself, and drop hurt by forgiving others. Either of these two, you carry guilt about yourself, or you're feeling hurt about other relationship, both are baggages from the past. You're simply carrying a baggage from your past. If I carry, right now, a five-kg dumbbell, like this, I am strong enough to carry this five-kg dumbbell, so I'll be able to effortlessly carry it. But if I continue to carry it for 10 minutes, it will not appear five kgs. It'll be much, much heavier, isn't it? If I continue to carry it for one hour, not only my arms, my shoulder will also begin to pain. If I continue to carry it till tomorrow, I might need physiotherapy. A simple five-kg load which right now is not so heavy in my hands will lead me to a point where I will need expert help to deal with it if I carry it for a day. Now you tell me what should I do if I have to stop suffering this load? Drop it. If I drop it, in that instant I get liberated. Both guilt and hurt are nothing but psychological load that we have been carrying longer than it should have been. Human we are. We will err sometimes. And because you have high moral ground, you will feel guilty for what you have done. Humans we are. We have fragile ego. And the way the world reacted to you certain times can cause hurt in you. Feeling that momentary guilt, feeling that momentary hurt, is human, natural. But continuing to carry it for days together, weeks together, months together, and some people for a lifetime. And the sheer emotional load, the sheer psychological load, both baggages from the past, create such deep scratches in your spectacles you're not able to see life with clear perspective. The magic of forgiveness is when you forgive yourself for whatever you have been. Life is not about who you were. Life is about what you can be. There is no sinner without a future, and there's no saint without a past. Forgive yourself, and liberate yourself from guilt. Forgive others, and liberate yourself from the load of hurt you're carrying about others. Two monks from a monastery, one elderly and one youngster who was doing his training under the elderly monk, as they were walking by a stream one day, they saw there was a young girl who was standing there, and she looked quite petrified. The youngster reached out to her and asked, "It's getting dark. It's going to be dangerous. Why are you standing here?" She said, "I'm afraid to cross the stream." The youngster immediately volunteered saying that we are also crossing the stream. "Get onto my shoulders. When we reach the other side I will drop you and go." And he carried that young girl. They went that side. He dropped her, and they continued to walk. The young monk could very clearly see the elderly monk was looking a little disturbed and asked him, "What is the cause for your anguish?" And the elderly monk said, "Don't you know that we are from the monasteries and we are not supposed to touch the opposite sex? Why did you carry that girl on your shoulders?" The youngster smiled and said, "Oh, that girl you're talking about, I dropped her long time back. Why are you still carrying her in your head?" People who have hurt you in life, have gone away from your life, or maybe they're still there in life, but that incident is a memory of the past. Suffering for anything that happened in the past is equal to you suffering your own memory. You're simply suffering your own memory. Liberate yourself through forgiveness. Forgive yourself and drop guilt. Forgive others and drop hurt. And you can move on. Before I come to the second scratch in the spectacle called ego, let's do a courageous step. It'll be so self-cleansing and purifying. May I request you to close your eyes, please. Visualize a person who has hurt you a lot. Visualize a person who has disturbed you the most. In your own mental eye I want you to forgive them right now. Let go; let go. Forgiveness is not liberating the other from you, forgiveness is liberating yourself from the other. Forgiveness simply means I'm giving up my right to carry the burden of hurt for something that has happened in my past. Forgive them. After all, you are only doing creative visualization. Take another bold step forward. Give them a hug; embrace them. Mahatria, for all that they have done? It's okay. Show yourself you can be good even to those who have not been good to you. You're going to feel so beautiful about yourself. Give them a hug And do the most divine thing that you can do. Wholeheartedly wish them good. Wish them a good life. That's the beautiful you, choosing to be good even to those who have not been good to you. Forgive them. Express the language of love by hugging them. And wholeheartedly wish them a very beautiful life. How beautiful do you feel? Keep your eyes closed; do it for one more person. Without me guiding you, on your own. Think of one more person who has hurt you in life. Wholeheartedly forgive them, give them a hug, and wish them good. It's such a self-cleansing, self-purifying experience. You're simply throwing the spectacles with scratches and seeing life with renewed spectacles. This is the new beautiful you. This is the mature you. This is divinity manifesting through you. Please open your eyes. If you did it, I'm so proud of you, so proud of you. Just because there is dirt out there in the world, it's neither a reason nor an excuse for us to be dirty in life. You have to hold yourself to certain standards and refuse to fall from those standards. The second scratch in our spectacles which is stopping us from being the lover that we can be is ego. When ego comes, everything else goes. When ego goes, everything else comes. Either your love can prevail over ego, or your ego will prevail over love. Either it is L greater than E, or it is E greater than L. All beautiful relationships, love prevails over ego. All troubled relationships, ego prevails over love. When ego comes, everything else goes. It seems there was a bird which was flying holding onto a fish, and it realized a lot of other birds were chasing it. The further and further it tried to fly more and more birds were chasing it. Only then the bird realized they're all not chasing me, they're chasing the fish I'm holding onto. So the bird immediately dropped that fish. As the fish was falling, all the other birds converged towards that falling fish. And now alone in the sky, it seems the bird remarked, "In dropping that fish, I gained the freedom of the skies. The entire sky became mine." That fish is ego. While it's true, when ego comes, everything else goes, when ego goes, everything else comes. Peace returns to your life. Happiness returns to your life. The beauty of love returns to your life. You have nothing to prove to anybody in the world. Egos is a perpetual beggar. It's all the time forcing you to prove something to the world. The most tiring of all experiences in life is this constant need to prove something to the world. You don't have to. Give love a chance. Instead of holding onto your ego and dropping love, from here onwards hold onto love and drop ego. If the other world thinks that they won in the process, let them think. They will have ego victories, but you will have the triumph of love. By allowing love to prevail over ego and forgiveness to liberate you from guilt and hurt, you remove these scratches, and in the entire process the fragrance of love for which you were created as a human being begins to manifest. And that's the most beautiful version of you. And that's the most mature way to life. I love you so much, and I'm so proud of you, for here I know somebody who chose to be good even to those who have not been good to you. That's the way to go. Love you. And thank you.

====================

LESSON 11: Meditation - Forgiveness & dropping the ego meditation

- Visualize a person who has hurt you a lot, visualize a person who has disturbed you the most in your own mental eye. I want you to forgive them right now. Let go. Let go. Forgiveness is not liberating the other from you. Forgiveness is liberating yourself from the other. Forgiveness simply means I'm giving up my right to carry the burden of hurt for something that has happened in my past. Forgive them after all. You're only doing creative visualization. Take another bold step forward. Give them a hug. Embrace them matria for all that they have done. It's okay. Show yourself you can be good even to those who have not been good to you. You're going to feel so beautiful about yourself. Give them a hug and do the most divine thing that you can do wholeheartedly. Wish them good, wish them a good life. That's the beautiful you choosing to be good. Even to those who have not been good to you. Forgive them. Express the language of love by hugging them and wholeheartedly wish them a very beautiful life. How beautiful do you feel? Keep your eyes closed. Do it for one more person without me guiding you on your own. Think of one more person who has hurt you in life wholeheartedly. Forgive them. Give them a hug and wish them good. It's such a self cleansing, self purifying experience. You're simply throwing the spectacles with scratches and seeing life with renewed spectacles. This is the new beautiful you. This is the matured you. This is divinity manifesting through you. Please open your eyes.

LESSON 12: Happiness Is the Way
--------------------
<v ->So much I've been speaking about love,</v> and here comes a very, very important hack. Not only to human dynamics, not only to relationships, but to the maturity with which you live your life and you pursue relationships. Here comes a very, very important hack. Love does not guarantee happiness, but happiness guarantees love. In a happy relationship, love is always felt. For example, think about you being with your friends. Now, when you are in a circle of friends, you're not all the time telling each other how much you mean to each other, how much you love each other. You, just together, find happiness. And in that happiness, unspoken, unexpressed, love is still felt. On the contrary, the more and more relationships become serious, the more and more it becomes discussion of who is right and what is wrong, we take away this joy, this celebration. In the absence of happiness, love is just an emotional sentiment. In the presence of happiness, love is a blossoming phenomenon. In fact, it magnifies the relationship. I remember, long time back in life, somebody had asked me to take their four-year-old grandson to an ice cream parlor. And as I was holding the hand of a four-year-old and walking, inexplicably, the four-year-old burst into laughter. With all my adult maturity, I turned in the direction of that four-year-old and asked him, "Why did you laugh?" The child looked straight in my eye and asked me in return, "Uncle, do I need a reason to be happy?" I was jolted by the question the child asked. "Uncle, do I need a reason to be happy?" And I'm wondering, as children, what was there to be happy? And yet, everything made us happy. Slipping and falling made us happy. Imaginary characters made us happy. Anything served as a toy, and we played with it, and we were happy. And here we are thinking that we have grown into mature individuals, knowledgeable people, living out of elevated consciousness, and become so serious about life. Everything seems so burdensome. Where is the glitter in your eyes? Where is the giggle? Where is the blush? Where is the smile? Where is the laughter? Where did we bury our happiness? When people ask me, "How are you?" and I say, "Top of the world," they ask me immediately in return, "Why? How?" Not only the world needs a reason to be happy, they think I need to even explain my happiness to them. For what? Bring back a little craziness into relationships. Bring back a few childlike, innocent moments into relationships. Bring back those moments of pranks and sweet-nothing moments into relationships. Friends, relationships have become boring. It used to be entertaining. It used to be engaging. There were so much lighter moments. Maybe because we don't make eye contact with people anymore. Our eye contact is with technology all the time, and somewhere the sense of maturity. Maturity is not speaking big, big concepts in life. Maturity is dealing with those little, little things in life with your happiness and peace intact. When you live your life through the spectacles of love, it doesn't necessarily guarantee happiness. But when you live through your life through the spectacles of happiness, happy organization, happy meet between friends, a happy individual welcoming others who come home, and happy individual going back home, when we achieve this transformation, love need not even be expressed, it is felt. How do we create a happy relationship? First stop taking yourself so serious. Learn to laugh at yourself and at your life. We all have our lesser moments. We all have those moments when we falter. Instead of getting too worked up about it, instead of getting upset about it, instead of having anger issues about it, first take yourself a little lighter and less serious. Learn to laugh at yourself and at your life. It seems a man had arranged for a party and everybody had come. There was music, and everybody were dancing, and he was dancing the happiest. Nobody knew for what this party was. So one of the guests mustered the courage to go and ask the host, "What is this party for? And why are you looking so elated and dancing with so much happiness?" Still dancing, the man said, "Oh, you don't know that morning my Mercedes Benz met with an accident, and it's damaged beyond repair." Saying that, he continued to dance. Everybody who was dancing stopped dancing. They said, "What? Your luxury sedan is damaged beyond repair, and you're giving us a party and dancing?" The man, for the first time, stopped dancing. And he told everybody, "While the vehicle is damaged beyond repair, nothing happened to the driver. I was the one who was driving the Mercedes Benz." And it seems then the man said, "The Benz is gone, but with money I will buy three more. If my little finger has gone in that accident, all the money in the world would not have got me back my little finger. Let's celebrate that the driver is intact and safe with his little finger still working." And he continued to dance. When you develop that attitude towards life, when you can turn even a disaster into a celebration, in your presence, all relationship blossoms. Talk to your children about what they are interested in, rather than all the time taking a moral high ground of advising them what is right and wrong. Talk to them what they're interested in. They like football, talk to them football. They want to watch a TV series, watch along with them. And just by showing interest in what they're interested in, and that is what children see in a friend. When you show interest in what they are interested in, they find you interesting. And whoever they find interesting, they see a friend in them. Here is an opportunity, as a parent, to show joy in what your children are interested in and become their best friend. Bring back a little naughtiness and prank into your marriage, with your best friends. Don't be so serious. Don't walk around life as if you are one enlightened master all the time, which you are not. You heard the story of the laughing monks. There were three monks. They're called the laughing monks. The only thing thing they did in their life was laugh in response to anything that was asked to them. They used to go from village to village and laugh. People used to come and share their troubles with them, and their response was always laughter. First of all, right now, as you're listening to me, don't keep such a serious face and listen to me. Smile. Let there be radiance of smile in your eyes. Feel a little lighter; sit a little more casual. I know you love me, and I love you. We have been together too long in this journey for you to be so serious when you're experiencing me. Transformation itself should be a happy journey. Everything in your life must be a celebration. So listen to me, we are talking about laughing monks, and you cannot look so serious. See, I generally don't smile. Even I'm smiling. And one day, one of the three laughing monks died. Villages from everywhere congregated to find out, "Whenever we spoke of our challenges, they always laughed at us. Now let us see how they handle the loss of one of their loved ones." And they were shocked to see the two laughing monks were going around this one body, laughing at the body. They all said, "This is not fair. For everything you laugh; we can understand. You have lost a friend, and you're still laughing?" One of them said, "All our life, the only thing we know is to laugh. Now, if we don't laugh, his spirit from there will look at us, and he will laugh at us. And that's why we are laughing." Bring back happy relationships. Ask yourself this question. I think as human beings, we have lost this ability to be happy. Go home, not hoping they will make you happy. Go home to make them happy. We have turned food into an enemy. We don't see food anymore. Food has become carbohydrates, protein, fat, minerals, vitamins. We don't see food anymore. And from the world I come from, there is the system of medicine called Ayurveda. And Ayurveda says, "Happily cooked, happily served, happily consumed, food becomes health." Any one of these three, if the cooking was not happy, if the serving was not happy, if the consumption was not happy, it becomes a disease. You want food to turn into health? You happily cook, you happily serve, and you happily consume. We have turned food into an enemy. Now let consuming food become a seller. I'm not telling you become reckless, but I'm saying whatever you eat, do it with happiness. Celebration of rhythm is music. Celebration of movement is dance. Celebration of body is health. Celebration of God is faith. Celebration of relationship is love. And celebration of blessings is happiness. If you can start seeing all your relationships as a blessing in your life and you start celebrating them, you'll find happiness in life. And this happiness will be the context in which love will blossom in life. Since the world has forgotten to be happy, ask yourself this question every day, "How can I make my loved ones happy?" And whatever it takes, bring happiness into their life. Or I'll put it this way. You give happiness to the world, and the world will reciprocate with love back to you. The most mature hack to transforming a relationship is in happiness, love is felt. How do I create happy relationships? Share your stories of how you have turned relationships into happy relationships. And let's not only learn from Mahatria. Let's also learn from you through your inspirational stories. And we will also bring happiness in our relationship and experience that love. I love you so much, happily. I love you so much. Thank you.

====================

LESSON 13: Intelligence & Emotions
--------------------
<v ->One of the greatest challenges,</v> both in terms of how we respond to life and in relationships, is the way we have been designed as a human being. There are two aspects. One, our emotions, and two, our intelligence. Human engineering is like this. We have been designed in such a way that when we are emotional, our intelligence takes a backseat. And when we are too rational, too analytical, our emotions take a backseat. So at any given time, it's either your intelligence or your emotions which is at the forefront. And it's by decision that wisdom that created us has engineered us like this. Only because of this, this aspect called wondering is so integral to being a human being. Like the nursery rhyme that goes "Twinkle, twinkle little star, "how I wonder what you are." An element of innocence is needed for us to wonder, whether it is our taste or it is a form or it is a form of music or anything. For you to be enthralled, for you to be in a state of wonderment, for you to be overwhelmed about anything, means the intelligence has to take a backseat, and we have to be childlike in our emotional state. Only then, wonderment is possible. So that is why expressions like aha! wow! all this is so integral to the way a human being lives life because we can be childlike in our emotional state. However, this very design where where our emotions are in the forefront so that we can live in wonderment and intelligence taking a backseat becomes a major challenge in the way we respond to life. What's the challenge? In the sway of emotions, intelligence does not work, whether it is for you or for others. That is why when we are overwhelmed with emotions, we say things which otherwise we wouldn't say, we perform acts which otherwise we will not perform. Sorry to say this, but to put things in context, suicide itself is an emotional decision that is taken when your rational intelligence has taken a backseat. That is why researchers always say, "If you can pass that moment, you may not even revisit that idea." So what happens is when emotions engulf us, we tend to react; we tend to say things that we wouldn't. So often, we make wrong decisions in life. In fact, any decision that has been taken, whether it's the resigning a job when you were overwhelmed with emotions or dropping a relationship or sometimes being nasty in the way we communicate, which ends up hurting not only the individual but the relationship as a whole, are all the result and effect of the emotions being in the forefront and the rational intelligence taking a backseat. So if I have to give you one prescription, one psychological prescription which is going to make a humongous difference in your life, it'll be this: Because in the sway of emotions, intelligence does not work, abstain from action, and abstain from decision-making in an emotional environment. Abstain from action, abstain from decision-making in an emotional environment, whether it is you or the other. Sometimes what happens is, the other person is overwhelmed in emotions. Maybe they felt a hurt or they were angry or they were frustrated or they were feeling a little low about it. But engulfed in emotions. You're not. You try to make sense to the other person by rationing out the entire thing, saying that what I meant was, my true intentions were; you try to reason out to them, but you cannot make sense to those who are right now engulfed in emotions. Whatever you try to say, for them to comprehend, they must be in a state of intellectual absorption. But when emotions have engulfed them, they are not in a state of emotional absorption, and hence it does not make sense. Have you noticed, what starts as a discussion which is what is right, when it becomes an argument it becomes who is right? The focus is no more about what is right; the focus has become who is right. In a discussion the focus is on the issue. In an argument, the focus has become on the personalities. Am I right? I am interested in proving I'm right; you wanted to prove you are right. Emotions run high, and in the entire process, except probably me hurting the other or the other hurting me, nothing else is achieved. Abstain from action, abstain from decision-making every time you find in the environment the emotions are running high. The time to correct a mistake is never during the mistake. Every attempt of yours in trying to correct someone's mistake by giving of even in a professional situation, leave alone personal relationship, there is always this implicit disobedience. See, explicit disobedience is easy to handle. Somebody disagrees with you vocally. We can reason it out. They'll simply nod their head, even in a professional environment. In front of you, they'll nod their head. And internally, they're disagreeing with you: implicit disobedience. So you think you've driven the point, but the other has not absorbed it at all. When you have said it and the other has not absorbed it, it creates no change. So whenever you find the other person is emotional, wait for emotions to settle down. There is a beauty to this design, Emotions have a time span. They're never everlasting. Different people have different emotional thresholds. For some people it's minutes, for some people it's an hour, for some people by the day; emotions settle down. They're back into an intellectual absorption; now you can make sense to them. The time to correct a mistake is never during the mistake. Even more importantly, you cannot resolve a fight during the fight. This doesn't mean you are giving up. This doesn't mean you're becoming submissive. This simply means you're taking a very mature approach in the situation. Because you understand life from an elevated state of consciousness, you're taking a very mature approach in the situation. Whether emotions engulf me, the moment I become aware of it or I find that emotions have consumed the other, the moment I become aware of it, I gently whisper into myself: in the sway of emotions, intelligence does not work. Abstain from action; abstain from decision-making; wait for the emotions to settle down. The leader in the organization has pulled you up for something that's gone wrong. You are absolutely convinced that you were not the one who committed the mistake. But right now there is a prejudice from that end; right now if you ever attempt to clarify your stance, it'll only turn into not what is right, who is right. An argument. Either you'll feel hurt or you'll hurt which is not what you want to do in an organizational professional setup. You're not being submissive; you're not giving up; you're just taking a mature approach by saying, "Right now I'll abstain from action. "I'll abstain from decision-making." I know a lot of people who get overwhelmed with emotion, they resign their job and struggle to get another job. Wait for a day, maybe two. Go back and have a direct communication. There is beauty in direct communication. You can either clarify, or you'll get clarified. A couple of days later when the emotions have settled down, go and have a one-on-one, face-to-face, direct communication. And that is a mature approach to relationships. Same as the case, somewhere you are trying to reason, the other is unreasonable, and you realize your emotions have engulfed you. Hold back; hold back. There is another day in our life. There will be another sunrise. Everything need not get done now; everything need not get done by tonight. You're just taking a very prudent approach here. Wait; in a day's time, your emotions will settle down; you'll be in a much better position to communicate. Because when my intelligence is in the forefront, I'm a much more effective communicator than when my emotions are there in the forefront. And now you'll have a much better empowerment in your communication. Once again, either you'll end up clarifying or somebody produces counter communication to you, and you'll gain clarity on where you need to correct yourself. One: Human beings are designed in such a way, either your intelligence is in the forefront or your emotions are in the forefront. Why? Two: Only if my emotions are there in the forefront, with those childlike emotions, I'm capable of wonderment in life. Poetries would have never happened in the world if man was not capable of being in a state of wonderment. All poetries in the world are born out of wonderment. Creative expressions, artistic expressions happen only when you have emotions in the forefront. However, three: The problem with this in human relationships is when emotions are in the forefront and your intelligence is in the background, your sense of judgment is impaired. You perform acts which otherwise you will not; you make wrong decisions in life. So, four: In the sway of emotions, intelligence does not work. So the best thing that you can do is, five: Abstain from action, abstain from decision-making whether it is you or the other. When the environment is overwhelmed with emotions, abstain from action, abstain from decision-making. The beauty is, six: Emotions have a time span. It will settle down. In minutes or hour or by the day, it will settle down. And now you can make sense. Seven: The power of direct communication. It either helps you to clarify or get clarified. By simply applying this mature approach into relationships, you'll get the best of both. You'll have those moments when your emotions will be in the forefront. You'll cherish life, you'll celebrate life, you'll live it to the hilt in a state of wonderment. And yet, whenever there has to be a bone of contention that has to be resolved in relationships, when conflicts and differences have to be resolved in relationships, you will also wait for the emotions to settle down, bring your intelligence into the forefront, effectively communicate, make sense to the other, and thereby build mature relationships. So next time, when you find the environment is overwhelmed with the emotions, somewhere in the air, I want you to listen to the whisper of Mahatria telling you, "Hi; abstain from action, abstain from decision-making, just hold back." And that is a mature way to get the best of both with which you have been engineered by that wisdom. The best of emotions and also the best of human intelligence. Master relationships, and you'll conquer life. I love you so much. Thank you.

====================

LESSON 14: Make Your Love Visible
--------------------
<v ->People relate to you</v> much more for what they can be with you than what you are with them. In a simple sentence, people get drawn towards you not because you are special but people get drawn towards you because you make them feel special. There is always this pull, this attraction, this magnetism towards people in whose presence I feel beautiful, I feel secure, I feel confident, I feel not judged. In the presence of people where I can be myself, in the presence of people where my vulnerability will not be exploited, or it'll not be held against me. So, people get drawn not because you are special but you make them feel special in your presence. So a very important aspect of human relationships, a very mature way of understanding how we get the We in our life right, is this: it's not about what you feel for me; it is about how you make feel when I'm with you. Now in this direction, though we genuinely love people around us, we genuinely want to empower other people for their own betterment and good, sometimes unknowingly, not intentionally, but unintentionally we end up hurting people or creating a distance from people. People tend to withdraw from us. So what are some of those? The first and foremost of all is this. In every human being, right from your children to your best friends to your spouse to your parents to your colleagues to your team, the need to be respected is far greater in a human being than the need for growth. What do I mean by that? If somewhere in the process of how Mahatria is explaining this journey into Infinitheism, this journey of infinite possibilities, this journey of experiencing holistic abundance in life, somewhere either in my gesture or in my tone or in the way I explain the different facets of life, if I ever get you to feel not respected, you will not continue with this Quest. You'll withdraw yourself. Somewhere you come forward to share your insights, your stories of growth, your transformational insights. You come and want to inspire the fellow Tribe. And somewhere in your sharing, either in the comments that comes from the fellow Tribe, or in the way... whatever you have shared had been edited or curated before it was posted, somewhere you get this feeling of not being respected, you'll immediately tend to withdraw because in every human being, the need to feel respected is far greater than the need for growth. So the secret of leadership whether as parents leading the younger generation, or as teachers leading your students, or as an author empowering the seekers here, or building a world class sports team, no matter what you are doing. The secret of empowering leadership is, "How do I give a feedback?" Or "How do I help people to correct themselves by still making them feel respected?" Because that order does not change in any human being. First is the need to feel respected. In fact, the extent to which you make people feel respected, to that extent they become open to your suggestions, your advice, your guidance, your expert counseling. It's so essential whether I do it as a professional psychologist or because I'm the captain of a team or in a professional role I'm leading an entire organization towards a project completion. Whatever I do amongst best friends, with all the genuine intention I have to help my friend, to lift him to higher states of consciousness, to higher states of a moral understanding of right and wrong in life. If I have to do any of these things, I first need to make the other person feel valued, respected; a sense of belonging has to be created. And only then, you can deliver the correction, or the suggestion, or the improvement to the other person. In fact, this is where unintentionally we get it wrong out of this love, out of this affection, out of this care that we have for people. We go ahead and give them a feedback, but in the way the feedback comes, it sometimes makes them feel maybe half your age, but when they feel not respected, they don't feel a sense of belonging. And when they don't feel a sense of belonging, whatever you communicate is not getting inside them; it gets around them. It does not have a transforming effect. So always in relating with others, a mature approach is to make the other person feel respected, feel valued. It can be anything. Begin the conversation by first appreciating or speaking something positive or cherishing a moment that you have shared or somewhere just pamper the ego of the other person by saying, "If you do not mind," "If it is okay with you," "I want to..." "I have an observation about you." "So I just want to reflect you to you. Take it or leave it." Somewhere, you're not being defensive. You are just putting the understanding of human behavior into practice, and that gives you an empowering state. So always remember, the need to feel respected is far greater in every human being than the need for growth. In fact, if you make people feel respected, they will volunteer to ask you for suggestion, advice, and feedback. They would want you to participate in their journey of growth. Two: if you ever give them a feeling you do not respect their feelings, they do not feel respected. You can follow the etiquettes, you can get the tonology of your communication right, you can have all these misters and Sir and Madam. Your Highness, everything that English etiquette gives you, you can bring all that in your communication. But somewhere in the entire process, they are a little disturbed about something, disappointed about something, or overly elated about something that they've achieved right now. Feeling hurt in a relationship, feeling a little sad about what had happened. Whatever, whatever maybe their emotion. Out of our infinite love for them, you don't want them to feel sad. So you tell them, "For such a small thing, why are you getting so disturbed? It's such a trivial thing, "and this should not be bothering you so much." The intention here is one of love. The intention here is you do not want your beloved to suffer for something. So you think you want to bring them out of a negative emotion, but in the process, they get this feeling you don't respect their feelings right now. And when people feel you do not respect their feelings right now, they feel you do not respect them. And when they feel you do not respect them, they are not hearing another word of what you're communicating. Hearing is physical; listening is psychological. Everybody hears you, but only when they feel respected, they will listen to you. So next time, when you find a loved one engulfed in an emotion, it's the time to just throw your arms around their shoulders. There is magic in these two words: "I understand." Magic, pure magic, just by letting others know, "I understand." It's magical to express this: "Feeling with your feelings." Just these sentences. "I understand." "Feeling with your feelings." It makes the other person feel so important. And in feeling important in those moments, they feel respected. In feeling respected, they open up to you. In opening up to you, they don't just physically hear through their ears, they psychologically listen to what you say. And that is empowering. That is empowerment. Next time you see a loved one, tears trickling down, the best thing that you can do is, before you use your tongue, let your hands reach out to wipe those tears; hold them in an embrace. Let them rest their head on your shoulders, run your fingers through their hair, make them feel secure, make them feel respected, make them feel, "I understand." Sometimes even without helping people to come out of the situation in which they are, you help relationships to grow, to the extent you display respect to people. And you display respect to people by showing respect to their emotions. And three: do whatever it takes to make people feel beautiful. I keep hearing this phrase everywhere in the world, "Don't rub me on the wrong side." But why would you do that? Why would you ever want to rub another human being, especially the ones you love? Why would you ever want to rub them on the wrong side and show them how ugly they are? Why can't we always rub people on the right side, their best side, and show them how beautiful they are? The more and more you help people to feel beautiful in your presence, literally like a magnet, people get drawn towards you. And the more and more I can help people to feel beautiful about themselves, the more and more I create beautiful relationships in life. Like I said in the earlier session, you master relationships, you conquer life. Make this a resolve. That you will remember all these three steps in your everyday relationships. And every day in every relationship, the need to feel respected is greater than the need for growth in people. Only when I show respect to the feelings of other people, they feel respected. There is magic in this expression. "I understand." "Feeling with your feelings," and one of the expressions of love that whenever you are with me, I will do everything in my capacity to make you feel beautiful. For I understand it's not what I feel for you, it is what I make you feel when you're with me that makes all the difference in relationships. So share with the rest of us all those little little fine tunings that you're doing to turn relationships truly magical, and inspire the rest of the Tribe to learn from you. And let's collectively grow by making individuals beautiful, and thus build a beautiful world. I truly believe you are feeling beautiful every time you are with Mahatria. I love you so much. Thank you.

====================

LESSON 15: Expectations Management
--------------------
<v ->In all these sessions,</v> I have never told you welcome back. Today, I feel like telling you, hey beautiful you, hey mature you, what it is to live a human life by comprehending life and applying this understanding into day-to-day living. Like I said earlier, maturity is not in talking big, big concepts. Maturity is in our ability to go through our day-to-day life with our peace and happiness intact. Somehow nobody gave us a user manual to life. Most of us only through trial and error and experimentation, we have learned to live our life. The sooner we can understand the laws of life, the equations of life, the best practices of life, the sooner we realize the power of self-awareness by which we understand ourselves well, the sooner we lift ourselves to the higher orbits of consciousness so that we live in the most mature way. The day-to-day moments of our life, not only you feel beautiful, not only you make others feel beautiful, your heart can beat; life is beautiful. Life is truly beautiful, isn't it? And what magnifies this beautiful life is meaningful relationships, the more and more my relationships turn into bliss of love. Happiness and love in relationships, the more and more I can experience bliss of love in my day-to-day relationships, you're left with no other alternative than when anybody in the world questions you, how is life? With a glitter in the eye and a smile in your lips and a dance in your heart, we can only say life is beautiful. And one of the things that parades this beautiful life is expectations. No, I'm not going to tell you, drop expectations; I will never ever give you an ideal that you cannot live by. I will never ever try to demand such moral high grounds which isn't practical for us to practice in day-to-day life. See, it's not about what is there in print or what is there in scripture or what is prophesied. End of the day, it should be practical enough for me to integrate it into my day-to-day living. So I would never be naive enough to tell you to drop expectations, but I would definitely tell you, expectations is at the core that parades this otherwise beautiful life. So the focus here is not about dropping expectations; the focus here is about expectation management. What do I mean by expectation management, management of what? I have what I have, and I have to get the best out of what I have. How do I get the best out of what I have? First and foremost of all is to empathize by recognizing. I'll ask you a question. Are you able to live by all the expectations you have from yourself? Leave the world, whether the world lives up to your expectation or not. I'm sure you have expectations from yourself in terms of the goals you want to achieve, in terms of the ethical principles you want to live by, in terms of the discipline that you want to follow, in terms of wanting to be counseled. In terms of having to live through all that we have learned in the various sessions of this Quest, A Journey into Infinitheism, into this Quest of holistic abundance, in this entire journey with Mahatria, I'm sure there are things that you live by, there are things that you understood not able to live by, and there are things that you are still not in agreement with. So the big question is this, if I am not able to live up by all the expectations I have from myself, why am I expecting the rest of the world to live up to my expectations? So not even trying to be philosophical, simply trying to be practical, understand neither all your expectations will be fulfilled in life, nor all your expectations will remain unfulfilled in life. Relationships are not products to be living up to your expectations. Relationships are not commodities to fit into your expectations. Relationships simply magnify life. They are dynamic. As unique, individualistic, original, and different you are, so are others. I have an outlook towards life, and they too have an outlook towards life. In fact, the beauty about life is the very spice in relationships is because we are different. Otherwise it'll be like mechanical robots coming together to relate with each other. Today, the entire happiness is in the unpredictability of relationships; the entire excitement is there is no predictable response to any situation, for the same thing yesterday your daughter would've replied differently, and for the same thing today her reply will be different. A request that you had a week ago and your dad said, yes, and today you're going to have a similar request and he's going to say, no. A bouquet of flowers look beautiful because each flower is a different color. Life is a beautiful bouquet of all of us being so different from each other. Neither all your expectations are going to be fulfilled in life nor all your expectations are going to remain unfulfilled in life. There is no obligation either from God or from life or from your fellow creation to live up to every expectation of yours. Mahatria may not have lived up to your expectation, and I understand. In certain areas you may not have lived up to my expectation; I understand that too. The moment you develop this acceptance, neither all my expectations will be fulfilled in life nor all my expectations will remain unfulfilled in life, there is liberation; there is freedom. It's a let go. And with that freedom when you relate with people, you don't burden the world by dumping your expectations on them. Yes, you have a right to your expectations, and the world has a right to either fulfill it or not fulfill it. Most of your disappointments in life, in relationships, is because you're standing under a mango tree expecting oranges; unrealistic expectations. Some people are romantic; some people are not. Some people are expressive; some people are not. Some people are very extroverted, demonstrative in their happiness; some people are not. Some people know how to laugh, some people know how to smile, and some people keep a frown; we are all differently designed. Some people are interesting; you can engage in any conversation with them. Some people are not participative. Some like company; some like solitude. In every category, in every form, with every differentiation, we all have been created as these unique human beings. In fact, the more and more you learn to celebrate differences rather than screaming to the world, be like me, be like me, be the way I want. Nothing of the world changes, but you liberate yourself. Most of your disappointment in life is because you're standing under a mango tree expecting oranges. To expect rain on a hot day, to expect a microwave oven to cool something, to expect a refrigerator to heat something, how insane it is. So it is to expect oranges from a mango tree or mango from an orange tree. You can keep expecting, but it's never going to get fulfilled. And the irony is not only we stand under a mango tree expecting oranges, then we get angry at the mango tree for not giving us oranges. But how will it? It was never meant to be. We have only two parts in life. You can either happily get along, or you can happily get away. Immature choices: miserably get along, or miserably get away. Mature path is you either happily get along or happily get away. Maturity is to recognize I'm standing under a mango tree expecting oranges. Now, what are my alternatives? I want to happily get along. I will have to change my expectations to expecting mangoes from a mango tree because my expectation of oranges is not going to be fulfilled. But I'm not ready to leave this tree; I'm not ready to drop this relationship in my life. So I change my expectations to expect mangoes from a mango tree; this is happily getting along. Mahatria, I cannot do that. Mahatria, I want oranges. Well then you have to happily get away. This tree will not fulfill that expectation. This relationship is not going to fulfill that expectation for you. You have to now go in search of an orange tree from where alone you will get oranges. I repeat: immature path to life, immature approach to relationship, is I either miserably get along, or I miserably get away. Mature path to relationship is either I will drop my expectations for oranges from a mango tree and start cherishing the mangoes from a mango tree, happily get along, or I will dare to walk away from this tree and go in search of the tree for the fruits that I want, happily get away. Of all the creations of God, man is the greatest of all creations. And you, as the greatest of all creations, live your life with heightened maturity, ensuring your life is always beautiful through effective expectation management, of simply recognizing nothing of the other has the obligation to fulfill all my expectations. So neither all my expectations will be fulfilled nor all my expectations will remain unfulfilled. And I take this approach of happily getting along or happily getting away. Before you come back to experience me, just to see the joy that you get out of admiring what is beautiful in other people, how fulfilling it is to happily get along in those relationships that truly matter to you in life, you will write three love letters. Whether you will hand write them, a thing like that, or you'll email them, so be it, but it will be a personal expression where you admire at least 11 things in a fellow relationship, and this will be your way of making them beautiful, making them feel beautiful, and in the process, reinforcing this deep positive emotion within you. And that is life is beautiful. Hey beautiful you, I love you so much, thank you.

LESSON 16: The Guided Process of Prema Nidra
--------------------
<v ->What a gift it is,</v> the power of imagination. What a gift it is, that we all have a mental reality in which we can create whatever wishful experience, whatever wishful experience that we want. We use the power of creative visualization in the process of Purna Shakti to take us into a heightened state of energy from where we release our dreams in the present continuous to ensure that we create this mental comfort zone and allow it to manifest in our life. Once again, today, we are going to use the power of creative visualization, the power of imagination, the power of our own internal visual reality, to feel so much more closer to all these relationships that truly matter the most in life. Everything in the world was first a thought. All thoughts do not become things, but all things were first a thought. And recognizing that all things were first a thought, it's only scientific for us to recognize then if I have to improve the quality of things in my life, then I have to improve the quality of my thoughts. Healthier the seeds, better the harvest. When I improve my thinking, some of which manifests in the physical reality, becomes quality things in our life. So what we are going to do is go through again a creative visualization, a guided process where, uninhibited, we are going to feel that proximity to some of these relationships that truly matter to us the most in life. This process is called Prema Nidra. I've said this even earlier, don't be bothered about a jargons and terminology, but in the language that I speak from where I come, prema means love, nidra means relaxation. How through the process of love can I experience a very relaxed, peaceful state within me. To love and to be loved is the most purifying of all experiences. And this entire process of Prema Nidra is nothing but intensifying this experience of to love and to be loved and feeling beautiful, peaceful, and in a state of absolute relaxation from within. May I request you to please close your eyes. Please. I know it is a visualization, so I know you want to open your, keep your eyes open, but you want to experience the entire depth of this entire experience. You're going to get that only if you run this in your own visual reality for which you need to shut your eyes. Please close your eyes. Visually connect to your mother. See your mother there. Take her hands in your hands. Hold her hands. Look into her eyes. You might have already said it a million times, but now as a part of Prema Nidra, express your love to your mother; tell her in three, five sentences how much you cherish her, how much you celebrate her, and how much she means to you. Tell her how much you value her selflessness in making you who you are. If this is causing tears in her eyes, so be it. If this is causing tears to ooze in your own eyes, so be it. Now give her the warmest embrace. Pour your love; pour your affection. And hug her. Beautiful, lovely. Now connect to your dad. I know a lot of you would've shared a very formal relationship with your dad. Let's break those barriers. Let's break the inhibition. Maybe in physical reality you've never done this before, but now part of Prema Nidra, do it. Take your dad's hands in your hands. Look him in the eye. Express in three to five sentences what your dad means to you. Don't drop your eyes. Keep looking at your dad. Tell him how much you look up to him, how much he has been an inspiration in your life, how in every way, he has ensured that you get to live the life that you are living right now. Make your dad melt in your love. Give him a hard hug. Embrace him tight. If you're feeling overwhelmed, so be it. These are right emotions. Right, deep, positive emotions. Feel the fragrance of love growing in you. Feel love with you, within you, around you. Who do you consider as your best friend in life? Who? Who do you consider as the best friend in your life? Now take your best friend's hands into your hands. Smile; blush. But beyond all these things, let your friend know what he, she means to you. I know you feel like expressing it to so many of your friends. Do it to one as part of Prema Nidra. Feel engulfed in love in three to five sentences. Now, I always told my friend, It's okay. Say it one more time then. I've never told my friend. Good things have to have a beginning. And let this be your first experience of telling your friend what your friend means to you, how much you value this friend in your life. Look at those beautiful eyes, and tell your friend in three to five sentences how much you love your friend. Dissolve into each other in a warm embrace. Hug each other in such a way you no more know where you end and where your friend begins. Dissolve into each other. Lovely. To love and to be loved is the most purifying of all human experiences. Now connect to a child, your own, your niece, your nephew; connect to a little one, anybody, but connect to a little one. Either go down to their height, or lift them; hold them in your arms. Doesn't matter how much they understand. You feel beautiful by your own expression. So tell the little one how much that little one means to you and how much you love the little one. Care not whether the little one understands or not. You express it. Cuddle the little one. Squeeze a little. Extend a kiss. Feel so divine in this love. Feel so beautiful in this love. Feel cleansed in this love. Let's take this love beyond just people. Something in the environment, a pet, a plant, a tree, anything. Just take your love a little beyond just people. Any other form of life. I shamelessly hug trees. I love hugging trees. I relate to every pet that ever crosses me. Maybe it's your fish in the aquarium, your birds. Anything. Connect to a form of life in the environment, and show that your love is not just exclusive to people but it also includes other forms of life. In whatever way you want to express, through gestures, through words, overflow in love. Prema in love. Nidra. Let this take you into a deep state of relaxation. Let this overflowing love give you the experience of deep peace. Feel so divine and beautiful about yourself. Let this love remain the fragrance of your personality. Let all relationships in life bask in your love. By cherishing the product, I show how much I cherish the manufacturer. By loving the creation, you're actually loving the creator. By loving every form of life, you're actually loving God. Feeling that love has become the fragrance of your personality, very, very gently, please open your eyes. Whoever you are and wherever you are, hey, loving, lovely, lovable you, Mahatria loves you so much. Maybe one day I will see you in person and take your hands into my hands and look into your eye, and in three to five sentences, I too will tell you how much I love you. I love you so much. Thank you.

Thee - Deepen Your Relationship With Existence

====================

LESSON 17: Clean the Bottle From Within
--------------------
<v ->When we began this entire journey,</v> we learned that life hinges on three relationships. Relationship with myself, Me, relationship with others, We, and relationship with that force above, Thee. And unless we get our life, in that order, right in all the three dimensions, a sense of incompleteness will always be there in life. So no matter what we do in our life, no matter what we achieve in our life, no matter what we accomplish in our life, the sense of incompleteness will keep disturbing you, disturbing your peace. And there is this inexplicable emptiness within. And here we are, having traveled through this entire journey of Me and We, ready to take this step forward towards Thee, a subject that is normally reserved for religion to deal with. Having established that every human being is unique, original, rare, different, one of its kind, to think a population of over 7.5 billion people can be forcefully fit into six major boxes called religion is beyond my even imagination. Religion is there to guide us not to define and confine us. It's a signpost; while I'm driving, there is a signpost that tells me I can take right, I can take left. Where will right take me? Where will left take me? And then, it is left to individual discretion on what to do. Don't get me wrong. This is not about not being religious. This is about having this heightened understanding of what is the essential signs in religion and applying that in your day-to-day life. If the power of spiritual principles are not integrated into your day-to-day materialistic life, they remain abstract concepts. In its true essence, true to the vision of the founders of every religion, we should actually be experiencing a world of brotherhood, a world of harmony, a world of interdependence, a world of love, a world of peace. On the contrary, it has led to hatred, selfishness, murder, riots, war. So somewhere, fundamentally we have got something wrong. Somewhere in the core, we have deviated from the original vision of the founders of religion. So this entire experience in Quest, in building this relationship, strengthening this relationship with Thee is not anti-religion, but it is to understand the signs of religion and put it into day-to-day practice, integration of spirituality into materialistic life, application of the highest principles of life into our day-to-day choices. And the very first step I want you to understand is religion itself is derived from two words Re Ligare: Re means again; Ligare means origin. So the heart of religion, the basic purpose of religion, is to lead you again to your origin. Bible says, God created human being after his own image. In Sikhism, the founder says, the creator is embedded in every creation. In the Vedic tradition they say, this individual consciousness, Jivatma, descended from that universal consciousness, Paramatma. Quran says, everything descended from Allah. Gautama Buddha says, everything came from that nothing. So in essence, all the religions say, your origin is God, divinity. Since we have a very narrow definition to God, as much as possible through all the future sessions, I'm going to use much more of the phrase divinity rather than the confined definition we hold to God. So if religion is Re Ligare, again your origin. Religion serves its purpose only to the extent that you are living your life in such a way that every day, through every choice, with every decision, you feel closer and closer to divinity. Not moving further and further away from divinity but feeling closer and closer to divinity. And just to understand that, let's do a small interaction. Let me now create a table. And in this table, on the left hand side, I want to list all these six boxes, the major religions, Christianity, Islam, Hinduism, Jainism, Buddhism, Sikhism. And on the right hand side, let me list a few things, Mosque, Bible, Vegetarianism, Bhagavad Gita, Kirpan, Dharmapala, I can go on. And I ask most of you on that side to match the following; it shouldn't be difficult for you to draw Mosque to Islam, Bible to Christianity, Bhagavad Gita to Hinduism, Kirpan to Sikhism, Dharmapala to Buddhism. It shouldn't be difficult because each one is a symbol of a religion. Let's do another exploration right now. Let's do another table. Once again, let me list all the six major religions on the left hand side of this table; on the right hand side, now I want to have a few things, love, peace, worship, gratitude, happiness, selflessness, silence, divinity, nature, beauty, consciousness. I can go on. Now, I want you to match the following. All of you have to list everything that is on the right hand side with every religion, which means when we go beyond symbols of religion, in the heart of religion, religion is nothing but noble qualities. In every religion and every founder of religion and every scripture is only expecting each one of you to live by noble qualities. I give you a color; you can associate to a religion. I call myself a lover; to which religion will you associate me to? I give you a terminology; you can associate it to a religion. I tell you peace; to which religion will you associate to? So at the core of religion, living religion in our day-to-day life, integrating the power of spirituality into materialistic life, is nothing more than you being a beautiful human being. In essence, spirituality is not about how good the bottle looks from outside. In essence, spirituality is about keeping the bottle clean from inside. In essence, spirituality is not how I look; it is about who I am. To the extent you become selfless, to the extent you are blissful, to the extent you are grateful, to the extent you are devoted, to the extent you are anchored on faith, to the extent you love the world, to that extent, irrespective of labels, you are actually living by all the religions in the world, and that is true spirituality. The proof of your spiritual evolution is in the manifestation of peace. Only to the extent you're peaceful, you can experience silence, and only to the experience of silence, only to the extent you can experience the depth of silence, the doors of divinity open for you. I need divine manifestation in my life. I need silence. I need silence. I need peace. I need to experience peace in life. I need to be beautiful from within. In this entire journey that we are going to go through in Quest to lead you to a deep connection with Thee, the focus is going to be how to make you experience the depth of peace. In the midst of this ever-changing life, in the midst of all these choices, all these decisions that you'll have to make, in the midst of all these uncertainties that you experience in life, how do you still get to experience the depth of peace? And thereby, you make yourself ready to experience silence, and thereby enable this divine manifestation to manifest through you, is going to be the focus of this entire journey. So till we dive deeper into the subject, I want you to be absolutely self aware that you are enabling the most beautiful of all human qualities, whether they find a mention in the scripture or not, the most beautiful of all human qualities, as simple as, gratitude, love, bliss, manifesting, in all the choices and the decisions that you make, in all the ways you respond to the world, a touch of selflessness, where I'm able to put the other ahead of myself. In whatever I do, I'm able to put the other ahead of myself. And you are actually not putting the other; in fact, a master was asked once, "What is the best way to relate to the other?" And the master replied, "By simply recognizing there is no other." Will I say my left hand; isn't it a natural extension of me? Will I say my right hand; is it not a natural extension of me? That part of the world I come from we bring these two hands together whenever we meet a fellow human being to symbolize, irrespective of all the differences that exist between you and me, I in spirit and you in spirit are one and the same. And I bow down to that spiritual oneness between you and me, essentially saying, the more and more I'm able to see this world as a natural extension of me, there is no more this concept of other. So even when I do good to the world, I'm actually doing it to my own natural extension. Even when I love the world, I'm only loving my natural extension. Even when I attempt to be selfless by putting the other ahead of me, I'm actually serving myself in my own ways. So ensure that all your best qualities find expression in the way you live your life, and live till we meet again reminding yourself, the goal of every goal is peace. If I can find peace, I'll find silence. If I find silence, I will allow the divine manifestation to manifest through me. I ended every session till now by telling you, loving you so much. For a change I feel like ending, peacefully yours. Thank you.

====================

LESSON 18: Develop Emotional Maturity
--------------------
<v ->"Peacefully yours,"</v> I said and I ended. I assume you're also beginning to experience the magic of peace by putting the highest qualities into practice. I believe you're also experiencing peace by recognizing the power and the magic of living your life, experiencing that spiritual oneness. Right now, wherever you are, there may be lights on, maybe a fan or an air conditioning on. Right now through technology you're experiencing me. Different equipments, but all of them powered by the same electricity. The same power, the same energy, the same electricity, by expressing itself through different equipment, through the bulb, it's lighting the room, through the air conditioner or the heater, depending on the time of the year that you are experiencing Mahatria. And this technology that is being enabled, different manifestation, but the energy is the same. One spirit, one Thee, enlivening all of us as different manifestation, is the recognition of that spiritual oneness. I in spirit and you in spirit are one and the same. In spite of all the other differences between us by age, by gender, by religious identity, by nationality, by your mother tongue. In spite of all the differences, the same source of life is teaching through me right now. And the same source of life is seeking through you right now. And the more and more I recognize this, that sense of responsibility I feel towards everything that has life, that sense of responsibility that I feel towards my fellow human beings, comes naturally to you. Since we set the goal of every goal is peace, and peace will lead to silence, and silence will lead to divine manifestation, let's take the first step in this direction. Emotional maturity. We already discussed, when we discussed about relationships, how emotions play such a big role in human life. What is emotional maturity? Everything will come under these three things: A, C, R, Accept, Change, Remove. Let's only stay with acceptance. All your negative emotions, whatever name it is called, whatever form it is, all your negative emotions is due to non-acceptance, and all your positive emotions, by whatever label it is called, is due to acceptance. Let me elaborate a little; something is happening or somebody is doing something not the way you want, and you're not able to accept it. It becomes anger. Something is happening or somebody is doing something not the way you want, and you are able to accept it. It becomes tolerance. So something plus non-acceptance is the negative emotion of anger. Something plus acceptance is the positive emotion of tolerance. Just to ensure I deepen this clarity, a negative emotion is called a negative emotion because it disturbs your peace. A positive emotion is called a positive emotion because it preserves your peace. That that takes you away from peace is also taking you away from divinity. Hence it's called a negative emotion. That which preserves your peace is keeping you in touch with divinity. And hence it's called a positive emotion. I'm about to face uncertainty, and I'm not able to accept that I'm facing uncertainty. It causes fear in me. I'm facing uncertainty, and I'm accepting it. I'm welcoming it; it's called adventure. Something plus non-acceptance is the negative emotion of fear. Something plus acceptance is the positive emotion of adventure. Somebody has something in life, or somebody is able to produce some result in life, and I'm not able to accept it. It becomes jealousy. Somebody has something in life, or somebody is able to produce some result in life, and I'm ready to accept it; it becomes inspiration. I get inspired that somebody is able to do it; one day I will also be able to do it. So again, something plus non-acceptance is the negative emotion of jealousy. Something plus acceptance is the positive emotion of inspiration. Mentally present, physically absent. I'm not able to accept it. I say, "I'm missing you." Mentally present, physically absent. I accept it. I say, "I was thinking of you." Both the experiences the same. Non-acceptance makes me say, "I'm missing you." And acceptance makes me say, "I was thinking of you." I can go on listing as many negative and counter-positive emotions, but everything comes under the simple equation. I'm facing something in life which right now I don't know how I'm going to resolve it. I'm not able to accept it; I call it a problem. I'm facing something in life, and right now, I don't know how to resolve it but I'm able to accept it because I grow by solving problems. So, I'm able to accept it; then I don't call it a problem. I call it a situation, I call it a challenge. I call it an opportunity. So whether I see something as a problem or as a challenge, something as a problem or as an opportunity, does not depend on itself. It depends on my non-acceptance sees that as a deprivation. My acceptance sees that as an opportunity. My non-acceptance sees that as a problem. My acceptance sees this as a challenge. So, I'm bringing mathematics, basic mathematics and equations, to emotions. Something plus non-acceptance is equal to negative emotion. Something plus acceptance is equal to positive emotion. And here is the big step of transformation and emotional maturity. Next time you're going through any negative emotion, and you know it's a negative emotion because it disturbs your peace, instead of asking what is disturbing me or who is disturbing me, I want you to ask this emotionally mature question to yourself: what am I not accepting that is disturbing me? Who am I not accepting that is disturbing me? Understand the difference: by saying something is disturbing me or someone is disturbing me, I'm blaming something outside of me. One of the earliest lessons that we learn, no blaming is allowed. Instead of saying something is disturbing me or someone is disturbing me, because I understand the emotional equation of life is something plus non-acceptance, something plus my non-acceptance is creating negative emotion in me. So I no more ask this question, what is disturbing me or who is disturbing me? Having resolved that I'll take complete responsibility for my life, having resolved I will take the U-turns, I ask myself this question, what am I not accepting, who am I not accepting, that is disturbing me? Turn that non-acceptance into acceptance. You come to the second part of the equation. Something plus acceptance is equal to positive emotion. A positive emotion is a positive emotion because it preserves my peace. The moment I turn non-acceptance into acceptance, I turn a negative emotion into a positive emotion. I preserve my peace. So the first step to emotional maturity is accept the unchangeable. What is unchangeable here? Something is unchangeable. Second step: change the changeable. What is here that can be changed? My non-acceptance can be changed into acceptance; that is in my control. By accepting something, someone, which is unchangeable. The world is not in my control. And by changing what I can change, I will change myself, or I will change my approach towards the world, which is in my control. I display emotional maturity in dealing with the day-to-day situations of life. Accept the unchangeable; change the changeable. Of course there are situations in life where you are not able to accept but neither you're able to empower a change. There are such situations in life where life throws you in a state of helplessness. Like if I still want oranges and I'm stuck under a mango tree, and no matter how much I try, I'm not able to accept or change myself to only expect mangoes from a mango tree. What do I do in a situation like that, Mahatria? I will remove myself from the unacceptable. I might have to happily get away and go and search of oranges from an orange tree. I might have to let go of this job or I might have to do a geographical relocation or I might have to drop a relationship in life or I might have to change the direction of my career progress. But there are times in life, there's no point in going on banging your head against a wall and bleeding; maybe I have to go in the other direction. Come let's go the other way and find the door somewhere else through which I can exit. There are moments in life, I need to remove myself from the unacceptable. Emotional maturity simply means experience by experience, experience by experience, you deepen this awareness and lift yourself to that level of consciousness where you spontaneously find yourself in the right gate. The unchangeable is accepted, the changeable is changed, and you remove yourself from the unacceptable. So whenever you reach that stage in life, a day from now, a week from now, a month from now, a year from now, and somewhere, a decade from now. Whenever you reach that stage in life and only this much; there is no fourth gate in life. Everything that you face in life is within these three gates. Accept the unchangeable; change the changeable; remove myself from the unacceptable. And the day you reach this stage where you spontaneously find your yourself in the right gate, you can pat yourself; for you have gifted yourself that emotional maturity by which you can face all the vicissitudes of life, all the uncertainties of life, with your peace absolutely intact. No matter how turbulent the cyclone may be, the epicenter of the cyclone is untouched and undisturbed. By gifting yourself this emotional maturity of accepting the unchangeable and thereby neutralizing all the negative emotions in your life. By changing the changeable and thereby taking control over life. And by removing yourself from the unacceptable; no more feeling victimized by life. You literally become the epicenter of your own life. No matter how turbulent the life around us, you become a witness, as the epicenter, where you are able to watch everything that is happening around you, but nothing, no one, anymore have the power to disturb your peace. And that is true elevated consciousness. That is when you can say, that is when you can proclaim, I've integrated spirituality into my day-to-day materialistic life. I live my life no more for peace. I live my life out of peace which means in every moment, you are enabling divine manifestation to manifest through that peaceful you. I'm ready to tell you, peacefully yours. Whenever you are ready to tell the world, peacefully yours, come and share it with the rest of us in the Tribe. Peacefully yours. I love you so much and also wishing you most and more of every form of abundance. Thank you.

LESSON 19: Gratitude Is the Mother of All Virtues
--------------------
<v ->Gratitude is the mother of all virtues.</v> A word that is heard all the time; a word that is spoken all the time. By decision, I am not using the word thank you because thank you has become a mere etiquette. Thank you has become a mere dance of the tongue. Even when we don't feel it, we say thank you. By decision, I'm using the word gratitude because gratitude is a feeling; it's not what you say, it's what you feel. Gratitude is the mother of all virtues. If anybody ever comes and asks me, "Mahatria, if I have to practice every quality that is prescribed in any of the scripture, from any of the religions, how would I do that?" And without batting my eyelid I will tell them, "Let your heart keep beating in gratitude. And this one quality of gratitude will automatically bring all other virtues. In fact, every virtue is delivered from the womb of gratitude." A mother and a child went to a bakery, and it was the anniversary of that bakery that day. So the shopkeeper told the child, "We are in celebratory mood. So my son, you take as much chocolates as you want with both your hands," and opened up a basket full of toffees. The boy said, "No, I don't need it." There was inexplicable pride in the eyes of the mother. The shopkeeper repeated, "It's okay; mama will not say anything; with both your hands, take as much toffees as you want." And the boy still refused. Then the shopkeeper, on his own, took up a brown envelope, filled as much toffees as he could, and handed it over, and the boy happily received it. The moment they came out of the shop, the mother looked in the eye of the son and said, "How proud I was when you refused to take anything that was given to you free. Then why did you accept it when he gave it to you?" And the little boy with radiance in his eyes, looked at his mom and he said, "Ma, even before entering the shop I had decided, if he asked me to take chocolates with my own hands, I will say no because with these little hands, only little will come. When he gives with his big hands, that is when I will receive it in abundance, so I was waiting for him to give, and when he gave I happily received it." And it's not a story; it's the reality of each of our lives. Much more than this little head of ours could ask God, give me this and give me that, including this very life as a human being, including this very life as this unique you, has all been bestowed upon you by that infinite intelligence. The truth is, at every challenge in my life, I can cry out, "Why me God, why me God, for all my challenges?" Or I can count my blessings, and go down in gratitude and ask, "Why me God, why me God for all my blessings?" The rest of our life will not be enough, as simple as this day in your life. Lot of people who went to sleep last night; not all of them woke up to another day. The very fact that there has been another sunrise in your life, and this moment is a reality in your life, and life is continuing to flow through you, it's divine benevolence in your life. You don't have to be an enlightened soul or a Buddha to live your life with eternal gratitude. We just need to become aware how much is going right for us in life and cherish it. There's always a portion of life that is not right. And for everyone it is, for you it is, for me it is, for everyone it is. Life is never going to be perfect; life is not meant to be perfect. The focus is not about what part of life is not okay; the focus is about celebrating with gratitude how much of your life is actually going right. There was a master and a disciple who had gone deep into the jungle to stay away from the noises of the city to practice their various spiritual disciplines. After about six months of living in quite challenging conditions, here they were coming back to their village, and from a distance the disciple could see more than half the roof of the hut where they were about to stay were blown in the winds in the six months time. So he knew it's going to be very cold inside because the wind is going to enter. He was in a state of complaining mind saying, "There seems to be no spiritual justice. What is the point in all the spiritual practices that we did for over six months? We returned back to the village, and we cannot even feel the cozy comfort of our own hut." And as he was complaining, right next to him he saw the master was expressing his gratitude in prayerfulness, saying that, "Lord, your ways are your ways, my Lord; thank you so much. For six months, we were in open air. You didn't want us to be in a closed environment and feel claustrophobic. So you already kept half the roof open for us so that there'll be natural flow of breeze. Lord, your ways are your ways, my Lord. Ever grateful to you." In fact, the disciple was not only upset half the roof was gone, he was even upset with the master because he was expressing gratitude for something that does not look perfect and right. But anyhow, they went inside the hut. They were tired enough, ready to sleep. The clouds did build, it turned into a downpour, and it was pouring so much that it made no sense inside the hut because the rain was still falling inside. Angrily, the disciple went outside, and he was standing there steaming in anger. And as he was standing there in anger, right next to him he saw, with hands raised in prayer, the master was dancing in the rain saying, "Lord, your ways are your ways, my Lord; thank you so much for this celestial shower, feeling so cleansed and so fresh. Lord, your ways are your ways, my Lord; I'm ever grateful to you." Looking at the bliss with which the master was dancing, the disciple could not take it. He looked into the eye of the master and he said, "Master there's a limit for everything, and this is the limit; everything is going wrong. And you're going on saying, 'Ever grateful; ever grateful.' What is there for you to say, 'Lord, your ways are your ways?' Because Lord does not seem to be merciful towards us." The master stopped the dance, looked in the direction of the disciple, and the master said, "Your attitude to complain about everything in life is not giving you peace; you're eternally disturbed. My attitude of always being grateful for everything in life is giving me so much peace, and I'm always feeling all the right emotions." And then the master said, "The proof of right living is in the peace it manifests. The true proof of spiritual evolution is in the manifestation of peace. If you're truly spiritually growing, and if you're living your life right, then the way you live your life should give you peace, but it's only giving you disturbance." And then the master added, "A complaining mind is never peaceful, and a grateful heart is always peaceful." Saying so, the master gently raised his hands again in prayer, began his graceful dance. And the master said, "Lord, your ways are your ways, my Lord; by giving me such a disciple, you help me to understand you even better; ever grateful to you, my Lord, Lord, you ways are your ways." And the master kept dancing. The words of the master kept lingering in the mind of the disciple. A complaining mind is never peaceful, and a grateful heart is always peaceful. The disciple understood what the master was saying. Not as graceful as the master, but the disciple also raised his hands and awkwardly started dancing saying, "Lord, your ways are your ways, my Lord; by giving me such a master, you help me to understand you and life much better; ever grateful to you my Lord." Even if you don't remember anything, life the Infinitheism way, even if you have not caught anything from all the teachings of Mahatria, anchor your life on these two sentences: a complaining mind is never peaceful, and a grateful heart is always peaceful. Gratitude is the mother of all virtues. Do you know, gratitude and disturbance cannot co-exist? Complaining and disturbance can co-exist; gratitude and disturbance cannot co-exist. In any given instant, if you ever catch yourself disturbed, either practice emotional maturity of acceptance and you drop the disturbance, or any moment you see yourself disturbed, in that very instant ask yourself this question, what can I be grateful for right now? Whom can I be grateful for right now? The moment you find something you can be grateful for or someone you can be grateful for, in that very instant, disturbance will leave you. Like how life and death cannot co-exist. Light and darkness cannot co-exist. Ego and love cannot co-exist. Gratitude and disturbance cannot co-exist. So in any given instant in life, either you are disturbed or you're grateful. So from now onwards, let's put it this way, any moment in your life, if you feel disturbed, see this as a notification from life, telling you it's time for gratitude. In your smartphones, you get notification from all social media; like that, disturbance is a notification from life saying that, stop complaining and start practicing gratitude. The next instant you become self-aware of any form of disturbance, in that very instant intercept with this question, right now, what can I be grateful for? Right now whom can I be grateful for? And with gratitude, you'll remove disturbances from your life. No more, "Why me God; why me God?" for all your troubles. Only "Why me God; why me God?" for all your blessings. No more a complaining mind; only a grateful heart. May I request you to just close your eyes for a short prayer; let me express on your behalf. Whoever, whatever that God is, or even if you are an atheist, to whatever that force of nature is. Thank you, thank you so much for gifting me this beautiful life. Thank you so much for gifting me this moment of gratitude. Thank you so much for all the choices that you had, you chose to create me as a human being. Ever grateful that of all the choices that you had, even as a human being, you chose to create me as me and not as anyone else. Thank you for all the turning points in my life. Thank you for this transformation in my life. Thank you for all the breakthroughs in my life. Thank you for all the beautiful people in my life. And my Lord, thank you for loving me so much. Sometimes I wonder, what have I done to deserve so much love from you? Thank you my Lord for loving me so much. And let me also tell you my Lord, I too love you so much. Like the master, I feel like ending my prayer by saying, Lord, your ways are your ways, ever grateful. Even when I face challenges in my life, I will face them with gratitude, for I recognize challenges are nothing but your way of chiseling me to an elevated state of consciousness. Challenges are nothing but your way of making me even more aware of what I'm capable of. With this mature understanding that I'm never given an experience that is not needed for my evolution, I've lived my life with my heartbeat being gratitude. With every breath of mine to my last breath, I shall only whisper, Lord, you ways are your ways, my Lord; ever grateful to you. It's easy to be grateful to the creator. It's beautiful to express your gratitude to the creation. Can you, before experiencing the next session, express gratitude to at least five different people for the role that they have played in your life? Whether you'll do it through email or text, or call, or in person, but I want you to express to at least five different people, distant, close proximity, wherever they are, at whatever stage in your life they've played a significant role, express gratitude to at least five different people for the role they have played, for whoever you are and wherever you are right now in life, and then come back to experience the next session. And I want to take this opportunity to express my gratitude for allowing me to play my part in this journey of your transformation. Gratefully yours, lovingly yours, peacefully yours; thank you.

====================

LESSON 19: Meditation - The gratitude prayer

- May I request you to just close your eyes for a short prayer. Let me express on your behalf whoever, whatever that God is, or even if you're an a thias, to whatever that force of nature is. Thank you. Thank you so much for gifting me this beautiful life. Thank you so much for gifting me this moment of gratitude. Thank you so much for all the choices that you had. You chose to create me as a human being. Ever grateful that of all the choices that you had, even as a human being, you chose to create me as me and not as anyone else. Thank you for all the turning points in my life. Thank you for this transformation in my life. Thank you for all the breakthroughs in my life. Thank you for all the beautiful people in my life and my Lord. Thank you for loving me so much. Sometimes I wonder what have I done to deserve so much love from you? Thank you, my Lord, for loving me so much and let me also tell you, my Lord, I too love you so much like the master. I feel like ending my prayer by saying, Lord, you always, are you always ever grateful? Even when I face challenges in my life, I will face them with gratitude. For I recognize challenges are nothing but your way of chiseling me to an elevated state of consciousness. Challenges are nothing but your way of making me even more aware of what I'm capable of. With this matured, understanding that I'm never given an experience that is not needed for my evolution. I've lived my life with my heartbeat. Being gratitude with every breath of mind to my last breath, I shall only whisper Lord your always or your always my Lord. Ever grateful to you?

LESSON 20: The Crescendo of Intelligence Is Faith
--------------------
<v ->If the essence of everything that is there</v> in every religion, if the essence of everything that is there in every scripture, has to be brought into one word, and that word will be faith. In fact, Infinitheism itself is at the heart of it, is all about faith. Theism means a world of faith. Infinitheism is faith in an infinite by whatever name you call it, irrespective of whatever name you call it. Labels vary, proper nouns vary, the symbols vary, but at the heart of everything is faith. Faith in your potential, faith in your future, faith in that eternal force, that's brought you into existence because of which you exist and faith that carries you through this journey of life. And yet, there's always this question, if there is a force above us, on which I need to have faith, then what is the role of human intelligence? If there is something else beyond me that navigates my life, then what is my role in it? Then why should I develop competence? Why should I build my skills, capabilities; why knowledge? Why I need maturity? I'll simply pray and say, let the force above carry me through in life. What is the role of intelligence in faith? And this is where... there is a science to it. A very, very deep science to it. This is where the beautiful design of life comes into the forefront. Life is designed by choices and consequences. We keep executing choices. Here, I have chosen to express the wisdom of Infinitheism through this Quest. You've executed a choice to aspire for breakthroughs by experiencing these sessions in Quest. These are choices that we have executed. Whether you've chosen to remain single or you're in a relationship, whether you went through the university or dropped out from that, the geography that you were born into and the geography where you are living, in what line you have chosen your professional growth. To have a child, not to have a child. Everything is a choice, and we keep executing choices. And for each of our choices, there are consequences. And the design of life is this. While you have a control over the choices, you can only have a preference about the consequences. You have no control over the consequences of life. As simple as executing a choice to drink a cup of coffee. It might be gratifying, it can cause acidity, it might make me study better, maybe it'll not enable me to sleep further. A simple choice of sipping a coffee. There are multiple consequences which I have no control over. I go out and start a new business. I might flourish, I might struggle, I might fail. I come all dressed up multi-layered, and it might turn out to be warm. I can come dressed casual; midday it can turn cold. I can choose my approach towards the world, but I have no control over how the world will respond to me. So in every aspect of life, I can give you a plethora of examples. We have a control over choice, but we have no control over the consequences. In fact, to bring back the emotional maturity of accepting the unchangeable and changing the changeable here, no matter what the consequence is, I cannot do anything about it. I will accept whatever be the consequence. And what is in my control is executing the next choice; change the changeable. I'll go on and execute the next choice. Choice, consequence; counter choice; consequence, counter choice; consequence, counter choice. And that is the cycle of life. Now, here comes spirituality. This is science. Here comes spirituality: to recognize I need my intelligence to execute my choices. And to recognize that is the limits of my intelligence. With all my intelligence, I can be the world's most renowned scientist. I can hold the most powerful position in political office in the world. I can be an enlightened spiritual master. No matter what, no matter who I am, the limits of my intelligence is I've executed a choice. And now I cannot do anything about it. Irrespective of my preference of the consequence, I have to await so the prayer goes, Thy will be done. I have executed a choice; what consequence I receive, Thy will be done. I have executed a choice, what consequence I receive, Inshallah. That is God willing. In the Vedic tradition they use the phrase Prasada Buddhi. Prasada means gift of God. Buddhi means I have developed this intelligence, that I can use my intelligence to execute choices. But the consequence, I'll accept it as a gift from God, whatever that consequence is. So what is faith? Faith is the surrender. That you know what is right for me, my Lord, than I know it myself. The truth of life is choices are born out of your intelligence. Your finite intelligence and consequences are given to you by "that" infinite intelligence. Using my finite intelligence to execute choices and to surrender that same intelligence in faith to that infinite intelligence; Thy will be done, Inshallah, Prasada Buddhi. Whatever is the consequence that I get, favorable or unfavorable, expected or unexpected, maybe I'm surprised by it, but I'm shocked by it sometimes. I'll gracefully accept the consequences that is given to me, knowing very well You know better what is right for me than I know it myself. A mother is denying a food that the child is asking. In the immaturity of the child, the child feels the mother is so cruel. But in the love of the mother, the mother knows the child is having some acidity issue, some digestive issue, and it's better for you to refrain from this food. In the innocence of a child, the child wants to run across the road. The father is holding the hand tight and not letting go of the child. In the immaturity of the child, the child feels that my father is restraining me, but in the infinite love the father knows this is not the time to cross the road; it's not safe to cross the road and holding you and enabling you to cross the road safe. Similarly, sometimes in our limited understanding of life, we feel we are being denied or certain things are delayed or deferred when we want it in life. But in the infinite love, the Creator has towards you, the creation, sometimes it's better to delay, defer it, or sometimes even it is better to deny it to you because this is not good for you. Sometimes there are take diversion boards in life because continuing to go in the same direction, you might meet with an accident. The road ahead is not right for you, so there are take diversions. Just to tell you that take this alternative path that will lead you to reach where you ought to reach in life. Faith is recognizing there are no ends in life, only bends in life. Faith is in recognizing sometime God upsets my plans because he wants to execute His plans for me. Faith is not judging God by judging the consequences that are given to me in life. Faith is the graceful gratitude, acceptance of consequences in life and picking up my intelligence again to execute the next counter choices in life. So if you can commit yourself to the cycle of life, I will use my finite intelligence to execute my choices, and I will surrender the same intelligence and absolute faith to the consequences I receive in life. Even if I'm not able to comprehend it right now, I will still accept it. Somebody had to be thrown out from a train for him to discover a Mahatma Gandhi within him. Somebody had to be imprisoned for 27 years for him to discover a Nelson Mandela within him. Somebody had to be thrown into an environment of poverty for her to discover a Mother Teresa within her. Born and growing in the palace, somebody had to be exposed to the suffering of the world for him to discover a Gautama Buddha within him. In faith, even wrong is right, even bad turns into good, and that's the power of faith. Faith delivers miracles in your life. And the more and more I realize this, I will realize faith is not the opposite of intelligence. Faith is the crescendo of intelligence. You need a level of intelligence, like Albert Einstein so beautifully put when he said, there are only two ways to live your life. Either nothing is a miracle, everything has a design, or to see everything as a miracle. And once you recognize the depth of this entire thing, you'll realize the crescendo of human intelligence is to be able to live your life anchored on faith. So use your intelligence to execute your choices. Surrender that intelligence in faith to whatever be the consequences that are delivered to you, knowing very well on the long run, this is right for me, and that is why I've been given this experience. Pick up your intelligence again, and execute the next counter choice. Choice with intelligence, gracefully receiving the consequence with faith. Again, executing the next counter choice with intelligence. And if you can commit yourself to the cycle of life, then you will no more be reading or hearing about elevated consciousness. You will actually be living your life out of elevated consciousness. I have no alternative, but to conclude faithfully yours, gratefully yours, lovingly yours, peacefully yours. Thank you.

====================

LESSON 21: Divinity in Everything
--------------------
<v ->Till now we have been discussing</v> about what you need to do. We are going to focus the next few interactions between us on not necessarily what you need to do, but what you need to understand. Comprehension of life, comprehension of the science of spirituality. Or I'll put it this way. We need to know the truth. Whenever human intelligence directed itself towards a new field of endeavor, it gave birth to a field of science. When man wanted to study what constitutes the ocean, oceanology was born. When man wanted to study the formation of the celestial objects, astronomy was born. When man wanted to study the construction of this material earth, geology was born. Like that every time when human intelligence directed itself towards any field of endeavor, a new field of science was born. And all these fields of sciences are called as objective science. Objective science means man is the subject, and all these are objects of his observation. And through his observation, through his research, through inventions and discoveries, all these sciences have evolved, so they are called objective science. Man is the subject that's studying all these objects. So every time human intelligence was directed towards a new field of endeavor, it gave birth to a new field of science. Similarly, when human intelligence was directed towards studying the subject which is himself, herself, a subject of science was born. And that subject of science is called spirituality. Don't, because of its esoteric nature, because it is abstract, because it's study of the self, because it's study of the formless, we somehow do not accept spirituality as science. So every time we use the word science, we feel spirituality does not belong to science, but spirituality in its true nature is the study of the self, the science of the self. We will not dive completely deep into that subject, but to that extent that it has application value in our life so that we are able to integrate spirituality into this materialistic living, just to create a deeper understanding of God, not by just the form and the name that we know, but to have a scientific understanding of this phenomenon called God, let's dwell a little deeper in these sessions. And the depth of this understanding will not only integrate spirituality into your day-to-day living. It will also deepen this peace and prepare you for silence and in turn enable the divine manifestation to happen in your day-to-day experiences. Everything in life is governed by cause and effect. Science is nothing but studying the relationship between cause and effect. So the spiritual masters, in studying the self, dare to ask this question. If everything in life is governed by cause and effect, are there laws that govern cause and effect itself? And they had three revelations which they call as the three laws of cause and effect. Appears to be a science class, but trust me, this is as good as a class on life as any of the earlier sessions have been. The three laws of cause and effect are... First I will state them and then elaborate them with examples. The first, if there is an effect, there must be a cause. Two, effect is nothing but cause itself in a different form, in a different manifestation. Three, if I remove the cause from the effect, nothing remains. Let's study it with some examples. The first law of cause and effect, if there is an effect, there must be a cause. I see mud pots, the effect; then somewhere there must be mud. Only from that mud these mud pots could have come. If there is an effect there must be a cause. I'm experiencing the warmth of the sun, the effect; then there must be the sun somewhere. I'm seeing jewelry in front of me, gold jewelry in front of me, and if there is a gold necklace or a gold ring, there must be gold somewhere. If there is an effect, there must be a cause. Two, effect is nothing but cause itself in a different form, in a different manifestation. Aren't the mud pots mud itself in a different form? Isn't the gold necklace gold itself in a different form? Aren't the sun rays nothing but the sun in a different manifestation? Effect is nothing but cause itself in a different form, in a different manifestation. Three, if I remove the cause from the effect, nothing remains. If I take the mud out from the mud pot, there is no more mud pot. If I take the sun from the sun rays, there are no more sun rays. If I remove the gold from the gold necklace, there is no more gold necklace. If I remove the cause from the effect, nothing remains. The three laws of cause and effect. If there is an effect, there must be a cause. Effect is nothing but cause itself in a different form, in a different manifestation. If I remove the cause from the effect, nothing remains. Now let's apply this to the macro called life. The first law of cause and effect, if there is an effect, there must be a cause. Everywhere around me I see creation; then there must be a creator. I may not know who the creator is, I may not know what the creator is, but there is no effect without a cause. So there cannot be creation without the creator. In fact, there was one of those who was doing his research, his doctorate, and he was traveling in a train in the United States. Right in front of him he saw a senior professor from the same university, and the senior professor was reading the scripture. This scientist who was doing his research doctorate, aspiring scientist, told that senior professor, "For all the accolades that you have, for all that I have heard about you, I cannot believe that you are still reading scripture. You should be reading scientific journals." The professor gently smiled and said, "I think train is not the right place for us to have this conversation. Why don't you come and see me in the house? And we will have this conversation there." And the professor gently closed the scripture, put it back into his laptop bag. On the appointed day, at the appointed time, the aspiring doctorate reached the house of the professor, rang the doorbell. And as the professor opened the door, right there in that living room there was this immaculate mechanical model of solar system. And this aspiring doctorate was stunned by seeing the engineering excellence that has gone into creating this mechanical model of solar system. He told the professor, "This is stunning. I haven't seen anything like this. Who made this?" And with a sheepish smile the professor said, "Nobody made it. In fact, last night it was not there. I went to sleep; when I came back in the morning it has come. It just came by itself." Helplessly smiling at what he didn't know was humor or not, and after the smile he said, "Seriously, Professor, who made this?" And the professor replied, "Seriously, I won't joke with you. It wasn't there last night. I just came in the morning, and somehow on its own accord it has come into existence." Unable to bear any further, the aspiring doctorate told the professor, "Sir, between you and me, we know that this is not possible. Just like that it couldn't have come. Somebody should have created this." The professor asked, "If you guys believe this entire existence nobody created it, it came by itself with one bang, can't a mechanical model of solar system also come by itself?" The aspiring doctorate said, "I catch the point, sir. If there is a creation, there must be a creator." The first law of cause and effect. If there is an effect, there must be a cause. If there are mud pots, there must be mud. If there is gold necklace, there must be gold. If there are sun rays, there must be sun. If there is creation, then there must be a creator. Second law of cause and effect. Effect is nothing but cause itself in a different form, in a different manifestation. So who is this creator? Where is this creator? Isn't the mud present in every mud pot? Isn't the gold present in every jewelry? Isn't the sun, in essence, present in every ray of the sun rays? Then the creator is embedded in every creation. Why? Effect is nothing but the cause itself in a different form, in a different manifestation. In a modern day parlance, the electricity will say I am the one who is expressing through every equipment that you are using. And spiritually, that's what the creator would say. I am the one who is manifesting in every creation. Of course, if I remove the cause from the effect, nothing remains. I remove gold from the gold necklace, mud from the mud pot; nothing remains. The creator disconnects with the creation. Ash unto ash and dust unto dust. Nothing of us will remain. We will just become recyclable, just recyclable material. That's it. Why is this understanding important right now? To experience divinity in everything. There is no point in isolating. After saying everything came from God, then in everything, there is God. Earlier I said, the proof of true spiritual evolution is in the manifestation of peace. Here I add one more. The proof of true spiritual evolution is to outgrow all forms of discrimination. If the mud is there in every mud pot, in all shapes and sizes and all colors, then how can we glorify one more pot and feel less about anything else? Because the mud is present in everything. There is an expression in the culture I come from. God is nearer than the nearest. As long as you search for God outside of you, you never find, but as long as you are ready to experience divinity with you, within you, it's nearer than the nearest. And just to drive that point, what do I mean by nearer than the nearest; how far is the gold from the gold necklace? Hm? How far is the mud from the mud pot? Hm? How far is electricity from any of the electrical appliance that is working right now? Hm? Then how far can the creator be from the creation when the creation is functioning nearer than the nearest? So, kindergarten level of being religious is to be able to find God only in a few isolated places of worship. True spiritual evolution will be to experience divinity in everything, to see divinity in everyone. If you cannot see God in the dimple of a child, if you cannot see God in the wrinkle of an old lady, if you cannot experience God in rain and heat, if you cannot experience God in men and women, if you cannot experience God in the creation around you, if you cannot feel the divinity within you, then maybe you can go down at the altar of every symbol, but you still don't get to experience divinity in anything. By understanding effect is nothing but cause itself in a different form, in a different manifestation, you begin to experience divinity in everyone and in everything. Again, forget the terminology; forget the jargon. But in the world I come from, we use two phrases. Soundarya Lahari, meaning, wherever you see beauty, there is God. And the other phrase we use is Ananda Lahari. Wherever you perceive happiness, there is God. So as long as you can find that celebration within you, and as long as you can celebrate everything around you, you are experiencing divinity in everything. As long as you make yourself beautiful from within, the bottle is clean from within. And as long as you can perceive beauty in everything, from a dry leaf to a tree that has lived hundreds of years, from a pebble that remains a pebble to a seed from which a forest would sprout, beyond the color of skin, beyond gender, beyond social status, beyond nationality, beyond geography, recognizing that all the mud pots have come from the same mud, all the gold ornaments have come from the same gold, every streak of sun rays is coming from the same sun. All the creation has descended from the same creator. Religion says, see all in that one God. Spirituality says, see that one God in all. Living your life experiencing divinity in everything is true spiritual evolution. I truly wish you live your life perceiving Soundarya Lahari, beauty in everything, Ananda Lahari, happiness in everything, divinity in everything, a life transcendental of all discrimination, a life of eternal peace. And that will be truly living your life, allowing the divinity within you to manifest through you in your day-to-day experiences. If I ever get to see you in person, unhesitantly, I will look into your eyes and tell you I can perceive divinity in you. I love you so much. With that reverence that there is a spiritual connection between you and me, for I in spirit and you in spirit are one and the same, I conclude this session by saying, whether you recognize it or not, there is a spiritual connection between you and me, spiritually yours. Thank you.

====================

LESSON 22: The Truth
--------------------
<v ->If the fundamental truth that we need to understand is</v> effect is nothing but cause itself in a different form, a different manifestation, hence the creator dwells in all the creation. True spirituality is to experience that one Thee in all the manifestation of life. The second basic truth I need to understand for my spiritual ascendance is to recognize that God cannot be a person, can only be a presence. Don't get me wrong. I'm not in any way telling you that the God in form, the God in name, that you worship is not right; it is. But I need to just recognize by saluting the flag, I'm actually saluting the nation represented by the flag. The flag is symbolic. By carrying my daughter who has gone to study in a university, her picture as my screen saver, I need to recognize that the picture of my daughter which is a screen saver in my phone is a symbolic representation of my daughter who's studying in the university. By hanging on the wall the citation, the certificate that I've received for my college education, I have to recognize the certificate is not the education; the certificate is symbolic of the education that I received when I was there in the university. Similarly, in my entire life I only related to a world of form. I just don't know how to relate to a formless abstract. Like how I will use a logo as a symbol of a brand, a flag as a symbol of a country, I use God, in name and form, as a symbolic representation of that infinite presence. The symbol is as powerful as what it represents; doing anything to the flag which is unconstitutional will be considered a crime. It's only a piece of cloth, but because it's seen as a symbol of the nation, there are constitutional expectations on how I deal with a flag. The symbol is as powerful as what it represents. I would not any allow anybody to mishandle the citation that I have because symbolically it represents the education that I have received. Similarly, I hold a lot of respect and reverence to the symbolization of that infinite presence to whatever God in name and form may be. But I have to recognize it is only a symbolic representation. If there are million churches in the world, there are million forms of Jesus Christ, and all this is only symbolic. The Son in form on earth is a symbolic representation of the Father in heaven that's formless. Millions of places of worship and millions of idols to be worshipped, and they're all just a symbolic representation of that eternity that I wish to connect to. Why this is important is, goals are a direction to potential. I have the potential, I don't know what to do with my potential. In order to manifest that potential I need a direction, and goals act as a direction to my potential. Relationships are a direction to my love. There's so much of love within me and I need to express, I don't know how to express it. So I choose relationships as a direction to the expression of my love. If goals are a direction to my potential, if relationships are a direction to my love, God is a direction to my faith. Why this understanding, why this truth have to be understood is important. That on which you have faith is your God. You're not just talking about the confinement that has been given by the six boxes called religion. That on which you have faith is your God. Her God is different, your God is different, my God is different, somebody's God is different, but that on which you have faith is your God. The second one is even more important than the first one: your God is only as powerful as your faith is. His God is powerful because his faith is powerful; her God is weak because her faith is weak. "If you have as much faith as a mustard seed and you tell a mountain to go away, it'll go away," he proclaimed from the mountain top. The focus here is not about on what you have faith, but the focus here is that you have faith and your faith is absolute. So we are all all the time discussing about whether my God is powerful or your God is powerful. All the religious wars in the world have been fought on this thing, whose God is powerful? Not realizing, matters not; whose God is powerful does not matter. In fact, two of you can be worshiping the same God. For him and her Krishna can be God, but if her Krishna, her faith in her Krishna is complete, and your faith in your Krishna is not complete, her Krishna is powerful, and your Krishna is not. He says he has faith in Lord Mahavira; she says she has faith in Lord Mahavira. Her faith is absolute, his is not; then her Mahavira is powerful; yours is not. Your God is only as powerful as your faith is. Why? Because the power of your God is derived from the power of your faith. The fallacy is this, we always believe God makes faith work; on the contrary, it's faith that always made God work. The extent to which your faith is absolute, to that extent, you let that infinite force to manifest in your life and fill your life with miraculous possibilities. For the fishermen, his God is the ocean; for a farmer, his God is the agricultural fields; for a Sherpa from Nepal, the mountains are their God. Everything works; nothing works; for it does not depend on everything; it depends on your faith in it to put the whole thing, to stack the whole thing in a sequence. God is not a person, but God is a presence symbolized by a form. The Son of God is a symbol of the Father in heaven. Every incarnation, or the word that we use, every avtar is nothing but a representation of the cosmic consciousness. All-powerful, omnipresent, omnipotent, omniscient, and it can only be a presence because form is confined by time and space. This is science; this is physics: a form is confined by time and space. If anything can be eternal, if anything can be everywhere, it has to be formless. The bulb is a form, the fan is a form, air conditioner is a form, laptop is a form, quantifiable, confined by time and space. Electricity is formless. The nose that breathes is a form, oxygen is formless; planet earth is a form, gravity is formless. The God by name and form that I worship is confined by space. The eternal has to be a presence, a formless presence. That is why divinity in everything. And doesn't matter what that name is, what that form is, it works to the extent your faith is total, so recognize, that on which you have faith is your God. Your God is only as powerful as your faith is. If you have to make your God powerful, you have to make your faith powerful. Why? The power of your God is derived from the power of your faith. It's not your God that makes your faith work, it's your faith that makes your God work. If your faith is absolute, your God is all-powerful. Only to the extent you love me, you can understand my love for you. Similarly, only to the extent your faith in your God is complete, to that extent, your God can fill those divine manifestations in your life. So linking it back to the earlier session, no matter what the consequences of life is, to whatever is that symbol towards which you direct your faith, ensure your faith is absolute. And the more and more you strengthen your faith the greater and greater will be the manifestation of that all-encompassing force, expressing itself through you as miraculous possibilities in your life. That is why in Infinitheism we say that formless energy plus your competent effort plus your faith in that miraculous energy is a phenomenal combination. That energy is already there, the formless presence. Your intelligent, competent effort, remember? One of the earlier sessions, Consistent, Directed, Self-motivated, Intelligent Effort, but is this too enough? No, we will have to get that infinite energy to pour itself through all your endeavors. How do you do that? By ensuring your faith in that formless presence is absolute. Whatever may be the symbol that you choose, the name and form you choose, but ensure your faith is absolute. And that is how you get to the proportion your faith is total, to that proportion that energy pours itself through all your materialistic endeavors. Not only ensuring their spiritual integration into your materialistic life, but also prepare yourself for a life of series of miracles which manifest to the extent your faith is complete. I know you'll smile, but I'm left with no other alternative but to tell you, spiritually yours, faithfully yours, gratefully yours, lovingly yours, peacefully, Mahatria. I'm yours. Thank you.

====================

LESSON 23: Infiniprayer
--------------------
<v ->I want to truly thank you for traveling along with me,</v> along with us, in this journey. I want to express my appreciation, gratitude, for you being such a devoted seeker. Not only putting into practice whatever you've been learning from these sessions, but also coming forward and sharing your stories of transformation and inspiring everybody else in this journey. We're just peaking towards the climax of Me, We, Thee. I always told people journey is life, not destination, but journey is life. The way to the picnic should be as enjoyable as the picnic itself. If you don't celebrate the process... because for four years I train and I win the Olympics, those moments of glory is only till the national anthem is played. And after that, I step down from the winning podium, and once again, the defending champion, I'll have to go back to training. So, if you do not enjoy the process, then the results will only be punctuated happiness in your life. So the way to the picnic has to be as enjoyable as the picnic itself. Celebration of process is celebration of life. Results are just a measure of process excellence. Similarly, journey is life, and what an incredible journey it has been between you and I. And we're just peaking towards the climax of this entire journey. I've always wondered how come there is this "Happy Birthday" song which is so universal, independent of religion, independent of theist or atheist, independent of whether they believe in God or don't believe in God, independent of nationality, geography. Everybody sings "Happy Birthday." It's a universal song. So there was this dream in Infinitheism that we need to also have a universal prayer where irrespective of your religion, irrespective of your spiritual rootedness, irrespective of who or what your faith is, in expressing this prayer, every citizen in the world should feel it is to his God, her God, that they are actually praying. First just listen to what we call as Infiniprayer. Prayer to the infinite is Infiniprayer. Just listen to it once, and then let me explain all the 11 lines that are there in the prayer. ♪ Feeling Thy presence ♪ ♪ Feeling Thy grace ♪ ♪ Feeling Thy radiance ♪ ♪ You are my source of faith and strength ♪ ♪ You are my path and destination ♪ ♪ And I'm always connected to You ♪ ♪ Nothing of me and everything of You ♪ ♪ Lead me higher ♪ ♪ Lead me deeper ♪ ♪ Lead me beyond ♪ ♪ Lead me to You ♪ <v ->Connect to me again.</v> And in case your eyes are closed, please open your eyes. Feeling Thy presence. Feeling. God is not an aspect or science to be understood. It's a connection to be felt. You feel one with in all the prayers of all the spiritually world souls. It's not an intellectual rational, analytical understanding. It's a feeling; you open you your heart to this connection. Feeling Thy, whatever that God is, whoever that God is, Thy represents that feeling Thy presence, because if it's a person, it'll only be confined by time and space. If it's a person, either when the person leaves or you leave, there's disconnection there. If something has to be eternal with you, always with you, it can only be a presence. By saying feeling Thy presence, you're saying, "My Lord, you're with me, within me, all the time." It's like a mud pot saying, "I feel the presence of the mud with me, within me." It's like a gold necklace saying, "I can feel the gold with me, within me." It is here you, the creation saying, "I can feel the creator with me, within me." Feeling Thy presence. Feeling Thy grace. There is a hand above us all the time. Faith is recognizing either that force is walking with you or there are times that force is actually carrying you through. The next breath in our life cannot happen without that grace. This thumb of mind shall not move without that grace. That every moment that is unfolding in my life, my Lord, it is by Thy grace. In fact, there is a saying in the culture I come from that even to experience Thy grace, I need Thy grace. Only by Thy grace I can even connect to you, my Lord. Feeling Thy grace. Feeling Thy radiance. What is radiance? The light that dispels darkness. Oh my Lord, there was I born naked, excreting and urinating in the same place where I was lying down. Even to nurse myself from my own mother's bosom, I needed help. Experience by experience, experience by experience, you have brought me to the stage where I am in life. How through all these experiences of life, you've dispelled the darkness of my ignorance, my immaturity, and brought me to this level of mature understanding with which I'm living my life. Feeling Thy presence. Feeling Thy grace. Feeling Thy radiance. You are my source of faith and strength. You are my source. I'm only a resource. I'm just a manifestation of you. You are my source of faith and strength. The strength with which I live my life I derive from my faith, and my faith is you, my Lord. You are my source of faith and strength. You are my path and destination. I don't know from where we created this concept that you see God towards the end of your life. Infinitheism disagrees with that in the fundamental paradigm. It seems a man was going through the experiences of his life one experience at a time; everything was just flashing back in his mind, and he saw a startling experience. Whenever he went through good times, he saw there were two sets of footprints, but whenever he went through difficult times, he saw there was only one set of footprints. He screamed, "This is not fair, my Lord. Every time I've gone through beautiful times in my life, happy times in my life, good times in my life, I can see you are walking along with me; I see two sets of footprints. But whenever I've gone through enduring times, whenever I have faced ordeals in life, during all my challenging phases of life, I see only one set of footprints. Why did you forsake me, my Lord? Why did you let me walk alone during those times?" The man immediately felt a reverberation, and a voice from beyond echoed, "You're right. Every time when you went through good times in life, I walked along with you. That's why you see two sets of footprints. Every time you went through the most challenging phases of your life, I somehow felt you'll not be able to bear with it. So I carried you in my arms, and I kept walking. The only set of footprints you see is mine, my child, for you were in my arms." Faith is recognizing that force either walks with me or carries me through. You are my path and destination. You are with me in every step I take in life. And it is towards You, all the time wanting to feel closer and closer to divinity is how I'm living my life. Feeling Thy presence. Feeling Thy grace. Feeling Thy radiance. You are my source of faith and strength. You are my path and destination. And I am always connected to you. You cannot be a part-time devotee of a full-time God. You can't be a Sunday-morning Christian, a Friday-afternoon Muslim, a Thursday Jane, or a Tuesday Hindu. You cannot be. There is an old saying, "Where is God?" And the reply is, "Where is He not?" The new paradigm for you has to be, if anybody ever ask you, "When are you connected to God?" And you should be able to ask in return, "When am I not?" I live my life out of faith, so in every moment I'm connected to the divine presence. And I'm always connected to you. Nothing of me and everything of you. If the next breath cannot happen without Thy grace, if this thumb of mine shall not move without Thy grace, if everything is Thy will be done, I'm only an instrument of a higher force. In fact, all of us are nothing but an instrument of a higher force. You want your life to become music? Simply make yourself an instrument of a higher force. Nothing of me and everything of you does not mean I'm nothing without you. That'll be a negative assertion. I can be everything with you. So, the first seven lines of Infiniprayer is nothing but me expressing. I'm not asking anything. I'm just expressing my feeling towards my faith: Feeling Thy presence. Feeling Thy grace. Feeling Thy radiance. You are my source of faith and strength. You are my path and destination. And I'm always connected to you. Nothing of me and everything of you. Only now we're going to ask, not this, not that, not this toy, not give me this. You're going to ask for four things which are holistic in nature. First, Lead me higher. Lead me higher in maturity, my Lord. Let me... whatever time that is left in my life, let me live my life from the highest maturity that is possible. Elevate me to the highest level of consciousness from where I can live my life. Lead me higher. Lead me deeper. Lead me to the deepest level of self-awareness with which I can live my life. Let me not be a stranger unto myself. Lead me deeper in my self-awareness; lead me deeper in my spiritual alignment. Rooted in my spiritual alignment, let me live my life. Lead me beyond. Lead me beyond my own limitations. Lead me beyond all my own confines. Let nothing of me become a confinement, a limitation, to the possibilities that can manifest in my life. Lead me higher. Lead me deeper. Lead me beyond. And my Lord, Lead me to you. No matter how much the child enjoys playing with the toys, nothing can take the place of a mother for the child. Similarly, no matter how much I revel in your kingdom, I'm not going to be satisfied just with the kingdom of God. I need you; I need God in my life. Lead me to you. Can I request all of you to please close your eyes? Whatever will suggest prayerfulness for you, whatever body language makes you feel prayerful, in that reverential state of prayerfulness, connect to your God. Whoever, whatever your God is, connect to your God. And I'm going to play the Infiniprayer thrice. Staying connected in this prayerfulness to your God, please sing along. As your expression of prayer to your Lord, go with the Infiniprayer. Here it is. ♪ Feeling Thy presence ♪ ♪ Feeling Thy grace ♪ ♪ Feeling Thy radiance ♪ ♪ You are my source of faith and strength ♪ ♪ You are my path and destination ♪ ♪ And I'm always connected to You ♪ ♪ Nothing of me and everything of You ♪ ♪ Lead me higher ♪ ♪ Lead me deeper ♪ ♪ Lead me beyond ♪ ♪ Lead me to You ♪ <v Mahatria>Don't hold back.</v> There is nothing to resist. I'm not converting you to something else. I'm converting you into a more devoted devotee to your own God. The expression of prayer is new. Your faith in your Lord isn't. So please connect to your God; connect to your faith. And in this absolute prayerfulness, sing along the Infiniprayer as you experience it; go. ♪ Feeling Thy presence ♪ ♪ Feeling Thy grace ♪ ♪ Feeling Thy radiance ♪ ♪ You are my source of faith and strength ♪ ♪ You are my path and destination ♪ ♪ And I'm always connected to You ♪ ♪ Nothing of me and everything of You ♪ ♪ Lead me higher ♪ ♪ Lead me deeper ♪ ♪ Lead me beyond ♪ ♪ Lead me to You ♪ <v Mahatria>One last time, Just dissolve in your surrender,</v> in your faith to your Lord, and just one more time, let's feel that engulfing peace in the state of prayerfulness. Let's sing the Infiniprayer just one more time. Start. ♪ Feeling Thy presence ♪ ♪ Feeling Thy grace ♪ ♪ Feeling Thy radiance ♪ ♪ You are my source of faith and strength ♪ ♪ You are my path and destination ♪ ♪ And I'm always connected to You ♪ ♪ Nothing of me and everything of You ♪ ♪ Lead me higher ♪ ♪ Lead me deeper ♪ ♪ Lead me beyond ♪ ♪ Lead me to You ♪ <v ->Only if you feel like getting back into action,</v> immediately get back into action. If you feel like remaining in the state, simply be in the state. Just pause the Quest session, and experience this engulfing peace for some more time, and come out only when you feel like coming out. You plus your faith is such a miraculous combination. May this journey lead you higher, deeper, and beyond. Thank you.

====================

LESSON 23: Meditation - Infiniprayer

- Feeling thy presence, feeling thy grace, feeling thy radiance. You are my source of faith and strength. You are my path and destination, and I'm always connected to you. Nothing of me and everything of you. Leave me higher, leave me deeper, leave me beyond, leave me to you.

====================

LESSON 24: Command the Universe From the Seat of Silence
--------------------
<v ->I know we come from a world of doing.</v> I know we come from a world where we believe in the dynamism of life, but I want you to visualize two different scenarios: a turbulent Pacific Ocean, and into the turbulent Pacific Ocean, even if I take right now whatever is the world's tallest building, say Burj Khalifa from Dubai, and I hurl it into a turbulent Pacific Ocean, you won't even notice a difference. Scenario one. Scenario two: there is an absolute still water lake, and in that absolute still water lake, a small speck of dust floating in the wind just comes and lands on that still water. It'll start creating ripples which will encompass the entire lake. Similarly, in that chaotic mind, in that noise within, with which we live our life, we don't get to connect to the existential energy. We don't get to listen to the whispers of existence. By quietening, and don't get me wrong, when I say quietening, the mind is designed to wander. The body is designed to be localized; the mind is designed to wander. In fact, all the discoveries and inventions, all the technological breakthroughs, all the advancement of science that we have, have all happened because the mind wanders. In fact because your mind wanders only, you even came to me, otherwise you wouldn't have come to me. The mind is searching everywhere for questions, for answers to the questions, questioning the answers, upgrading desires, creating new aspirations, projecting new possibilities into the future. And all this is the manifestation of a wandering mind. And yet, if there is any way by which I can quieten this mind, the preparation for that was to live your life with peace. The reason we have gone through all these sessions is let the mind wander, but peacefully, not in a state of agitation. And if all that that I have applied and lived by, it brings me to a stage where I'm able to go through my day-to-day life with my peace intact. Which means for the first time, we are not looking at how I can train a wild elephant; you cannot train a wild elephant. You have to first tame the wild elephant; only then you can train. Peace is nothing but my mind wanders when it has to wander, but I am able to quieten the mind. A state of no mental agitation is peace. And now that that mind is quietened, let me see if I can also experience a state of non-doing. I don't want to use the complicated words like meditation, transcendence; all seem too esoteric. All I'm asking of you is for a few minutes every day, and you define the few minutes, if for a start, that's one minute, it's one minute. If it's three minutes, it's three minutes. If it's 11 minutes, it's 11 minutes, and I don't ask more than that from you. Peacefully, just quieten yourself, make yourself like a still water lake, where everything that comes from you can create ripples in this existential consciousness. It's almost like a reverse delegation where from that state of non-doing, from that experience of that silence, anything that you release into existence, it's a reverse delegation. You're asking the entire force of existence to work for you. You're asking the entire force of existence to make things happen for you. You don't have to be a biblical scholar, for one sentence in the Bible is enough, and He says, "Be still and know I am your God." Essentially saying the extent to which you can still your mind, in the midst of all the activities of life. Prophet prescribed to you to pray five times a day, and still your mind. In the middle of a battlefield, where billions of soldiers were ready to fight the war, through the epic of Mahabharata, we realize Lord Krishna was ready to give a discourse on the importance of silence to the seeker, Arjuna. That's the power of internal stillness. In fact, from the culture I come from there is a saying, from the seat of silence, your mere wish is a command to the universe. So which means we can purify ourself, cleanse ourselves, reach that level of internal peace, and thereby enable silence. That a mere wish from you, there is a reverse delegation, where you are asking all the forces of existence to work together, to make it happen in your life. Buddha did not even think a place of worship is required, for he believed that if you can embrace silence, and wherever you embrace silence, you can experience God. So there is a saying, where he sat became a temple. Essentially saying, wherever you can sit and experience silence, that is your place of worship. In fact, in the Hindu system, they say, no matter what rituals you practice when you go to a place of worship, at the end of it all for a few minutes, just stay in non-doing to absorb those vibrations. May the power of your doing be derived from the power of non-doing. On personal authenticity I'm saying this to you, if today I'm able to draw millions of people from over 135 countries to seek and grow in this journey through the wisdom of Infinitheism, by the teachings of Mahatria, all that that I've drawn into my life, I've drawn into my life because of this one discipline: sitting in a state of non-doing for a few minutes every day. Health, wealth, love, bliss peace, every form of abundance. As one of the richest person in the world, for all the amazing human beings, the sort of CEOs, the sort of leaders, the sort of opinion makers in the society, all of them who have gravitated towards me, and all this has happened, through this one discipline. If I ask you to do a lot of things, and you have hesitation, I can understand. All I'm saying for a few minutes a day, don't do anything; simply in a corner, withdraw yourself into a state of non-doing. Sing the Infiniprayer. Connect to your faith. Feel that peace within. And just stay in that state of non-doing for a few minutes. At the first thought you get, again, one minute later, at the first sensual stimuli you have a few minutes later, get back to life; it's okay. Initially, it'll only be fleeting moments, but progressively, you'll train your entire system to elongate this. And I'm not, on any given day, asking for more than 11 minutes of non-doing from you. Friend, I'll put it this way, whenever you are experiencing the session, just for the next 21 days, religiously, with no absenteeism, sit in non-doing for whatever few minutes you can sit, and you come and tell us in the Tribe later, what are the manifestations that you have experienced? What a powerful prophecy it is from the seat of silence. Your mere wish becomes a command to this universe. Then I think you have to give it a chance. Initially, it'll start as an experiment, but eventually it'll become an experience. And let's start now; not later, let's start now. I'm not going to conclude it, I'll conclude now, and then you practice it. And whenever you feel like opening your eyes and getting back into life, get back into life. Starting today, may the power of all you are doing be derived from the power of non-doing. All your disappointments in life is because you no more have an appointment with God. And there is no better way to connect to your supreme creator than through silence. It's been a fascinating, incredible journey with you. And it'll only be befitting, before we go to the finale of celebrating this journey into Infinitheism, to offer ourselves in the silence, in the stillness, in this non-doing, in this spiritual connection. So I'm signing off from this session by telling you it's been a fascinating journey with you, and I'll meet you in the finale. Paradoxical, it may sound, I'm awakening you to life by telling you very, very gently, please close your eyes, sing the Infiniprayer, connect to your faith, experience that state of non-doing. And whenever you feel like coming out, please come out and take life head on. Declare to the world, hey world, as an Infinitheist, in this path of Infinitheism, I am coming. Introvert yourself and slip into non-doing.

====================

LESSON 25: Life the Infinitheism Way
--------------------
<v ->Life is a series of new beginnings.</v> In life, every finishing line is the new starting line. I don't believe there is anything called the ended life. There is only new beginnings in life. In fact, in spiritual sense, every end is nothing but a new beginning. Every finishing line is the new starting line. Life is a series of new beginnings. So I don't want to see this as the final session. I don't want to see this as the climax. I don't want to see this as the finale. Yes, in terms of your interaction with me and my interaction with you, in a world where everything is time-bound, here we are in the final session. But I think in more than one way, I will be there in your body language, I will be there in your head noise, I will be whispering to you all the time, I will continue to be a form of presence with you. And that way life is a series of new beginnings. There is the saying, which they attribute to Buddha and say, experience everything in life as if it's the first time. I want to edit this "as if" because in your current maturity, whatever experience you go through, it is the first time. In this state of heightened awareness, in the state where we have comprehended the various laws of life and the need to align ourselves to these laws of life, in the state of new branch of consciousness from which you look at life, or simply put, the everyday word that we use, all this together is called maturity. And in this level of maturity, your life begins just now. So there's no question of, live your life "as if" it's the first time. In our current maturity, everything is the first time. I've been entering you right now for over three weeks, almost four weeks, little by little, little by little. Like we have discussed, it's not that we are seeking new horizons, but we are seeing our existing horizons with new spectacles. It's not life has changed. You have changed. The perspective with which you see life has changed. The spectacles through which you see life has changed. This is the new version you. And this beautiful you now have developed this fragrance about you. That no matter what you do, life seems beautiful. No matter what you do, there seems to be a sense of celebration to life. No matter what you do, there is this new spectacles to Life the Infinitheism Way. Life is so beautiful, isn't it? Life is actually on top of the world, isn't it? Life is a celebration, isn't it? Celebration is life, isn't it? Life is a game, isn't it? Who said any game is easy? I would never be naive enough to tell you life is easy. Life isn't. It's enthralling. It's thrilling. It's entertaining. And most importantly, experience by experience, it's introducing you to a new version of yourself. Life is like a mirror, reflecting you to yourself. When you play a sport, you sweat it out; you endure it. But in spite of all the demands, you cherish it. You celebrate it because you are passionate about the sport. Same is the case with life. Life has its uncertainties. It has its challenges. But you're so passionate about living, it's for this reason a human being is always seen as an evolving consciousness. Even if a breath is left, one breath is left in life, there is still a possibility for me to evolve to a higher state of consciousness. To live is to evolve. To live is to grow. To live is to change. To live is to transform. To live is to become, and live is to keep arriving in life. And here we are, supposedly the finale of this Quest, but truly, just the beginning of a new life. At this level of maturity, your future begins now. Now the big question is how do I sustain this transformation? How do I ensure that this is not just a hype? A hype that I felt during this entire Quest, during this entire journey with Mahatria, that I just felt a high. You know, when people get intoxicated with different forms of alcohol, they feel a high for a few hours. And then when the effect of the chemical subsidizes, they come back to the normalcy of who they were. How do I ensure this entire journey is not just another high? It's just not another intoxication where I feel a temporary high? And as days rolls by, I go back to my old habitual ways. Why at all change, if I'm going to go back to square one? So the most important thing in life is not change, but to sustain change long enough till it becomes transformation. Change is temporary. Transformation is permanent. And there is science to transformation. There is a point at which quantitative change becomes qualitative change. And at that point, change becomes transformation. Transcends the old formation into a new formation. I repeat. There is a point at which quantitative change becomes qualitative change. And at that point, change becomes transformation. It transcends the old formation into a new one. 90 degrees centigrade, it's still boiling water. 99.9 degrees centigrade, it's still boiling water. 100 degrees centigrade, water becomes steam. There is a point at which quantitative change creates qualitative change. Now it has become transformation. It has transcended from a liquid form into a gas form. It has become a steam. Same as the case with us. Change sustained long enough will become transformation. You'll transcend from the old formation to a new formation. So to ensure that this entire journey is not a temporary high but a permanent transformation, I'm going to ask you to do two disciplines. One, I want you to begin your every day. That's all. A one minute prescription for the morning and a few minute prescription for the night. How do you begin the day, and how do you end the day? Only that much. Religiously. I want you to begin your every day by getting your first thought, first emotion, and first action somewhere aligned to what you have learned in this entire journey. The first thought. Recall any teaching, any insight, any story, anything that you felt was a very powerful reference that came from the voice of Mahatria. Or in this entire journey you went through, a very insightful experience or a feedback that you received from the world that kept lingering in you mentally. The first alignment, first thought. Emotionally. Either depth of love or depth of happiness or depth of gratitude or faith or the sort of enthusiasm and intensity you felt; what's your first emotion? And what's your first action? Could be the language of love. Extend a hug. Could be an expression of gratitude to your Lord, to the Creator, to faith. Could be a simple dance as a celebration towards life. Maybe just expressing your love for yourself and giving yourself a kiss. Whatever it is, let the day begin by you getting your first thought, first emotion, and first action right. And end of every day, you're going to introspect. Introspection simply mean questioning yourself. You will not go to sleep without answering this question. "Where did I improve today?" I'm not even bothered about the answer. You might find answers some of the days; you may not get an answer some of the days. Maybe you'd have improved; you may not recall. Maybe you've not improved. Maybe there are 10 areas where you see a new version of yourself, not just one. But everyday before going to sleep, I want you to challenge yourself with this question. "Where did I improve today?" We're only focusing on positive reinforcement. Deep, positive emotions. So I'm not bothered about where did you falter today? What did go wrong today? What was negative of... Those you're not focusing on. You're only focusing on one thing. Where did I improve today? And with that introspection, and trust me, just by getting your morning right with the first thought, first action, first emotion right and getting your end of the day by answering this question, by deepening this awareness, you are just looking into your own day and asking yourself this question, where did I improve today? And these two things will anchor you to this Quest and to these learnings that you have gone through. Maybe come back and experience this. Maybe go and read the stories of your fellow Tribe. Maybe come and inspire us by sharing your story with the Tribe, but find a way to stay in touch. A disciple would ask Buddha, on the last day he was embodied, everything seems easy when I'm with you in this journey. How do we sustain this transformation beyond your time? And in the native language Buddha spoke. Buddha would say, Buddham Charanam Gacchami. Dhammam Charanam Gacchami. Sangam Charanam Gacchami. Essentially saying, stay in touch with the teacher, stay in touch with the teachings, and stay in touch with like-minded people. The only way to sustain transformation is stay in touch with the source that created the transformation in you. So once in a week, come back and re-experience these sessions. Find a way to stay in touch with Mahatria. If I'd had to say, your Mahatria. By now, I should have become your Mahatria. Buddham Charanam Gacchami: Stay in touch with the teacher. Dhammam Charanam Gacchami: Stay in touch with the teachings. Even if you cannot stay in touch with the teacher all the time, at least stay in touch with the teachings all the time. And the easiest way to implement that is create a spreadsheet, decide these are 11 aspects that I have learned which I am going to practice on a consistent basis till it becomes my transformation. There is a point at which quantitative change becomes qualitative change. And at that point, change becomes transformation. Every day, either ask this question, "Where did I improve today?" or take an attendance. Did I live by all these 11 things that I set for myself? It's like self-evaluation through self-awareness. This is just your own self-evaluation chart. You don't have to share it with anybody, but do a private evaluation of yourself, and every day see, did I live by all these 11 qualities that I wanted to live by? Or did I practice these 11 things that I have demanded from myself? Create your own spreadsheet and take attendance on a daily basis. Ah, missed it. Practiced it. P and M or Present and Absent, just take an add. And you are just helping yourself to ensure you sustain this change into transformation. This is your way of staying in touch with the teachings. Sangam Charanam Gacchami: Stay in touch with like-minded people. Surround yourself with growth-oriented people. Surround yourself with people that you look up to. Always remember this in life. If you want to develop your ego, surround yourself with people who look up to you. If you want to develop yourself, surround yourself with people you look up to. If I have to give you an example: if you just want to feel like winning, play the game with people who are not as good as you. If you want to improve yourself in the game, then play the game with people who are better than you. Surround yourself with people who are better than you; surround yourself with people you can look up to. Sangam Charanam Gacchami. And if you can ensure Buddham, Dhammam, Sangam Charanam Gacchami if you can ensure you are in touch with the teacher, the teachings, and like-minded people, you'll sustain this change long enough and ensure this becomes your transformation. You'll transcend into a new formation. You will reset yourself into a new branch of consciousness. This will become the new you. You can proclaim to the world, "Hey world, this is the new me." And from here onwards, all these will not be mere teachings, Life the Infinitheism Way. They will become the very fragrance of your personality. And this world needs a lot more of us. Lot more of us. We can turn this world into a paradise, so much so that people do not have to die to go to heaven. When they're still alive, they're able to experience heaven on earth, and this planet will become heaven on earth. If there is so many more of us where all the teachings in Me, We, and Thee, are no more concepts, but they become the very fragrance of your personality. Carry this spiritual, psychological fragrance in you, and let the world simply sense that wherever you are, the aura seems to be very, very different because you happen to be there. It's my secret desire that one day in this very planet, I have to physically bump into you, and you will share your story of transformation with me. Till then, I shall wait. I love you so much. Life has just begun for you in this new state of consciousness. Hey world, we are coming. An Infinitheist is coming. Thank you.
