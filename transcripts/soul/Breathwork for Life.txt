Preparation 1: Welcome to Breathwork for Life
--------------------
<v ->Hi, my name's Niraj Naik, and I'm the founder</v> of the world's fastest growing breathwork, wellness, and meditation movement and community, called SOMA Breath. So welcome to this amazing journey where you're going to learn how to live longer and happier with more peace of mind. You see, the breath is really like a pharmacy of different techniques, and it can help you live longer, but it can also give you peace of mind and states of absolute divine inner bliss. But if you're going to live longer, don't you want to have a life filled also with peak experiences where they're just unforgettable memories? Well, that's the power of the breath too, because just with simple breathing techniques, you can reach a peak human experience, an ecstatic state. And this ecstatic state is a state where you can truly transform. But perhaps you've been to a breathwork class in the past and gone away feeling traumatized because there was just a symphony of screaming and orgasms going on, and maybe you're a little bit nervous about breathwork. Well, I've actually solved that problem for you. We're giving you the same peak experience that I have shared in many classes around the world now, where people come up to me at the end of it going, "Oh my God, what the fuck just happened? You just transformed my life." But I'm giving it to you in a safe way. Instead of throwing you in the deep end without a safety net, at the end of this Quest, you're going to experience our most powerful breath technique, the one that totally changes lives. And my goal for this Quest is for you to wake up every single morning going, "Oh my God, I love my life." In fact, I made a song called "I Love my Life." It became the anthem at Mindvalley events, and you can see music is a really big passion of mine. But it was when I discovered that you can combine breath and rhythmic music together to make an even more powerful experience, that led me to develop this SOMA Breath School and our techniques. So this Quest is powered by this special brainwave music technology which is going to make this entire experience much more fun, much more enjoyable, where you're actually going to get hooked on these techniques. You're going to be actually looking forward to doing these practices instead of going, "Oh, do I have to do it?" You're going to actually have enthusiasm for doing this Quest every single day. What makes SOMA Breath different is that we actually use rhythmic music. That is where the breath is timed to the rhythm of the beat. And when you breathe in beats or breathe in a rhythm with the music, magic happens, because rhythmic music and breath combined have the power to create this state called Heart Coherence. This has been studied by many scientists around the world, and just through simple, rhythmic breathing every single day we can bring back harmony and balance to the inner world. And when you have more harmony and balance on the inner world, you actually have a better relationship with the outer world. And that way, you can actually become like a magnet. In fact, you could say SOMA stands for "the science of magnetic attraction," 'cause when you bring in that inner harmony, you actually become like a magnetic personality. There's even a famous Chinese philosopher called Lao Tzu who once said, "The perfect human breathes "as though they're not breathing at all." So what does that actually mean? See, we've been conditioned by society to breathe heavy and deep and get lots of oxygen. In fact, deep, heavy breathing gets less oxygen to ourselves, not more, and mouth breathing is the worst of all. Did you know that, once, they used to use the term "mouthbreather" as an insult to tell people that they're stupid because they haven't learned how to breathe through their nose yet. And it was also a sign of somebody who's just stupid and dumb. The reason why is if you breathe through your mouth like this... or... all day long, you're actually shutting off the blood supply to the brain. But when you switch to nasal breathing, smooth, rhythmic breathing, we actually get a flood of oxygen going to where it really needs to go. And you're going to learn the science of the breath in an easy, simple way and a fun way with an experience of powerful techniques that's going to turn your breath, your default state, into Lao Tzu. And what we want to create is more high and happy people in this world, 'cause high and happy people are fun to be around with; they do cool stuff, and they actually make this world a higher, happier, better place for all. But when you're miserable, unhappy, angry, and sad, we're not at our best, and people don't want to be around you. I want you to become a magnetic personality all the time as your default state. What does an ancient psychedelic and breathwork have to do with solving some of the world's biggest problems? You see, the number one killer in the world today is heart disease, and now depression is set to be the new pandemic. And the root cause of all this is stress. And when we get chronically stressed, we actually make bad decisions. We make poor lifestyle choices, and we get addicted to stuff, right? See, back many thousands of years ago, there was a time, the Golden Age on our planet, where the ancient gods, the Rishis, were addicted to a substance called SOMA. That's right. But we don't know quite what that SOMA was, but it gave them immortality. It made them have no sickness and disease. It made people have a deeper connection to themselves and the divine. However, when the SOMA starts to run out, they all freak out because they're so hooked on this stuff. So they had to find a way to create it from within, and that became the origins of things like tantric yoga, meditation, and even breathwork. So when you learn how to cultivate the SOMA within, you actually can make bliss on command, and your desire for stuff falls away. You see, the world has become corrupted by overconsumption. The environment's become polluted as a result of people just needing to buy more and more stuff to be happy. But just imagine if you could, just with a simple breathing technique, turn on bliss on command, feel content, feel in balance, and not need to be dependent on so many things to make you happy. That's what this Quest is going to achieve for you. So there's many different breathwork styles out there, and it can get confusing; which is the right one for you? But breathwork usually has been preached as a one-size-fits-all, a panacea for all things. But if you look at the different breathwork styles, they usually revolve around one technique, and one technique can never be a panacea for all. And SOMA Breath takes the wisdom of Pranayama, which is really like a library, a pharmacy, of breathing techniques which are customized to you and to your needs. And there's not just one technique. There's a whole pharmacy of different techniques for different uses, which you're going to absolutely love because if you want to solve any kind of minor ailments you might have, such as a blocked nose or a headache or body pain, you can do so just with breathing techniques. Or if you want to go into peak states, you can do so with a breathing technique without needing any external stuff. And your safety is my main priority, so we're not going to throw you in the deep end without a safety net. In fact, you're going to have scientifically validated, effective techniques that has the wisdom of the past combined with the modern science and my special proprietary music technology that makes this entire process more fun and enjoyable. So on this 14-lesson Quest, in Part 1, you're going to learn how to correct your breathing so it's more efficient and helps you live longer and healthier. Part 2, we're going to go into your lifestyle, but we're going to correct your lifestyle and bring it into balance and harmony with your breath. In Part 3, you're going to learn how to cultivate the SOMA within. And all of this is going to be driven by our powerful proprietary audio music technology which makes the entire process more fun and enjoyable. So this is like having your own natural, side effect free psychedelic on command. However, it's completely under your control. So you can turn on bliss whenever you wish. But the real purpose of spiritual practices is to improve your default state. This is the time when you're not doing any techniques. And at the end of this 14-lesson Quest and learning and experiencing the SOMA from within, your default state is going to become better. You're going to be at your best every single day, and you're going to feel high and happy. So first, we're going to turn you into Lao Tzu. And then, we're going to prepare you to go superdeep into a peak human experience. And all of this is going to be really fun and enjoyable with our special music technology. And then, you're going to go away going, "Oh my God, I fucking love my life." If you master your breath, you can control your state. And when you control your state, you master your life. That's right. So at the end of this 14-lessen Quest, you're going to go away with so many different benefits. There's so many to list here, like more enthusiasm for your life, more productivity, better concentration, and a deeper relationship with yourself and others around you. In fact, you can sum this all up into one statement. You are going to go away feeling higher and happier than you were before. So the best time to supercharge your health is right from the moment you wake up. In fact, most breathing exercises are best done in the morning on an empty stomach. And the great thing with this is that when you have a morning routine that's really powerful, it will actually elevate every area of your life and make your day so much more fun and productive. So what you're going to need to set aside every morning is just, to begin with, a few minutes, but we're going to be adding on during the Quest to make sure you give yourself at least 30 minutes to an hour for your perfect morning routine. And actually, one of our methods, the Breath Hold Time, is done the moment you wake up, within the first 10 minutes. So make sure you're ready with a stopwatch and prepared to be able to do this practice. So what you're going to need to make the most out of this Quest is a simple stopwatch which you can find on a smartphone. That's what I use, but optionally, you can also get a pulse oximeter. This helps measure your oxygen levels, but this isn't essential at all, but you can find a cheap one on Amazon if you wish. But really all you're going to need is a pair of lungs so you can breathe and a heartbeat to make the most out of this SOMA Breath Mindvalley Quest. I'm so excited about the transformation you're going to experience on this Quest, so let's get ready to breathe together, and I'll see you on the inside. Peace.

Part 1: Correct Your Breathing

====================

LESSON 1: Become Your Own Guru
--------------------
<v ->Hi, I'm Niraj.</v> And I'm so excited that you decided to join us for this special Quest. If you are here, it's probably because you are looking for different ways to maybe reduce stress, improve your health. Or maybe you've tried different breathwork techniques already, and you're looking to go a little bit deeper. Or perhaps you are confused because there's so many different breathwork styles out there; which is the right one, and which one should you choose? So let me tell you something. You're going to be in for an absolute ride because you are not only going to learn all about breathwork, what breathwork really means, the origins, the history, the science and the application of it, but you're also going to experience breathwork like nothing else, because I've created a modality that's become really popular around the world through SOMA Breath that is changing people's lives in just a few minutes a day. But just with one simple experience that you can do first thing in the morning, you're going to have an amazing start to your day. Here's an interesting point for you to consider. You see, how long can you go without food? Maybe a couple of months. How long can you go without water? Maybe a few weeks. But how long can you go without breathing? Just a few minutes. But why is it the one thing that we take most for granted and care about the least? You see, there's so many diet courses out there and all these exercise courses. In fact, if you just sit still, you can last a long time just not doing any exercise. But if you stop breathing just for a few minutes, it's over. So really, we should be paying more attention to our breath. And you're going to realize that just with simple breath control techniques, that's right, you're going to have the power to awaken this inner pharmacy that we have. Yeah, it's just like being your own pharmacist or actually becoming your own guru. Because when you know how to control the inner world, you can have a much better relationship with the outer world. You're going to experience the ability to reach bliss states on command, and you're going to say goodbye to sickness and disease. When was the last time you went to the pharmacy? And why did you go to the pharmacist? Perhaps you went there because you were looking to unblock your nose; you might have had a cold or flu, or maybe you have got heartburn or indigestion, and you are taking something for that. Or perhaps you simply want to go to sleep at night, and you've got a prescription for a sleeping pill. Whatever it is, and there's so many different pills out there, there's a saying that goes that there is a pill for every ill, yet there's also an ill following every pill. And that's because of side effects, adverse drug reactions. And you know, adverse drug reactions happen to be a number three leading cause of death in the world. So the less we are dependent on them, the better it's going to be for your longevity and your peace of mind. And you see, what if I told you that there are simple breathing techniques for all of these common, minor ailments, and that with simple breath control and breathing adjustments which you're going to learn in this course by doing and experiencing, you actually can prevent a lot of these diseases from occurring in the first place. And don't worry, I'm actually going to give you the support with science and the techniques that you can do and start practicing from this lesson that are going to dramatically help improve your health, your well-being and to cultivate a peace of mind. You see, in yoga, which is where breathing exercises actually originate from, pranayama which is the source of a lot of my wisdom and knowledge, the aim of yoga is to bring tranquility to mind. chiti niti veroda - bring peace and tranquility to mind. And we're going to reverse engineer what that exactly means. Because actually my goal now is to create high and happy people around the world because high and happy people like to be nice to other people, be kind to people, and see people as the same, not different and not apart. And angry, depressed, sad people with resentments and jealousy and envy, they do all the bad stuff in the world. So through breath control, actually, you're going to learn that you can actually change quickly your emotional state. If you're feeling really low mood, you can actually raise your mood and feel a lot more high and happy. And with even more deeper practices which you're going to actually experience at the end of this Quest, you can even create this mystical bliss molecule called Anandamide, or the Soma within, on command. And I'm going to explain to you the science behind this, why it works and why we can cultivate bliss literally by just learning how to breathe the right way. One thing I really like what Vishen says is about Brules, bullshit rules. And there's a really serious bullshit rule that we are being fed with breathing. And that is that we need lots of oxygen, and deep, heavy breathing is the answer to all of our problems. Well, that couldn't be more wrong. In fact, you're going to learn during this Quest that reduced breathing and learning how to breathe less is going to be the secret to your transformation. You see, the mainstream tells us crazy things like deep, heavy breathing is healthy. Completely wrong. You're going to be told that carbon dioxide is a toxic waste gas by the mainstream and that we must do whatever we can to get rid of it. Also completely wrong. You're also going to be told things like don't hold your breath. Completely wrong. You're going to learn that by holding your breath, that's how we create this awakening of the inner pharmacy and all the magic that can unfold from that. You see, with the breath, you can actually live longer. You can live longer but with peace of mind too. You can cultivate a state of inner bliss and peace on command. But you can also reverse the ageing process by taking control of the breath. And we're going to explain why that is through deep science, but in a fun and easy way so that you can really understand in simple terms why breathing is so important and why you must take control of it. You see, taking care of your health doesn't need to be expensive. This is another paradigm shift I want you to have, because we spend thousands and thousands of dollars, or pounds, or whatever currency you're in, on things like supplements and personal trainers and courses and diet changes and exercise routines and this latest biohack, and we spend all this money also when we get sick with the doctor and medical bills. And I want you to actually stop all that because when you take control of your breath, which is completely free, you can never run out of it, and it's from your own self-control, not from some guru outside of you, you are the guru, you're going to learn and experience through this Quest that actually just with breathing alone, you can create extraordinary states of health. A famous Chinese philosopher called Lao Tzu says this famous quote. "A perfect human breathes as though they don't breathe at all." That sounds a bit weird, right? Because we should be heavy, deep breathing, right? No, not at all. If you reverse engineer what Lao Tzu says, it makes a lot of sense. You're going to learn exactly by experiencing and doing why breathing less will actually make you feel a lot better, okay? And breath is the mirror of your health. Think about this. If you look at somebody who's in a bad mood, angry, frustrated, there's even a saying for it, they're huffing and puffing all day long, right? When you're huffing and puffing, you're kind of angry and stressed. You breathe faster; you hyperventilate. Over-breathing is the cause of a lot of health issues as you're going to learn. And you can look at somebody who is breathing calmly and peacefully; they hardly look like they're breathing at all. And that's the state of their mind. Breath is the remote control for your mind, body and spirit. And breath is actually a mirror of what's going on in the inner world. It's actually the state of your mind, your thoughts, how you think, and how you act. So by learning how to use this remote control and by experiencing the remote control itself, which you're going to get from this Quest, you can take control of this inner world. And by having more control of the inner world, you're going to have a better relationship with the outer world. In fact, if you're into things like manifesting, you're going to manifest on steroids. If you're into peak performance and endurance sports, you're going to have more stamina, fitness and drive. Well, perhaps you are somebody who works in a busy, busy schedule, and you are maybe an entrepreneur who's got lots of deadlines to meet, and you you don't want to get stressed, and you want to stay focused and have better concentration; then learning how to control your breath is the secret to peak performance, focus, drive, concentration and being at your best every single day. Have you ever sat in a car with somebody who's kind of an erratic driver? They stick their foot on the pedal, and they accelerate completely out control, whizzing through traffic. And you're like, "Whoa, oh my God." Well, that's what some breathwork styles can be like. And I know that 'cause I've experienced them myself. And certain courses can make you feel like you're jumping straight into the deep end with no safety support. Whereas our technique brings you into the states that you're looking for with the inner control that you are also going to receive safely, without the pain, without the fear, where you're in control, you're the guru, you take control of the driving seat. And it's like driving a car where you know exactly where you want to go, the right destination to reach, what you are looking for. Well, the SOMA actually comes from the Rigveda. There was a legend thousand and thousands years ago where ancient Rishis would consume the substance called soma that gave them immortality. It gave them everlasting bliss and a connection with the divine. It was like they had their own pharmacy on tap with the soma. However, the soma starts to run out, and all the Rishis freak out 'cause they're so addicted to this stuff that if they stop taking it, they're going to die. So they came together and discovered a way to create the soma within. This is the origins of things like tantric yoga, meditation, even Buddhism, where humans were looking at ways to cultivate profound states without being dependent on external substances. So if you're somebody who's scared of things like psychedelics, or perhaps you don't want to take loads of pills and prescriptions for stuff, well, learning how to cultivate the soma within is something that you are going to get from this Quest. And you're going to learn as well that with gradual practice, where you hold your breath for progressively longer periods of time, there's a point, around 90 seconds of holding your breath, I know that sounds a little bit scary at first, 90 seconds holding breath, well, yeah, I'm just going to tell you that at that point is when we release this magical bliss molecule from within. And when we do it in the right way, we actually can go into altered divine states of consciousness, where we have a deeper connection with ourself and the external world and the universe and all of the wisdom that it can bring. You see, there's different layers of consciousness. And through cultivating the ability to tap into the soma within and to also activate gamma brainwave frequencies, we actually can tap into this supermind, the superconsciousness of all things. That's right. And through that, you get divine downloads. You get inner guidance and deep intuition. There's many names for waking up the soma within. You may have heard of Kundalini awakening or third eye activation and Samadhi. And this is what is called an Eastern mysticism. But scientifically, what we're doing is we're creating a state of intermittent hypoxia which triggers the release of our own endogenous version of DMT. That's right. So you don't need to go out there and reach for psychedelics if you want to create your own DMT. You also don't need to go and spend years in some ashram to learn how to activate your Kundalini. Just through this Quest alone, you're going to learn a scientifically validated method that can get you there without all of the mysticism and dogma that's also fun and enjoyable to do. But to get here safely, we need to first prepare the mind and body for the massive transformations that lie ahead. And so, therefore, in this Quest, you're going to receive the right guidance that will help you get there. So first, we need to learn about Breath Hold Time. This is the very first step in this Quest. So let's talk about Breath Hold Time. What is your Breath Hold Time; what does it really mean? And how are we going to use this as a measure of your state of health? So Breath Hold Time, or BHT, actually measures through a very simple technique how well your body gets oxygen to where it really needs to go which is your organs, your muscles, your tissue cells, your brain, your heart, things that we need energy producing in for your life to exist. So by using a very simple technique of measuring your Breath Hold Time, which you do first thing in the morning, you can actually check in with the state of your health. And there's a few simple things you need to understand when it comes to your Breath Hold Time, and that is the length of time that you can hold your breath after exhalation determines the state of your health. So average Breath Hold Time is between 20 and 40 seconds. And don't be surprised if right now, when you check in with your Breath Hold Time, your Breath Hold Time is only around 20 to 30 seconds. That's kind of average, but it can be very quickly improved. And when you quickly improve your Breath Hold Time using the techniques in this Quest, you'll feel remarkable benefits to your health and your well-being, even your mood and your ability to concentrate. So our aim is for you to get into superhealthy Breath Hold Time. I don't want you to be average; I want you to be extraordinary. So here, we're going to be getting you to 40 seconds and above, okay? When you have a 40-second Breath Hold Time, you're at very good health. And at that 60-second Breath Hold Time and beyond, you'll just be living in a state of perpetual bliss. That's what we're going to get you to. And going beyond this Quest, if you carry on the techniques that I teach you, I promise you, in a few months or even less, you'll be operating in that 60-second Breath Hold Time. Now, some people, when they go to the gym, they measure how strong they are by the amount of weights they can lift. Well, your breath hold time is actually like a gauge which you can check in with every day to measure how well you're doing with the overall state of your health and the breathing techniques and other exercises I'm going to teach you. I really want to stress the importance of checking in with your Breath Hold Time every morning because it will actually be something that you enjoy waking up to doing because it's like teaching you so much about the state of your well-being. And you also notice how lifestyle factors dramatically affect your Breath Hold Time, such as eating late at night before you go to bed, not getting a good night's sleep, drinking alcohol, doing stuff that you know is not good for you. It will dramatically impact your Breath Hold Time. And you'll feel it; you'll notice it. But when you start to shift your lifestyle towards our SOMA Breath lifestyle, that's when magic happens. And every morning, you're going to be superimpressed at how well you're doing with your Breath Hold Time. And it'll become like a fun game for you to do every single morning. So it's really important that you know the right way to measure your Breath Hold Time. So in the next video, I'm going to teach you exactly how to do that. So your practice for today, the first thing you're going to do is check in with your Breath Hold Time tomorrow morning. And there's a right way to do it and a wrong way, so there's an additional video that you should watch that teaches you the right way to do this. Then next step is that I want you to learn by experiencing and doing. And so, you're going to test out our most powerful technique, the SOMA Awakening is actually our signature technique, and our Limitless Daily Dose which combines everything I've been talking about, powerful music, rhythmic breathing, pranayama techniques, and guided meditation, visualization techniques all into one sequence. And this, you're going to do also after you've checked in with your Breath Hold Time as your first activity of the day. But before you do Limitless, I want you to do this one little exercise. I think it's really, really profound. And that is to give yourself a mood score. 10 is the most ecstatic you've ever felt; 0 is the worst you've ever felt. So check in with yourself before you do this; how are you feeling? Are you at 10 or a 0? Or where are you on that scale? Then do the breath meditation, and then check in with yourself again, and really feel into how you feel because we've been doing a lot of learning, and we can get really stuck in our heads. So what I want you to do is to get into your body. This course is all about getting back into the feeling, into your body. And when you feel how you feel and measure that on a scale, you can see the benefits of this technique. And by tuning into, anchoring that feeling with the practice, you'll actually be more inclined to want to do it over and over and over again, and then see the improvements of it. See, some people go from a 4 to an 8 and then actually have to add extra numbers onto that scale because they go from 10 to 11 and 12 'cause they start to feel things they've never, ever felt before. That's the magic of what we've created here. All right. So check out the first exercise. I can't wait to see you on the inside.
====================

LESSON 1 - Additional video: Measure your breath hold time (bht)

- All right, so in this video I'm going to show you how to measure your Breath Hold Time, or BHT. That's right. So we're going to do this first thing in the morning, when you wake up, within 10 minutes of waking up. And, you're going to make sure you sit up straight, okay, for this? And you're comfortable whilst you're doing it. And you're not going to do any techniques before doing this. You're going to go straight into this exercise. All you need for this is a stopwatch, okay? You should have one on your phone, all right? But you just want to get a stopwatch. And the way we're going to do this technique is you're going to breathe in through your nose and out through your nose with a normal inhale and a normal exhale. So you're not going to go... anything like that. You're not going to use your mouth; you're not going to go... or do anything like that. You're just doing a normal inhale through your nose, exhale through your nose, like you normally would. So, make it as silent and smooth as possible. So, no jerkiness and no force with your inhale. So you don't go... nothing like that. You're just... okay? That's how you're doing the inhale and exhale. And what we're measuring is the time of your Breath Hold Time up until you get the first signs of stress which means you get that first urge to breathe, where your next inhale after that, you're not gasping for air, so you're definitely not breathing in through your mouth on your next inhale after that, and you're not forcing your inhale through your nose, even after that. You should be able to do a normal inhale and exhale. Otherwise you've gone too far. All right? If you feel like you're gasping for air, then your Breath Hold Time is going to be around 25% longer than it should be, okay? But, it might take a little bit of practice, but when you get it right, you'll be able to get an accurate measure of your Breath Hold Time every single morning. So now, I'm going to actually do it, and you can see how it's done. And remember, you start measuring your time from after the exhalation, and then the time finishes when you inhale after that hold. All right. So let's do a round together. So, stopwatch in my hand. Okay, sitting up straight, nice and relaxed, breathe in through your nose. So, hopefully, you were able to get to 40 seconds and beyond with your Breath Hold Time. Okay, so, have a go; practice until you get this right. But remember, don't repeat this exercise back to back, otherwise you're going to get an inaccurate score. You should only do this once, first thing in your morning; that's the score you want to take. But, obviously you might want to practice a few times before, just to make sure you're doing the technique correctly. So now you know how to do this technique. You can actually do this several times during the day, like in your afternoon and before you go to sleep, and you might find that your scores fluctuate throughout the day. And usually your worst time is going to be the morning time, okay? Don't be alarmed if it's a lot dramatically lower than other times in your day. But you want to measure your morning one as your true metric and gauge of your health because that is your baseline you want to work from. When you improve that morning Breath Hold Time and you consistently can improve that score, that's when you're really operating at your best, every single day. All right. And then, after this exercise in the morning, it's a good idea to rehydrate. So get some good quality mineral water. You can also add fresh lemon juice to it if you want. You can make it into a tea. Never drink the water cold 'cause that shuts off your digestive system. Warm water is very soothing for the gut and helps hydrate your body. That's right. So, enjoy this exercise. You now have an amazing tool at your fingertips which you can use to measure the state of your health. So, much love and peace.
====================

LESSON 1 - Additional video: How to practice the soma awakening technique

- Hi. So in this video, I'm going to show you how to do our Soma awakening technique. All right. It's very simple. And all you need to do is make sure you are either sitting up straight, with your back straight, or lying down on your back with a straight back. All right. And if you're sitting, make sure you are sitting in a place where you're not going to fall off and hurt yourself. Okay? Be in a comfortable chair. So very simple instructions for this technique. First step is to just correct your breathing. So make sure you're breathing diaphragmatically. So make sure that, if you were to put your left hand on your belly, right hand your chest, when you in inhale through your nose, your hand on the belly rises first. That's right. And remember your lungs are actually in your back. So you don't just stick out your belly. Imagine you're filling up your lungs like a cylinder and then into your chest on your inhale. So you're going to be breathing in when I say "in," and you're going to be breathing out when I say, "out." Okay. To make it very simple for you, you're going to breathe in with a rhythm, okay? And you're going to breathe in with the rhythm of the music with a smooth inhale through your nose. And you're going to breathe out through your mouth, with a slow and smooth, consistent exhale, but it is going to be in time with the rhythm of the music. So you'll hear me say, "in," and some rhythms, you'll be hearing me go, "In, two," or, "in, two, three, four." And then when I say, "Out," you're going to breathe out, with a smooth, consistent exhale to the beats. So some exhales are going to be "Out, two, three, four," or, "out two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight." So different phases of this session have different rhythms. So you're going to be breathing in beats, like this, for several minutes. This prepares you for the next stage which is the breath retention. In the breath retention phase, you're going to hear me say, "Breathe in." So you're going to breathe in. Again, you breathe in through your nose, and then you breathe out with a full exhalation. And if you're sitting up, you just let your head drop forward; chin goes to your neck, and you completely relax in your chair. And you hold your breath now until you get that first big urge to breathe. When you get that first big urge to breathe, you can take a sip in, through your nose, and out through your mouth, and hold it again. And if you find you can't hold your breath very long, because each track has quite a long time for your breath retention phase. But if you find your breath hold is very short, like 20 seconds, 30 seconds, then you can do more of these sips of air in, and holding, back out. However, as you progress through this, you're going to find that your breath retention time increases too. And you might find you're better to hold your breath for much longer which means you won't need to do those sips. But then when you feel that really big strong urge to breathe, you'll feel like this euphoric feeling, and you might get some tension and contractions in your abdomen and at the back of your spine. If you had a pulse oximeter, what you would observe, is that your oxygen saturation starts to drop below 90%. When it goes below 90%, that's when you're in the state of hypoxia. I don't want you to be dependent on this gadget. Maybe the first time, if you use it, you can use it to to match the measure on here with how you're feeling. But then I want you to be able to just feel when you're in this hypoxic state, all right? Then after that, you're going to take a deep inhalation through your nose, and you're going to contract up your pelvic floor muscles, or the muscles around your sphincter, which is called the ashwini mudra. You're going to breathe in; hold your breath in. That's right. And then you're going to hold it for about five to 10 seconds, and release with a hum. Hummmmmmmm. And then you're going to repeat that hum several times until the next round. That's right. You might find actually that you can hold your breath on the inhale for even longer than 10 seconds. But to begin with, just do it for a short time. Then start to experiment, as you go deeper into this session, with actually extending your inhalation hold as well. But bear in mind that everyone's going to have a different capability to hold their breath. All right? So don't force yourself. Don't stress yourself. There's no competition here. You're only going by your own abilities. All right. And you're going to measure your progress, as you go on throughout this Quest. However, there's a few key points you want to remember. First one is, the neck locks on the breath holds. All right. So if you're sitting up, you're going to do a neck lock. However, if you are lying down, you don't need to do any of these locks. Also we're going to be breathing in a rhythm, and it's going to be smooth and consistent with no pause between inhale and the exhale. So when I say, "In," you breathe in, when I say, "Out," you breathe out. And always breathe in through your nose, never, ever in through your mouth. All right? So breathing in through your nose, out through your mouth, in a smooth, consistent rhythm. And you don't need to count in your head because the counting is embedded in the music. So just follow along with the music; let the music be your guide. And this will make sure your breath is always smooth and consistent. So go test out this technique now. I can't wait to see your results with it. You're going to have a great time. Peace.

LESSON 1: Meditation: Limitless daily dose

- Welcome to SOMA Breath Meditation, a creative expansion for the golden age in becoming limitless. Bring your awareness to your breath as you breathe in and out. On your next breath in, squeeze every muscle on your body, release and let go, and then close your eyes, that's right. And as you close your eyes, become more and more relaxed. and draw your awareness to the sound. That's right. Tune into the sound, any sound, and become fully present with its presence. And notice as you tune in to the sound, the voice in your mind, the worries about the future, gets hung up on the past, gently drifts away, fades away, taking away with it all the cares and worries of the world. And now imagine that there's a movie playing in your mind's eye, and you have the ability to project a vision of a new reality where you are awakening into a new world, a limitless world where your creative imagination is allowed to run freely with no limitations, no obstacles in your way, and bring this vision into the future moment as though it's happening right now. That's right. How would it feel? How would it look? How would it touch? How would it taste, even, to be absolutely limitless? How would it be? How would it feel? What would you do if you were able to create any reality that you wish? You are waking up into this new age, the golden age, filled with an abundance of health, wealth, vitality, living in harmony with all that is, thriving together as one, and become one with that feeling, with that vision. Make it real, make it vivid, call it in right now. How would it feel to be absolutely limitless? How would it look? What would you see if your mind was completely boundless with no limits? So just allow your mind and your thoughts to run freely. Play with this creative idea of being absolutely limitless. So now let's get ready to breathe in the rhythm, breathe in beats. Three, two, one. Exhale and in, three, four. Out, two, three, four. In, two, three, four. Out, two, three, four. In, two, three, four. Out, two, three, four. In, two, three, four. Out, two, three, four. And imagine as you are breathing in the rhythm, you are amplifying this vision, expanding it, making it boundless and limitless. See how far your mind can stretch. That's right. In, two, three, four. Out, two, three, four. In, two, three, four. Out, two, three, four. In, two, three, four. Out, two, three, four. In, two, three, four. Out, two, three, four. In, two, three, four. Out, two, three, four. Every time you breathe in this rhythm, you harmonize with the cells of your body bringing into alignment with your vision. Two, three, four. In, two, three, four. So turn up the dial on your level of inspiration, becoming truly inspired. That's right. Two, three, four. Out, two, three, four. In, two, three, four. Out, two, three, four. In, two, three, four. Out, two, three, four. In, two, three, four. Out, two, three, four. In, two, three, four. Out, two, three, four. And now, take a deep breath in and breathe all the air out and hold your breath after four exhalation, as life is just a series of inhales and exhales. As you press pause on your breath, you press pause on life for a moment, allowing the thought files to reassemble clearing the clutter, the unconscious mind like a defrag switch for your operating system, bringing your thoughts in harmonious alignment with your grand vision. Become completely still. Completely at one, peaceful. When you feel that first big urge to breathe, you can take a little sip in, and blow the air out and keep holding, allowing yourself to go even deeper into the state of this inner oneness, tranquility, peace. And when you get a really strong big urge to breathe, send this energy up and up and up. As you feel this pulsing sensation, the charge within. Breathe in and send the energy up, all the way up like an electric blue current of light. Hold and release with a tone. ♪ Ah ♪ ♪ Om ♪ So now let's get ready to breathe in a rhythm. Breathe in beats. Three, two, one, exhale. And in, two, three, four. Out, two, three, four. In, two, three, four. Out, two, three, four. In, two, three, four. That's right, feel this vision expanding and expressing itself, as you become deeply inspired. In, two, three, four. Out, two, three, four. In, two, three, four. Out, two. As you connect to your higher power, in, two, three, four, you open, three, four, to new experiences, two, three, four, in this creative playground. Three, four. In, two, three, four. Out, two, three, four. Unlock the inner creative mind to its full potential. Three, four. In, two, three, four. Out, two, three, four. In, two, three, four. Feel into the very depth of your being, your heart. Out, two, three, four. In, two, three, four. Out, two, three, four. In, two, three, four. Out, two, three, four. In, two, three, four. Out, two, three, four. In, two, three, four. Out, two, three, four. In, two, three, four. Out, two, three, four. In, two, three, four. Out, two, three, four. In, two, three, four.

Out, two, three, four. In, two, three, four. Imagine circulating this energy around like a current, electric white light everywhere you take in and out, that's right. Three, four. Out, two, three, four. In, two, three, four. Out, two, three, four. In, two, three, four. Out, two, three, four. In, two, three, four. And now the faster rhythm, supercharge this vision. In, two. Out, two. Become inspired. Out, two. The highest frequency thought. That's right. In, two. Out, two. As we enter into the gamma. In, two. Imagine you're traveling through a portal, a new reality tunnel. In, two. That's right, keep going. You're doing great, you're nearly there. In, two. And when you reach the other side, you awaken into the golden age, a new reality of your own creation. And now take a deep breath in, and breathe all the air out and hold your breath after full exhalation and go deep, deep within your own mind. That's right. Your limitless mind. Become completely still. Completely at one. Peaceful. When you feel that first big urge to breathe, you can take a little sip in, and blow the air out and keep holding, allowing yourself to go even deeper into the state of this inner oneness, tranquility, peace. And when you get a really strong big urge to breathe, send this energy up and up and up as you feel this pulsing sensation, the charge within. Breathe in and send the energy up, all the way up like an electric blue current of light. Hold and release with a tone. ♪ Ah ♪ ♪ Om ♪ And allow your breath to return to normal in its own time. Allow it to be free however it wants to be. And you can play with the energy, holding a breath on the inhale or the exhale, or just coming to a natural stop where you don't feel the urge to breathe in or out. That's right. Imagining you are like a seed planted into the earth and the seed begins to awaken and the stem starts to rise up out of the earth to blossom into a beautiful flower. And just like this awakening flower, you are now awakening into a new age, the golden age, in this limitless world of your own creation. Dream big. Expand that vision. And imagine right now you are filled with a new sense of purpose and creativity, with the ability to turn this creative imagination into a reality of your own creation. And whatever new thoughts, ideas, and visions emerge from this time, pay attention to them 'cause they're important. This is your truth. And use this new sense of energy and creativity for the betterment of mankind, making this world a more harmonious and happy place for all. That's right. Much love and positive energy for the day ahead.

LESSON 2: The Science of SOMA Breathwork
--------------------
<v ->When you learn about breathing science,</v> it's not only just absolutely fascinating but also when you understand some very simple basic principles, it's going to empower you to have amazing health and well-being for the rest of your life. So now let's talk about pranayama, and how did they come up with pranayama? Well, pranayama actually came by studying animals in nature. So what they observed was animals that live a very long time, like elephants and turtles and whales, they actually have very slow breathing rates. They actually breathe at like one breath per minute, all right. And in fact, the whale can hold its breath for two hours at a time. That's right, two hours, and it can live 200 years plus. That's the bowhead whale, one of the oldest living creatures that we have. But now let's look at the opposite end of the spectrum. We have rats and mice. See, rats and mice, they actually breathe at like 150 to 300 breaths per minute. And they only live one or two years, and they don't hold their breath at all. Except for this strange anomaly to this rule which is the naked mole rat. Okay, the naked mole rat is a rat, okay, but has a few differences. The naked mole rat lives up to 30 years free of disease, and even in labs, they find it very hard to give it a disease. So what's different about the naked mole rat? Well, it's this. The naked mole rat lives primarily underground in a hypoxic environment. That's a very low oxygen environment, high CO2. And what else? The naked mole rat can hold its breath for 18 minutes at a time. So there is a real correlation here that we can see between breath retention times, rate of breath, and longevity in the animal kingdom. But a correlation is not good enough. We have to also be able to explain the mechanism. So let's look into another amazing scientist in his work, which is Helmut Sies. Now, Helmut Sies was the father of redox chemistry. He actually studied how oxygen reacts with things in the body. And he said this one thing, that although it's very difficult to live without oxygen, it's also very difficult to live with oxygen because of a phenomenon called oxidative stress. So what is oxidative stress? Well, oxidative stress is when oxygen creates energy in the body, and that reactive process actually is like a fire inside that burns and produces other byproducts. And those byproducts can cause damage to your cells, and make your cells age and die. In fact, oxidative stress is a big part of the ageing process. So if we can change our relationship with our breath, we can bring oxygen under our control and actually reverse the ageing process. And that's why if you look at pranayama, and you look at what we are doing with SOMA Breath, we've created a system of reduced breathing exercises that trains you to have breathing that will look like you're hardly breathing at all, meaning your breath is silent, smooth, rhythmic, and through the nose and diaphragmatic. That's right. So what's the opposite of silent, subtle, and smooth breathing? It's erratic overbreathing or hyperventilation. So what's going on with overbreathing and hyperventilation? Well, first, in order to understand why just even a little bit of elevated breathing, mouth breathing, and things like that are so bad for your health, we need to understand the basics, the science of respiration, all right? So oxygen plus glucose, okay, this is the initial part of the formula, creates CO2, water vapor, and ATP energy through the process of respiration in the mitochondria, which is the energy center of your cells. And we actually have about 1,000 or 2,000 of these little energy centers, but with our technique, actually you produce even more mitochondria which actually makes you even more efficient at producing energy. And we're going to talk about that in more depth in a moment. But what's happening is that we have to get from the atmosphere, the oxygen into the cells of our body where it's needed the most which is your organ cells, your muscle cells, your body tissue cells, all right? The process of doing that is oxygen comes in; it is absorbed through your lungs, and the oxygen binds to the hemoglobin of your red blood cells. And this is a transporting system like little vehicles that take oxygen to where it needs to go in your body. All right? Now where does it drop off the oxygen? Well, if it just dropped off oxygen everywhere, you'd have to breathe very, very hard to keep getting enough oxygen into your system. But we actually have a very special system already, which makes our breathing much more efficient which means you don't need to be constantly huffing and puffing all day long. And that is carbon dioxide. You see, let's say you're working out your muscles like this. You're doing some dumbbell weights. Well imagine that every single cell of your body is breathing all the time, breathing in oxygen, breathing out CO2, and it's that CO2 which we've been led to believe is some toxic waste gas, that is actually the most important thing to producing energy in your mitochondria. Here's why. It's the CO2 level that is the signal that tells your blood where to drop off oxygen. So when you're working out, and this muscles are respiring, these cells are breathing out the most CO2 in your body; that's where your blood is going to drop off the oxygen. So CO2 is like the signal for telling your blood where to drop off this oxygen. However, when we breathe out, when we exhale, we breathe out CO2. So if we hyperventilate, if we overbreathe, it means we're getting rid of this signal in the body that takes the oxygen to where it really needs to go. That's when we get low body tissue oxygenation and disease. So when you can slow your breathing right down, calm your breathing down, and become very efficient at breathing where you hardly need to breathe to make energy, that's when we have the right amount of CO2, right amount of this signal, and this CO2 allows optimum energy production. CO2 is also very important because it dilates your blood vessels; it relaxes your muscles, and it also calms the neurons in your brain. So when you are in a panic or anxiety attack, or if you're nervous or worried about something, your brain gets all erratic, and fires all these neuronal activities in an erratic way. But CO2 calms it down and brings you back into alignment and focus. So CO2 is our way for not only producing more energy, but also for being more focused, more attentive, and getting more stuff done and having more fun. Also being more relaxed and more calm and more content. So actually a lot of what we teach revolves around manipulating the CO2 levels in your body. So here's some of the main causes of hyperventilation. Mouth breathing, 'cause you're letting go of too much CO2, overeating, because your body, when you're eating food, sends all the blood to digest that food. And if you overeat, all the energy goes to digesting that food, meaning you breathe much harder than you need to. Lack of exercise. So if you don't exercise enough, you're not producing enough nitric oxide. And lack of exercise means you don't have well efficient mitochondria. This causes you to hyperventilate, and breathe inefficiently. Poor quality of sleep and oversleeping. If you don't sleep adequately, you're not having enough time to rest and rejuvenate. And in fact, sleep can be quite harmful, if you oversleep, to your health. And we're going to talk about that in more depth when we discuss sleep. But also things like factory foods, processed foods, drugs, stimulants; they cause you to overbreathe, and disease also does as well. So one of the things which we really can all avoid is exercise in the wrong way. If you do extreme exercise, if you're somebody who loves to go down to the gym and work out, one important thing you need to pay attention to is you never breathe through your mouth. Always breathe your nose. If you exercise to a point where you have to use your mouth, you're grasping for air, you've gone too far; that's stress. You're going to cause issues with your health if you keep doing that. Well, another one of the main factors for all of these issues and overbreathing itself is stress. It's usually in times of stress that we breathe faster than we need to. The reason why is because breathing can be both conscious and unconscious. All right? Meaning your autonomic nervous system, your reptilian brain, can be in control of your breath, and it just runs on autopilot without you thinking about it, or you can take control of it. And that's what makes us different from all the other animals because other animals do all of this stuff unconsciously; but consciously we can choose to either breathe like rats and mice or like elephants and turtles and whales, all right? It's up to us. But the reptilian brain is also what deals with our awareness of what's safe and unsafe. And if you're stressed out, then the reptilian brain is switched on into high alert, and it looks at the world with an unsafe lens. And that means you go into fight-and-flight mode. If you go into fight-and-flight mode, then that emotional stress, all those thoughts, the worries about the future, and being hung up on things in the past, that actually increases your demand for energy and breathing. You hyperventilate; you breathe like somebody who's having an anxiety attack or a panic attack. So by conscious control, we can actually prevent our reptilian brain from switching on the fight-and-flight mode, and we can bring ourselves back into harmony and balance. So one of the other big problems of overbreathing is it messes up this important factor to your health which is CO2 tolerance; how much CO2 you can handle in your body, all right? And if you have poor CO2 tolerance, you actually hyperventilate naturally. The reason why is because CO2 is what tells your brain you need to inhale. It's not the oxygen levels, it's the CO2. So if you have very poor CO2 tolerance, it means you breathe much faster than you need to. And it also means you produce energy very inefficiently. So with practice, and it can happen very quickly, you raise your CO2 tolerance; you handle more CO2 in the body which means you produce more energy efficiently, and you also are more calm and relaxed. Another very, very important gas for your body is nitric oxide. Remember, nose, NO stands for in nose, nitric oxide, because only through nasal breathing do we produce this remarkable gas. And nitric oxide works a lot like CO2. It helps get oxygen to where it needs to go, but it's also the most powerful antioxidant. Antioxidants are essential because antioxidants are what prevent oxidative stress. That's why we need antioxidants in our diet. But if you have lots of nitric oxide present, you don't need to eat as much too. So nitric oxide is a powerful antioxidant, but what it also is is that antiviral, antibacterial, antimicrobial. It kills germs in your nasal passages before they get into your lungs. Actually, there's a Covid treatment called SaNOtize, okay? It's got N-O capitals in the name because it's a nitric oxide spray that's been clinically proven to be like 98% effective against Covid. But we produce nitric oxide on command if we know the right techniques, which you're going to learn in this Quest. Actually seven to 15 times the amount of nitric oxide has been shown in studies to be produced just by humming alone. Nitric oxide is also anti-inflammatory and a bronchodilator. So if you suffer from asthma, it can relieve those symptoms. And as an anti-inflammatory, it can make you have less pain and feel more relaxed in your body. So I just want to stress the importance of nitric oxide as a gas for healing and well-being for your body. Now let's talk about nasal breathing. So nasal breathing is how we produce nitric oxide, but what nasal breathing also does, it acts like a filter for the air, all right? So when you breathe through your nose, the germs get blocked by the hairs of your nose, allowing the air to be properly absorbed through your lungs without any contamination. And what nasal breathing also does is it constricts the amount of air flowing into your lungs and out, meaning that you have less chance of overbreathing. So nasal breathing is one of the most important things that we tell you to do in our techniques. So nitric oxide is this amazing gas that has so many different health benefits, but we only produce nitric oxide through nasal breathing. And that's why nasal breathing is so key and important and why it's the foundation of all of our techniques. But what you can also understand is that breath hold raises CO2, because when you hold your breath, actually the CO2 is rising in your body 'cause you're not breathing it out. If you're exhaling, you're letting go of CO2. But if you stop your breath, the CO2 builds up. And then with a deeper practice, we create this state called intermittent hypoxia, which we're going to talk about in a moment. And another more advanced breath hold practice where you're holding your breath slightly beyond the comfort zone, you produce this positive stress response in the body that produces nitric oxide sulfurate, which actually makes you produce even more nitric oxide in your body. Let's now talk about the smooth, rhythmic, and diaphragmatic breathing. So here's a very simple thing you need to understand. When you breathe in, you stimulate the sympathetic nervous system. This is the active state, which also is known as the fight and flight state. When you breathe out, you stimulate the parasympathetic nervous system. When you breathe in and out in a rhythm, you actually create this balanced nervous system state, and you can get into a state called coherence. So diaphragmatic breathing is essential to prevent overbreathing and hyperventilation. And if you breathe through your mouth, you tend to breathe into your chest. But if you breathe your nose, you tend to automatically breathe into your diaphragm. Everything that exists in nature has a rhythm to it, a vibration. In fact, every single function in your body are called biorhythms 'cause they're rhythmical in nature. But every one of those functions of your body, they're called the infradian, ultradian, and circadian rhythms, like your sleep-wake cycle, your digestive system, your immune system, they all are governed by cycles; you're probably also familiar with the menstrual cycle. Well, they're all subservient to the rhythm of your breath. And when you do rhythmic breathing, even for just a few minutes a day, you can bring all those rhythms into balance. And did you know that breath can even affect the shape of your face and your teeth? There's an amazing book by a friend of mine, James Nestor, called "Breath" where he really goes into the science of why overbreathing, hyperventilation, affects the shape of your teeth, even your jaw, and can change your face. So if you want a facelift, stop overbreathing, and bring your breathing into control. So from this basic understanding of science, you should be able to see there's so many different health benefits from correct breathing. We have physical health benefits, fitness, stamina, endurance, even preventing the risk of disease, better focus, better concentration. With nitric oxide, you actually can make your own Viagra and prevent erectile dysfunction because Viagra, which you've probably heard of, actually stimulates production of more nitric oxide. So you're going to live longer; you're going to get more stuff done; you're going to have more fun and peace of mind just with simple breathing techniques. I want you to think of pranayama as like a pharmacy of different breathing techniques. So if you want to unblock your nose, you can do that. If you want to lower your blood pressure, you can do that. If you want to get to sleep, you can do that. If you want to relieve anxiety, there's one for that. If you want to kill bad bacteria and promote the growth of good bacteria, you can do that too. You can even relieve pain. But there's also amazing emotional and psycho-spiritual health benefits. So what I mean by that is having better control of your mood, reducing the risk of anxiety, depression, and also stimulating the gamma brain waves state that actually is associated with higher learning, and even creating a connection to a higher frequency of thought and vibration. And then we can enter into divine states of bliss by controlling CO2, energy production in the body, using nitric oxide, manipulating these gases in the body. We can create this amazing state of bliss with SOMADI. In fact, with the right breathing techniques, we can even elevate our mood into the ecstatic state. And it's the ecstatic state which has been shown scientifically to be the state where the brain can change the fastest. So if you want to create more skills, more talents, if you want to manifest, if you want to create extraordinary results in your life, we need to change the brain according to our will. And by getting into the state of ecstasy, we can transform quicker, faster. And that's one of the powerful techniques you're going to learn to do in this Quest. So your practice for today is to first check in with yourself, and become a mindful conscious breather throughout the day. Seeing, is your breath silent? Is it subtle? Is it smooth? Is it rhythmic? Is it diaphragmic? Are you breathing in through your nose? Are you breathing out through your mouth? Are you breathing in through your mouth, out through your mouth; what are you doing? Become a person who's really in touch with who they are; know thyself. And through this, you'll be able to understand now why maybe you're feeling certain ways. And how your breathing is influenced by your mood and how your breathing also affects your mood. So if you're somebody who also talks a lot, like I have been doing giving these lessons, then you also need to be mindful that overbreathing is caused by talking a lot. So when you hyperventilate through talking a lot, it's a good idea, let's say for one hour if you're spending a lot of time talking, take a 10-minute break where you just observe your breath in and out through your nose. That's right. Or you can just simply hum. Just for a few minutes, just hmmmmmmmmmm. Just do that. And that will also bring your body back into balance. So there may be occasions where you find it really hard to breathe through your nose. It could be a really cold day outside, and it hurts just to breathe in through your nose, okay? But just do your best; try your best. Even if like 50% of your day you are breathing through your nose, that's going to be a good start, okay? If you were only maybe 10% of the day before breathing through your nose. If you can just gradually, in baby steps, be more mindful and add more time during your day where you're really mindful, making sure you always breathe through your nose. And by the end of this Quest, you're going to make it into a habit. And consciously you are going to be in control of your breath. So don't forget to measure your breath hold time in the morning, and I'll see you in the next lesson.

LESSON 2: Additional video - Demonstration: hyperventilation vs slow breathing

- Perhaps you've experienced hyperventilation before. Well, I'm going to prove to you the harm that it can cause and how it affects your mood and wellbeing right now with what I call the force hyperventilation test. So if it's safe for you to do it right now, I want you to follow along with these instructions. So just give you a moment just to get comfortable. We're going to do this force hyperventilation test together. All right, so all you want to do is just sit, and you're going to pant like a dog. You're going to breathe like a cat, dog, or a rat, okay, which breathes very fast. So you're going to breathe through your mouth, and you're going to breathe at a faster rate than you normally would, like this. It's like you're panting. Okay? So let's do that for 30 seconds together, but don't do this if you're driving a car or operating any machinery. Then get comfortable. Let's begin. All right, so I dunno about you, but I'm feeling pretty lightheaded and dizzy. So what we're going to do now is just the breath hold time test, okay? You're going to breathe in through your nose, out through your nose, pinch your nose, hold your breath until you get that first urge to breathe, okay? So let's do that together. Hmm. All right! So, what you might have observed there is, well, first, how are you feeling? Check in with yourself. How do you feel now? Has the lightheadedness started to fade away? You feeling a bit more clear and relaxed? And you may have observed as well that your ability to hold your breath there was even longer than your normal breath hold time that you did in your morning.

LESSON 2: Meditation: Scientific om meditation for stress

- Welcome to scientific om meditation by SOMA Breath. Sit comfortably with your back straight or lie down on your back in a comfortable position where you'll not be disturbed. You can use this simple exercise whenever you are feeling anxiety, stress, or tension as a way to relieve that stress, and anxiety, and tension. So it is good to do this on the onset of those symptoms. So first, begin by scanning your body for the location of tension and anxiety by closing your eyes and just observing where in your body you feel you've experienced the feeling of anxiety. It's quite common for this to be in the upper chest region where you may feel a tightness. Others feel it down in the stomach, gut area, and the abdomen. Or you may experience it as headache and tension in your head. It could also be a combination of all of these three. So for a moment now, just allow yourself to scan the location of this tension in your body. If there was a color that represents this tension, what would that color be? Just see this color in your mind's eye, and notice as you perform the scientific om meditation that with your toning you can actually transmute this color from what most people will see as a dark, dull color to a bright, white light. So imagine that every time you make the tone of om, you are turning this color into the equal and opposite color that you would represent as being relaxation and peace. You may also not see a color, which is okay. So just instead feel what it would feel like to be vaporizing this stress away and releasing this tension with every tone that you make. Each of the three syllables of om correspond to certain regions of the body. The tone of aah corresponds to the lower part of your body, the gut, abdomen, and the region of your sex. The ooh sound, ooh, corresponds with the heart and the middle part of your body. And the hum, humming sound, corresponds with the upper part of your body, the throat, your third eye, pineal gland, and putridity gland. So by simply chanting each one of these tones in sequence, you can turn any darkness, dull color associated with stress, or tension, and anxiety in these regions to a bright white color, the opposite of what represents stress and anxiety to you. And then notice, as you do so, the tension just drifts away and fades away. That's right. So we'll be making each tone in turn after a full inhalation, and then at the end of the tone you can hold your breath on the exhale for 5 to 10 seconds. This will further bring your heart rate down and create a sense of relaxation in your body. If you wish to hold your breath a little bit longer, as you enjoy that sensation, you can do so, as you wish. So let's begin. Breathe in through your nose, let's make the sound of aah, bringing awareness to the lower region of your body. So inhale. And hold your breath. And now let's make the tone of ooh, bring your awareness to the middle part of your body, the region of your heart, chest, and lungs, and observe any darkness intention turning into a bright light of peace and relaxation. So breathe in through your nose, the full inhalation. Hold your breath after making the tone for a few seconds. And then coming back to normal breathing. Now bring your awareness to the upper part of your body, your head and your throat, and notice if there's any tension that remains there, turning any dark color into a bright light. So breathing in through your nose, full inhalation, make the sound of hum. You can hold your breath for a few seconds. Then you can inhale and come back into normal breathing. That's right. So now we can make one long tone out of each one of those three individual tones of aah, ooh, and hum. So it will sound like this. Breathing in through both your nostrils with a full inhalation. And hold your breath for a few seconds. And inhale, coming back to normal breathing. This time as you make that singular tone of om, scan your body for any tension, and notice as you make the vibration, imagine you are dissolving and releasing the tension, turning any dark color into light as you scan the awareness of your body. That's right. So again, breathing in through both nostrils after full inhalation. And now making the tone. And repeat and then hold your breath a few seconds. Inhale, come back to normal breathing. Have a rest for a few seconds and repeat the same process. Inhaling always through your nose with a full inhalation. And now keep repeating the same sequence for as long as you need till you can feel completely relaxed and the anxiety and tension has faded away. By simply breathing in through both your nostrils, the full inhalation into your diaphragm, then making the tones. And now the music shall play on its own for you to be able to perform this scientific om meditation for as long as you wish and need to for the desired effects and results. Much love and positive energy for the day ahead. Peace.

LESSON 3: Increase Your Breath Hold Time (BHT)
--------------------
<v ->Hey, it's Niraj here, and welcome to this lesson.</v> So I hope by now that you've actually tried our SOMA Awakening Technique, our Limitless Daily Dose, which is powered by this technique. And what you should also have now is an overview of the science of respiration breathing and how it affects your physiology and your emotions, feelings and thoughts. So now you really know about the power of this remote control, and I'm now going to teach you the techniques that gives you the remote control. That's right. Okay, so the first part of this, we're going to actually go over the Limitless Dose and the Awakening Technique. This is our most popular technique, and it's, what I tried to do was to bring in the most powerful pranayama techniques that improves your carbon dioxide tolerance and your ability to make nitric oxide, also create this beneficial state called intermittent hypoxia that we're going to go into, and also give you a dose of rhythmic breathing. That's right. Slow, rhythmic, connected breathing. So I'm going to break down each one of these components so that you can really understand why this technique works 'cause when you understand why it works and you get the benefits from it, it's going to make you want to keep doing it over and over again. So the SOMA Awakening Technique is a profound technique that's going to help raise your CO2 tolerance and improve your morning Breath Hold Time, giving you all of these amazing health benefits. However, there's some additional techniques you can do throughout the day, which are a part of this mindful, conscious breathing practice, which will additionally improve your Breath Hold Time and also your CO2 tolerance. And that's when you get long lasting additional benefits. All right, so let's go through each one of these techniques. So here's what we got for you. We got humming, alternate nostril breathing, reduced breathing exercises using our breath entrainment technology, and anaerobic exercises, various ways to exercise with no oxygen, which is one of the most efficient and powerful ways to build strength and health. All right, so let's go through each one in a bit more depth. Humming is actually my favorite exercise of all. I love humming, making tones, and it does a variety of different things. So firstly, when you hum and you make one singular tone, and what you're going to find as you do our techniques, your hums are going to get longer and longer and longer. You're going to be able to hold a single note, a beautiful, long note, for long periods of time. So humming is something you can do when you're relaxing, when you need to have a break, as I said every hour, if you're talking a lot, spend some time just to hum, okay? You can also do this in the sauna; one of my favorite activities, go into sauna and do humming. All right, that creates profound benefits, 'cause humming, also what it does, is it stimulates the vagus nerve and instantly activates the parasympathetic and calms you down, and it cools your body down. So if you're in a hot environment like a sauna, you're going to be able to stay in there even longer, all right? Plus, it produces nitric oxide. In fact, studies show that you produce seven times the amount of nitric oxide by humming than just nasal breathing. And then we have alternate nostril breathing. You're probably quite familiar with alternate nostril breathing. It's called anulom vilom in yoga, where you breathe in through one nostril, out through the other nostril, and alternate each nostril. Well, this is a breathing technique, if you think about it, that is a powerful reduced breathing exercise, 'cause nasal breathing, already, compared to mouth breathing, reduces the airflow coming in and out. So you have less volume of air coming in and out, prevents hyperventilation and overbreathing. If you close one nostril and breathe only through one nostril, that has another added benefit of creating even more reduced breathing. And what we're going to be doing is slowly reducing your breathing and desire to breathe and need to breathe over time, okay? Then we have reduced breathing exercises. Reduced breathing exercises are techniques that revolve around my SOMA Breath Entrainment Technology, where you breathe in time to the beat, and hold your breath at certain moments, as well, to slow your breathing rate even more down. What this does is it improves your Breath Hold Time, and it also increases your carbon dioxide tolerance gradually, but it also calms you down, and makes you feel very relaxed, and you can use certain reduced breathing exercises as well as a way to help you go to sleep. So they're actually quite good to do at night to help you calm down, relax and go to sleep. Then we have anaerobic exercise. Anaerobic exercise is a series of different techniques you can do, and we're going to go into a deeper, more powerful practices in the Quest later on, but one simple one is just anaerobic walking, where you pinch your nose, hold your breath, and walk around the room until you feel you need to breathe. And this technique is a very powerful way to exercise your body to be more efficient using oxygen, to increase CO2 tolerance, and improve your Breath Hold Time quite powerfully, quite fast. And there's a difficult way to do it, and an easy way. I'm going to show you both. So think of all of these, these are all actually reduced breathing exercises when you think about it, but think of it as you're going to be going on, for this period of time, a breathing diet. That's right. If you go on any kind of a diet where you're restricting your calories, let's say you normally eat 5,000 calories, and you suddenly have to cut down to 3,000 calories, there's going to be a period of time where you're going to actually feel hunger and hunger pangs and find it difficult and uncomfortable. We're actually going to be reducing your breathing down to reset, recalibrate, retrain you to have a slower, calmer, more subtle breath, all right? So in that process, just like a diet with food, you may go through a little bit of discomfort. You may feel a little bit uncomfortable. You get this feeling of air hunger. And when you get that feeling of air hunger, that's actually a sign that this technique's working. So you want to maintain mild air hunger feeling throughout this experience. That's when you know this is actually working. What that will feel like is a little bit of like, oh I need to inhale, but I can still keep going. It's not like where you're gasping for air. It's where you just feel this little urge to breathe, but it's not an overarching urge to breathe. And that's what these reduced breathing exercises help you to do. So I've made another video for you that actually creates a little sequence of these reduced breathing exercises, with a right way to do them so it's safe, effective and efficient. So here's your practice for today. All right, so when you wake up in the morning, make sure you check in with your Breath Hold Time. Then you can also do the Limitless Daily Dose, if you wish, or you can get straight into doing the reduced breathing exercise routine that I've created for you in the tutorial video. You can do them both together, back to back, if you've got the time, but also throughout the day, be mindful of your breath, and take conscious control of your breath, so you always breathe in through your nose, and you are making sure your breath is diaphragmatic, smooth and calm. That's right. So then these breathing exercises, like the Daily Dose, and also the reduced breathing exercises, must be done on an empty stomach. That's why I prefer you to do them in the morning as you get up. So much love and positive energy today. Can't wait to see your results with these. See you in the next video. Peace.

====================

LESSON 3: Additional video - Demonstration: reduced breathing exercises

- [Instructor] Put your left hand on your diaphragm and right hand on your chest. Now, breathe in. And observe which hand rises first when you breathe in. If this is the hand on your chest, that's incorrect. Imagine that your nostrils are in your diaphragm, the area around your belly, and that when you breathe in, your left hand rises first, then the hand on your chest. Now that we have corrected our breathing, it's time to perform anulom vilom, alternate nostril breathing. Close your right nostril with your thumb. Keep your left nostril open, and breathe in through your left nostril. And then breathe out through your right nostril. Breathing in through your right nostril, and again, breathing out through your left nostril. So you're breathing in and out through each alternate nostril, using your thumb and forefinger as a way to close your nostrils. Repeat this sequence of breathing in through your left and breathing in through your right in rotation for at least five minutes. Sit comfortably in an upright position with your back straight. With your tip of your tongue, point it to the back of your teeth, the Soma Chakra, in the direction of your third eye. Inhale through both your nostrils, and make a humming sound, and bring your awareness to the buzzing between both your eyes, center of your forehead, location of the third eye. Hum, vibrate and continue to make that tone for three minutes. To enhance the effect of this, you can change your focus so you're looking to your third eye with both your eyes focused on this point as you make the tone. You can also look to the tip of your nose, bringing your focus to the tip of your nose as you make the sound. Repeat this for at least three to five minutes. Find a place where you can stand and walk around safely. Take a sharp inhale and exhale through both your nostrils, pinch your nose and hold your breath, walking around until you feel that strong big urge to breathe. Then take a sip of air in through your nose, back out through your nose with a sharp exhale, hold your nose and repeat, and keep repeating this process several times till you feel your face begins to heat up and you feel a very strong sensation to breathe, even with an adrenaline rush sensation coming through your abdomen and up through your spine. An alternate method is to hold one nostril shut and walk around breathing through just one nostril. And you can repeat each nostril alternative for each round. This is a gentler way for beginners if you find the pinching nose technique too intense. Make sure you never inhale through your mouth and your breath on the inhale is as subtle as possible.

====================

LESSON 3: Meditation: Slow diaphragmatic breathwork 4:8:8

- Welcome to the SOMA Breath meditation for training your breath to breathe in a slow diaphragmatic pattern of three breaths per minute. In the ratio of four in, eight hold, eight out. Sit comfortably in an upright position or lie down on your back in a place where you'll not be disturbed. Ensure you are breathing diaphragmatically by always breathing into your nose and making sure that the hand on your belly rises first and then your chest. You can also do this lying down on your front to really ensure you're breathing into the diaphragm, feeling the rise of that diaphragm. You can even place a book on your belly if you're lying on your back to see and observe the diaphragm rising. It's very simple instructions. When I say in, you're going to breathe in through your nose, into your diaphragm, with a smooth, consistent inhale. And when I say out, you breathe out with a smooth, consistent exhale until I say hold, and then you hold your breath until the next command. Every breath should be as smooth, consistent as possible in rhythm with the music. So let's begin! In. Out. Hold. In. Out. Hold. In. Out. Hold. In. Out. Hold. In. Out. Hold. In. Out. Hold. In. Out. Hold. In. Out. Hold. In. Out. Hold. In. Out. Hold. In. Out. Hold. In. Out. Hold. In. Out. Hold. In. Out. Hold. In. Out. Hold. In. Out. Hold. In. Out. Hold. In. Out. Hold. In. Out. Hold. In. Out. Hold. In. Out. Hold. In. Out. Hold. In. Out. Hold. In. Out. Hold. In. Out. Hold. In. Out. Hold. In. Out. Hold. In. Out. Hold. End!

Part 2: Healthy Lifestyle for Correct Breathing

====================

LESSON 4: Breath as Your Inner Pharmacy
--------------------
<v ->Hi, Niraj here, and welcome back to this next lesson.</v> So here we're going to be talking about your breath as a pharmacy. And we're going to go deeper into this library of different pranayama breathing techniques that you can use to create your own medicines on command. All right. So first let's just talk a little bit about what happens when we get sick and we get symptoms of potential sickness. Okay, so usually you go and see a doctor, or you go to the pharmacist when you get certain symptoms. Let's say you've got annoying heartburn that won't go away. You go to the doctor, and maybe they'll give you an antacid prescription, and you go to the pharmacy. And then hopefully that would solve the symptoms. Or let's say you got a really horrible headache. You go buy some painkillers from the pharmacy. And then you would hope, pray, that that would alleviate those symptoms. However, what they do is they alleviate the symptoms which is just the symptom of the condition, not the cause. And this is the big problem with modern healthcare is that it works symptomatically. It doesn't go to the actual cause of where all these problems are coming from in the first place. And I'm hoping by now, you've got really good understanding how breathing influences your physiology at such a core deep level. And that overbreathing, hyperventilation, is one of the causes of many problems with your health. And symptoms of stress makes you overbreathe, and all that overbreathing turns into a vicious cycle where you actually end up causing more distress in your body and more of those symptoms that are associated with stress. So let's go through a checklist of what some of those symptoms might be. Well, first I'm going to talk to you about this from an Ayurvedic perspective. So Ayurveda is what I went into to really go deeper and widen my knowledge and understanding of traditional yoga and how I can use these practices to help me heal. So in the Ayurvedic philosophy is a very simple checklist to follow to see whether you are well or not well, and that's this. Do you breathe well? Do you sleep well? Do you eat well? Do you shit well? Do you piss well? Do you think well? Do you hold no grudges or hate? And do you love what you do and others around you? Then you are truly well. However, when you start to experience issues with sleeping, eating, not able to be able to think clearly, and perhaps you're holding onto some grudge from the past and anger and resentment from the past, or perhaps you're anxious and worried about the future. If this goes on for too long, then you become chronically stressed, and this chronic stress will lead to inflammation, overbreathing, and then you get what is called a heart attack. Because the leading cause of death in the world is actually heart disease and heart attacks. And when you get chronically stressed for too long, all of this takes its toll on your physiology. You get inflamed; you may even get cancer; you get chronic tension where the stress means that your muscles contract, blood flow diminishes to your muscles and joints and tissues, and this leads to disease. So it's a really good idea to solve any of these lifestyle factors 'cause this really is issues of lifestyle. Chronic disease is an issue of your lifestyle. And that's the Ayurvedic philosophy is that when you get sick, majority of the times all you need to do is check in with your lifestyle. This is what we're going to be going into and giving you tools on how to improve your lifestyle 'cause all of these will affect your ability to breathe in a smooth, silent, circular, rhythmic, diaphragmatic way. Because observe how you feel when you experience some pain or if you're not sleeping properly or eating properly, getting all that pain inside, observe your breathing 'cause your breath is a mirror of what's going on on the inside. You might find that you are breathing through your mouth, heavy deep breaths, and your breath is not smooth and circular and calm as we want it to be. So use this breath as a guide and also use this checklist I'm going to provide with you. So in this checklist, you're going to get a list of trigger symptoms which you really want to pay attention to. If you start to experience them, you want to work on making sure they don't turn into a chronic long-term issue. Then there's also some additional symptoms which are warning-bell symptoms which means you should go to the doctor immediately. Okay. So you're going to have a clear list of symptoms that are we call trigger symptoms which you can deal with yourself and then alarm-bell symptoms which are symptoms you must go for emergency treatment from your doctor from. But there's an even more profound question you can ask yourself every single morning. And this is what I call the morning health checkup. Ask yourself, "Am I waking up with enthusiasm to do a hard day's work and be kind and compassionate to others? Or do I wake up feeling like I have to, rather than I want to?" If you lack enthusiasm to get out of bed in the morning, to do the things that you really want to do, and if you lack enthusiasm to be kind and compassionate, this, if it's left unchecked, is going to make you chronically stressed. All right, because ultimately where you spend most of your day during the day is working, doing things. Maybe it's your business. Maybe it's a job, but if you are spending eight hours, 10 hours a day, hating your job and hating the people around you, this is going to take its toll eventually. You're going to get chronically stressed; that chronic stress is going to lead to all of those symptoms that I just talked about. So the moment you start to feel like you can't get out of bed and that could even be right now, and if you are somebody who's feeling that right now, I fully can relate to you 'cause this is what I felt as a pharmacist. I found it really hard to get out of bed. I had to change my perception of what I was doing. Firstly, I had to find a way to change my career and do something that I love, and I started to seek out people that I could model their success and strategies to help me to move into a career that was more aligned with who I am. But the thing is we must also take care of the present moment. And my swami always said to me this one thing: first make peace with your present moment. And that was to change my perception of the career I was in and seeing it in a new light. And I started to look at how can I improve my job so I don't hate it so much. How can I practice being kind and compassionate? What are the things I can do? I started to ask those questions, and this is what led me to actually creating my own healthy shopping list service and going deeper into actually fixing the cause of most people's health issues rather than just treating symptoms. And I'm sure if you really think about it and spend some time contemplating, you can find ways to make your present moment more peaceful and more aligned with who you are. And there's a great saying that Buddha says that all we can really control is the 200 meters in front of us. Okay, it's our little garden of paradise that we can create by just taking care of the things that happen around us. Because if you can make this little area around you a perfect place for you aligned to who you are, then what happens is this rubs off around you, becomes like a butterfly effect that goes and actually makes a bigger change around the world through a network effect. And this is what I want to do because if you can make yourself feel content and peaceful, and that's why the breath is so powerful 'cause that can instantly help you change your state, bring in balance and to cultivate a sense of peace around you, then you will influence and rub off this energy around you onto others and inspire other people to make the same changes. And then through one breath at a time, we make a change that impacts the entire world. So breathing techniques from pranayama really is like your own breath pharmacy. All right. And when you understand how to do them, you can actually prevent and treat some of those trigger symptoms from happening. So if you do get any of these trigger symptoms then we have a technique. We have three techniques that you can go to to help relieve them. So say you're suffering from stress and anxiety and finding it hard to go to sleep; you may even have elevated high blood pressure. Then there's a technique for that. We call it Slow Rechaka. Perhaps you've got heartburn and indigestion, and maybe you've got IBS because your gut microbiome has gone out of sync. So there's a technique for that. It's called Kati Mudra. Perhaps you have got a blocked nose. This is very common. Blocked nose, congestion and also constipation is linked to the nasal passages as well. We have a technique for that, powerful technique that in minutes can unblock your nose and relieve constipation. So go ahead now and check out those tutorials we've got for you for each one of those techniques; test them out; see how you feel doing them. And we also downloaded that checklist; have a read through it, and check in with any of those symptoms if you are being affected by them right now. And then your practice for today is first thing as always measure your Breath Hold Time. First thing in the morning, that's right. This is a recurring daily task. You're going to do this every single day. Then you can continue with the reduced breathing exercises in the morning. This is again another recurring daily task. And of course you can do our Daily Dose, so you can get that daily dose of intermittent hypoxia. That's going to help you feel amazing right from the start of the day. And then these extra breath pharma exercises you can do when you need to throughout the day as you need them. So much love, positive energy. I'll see you in the next video. Peace.

====================

LESSON 4: Additional video - Demonstration: pranayama breathing techniques

- [Tutor] Sit comfortably with your back straight in a comfortable position. Put your right hand on your belly, left hand on your chest, and ensure that you're breathing diaphragmatically. Breathing in through your nose into your belly but never into your chest. Now let's begin the exercise. Bring your awareness to your diaphragm, and breathe in through both nostrils, completely filling up your entire diaphragm and your lower lungs, and then inflating the chest so you have a complete lung full of air. This is a full yogic breath. And then purse your lips and exhale with a very smooth, slow, consistent exhale. Gradually letting go of the air with no force or tension, until your lungs are back to normal. And then repeat this several times in a row until you begin to feel very relaxed and calm. You may repeat this exercise for several minutes or as long as you wish to get the desired effect. Sit comfortably on the floor with your legs crossed in an upright position, or you can also kneel on your knees. Jut your neck forward, tilting your head slightly back, making a gulping sound with your mouth slightly open, and then immediately push your head forward with your chin towards your chest, and hold your breath for several seconds, and swallow. Repeat this several times to receive air into your stomach. You should hear a gurgling sound at the end. An alternative way is to keep your mouth slightly open, and draw air in so it touches the back of your throat, and then swallow and repeat the process of sticking your chin towards your neck, closing your neck, and then holding your breath for several seconds. Then, in order to bring air into your bowels, you need to just bend forward and push your head pointing towards the ground, and hold your breath as you lean forward, and let the air move in from your stomach into your intestines. And then later on, you'll notice that the air just gently passes out naturally, by making no odor or smell. Take a normal inhale through your nose; exhale through your nose; pinch your nose, and nod your head up and down whilst holding your nose, so no air can enter or escape until you feel a big urge to breathe; do this until you start to feel a warming sensation, and you really feel a big urge to breathe. And then repeat the process again, taking a small sip in through your nose, out through your nose, holding until you feel that big urge to breathe. Repeat this several times in a row, until your face really becomes warm and you feel that strong unblocking sensation where every single blood vessel starts to awaken and clear the congestion. You may need some tissues to blow your nose during this time, as you'll find that a lot of congestion will start to leave your nose. Some golden rules to this technique is never to breathe in through your mouth. Always breathe in and out through your nose.

====================

LESSON 5: Improve Your Digestion with Optimal Diet and Breath
--------------------
<v ->Hi, Niraj here.</v> And in this lesson, we're going to talk about your diet and digestion, and how breathing has an influence on your digestion, and how your digestion and quality of your diet actually also affects the quality of your breathing. So actually, to be completely honest, I really don't like diets. The word diet actually has the word "die" in it. And what I've realized is that people who obsess about diets are usually unhealthier than those who don't really care too much about what they eat. So I'm going to talk to you a little bit about food digestion and the Ayurvedic perspective of food and what food you should eat according to who you truly are. Because the problem with diets is that they are promoted in a way that they are blanketed as a panacea for everyone. So you may have heard of things like the raw vegan diet or the carnivore diet, two extreme different belief systems around food and diet, and people kind of become fanatical about them to a point where it almost turns into a religion. So I'm going to try and break a few myths around food and diet for you and what diets really mean according to the Ayurvedic philosophy. All right, so going back to my own personal story, I actually had a chronic autoimmune condition called ulcerative colitis which affects your colon and really does affect your digestion. So you literally get ulcers in your gut, and you're bleeding heavily every day. And this was going on for months and months. So I really desperately needed a way to fix this. And what I tried at the time, because there was so much media promotion of the raw vegan diet, I thought that this was going to heal me. And I followed that plan. In fact, it made me 10 times worse. I got supersick. I got...the symptoms got much more intense, and I was bleeding more heavily with so much gas and bloating. And I was confused. I was like, "Well, the media's telling me this is the healthiest way to eat, but I'm feeling so much worse. What's going on here?" And I even kind of got deluded by this statement they sometimes say that, oh, sometimes you're going to get worse before you get better. I was getting worse and worse and worse. I really wasn't getting better. So it was when I realized that actually there is no one size fits all when it comes to diet that everything changed. So that was by going back into the Ayurvedic system. The Ayurvedic system tells us that we're all unique individuals, and we're all composed of different energy types. And through simple questions, asking questions about how you look and how you think, you can actually find out your energy profile. And through this energy profile, you can actually create the right lifestyle plan for you. And food is a big part of this, because the Ayurvedic system works on energy. And food is a form of energy that we consume. So there's all different types of energies that influences the energy of our body. And food is one of the primary ones. And the wrong type of food and overeating, for example, can also really negatively impact the quality of your breathing. And vice versa. Breathing the wrong way, overbreathing, hyperventilation, can have a serious effect on your digestion. In fact, it takes two hours to digest food for most healthy, normal people. So when you're stressed, we overbreath, we hyperventilate. And overbreathing, even just a small amount for a few minutes of overbreathing, hyperventilation, where you're breathing faster than you need to, stress breathing, breathing in through your mouth, into your chest, this switches on the fight-and-flight response. So if you switch on the fight-or-flight response, the blood flow moves away from your digestive glands and goes to the bones and skeletal muscles for action, fight or flight. And this means that your normal digestion, which is two hours in most people, is now slowed down to like five to eight hours. So you can get slow and sluggish digestion which leads to things like indigestion, IBS and all these other horrible symptoms. And if it goes on for too long, you can get something really serious, like what I had, ulcerative colitis and other autoimmune issues, even things like Crohn's. So it's a really good idea that we take care of our diet, but we need to know what's the right diet for us or the right food to consume. So overbreathing has a direct impact on the quality of your digestion. But by learning how to breathe correctly, we can actually improve the digestive process. And the Ayurvedic system gives us an amazing insight to what's the right type of diet for you. I actually had to completely change my diet. And I actually started to eat cooked, warm, nourishing foods, which actually really grounded me and made me feel so much better. And through the Ayurvedic system, I found a whole new way of eating that was much more aligned with me. And this was a big, big factor that helped me heal. So another really key thing you must understand is by overeating, you actually can also completely mess up your breathing and even create stress just by eating too much. So that means gulping food down because if you don't chew your food, your stomach doesn't have teeth. So now your stomach has to do extra work to digest. So all of the blood flow goes into your digestion. But if you're already stressed, there's less blood flow going there. And if you are eating a lot of food and your stomach has to do a lot of work digesting, then that takes away blood flow from other areas of the body. And that actually means you end up overbreathing, hyperventilating, because your demand for energy goes up. And this is where we get into a vicious cycle. So overeating is one of the worst things you can do for your breathing, quality of breath, and your health. So one really powerful tip to improve your digestion from today is to eat mindfully. Which means chewing your food. That's right. You'd be surprised how many people just gulp food down. But if you chew your food, so every bite you take you chew 30 times, count in your head 30 times, that also stops you from talking while you're eating, and then swallow, so this gives enough time for saliva to build up to digest the food. And then the saliva comes down with the food, and actually then your stomach can easily process the food. Because your stomach doesn't have teeth. So it's really important that we use our teeth when we're eating. Simple thing. And also, when you chew your food, and you count in your head 30 times like that, it means you're eating much slower. And actually, it takes 20 minutes for your gut, your colon, actually, to register that you're full. It's your colon that actually sends a signal to your brain when you are feeling full. So if you actually eat too fast, you end up gulping food down and overeating simply because you haven't given enough time for your body to tell you that you're full. So eating slowly, mindfully, chewing your food, not talking whilst you're eating, these are some amazing tips you can use to stop this process of overeating which is actually such a common issue. So when I became The Renegade Pharmacist, I actually had a lot of experience helping people with their diets and the right foods for them. And one little analogy I used to give to my patients to quickly get them to understand the importance of food, the right food for who they are, was giving them the analogy of a car. And I asked them, "Have you ever put the wrong fuel into your car? What happens?" And almost everyone has done that at some point where they put like diesel into a petrol or petrol into their diesel. And they're like, "Oh yeah, the car just chugs along and sputters. And sometimes you have to take it to the mechanic to fix it." Well, I'm like, "Well, imagine you are a superefficient bio-engine, and you have been putting the wrong fuel into your fuel tank for years. And this is why you're on this huge list of medications." And that just made people go, "Ah, yes, now I get it." This little system from Ayurveda can show you what's the right fuel for who you are. But as a golden rule, the absolute wrong fuel for everyone is processed foods. Heavily processed foods that come from a factory with packages and ingredients with names that you cannot pronounce is absolutely the wrong fuel for human beings. And I just make this one simple rule for everybody, which is just, if all you can do is follow a no factory diet where you just eat whole foods and you eat foods that you really love and enjoy, which you'll figure out over time as you switch from a factory diet to a nonfactory diet, eat mindfully, eat in moderation, don't overeat, these things really make a huge difference. And then for some people, things like dairy proteins can actually be very hard to digest, and especially eating them late at night. And you may have had this problem where you get a lot of mucus congestion after eating things like cheese or having a big slice of pizza or having lots of sugary drinks can actually cause you to have a lot of mucus congestion. The reason why is when you get a slow, sluggish digestive tract, because you're really trying to break down all those heavy proteins, then what happens is as your gut is so intimately linked to your nasal passages, you get all this mucus congestion building up. So if you're somebody who suffers from something like sinus issues, nasal congestion, switching and changing your diet to the right fuel for you will make a huge difference to your life and well-being. So here are some of the common symptoms that you may experience when your digestion gets disrupted. First one is slow digestion, indigestion, which leads to bloating, gas and just feeling sluggish and lethargic. You may even get things like constipation as a result of that. So the first one that I recommend is Slow Rechaka, which you can do after a meal, which switches off stress instantly. And you can refer back to the tutorial on Slow Rechaka to learn how to do that. Any breath hold where you're holding your breath and holding it to a point where you can't hold it any longer can actually stimulate the peristaltic movement of your bowels. Meaning if you've got constipation, it can instantly relieve your constipation. So the anaerobic exercises, where you're holding your nose and exercising to the point where you're not able to hold your breath any longer, like holding your nose and walking around the room, that actually can get your bowels moving very quick. So never do those techniques when you've got food in your stomach. But if you're feeling constipated, it can really help clear, unblock your bowels, but also it can help clear the nasal congestion that comes from a slow, sluggish digestive system. Now, one of my most favorite and most powerful techniques to improve your health is called Kati Mudra. And this technique's going to help a lot with symptoms like heartburn, where you're getting that acid indigestion. And people who fast and get hunger pangs, Kati Mudra is really good at relieving those hunger pangs instantly. It can also make you feel full up. And so if you're into fasting, if you're going to do a weekly fast or a daily intermittent fast, use that Kati Mudra technique. But what this magical technique also does, and why it may be one of the most powerful longevity techniques of them all, is it improves the gut microbiome. The gut microbiome is so essential to efficient digestion and your well-being, 'cause also your immune system resides a lot in your gut. Around 60% of your immune system actually begins in the gut. So with Kati Mudra, what happens is you kill bad bacteria by bringing oxygen into your bowels. You kill that bad bacteria, but you also promote the growth of good bacteria. This is amazing. And the way you do that is by getting oxygen into your stomach, your gut, digestive system and your intestines, flushing out your bowels. It's like a cleanse for your bowels that you can do every morning if you want, or you can do it as part of your fasting routine. If you've ever been to a colon clinic, they actually use oxygen supplements to kill bad bacteria in the gut. They also use it to kill yeast, fungi and other microbes that are anaerobic. And it's the anaerobic bacteria, the bacteria that likes to thrive in low oxygen that actually we need to take care of. But oxygen into the bowels kills those anaerobic bacteria. That's the bad bacteria. That's the stuff that makes you have smelly farts and gas. But with this Kati Mudra technique, you can cleanse the bowels, kill that bad bacteria and actually feel really, really good. Because so much of your mood is influenced by your digestion. And if you have a presence of a lot of bad bacteria and microbial overgrowth, it can actually really affect the quality of your thoughts, decisions, and your mood. So when you actually have a regular cleanse using the Kati Mudra technique, you can actually improve your mood and well-being, so you can get more stuff done and have more fun. So one of the biggest problems humanity faces today is this pandemic of obesity, becoming overweight. And there's so many diet crazes out there, and there's so many different exercise courses and routines for helping people to lose weight. But there's breathing techniques you can also use that can help you improve your metabolic fire, the inner fire, and also to help lose excess body fat, especially around the waist. And that one from pranayama, we call Kapalabhati. Kapalabhati is amazing, 'cause not only has studies shown that it can help you reduce, eliminate, excess body fat, but what it can also do is increase your digestive fire, and it can also help cleanse bad gases from your gut. So you're going to get a tutorial that teaches you this technique that you can use in your day-to-day life to improve your digestive fire. If you're somebody who is suffering from weight gain and obesity, this is going to be an amazing technique for you. So your practice for today is to first measure your Breath Hold Time. As always, this is a daily recurring task. Then we're going to continue doing the reduced breathing exercises after the Breath Hold Time. This is also a recurring daily task. So pick the one that you like, and at least do one of those techniques each day in the morning. Then check out the Dosha test that we've got for you which will teach you your energy profile according to the Ayuverdic system. This is going to give you some amazing aha moments, and it's going to transform your life because you're going to start following the right lifestyle for you. Then you can check out our amazing techniques that we've got for helping you lose weight and improve your digestive fire if that applies to you. But you can also refer back to the other pranayama techniques and start implementing them throughout your day. And finally, eat mindfully. Every day from now on, chew your food; be conscious of your food; don't talk while you eat; eat slowly, and this will absolutely transform your life. Because when you eat mindfully and you really love and enjoy your food, magic happens. You actually improve your digestion dramatically, your well-being, your mood, your emotions will go up, and you'll start to love your food and enjoy the process of eating much more. So can't wait to see your results with this. I'll see you in the next lesson. Peace.

LESSON 5: Additional video - Demonstration: kapalabhati

- Sit comfortably with your back straight in an upright position and place a stopwatch in front of you so you can see it. Now, perform Kapalabhati to the beat, one every second. So, forcing the air out through both your nostrils while sucking in your abdomen and then allowing your inhale just to fall back in gradually and naturally with no force. Repeat this 60 times for 60 seconds, and then take a deep inhale through both your nostrils. Breathe all the air out through both your nostrils, and then let your head drop forward. Your chin touches your chest to create a neck lock, and then hold your breath, being completely relaxed until you feel a strong urge to breathe. See if you can override the first urge to breathe, becoming more and more relaxed. And then when you feel a stronger urge to breathe, then you can take a deep inhale through both your nostrils and then make a humming tone. This completes the sequence. According to the rules of the exercise, do not use your mouth to inhale, and only force air through your nostrils, and let your inhale completely relax with no force or control. The main emphasis on this technique is on the forced air through your nostrils.

LESSON 6: Achieve Deep Restful Sleep
--------------------
<v ->Hi, it's Niraj.</v> And in this lesson, we're going to talk about sleep, quality of sleep. That's right. So sleep has a huge impact on the quality of your breathing, and the quality of your breathing also has a huge impact on sleep. Just like diet, your sleep is an important lifestyle factor for healthy breathing and for longevity and peace of mind. Now, you see with sleep, a lot of people talk about lack of sleep being a big issue. Well, did you know that also too much sleep can also be a serious issue for your health? So we're going to talk about the science of sleep, what helps us get really good quality sleep and why things like oversleeping, just like overeating, can be so detrimental to your sleep. So first, let's talk about melatonin. Melatonin is the sleep hormone. It regulates sleep with a circadian rhythm, and it's also one of the most powerful antioxidants. So we need to create a lifestyle that supports the production of melatonin 'cause without melatonin, you can't get a good night's sleep. So here are some things that you can do to start improving your melatonin production from today. Number one is to dim your room and make sure you sleep in darkness because the circadian rhythm requires you to actually have a period of light and dark. And it's that contrast between light and dark that is the sleep-wake cycle. And that's what signals your pineal gland to start producing melatonin. That's right. Some people actually wear glasses, these red glasses, which shuts off blue light. Blue light, which comes from artificial light sources, is horrible for melatonin. It actually stops melatonin production. So shutting off blue light is a good idea. That means making sure there's no sources of artificial light in your room before you go to sleep. So one good tip for you is to use candles rather than lights before you go to sleep, especially if you need to, like, say, read a book or something, or you need to do something before you go to sleep. But here's another tip for you because if you're actually doing stuff that's stressful such as trying to study for an exam or you're reading news updates on Facebook and things like that, that's actually making you stress. This is also going to shut off your melatonin production. So try and minimize any activity before you are preparing for sleep. Sleep before 12:00 am. This is going to really help to ensure you're going according to the circadian rhythm. And also, don't overeat before you sleep. This is a thing that I find as really strange in the Spanish culture. They love to eat very late and even drink lots of wine, but alcohol, actually, really disrupts the production of melatonin and affects your quality of sleep quite seriously, actually. So there's many studies that support this, but also heavy food before you go to sleep will actually mean you overbreathe, you hyperventilate, and you turn on stress. And stress is something that's going to really affect the quality of your sleep, okay? So, but everyone's unique; everyone's individual. Some people can handle it better than others. So you really want to find out what's the right lifestyle for you when it comes to when you eat your food, your last meal of the day. But as a general rule, if you're going to eat heavy processed foods or things like cheeses that are heavily processed, lots of dairy-type foods, that's really going to impact the quality of sleep. And in fact, there's a whole thing, where cheese itself can give people nightmares. You may have heard of that: they're saying, and you may have actually experienced that yourself, but one of the reasons is because of the digestive process required to break that cheese down and the byproducts of that metabolism can actually give you funny, weird dreams. Okay, so be mindful of what you eat before you sleep. The cool thing is that we can actually use some very simple techniques to actually switch off stress and improve the quality of our sleep. So I've given you another version of our Daily Dose, which is a guided relaxation journey, which you can do before you go to bed. And this revolves around rhythmic breathing, okay? 'Cause when you breathe in a rhythm, just that coherent breathing actually tunes you to the circadian rhythm and improves the quality of your circadian rhythm. And this also turns off stress because when you breathe in a rhythm where you double your exhale time, you actually switch on the parasympathetic. So with just a few minutes of rhythmic breathing with a doubled exhale time, you will actually feel relaxed, calm, and much more easy to go to sleep in that state. I've also provided you with Mind Restore. This is one of my most popular hypnotic audios, which I call Trypnosis. This Trypnosis technology combines hypnotic voice with guided imagery and guided meditations which actually programs you during your sleep to wake up feeling like you've had the best night's sleep ever and also actually tunes your brain, your unconscious mind, to have good healthy habits. So you make more mindful choices the following day. It's an amazing technique. You got to test it out yourself to see how this magic works. And this is done in combination with my dear friend, John Vincent, who's a very, very esteemed hypnotherapist. And I think you're going to absolutely love this 'cause the way the music works with his voice is very trippy; that's why we call it Trypnosis, but it actually improves your ability to produce melatonin 'cause it brings your brain wave states into the low theta and delta brain waves which is the brain wave state that actually will help you release melatonin. And the cool thing with Mind Restore is that you can do it with or without headphones because if you're sleeping, you don't want to have your headphones in your ears. So you can just press play; let it run. It's an hour long, and you can just fall asleep with it. That's right. Or if you feel like you need to switch it off, that's fine too. But the best thing with this is that it actually works while you sleep. That's the magic of this Trypnosis technology. And if you find any of these tools helpful for your sleep, then use them every single night from now on. So we talked about all these things that can improve the quality of your sleep, but did you know that you can actually oversleep? That's right, so you can have a lack of sleep, but oversleeping can also be very harmful to your health. One of the reasons why is because of this phenomenon of morning hyperventilation. Did you know that most heart attacks happen in the morning between 4:00 am and 12:00 pm? That's right. One of the reasons for this proposed theory is morning hyperventilation. We breathe much harder than we need to, and we produce cortisol early in the morning. And yogis actually who really train in these breathing techniques for long periods actually need much less sleep. In fact, some of the famous yogis who live up in the Himalayas only sleep two hours a night. They think that sleeping is a waste of time and that that time could be used for exploring consciousness. So actually, we're not going to talk about becoming superhuman yogis just yet, but what we're going to talk about is the problem of oversleeping. If you are somebody who wakes up early, at like, say, 6:00 am, fresh, full of energy, then don't try and go back to sleep because someone told you, "Oh no, you need at least eight hours sleep at night." All right, because you may not need as much sleep as other people. This we can find out from your Ayurvedic energy type. Certain energy types like the vata energy types are much lighter sleepers. They don't need as much sleep. Pitta energy types need steady and consistent number of hours, like at least five to seven or eight hours every night. And same thing with kapha, they're the more deeper sleepers. They need more long, deep sleep. But the vata types are more light sleepers, and they actually may wake up much earlier than most people, full of energy. But one of the problems is if you go back to sleep in the morning after you're already awake, you actually can start hyperventilating in your sleep, breathing very hard, and this can really affect your health. And actually, yogis try and wake up earlier, but you don't need to really force yourself to wake up superearly, like 4:00 am. If you can wake up when you wake up without a loud alarm clock waking you up and making you stressed first in the morning, that's the best, waking up naturally when you feel like you need to wake up and not then just trying to go back to sleep because someone told you you need eight hours. Because have you ever tried that where you woke up and you felt fresh and awake, but then you thought, "Oh, I haven't slept enough, it's still dark outside." And then you go back to sleep. How did you feel when you woke up after that, the second time? Usually, it's really hard to actually wake up, and you need loads of coffee, and you're sluggish for maybe hours afterwards. This is because your entire metabolism's been disrupted by this issue of morning hyperventilation. And the hormonal system gets messed up. If you wake up, alert, and then try and go back to sleep, it messes up your melatonin and your circadian rhythm. So it's really good idea to find out what's the right amount of hours for you 'cause we're all unique and individual, and not oversleep. This is a serious problem for your health. And what you're going to notice as well is that if you didn't sleep very well at night, your Breath Hold Time is going to be shorter than when you've had a really good night's sleep. And also you're going to notice, as you do these reduced breathing exercises and all these techniques that improve your Breath Hold Time, you're going to need less sleep. That's the magic of becoming optimized with your breathing. The amount of sleep you need at night to feel refreshed and rejuvenated will be less because your body's functioning at its best every single day. Now, some of the issues that people have that really affect quality sleep is things like sleep apnea and mouth breathing and snoring during sleep. So there's some extra tips you can do to prevent things like sleep apnea from happening, where you hyperventilate a lot during your sleep and also even holding your breath. So, do you have periods of hyperventilation and holding your breath to a point where you wake up, like, in your sleep because you've held your breath too long. So sleep apnea is something that really affects a lot of people, but it's a symptom of bad breathing habits and mouth breathing and hyperventilation during the day. So what you'll notice, if you're somebody who suffers some sleep apnea, then our techniques and reduced breathing exercises, improving your Breath Hold Time, may reduce the issues of sleep apnea at night. But some additional things you can do is use mouth tape. That's right, you can tape your mouth. There's an amazing product called MYOTAPE which you can put around your mouth that stops you from mouth breathing during your sleep. And just doing that may actually improve the quality of your sleep dramatically. And you actually may have a whole new lease of life just by putting on tape at night. And taping your mouth would even improve your Breath Hold Time. So try it tonight. If you're somebody who mouth breathes at night, if you're a snorer, use the tape; try it; see what happens and report back. I love your feedback. So you may already be getting improvements with your Breath Hold Time. And in fact, did you know that your Breath Hold Time is also a measure of how easily and effortlessly you can fall asleep? So if you had a Breath Hold Time of less than 20 seconds, it's much harder to get to sleep at night, especially if it's 15 seconds and below. But as you start to improve your Breath Hold Time from 30 to 40 seconds and beyond, you're going to find it's much easier to just fall asleep. People who have 60-second Breath Hold Times and above actually just can fall asleep in seconds on command 'cause their mind is so under their control. And you may already, just by improving your Breath Hold Time, be finding that your sleep has improved naturally as a result. So again, measure your Breath Hold Time first thing in the morning. This is a recurring daily task. That's right. Then you can continue doing the reduced breathing exercises in the morning and remember to mindfully breathe throughout the day as well. This is a recurring daily task. Always remember to breathe in through your nose, never in through your mouth. So finally, tonight, you can actually test out our powerful breathing techniques and hypnosis techniques for falling asleep effortlessly; that's right. So we have the SOMA Breath Guided Relaxation audio, and we also have the Mind Restore Trypnosis audio technology. In fact, you can use them back to back. So start with the SOMA Breath Guided audio first. This gets you into the right state to fall asleep effortlessly. And then you can actually play the Mind Restore Trypnosis session afterwards and even fall asleep with the dulcet tones of John Vincent tonight. But it's up to you. You can even choose just one or the other, depending on how much time you have. The choice is yours. But I love your feedback, so please report back. So much love and positive energy for today and to having the most restful sleep you've ever had. Peace.

LESSON 6: Meditation: Mind restore hypnosis

- Do not listen to this while driving or using machinery. If you have any medical conditions or are in doubt, ask your doctor. If, for any reason, you need to awaken during this process, you will do so with all the resources you need and clarity of mind to attend to the situation. Welcome to the Peak Power Hypnosis session for deep restorative sleep and healing bliss. Take a moment before you relax deeply into trance to make yourself comfortable, and, as you relax deeply into this hypnosis session, there will be changes. Now, before you go into trance, close your eyes, if you haven't already, and take a deep breath in. Hold that breath. Relax, and breathe out. Take another deep breath in. Hold, and as you breathe out, notice the feelings of release and relaxation. And notice the most relaxed part of your body, and give it a color. Imagine that color spreading up to the top of your head and down to the tips of your toes, right up to the top of your head, out to your fingers, toes, enveloping your whole body. Relax; relax; relax. This hypnosis experience guides you into a hypnotic trance state designed to offer you the best state to relax your mind and body, to make the small and to make the massive, pervasive changes of behaviors and attitudes and the other changes, the shifts in belief, solid foundations for a new you. While the suggestions that are beneficial for you to become relaxed and ready to enter the deep and restorative sleep now integrate deeply inside. You can relax and go deeper, into the eyes-closed trance of your unconscious, and allow, behind closed eyelids, the experience to become vision. Feeling the hypnotic suggestions helps you to first relax and then focus your unconscious processes in a more functional and positive way. Inside you, streamlining and optimizing for a peak state of deep sleep and regenerative growth. And the more that you start to more and more direct the thoughts you think and realize the thoughts you have are thoughts that you create. You can create, can't you? More and more thoughts, in an optimized, peak state, for sleep and healing bliss. For deep, healing sleep. You can have increased levels of deep healing bliss, as you sleep and dream, that can spill over into your waking life. Relaxed and fluid thoughts that you need in some of the most focused states. Now, relaxing the muscles inside. And allowing your thoughts to drift away. Deeply into trance. With you relaxing now, and in other situations that it's appropriate to, being more fluid of mind and lucid of thought. Be more relaxed about letting stress and stresses out of your body. And mind. More and more, each and every time you listen to the Peak Power Hypnosis session for deep relaxation. And each and every time that in the future you change to be more, and the more you become more, the more there is. More of you in the universe. And the more of you that shines through, the more of the world that you touch, the more you shine with it. Resonate with it. And things that are in mind your beliefs that are positive and support you and your well-being. And while also changing the beliefs and the habits that don't support your health and well-being. Now, unconsciously, making more room to focus on what is optimum and optimizing the rest. And the rest that you give your body by entering into deeply relaxed states is letting go of tensions and noticing relaxation more. And drifting into trance. And out of trance, into a deep and relaxing healing hypnosis and sleep. Deeply. So that the next, the deeper, restorative effects occur more easily and leaving you feeling rested and restored, changing, where appropriate, situations, and moving forward so that you are happy to accept more relaxation. Insight. Insight onto these new areas of your life. You will benefit from deeper relaxation from you. Sleep now. Making this the soundtrack to your sleep more and more increases the deep sleep and healing benefits of restorative sleep, more and more, and increasing the situations where it makes a difference. Makes a difference to you. Now. Inside this trance and in the sleep you go into each day, become more beneficial. Because you do do that. And because, when you sleep each day for hours, your unconscious can be processing the thoughts of the day that help you in every way. And thinking as well as controlling all your autonomic responses, your unconscious is responsible for the production of millions of new cells each second. Your unconscious is capable of so much more than you know, and the more you know to focus your unconscious powerhouse of resources that your unconscious mind is and align with your other unconscious desires that you know are better for you and your immune system, boosted by both the nutrition you take into your body and the thoughts you have. Both, together, are restorative. Deep sleep and healing bliss are more and more activated by you, simply by imagining turning up your immune system, and having your unconscious mind and your other unconscious mind focus on the system you have to become stronger and more optimized for your protection. Increasing its performance and restorative healing abilities to a level that is safe and appropriate for you. Just like motivation is important in certain areas of your life, so is a fluid, relaxed, effortless motivation, and the more that you become motivated and effortlessly engaged in motivated behaviors to make changes to your eating and drinking that are more harmonious and better for your health and well-being. And being well is also supported by a positive immune system. It's supported by healthy eating and drinking and healthy thoughts about life. And a direction to go in, of goals to achieve, because the balance of relaxation reaches into your life, more and more in situations that you find yourself laughing at and feeling relaxed about surprises you. Or when you notice, noticing them in the future, as you more and more effortlessly draw towards the goals you have along your journey. And along that journey boosted, it can be counted, your positive thoughts greatly helped by the relaxed attitude to life and the changes in your habits and behaviors that you make. And you unconsciously make changes to become more relaxed. And when the time is right, you're more motivated, creative, happy, confident, and more, while journeying on through your adventures on planet Earth. Enjoying more and more. Sleep. Deep sleep is restorative and something that you have experienced, times of deep and refreshing sleep. Sleep. Sleep. But during, your unconscious was busy doing things that support you, that are about more effortless success. And effortlessly enjoyable, wonderful experiences. And experiences are the deep, wonderful, restful, regenerative sleep; are experiences of deep sleep that you have had, and can have, in the future, and deeper, refreshing and revitalizing experiences again. And doing that is replenishing and refreshing, and that supports you and makes you able to do more. And have more experiences. And that means it's a good idea to do that. It's something that you can do, and if your unconscious had any objections, the creative genius, solution-finding, programming part of you can find solutions and ways to at least let you experience more refreshing, relaxing, replenishing deep sleep. To see how you perform better or simply have more replenishing experiences of sleep, each week, you notice the accumulative benefits to you and the compliments from others that support it. Now. You create, from your thoughts and the things you consume, including the air you breathe, fresher air. For a healthier input of energy. Billions of atoms of energy as you breathe in. Energy that powers you, along with the thoughts that you receive from others. More and more, only accept the positive thoughts, and reframe in your mind the negative thoughts that others have as a commentary on the quality of their experience of the world, while you spend more time with the people and following the people who are more positive and make your life shine, so you can shine more and make others shine more, too. Everything is interlocked, and your levels of proper hydration impact you and your function and, in turn, impact the quality of the experience you have. More good nutrition and exercise that is right for you and water that is fresh and tastes good, as it quenches your thirst and replenishes your body. So as to be optimally relaxed and refreshed. Now, you can imagine looking back in the days and months ahead, and noticing you being more relaxed and clear-minded, able to respond, focus, and able to laugh at the things that, in the past, used to cause states of mind and body that, in the past, used to cause states of mind and body that are not like relaxation and clear, lucid thought. Now, the more you allow the feelings of relaxation to grow deeper inside, you can feel deeper relaxation inside and bring more balance and harmony to your body, your mind, and your unconscious. Now, you become increasingly able to think clearly. And to feel relaxed. And able to work more efficiently because of your deep, refreshing, restorative sleep today. And the more the tensions leave your body, the more balance and harmony you have in your body and mind. Because your mind affects your body, and your body affects your mind. Know that when you sleep, you can relax and release the tension from your body. And you know that if you relax before sleep, you relax into sleep. Feels good. And releases endorphins that make you feel wonderful. And relax deep now. Your mind affects your body. And your body affects your mind. Know that when you sleep, you can relax and release the tensions from your body. And you know that if you relax deeply before you sleep, deeply relax into sleep, feels good and releases endorphins that make you feel wonderful. And relax deep now; as you relax more and more, your thoughts relax, become effortless, and direct your unconscious to streamline your regenerative, restorative, deep sleep. And your body's abilities to renew itself. As it does each time you sleep more effectively because it's possible to relax more effectively, and so you can, as you drift deeply now. Tensions and stresses slip away. And if it's right and safe for you to make changes so that your thoughts relax, and the things that used to hold you back and slow you down, because of the indecisions and stresses, conflicts and tensions, all slip away now, and allow you to rid yourself of those. While another part of you, if it's safe and appropriate an activity for you to do, focuses on creating new and positive habits of success, as you enjoy and have more to share. And the more that you listen to relaxation, feel the relaxation, and enjoy the experience of the feelings of relaxation flowing over you, the more you listen to this and enjoy the benefits of listening to these sessions regularly, the maximum transformation. And the more that you can see yourself taking time for yourself to relax and to relax your mind, the more you will be able to experience the imagination, the feelings of relaxation. And the letting go and doing more, that will cause you to have more relaxation in your body. And mind. As you enjoy your life now and you welcome the things in that relax your mind, more and more, into a fluid, happy thinking center. And calmly, in a more resourceful place, you can operate better to bring you what you do want your life to be. Breathing in energy from the universe. And using more of it to make you relaxed and feel good now. Calmness increasing and spreading all over your body can relax deeper and deeper and replenish and revitalize. The toxins are expelled from your system, and the more that you can plan to replace them with healthy, life-giving energies, from the air you breathe to the food and drink you consume, and the more that you eat, drink, and breathe in a healthier way, the more that your physical self comes into balance. And a relaxed state of harmony. Blissful. Awareness of deep relaxation, giving you a chance to be repaired and restored. Relaxing, giving your mind and body the chance to replenish and restore itself now. Relaxation is something that you can enjoy more of whenever you like in life and is something that the more you choose to enjoy, the more you will find it's something that happens now. Into trance. Letting go. Letting go. Feeling deep bliss. Feeling deep bliss. Your mind will just drift away. Deeper. Deeper. You relax. Now. You relax. Mind. Body. And soul. You relax. Mind. Body. And soul. Floating. Drifting. Sinking. Spiraling into deeper and deeper pure pleasure and restorative, deep sleep. Deep relaxation. Relaxed thoughts. Sublime feelings. Feeling sublime. Feeling sublime. Letting go. Letting go. Feeling deeply.

LESSON 7: Increase Your Vitality Through Intermittent Hypoxia
--------------------
<v ->Hey, it's Niraj, and welcome to this lesson</v> where we're going to go deeper into intermittent hypoxia and the power it has to elevate absolute every area of your life. All right, so if you've wondered why yogis go and live at the top of mountains or why people like Wim Hof become superhuman and why yogis and Tibetan monks are able to melt ice, well, this is what you're going to learn today. And we're going to explore how you can use this technique yourself to improve your longevity and to create a peace of mind. So, first, what is intermittent hypoxia? Well, intermittent hypoxia means a brief period of low oxygen. And we're talking about intermittent hypoxia in your blood for this lesson. So what that means is that with certain techniques, you can actually lower your oxygen for a brief period for like a minute or two, and this creates a positive stress response on your body. So think about this. What happens is when you reduce your oxygen intake for a brief period for the right length of time at around 60 seconds and 90 seconds, your oxygen saturation starts to drop, and you can use a device like this, a pulse oximeter, to measure this. You may have seen this because in COVID times, these become very popular to measure hypoxia, but we are going to use hypoxia in a therapeutic way, controlled, intermittent hypoxia. We're not using it to cause any harm or damage the system. We're using it in a way which actually strengthens and nourishes the system. So what intermittent hypoxia does is it actually tells your body for a brief period that you're running out of oxygen and that we have to prepare for low oxygen environment. So think about this. If you're going to run out of oxygen, what's your body going to do to prepare? You're going to need more blood cells, and you're going to need better blood flow around your body, especially in your brain and your heart, and you're going to also need to prepare by creating more oxygen reserves and storage in your body so that if you run out of oxygen next time in the future, you're prepared for it. That's right. This is just like doing any technique that creates a little bit of a stress on your body 'cause that stress leads to strength. That's like going into a sauna, which is intense heat or like going into an ice bath, which is intense cold. This shocks the system and makes it grow stronger as a result. There's a saying that goes, "What doesn't kill you actually makes us stronger," all right? So with intermittent hypoxia, you're actually making your brain think that you're running out of oxygen, and that's when your body adapts and becomes stronger as a result. And this creates strength; it creates resilience to stress, and it also helps you slow your breathing rate down and have less need for oxygen. So it's a very powerful technique for improving your Breath Hold Time and slowing your breathing rate down. So intermittent hypoxia has numerous health benefits, and studies have shown that it can actually help prevent and treat chronic diseases such as diabetes, heart disease, degenerative brain diseases and even some cancers. Intermittent hypoxia also provides you with a very easy way of producing more energy on demand and improves dramatically your fitness and stamina. In fact, many athletes use techniques to produce intermittent hypoxia to improve their physical performance. Intermittent hypoxia, in the right way, with the right dose, can also help you sleep better, have less stress, less anxiety, and I believe it's the number one biohack for living longer with peace of mind. And why it's so powerful anti-aging? It's to do with stem cells. That's right. You see, stem cells hate oxygen. So if you lower the oxygen levels just for a brief period, we actually wake up stem cells out of circulation. That's right. And these stem cells have the ability to turn into any other cell in your body, so they go to areas where there's inflammation and where growth and regeneration needs to occur, but they can also go into the brain, and with the right guided meditation, you can actually direct neurogenesis and actually improve the health of your brain dramatically. So how do we create this amazing state of intermittent hypoxia? Well, let's go to the history of how intermittent hypoxia was developed as a therapy which led to the development of intermittent hypoxic therapy which is now found in clinics all round the world, using machines. But first, it began with the Mexican Olympics. In 1968, athletes were breaking records left, right and center. Scientists wanted to figure out why this was happening. You see, the Mexican Olympics were done at high altitude, and athletes were going up training at high altitudes and where the oxygen levels are much lower. And when the oxygen levels are lower, where you go from sea level up to a high altitude, you create a brief period of low oxygen. And as you acclimatize to that, you adapt to that lower oxygen environment. You become stronger, fitter, healthier, with more stamina. And that's why athletes were breaking all these records, all right? So that then developed intermittent hypoxic training where they use machines to simulate high altitude training. But these clinics are limited because, firstly, they're hard to find, and they're very expensive to do. So imagine if you could just do it by just breathing the right way. Well, that's exactly what the yogis discovered thousands of years ago in pranayama. In fact, the most revered technique of all is breath retention, Kumbhaka. So the original text of yoga are called the yoga sutras, and in the yoga sutras, there is a translation of a technique discussed in there called Nisshesha Rechaka. And Nisshesha Rechaka translates as hold your breath slightly beyond the comfort zone after full exhalation. That's right. But how do we get to that point where you can hold your breath slightly beyond the comfort zone? Well, somehow, the yogis knew that when you breathe fast, you breathe out CO2. They may not have called it carbon dioxide back then, but they knew the principles of breathing. So when you breathe out CO2 by hyperventilating or breathing a little bit faster than you normally would for a few minutes or 20 to 30 reps, repetitions before you go into that breath retention, that CO2 release means that you can hold your breath now longer than you normally would be able to. And when you hold your breath longer than you normally can, when you get to around a 60-second to 90-second Breath Hold Time, this is when your oxygen levels in your blood starts to drop. And that creates this beneficial state of intermittent hypoxia where you have to hold your breath slightly beyond the comfort zone. That's right. So yoga does not really talk about intermittent hypoxia or this pranayama technique very much. And in recent times, this has become revived. So you may have heard of the Wim Hof Method. Well, actually, it's a very similar technique to Nisshesha Rechaka, and it creates the same positive stress response. That's the mechanism of how that technique works, and that's why Wim's a real-life superhuman. He's actually a friend of mine, and I actually produced a soundtracks also to the Wim Hof Method audios in his courses. However, what I wanted to go was a bit deeper into the Nisshesha Rechaka technique by actually modeling what free divers do. You see, free divers do very slow rhythmic breathing before they go into the breath holds, and that allows them to hold their breath even longer and to be able to swim for long periods of time underwater, all right? Which is amazing. And I found that what it also helps you to do, if you're not swimming, you're doing it on land as we would normally do with our SOMA breath meditations, is allow you to go into deep states of meditation. That's right. While the rhythmic breathing, slow rhythmic breathing, entrains you to also have slow, smooth, rhythmic breath. But what it also does is it creates the state of heart coherence. And then that has its own additional benefits but also allows you to then hold your breath for long periods of time safely with no stress. And it acts like a defrag switch for your mind. With our special proprietary music, it takes you into these deep brain wave states where it clears the clutter of your thoughts; it acts like a defrag for your operating system, and you wake up feeling more refreshed and clear after the technique. So that brings us back to our SOMA Breath Awakening Technique which you'll find in our Daily Doses. This is what I believe the most powerful way and most effective and efficient way to create a state of intermittent hypoxia safely and with the most ease. So if you have been testing out the Daily Dose I've provided for you during this course, you may already be experiencing some of the benefits of intermittent hypoxia. It's one of our most powerful reduced breathing exercises as well, and it should improve your Breath Hold Time dramatically and also give you that fitness, energy, and stamina and the ability to concentrate that you've been looking for. So with intermittent hypoxia and done in the right protocol, we can actually go deeper and deeper into this state of meditation. And in the rest of this Quest, you're going to start doing more powerful Daily Doses and then moving into our awakening experiences, which these journeys take you into Breath Hold Times of 90 seconds and beyond. And when you get to 90 seconds and beyond Breath Hold Time, you really start to wake up the power of these endogenous stem cells. You really create a dramatic awakening effect, getting a dramatic blood flow going into your brain, awaking dormant parts of the mind, improving the power of your intuition, the strength of your pineal gland, the kundalini awakening that we've been talking about. And what will happen is you'll start to release the SOMA within, the bliss molecule, that will make you feel absolutely amazing and ecstatic. So now you're going to learn how to measure that state of intermittent hypoxia using a pulse oximeter. So you get pulse oximeter, and you put it on your finger. That's how it's designed to work, and it measures the level of oxygen in your blood. It's called your SpO2. And you'll see that even just a tiny sip of air, your blood is fully saturated, 98 to a hundred percent with oxygen. But then the magic happens when we hold our breath after a period of rhythmic breathing with mild hyperventilation, and you hold your breath after the exhale. When you hold your breath with no air in the lungs after full exhale, you'll see that around 60 to 90 seconds of that Breath Hold time, your oxygen level starts to drop. So you'll go from 98% down to 96, 95, 94 and then when it goes below 90%, that's when you're in that state of intermittent hypoxia. What you should be able to feel during this time is that euphoric feeling, this kind of rush sensation of energy building up from your abdomen and your spine. The idea is to really tune into that feeling 'cause that's the feeling that you're going to get when you know that you're in that state of intermittent hypoxia. That means you don't need to rely or use this machine to tell you when you're in that state. You can just do it naturally from your own feeling. So here's your practice for today. First thing as always, measure your Breath Hold Time, and you should really be seeing a dramatic improvement in your score of your Breath Hold Time. But if you're not for any reason, it may be because you did something the night before that disrupted your sleep, affected the quality, or it may be that you're not following the practice as prescribed. So go back and repeat things, and make sure you're doing exactly what I'm saying 'cause it really will improve your Breath Hold Time dramatically. It's just a natural result of these breathing techniques. So then remember to do reduced breathing exercises. These reduced breathing exercises are really important. They're going to help you to improve this Breath Hold Time. And then, you can pick one of our additional Daily Doses that we provided for you. They have different guided meditations for different intentions that will give you intermittent hypoxia in a safer and more effective way than anything else out there. All right, much love, positive energy. Peace.

LESSON 7: Meditation: Morning gratitude daily dose

- Welcome to Soma Breath Meditation for morning gratitude and motivation. This guided breath meditation combines three of the most powerful transformational techniques of breathwork, therapeutic music, and visualization techniques into one sequence. It's using the power of gratitude, as an intention, to produce ecstatic states of motivation and success right from the start of your day. This will supercharge your day so you can flow towards success effortlessly. All you need to do is follow along with the simple instructions, breathe to the beat, and let the magic unfold. Sit comfortably with your back straight in an upright position, or lie down on your back with your arms by your side and your legs out straight. Now bring your awareness to your breath as you breathe in and out. That's right. And then take a deep breath in, and squeeze every single muscle in your body. And then release; ah...the sigh of good feelings. That's right. Coming back to normal breathing. And now bring your awareness to an intention of gratitude, of becoming aware of a time when you are truly grateful for being alive, for being this human on this incredible experience called life. Imagine there's a movie playing in your mind's eye, and project that movie out where you are the lead character doing whatever it is that makes you feel truly grateful. And for a moment now, just embody this feeling, this sensation of deep gratitude. How would it look? How would it touch? How would it taste? How would it feel? Make it real. Bring it into the present moment as though it's happening right now. And now bring your awareness to future moments when you'd feel so grateful if you had completed one task that perhaps you've been holding back. Make it in the near future, perhaps next week or in the following months, where if you were to complete this task, it would also give you feelings of deep gratitude. Project this movie out in your mind's eye by turning the dial on the channel on this movie set in your mind's eye to this future moment, and begin to embody those feelings of deep gratitude as though they're happening right now. And notice how this vision expands as you breathe in a rhythm throughout this breath journey. So let's begin. Three, two, one, exhale. And in two, out, two, three, four. Breathing in and out. Making sure your breath is in a smooth, consistent, and coherent rhythm, like an ocean wave. Out, two, three, four. In, two, out, two, three, four. Turn up the dial on those good sensations, imagining you're breathing in gratitude, breathing out love and all those good feelings, good sensations. That's right. In, two, out, two, three, four. In, two, out, two, three, four. In, two, out, two, three, four. In, two. If there was a color that represented our feeling of gratitude, what would it be? Notice the location of that color in your body, and every time you breathe in and out, imagine this color is radiating around your body, filling you up completely with this color of deep and absolute gratitude, appreciation for life. That's right. Out, two, three, four. In, two, out, two, three, four. In, two, out, two, three, four. In, two, out, two, three, four. In, two. And as you breathe in and out, imagine these feelings of deep gratitude are expanding into every single cell of your body. In, two, out, two, three, four. Healing and nourishing and rejuvenating you and energizing you with those good feelings, good sensations of deep gratitude; that's right. In, two, out, two, three, four. In, two, out, two, three, four. In, two, out, two, three, four. Feeling expansion throughout your body as you wake up all of your blood vessels, feeling a tingling sensation growing inside your body. In, two, out, two, three, four. In, two, out, two, three, four. In, two, out, two, three, four. In, two, out, two, three, four. In, two, out, two, three, four. In, two, out, two, three, four., In, two, out, two, three, four. In, two, out, two, three, four. In, two, out, two, three, four. In, two, out, two, three, four. In, two, out, two, three, four. In, two, out, two, three, four. In, two, out, two, three, four. That's right, getting ready In, two, out, two, three, four. to take in that deep breath, a full inhalation; ready, breathing in, squeeze, and then breathe all the air out, and hold your breath after full exhalation. As you hold your breath, you go into a moment of deep relaxation and inner peace as life is just a series of inhales and exhales. As you hold your breath, you press pause on life, and you go into a moment of deep relaxation which allows the thought paths to reassemble, clearing the clutter, like pressing the defrag on the operating system of your mind, giving you a sense of freedom, clarity, and joy with peace of mind. And when you get that strong big urge to breathe, override that first sensation to breathe; take a little sip in, and then breathe all the air out, and keep holding. And bring your awareness to those good feelings, good sensations, noticing those warm tingly sensations of all that new energy, fresh oxygen flooding into every cell of your body, activating you at a cellular level. As you go deeper and deeper into your mind, enjoy that bliss. And when you get that big, strong urge to breathe, count down in your mind from 10 down to zero, slowly, when you start to feel that energy building up in the base of your spine, around your abdomen. That's right. It's when we step slightly out of the comfort zone that the real growth happens. It's like a metaphor for your life. For you to grow in every area of your life, you need to go slightly beyond the comfort zone and create strength. So when you get that big, strong urge to breathe, only when you get that big strong urge, breathe in, squeeze, and release with the tone. And then coming back to normal breathing until the next round. So let's get ready to breathe in beats. In, two, three, four, out, two, three, four. In, two, three, four, out, two, three, four. In, two, three, four, out, two, three, four. And you may feel tingly sensations around your body. This is the energy and electricity building up, charging around your body as the oxygen starts to saturate. And then your red blood cells transport this vital oxygen around your body, sending this energy into every cell of your body. In, two, three, four, out, two, three, four. In, two, three, four, out, two, three, four. That's right, supercharged. All this new energy. Pull it in. That's right. Because you are amazing. You are a miracle. You already have everything you need to receive, infinite love, health, wealth, abundance; all yours. Just open your heart. Open your mind to connect to the white light within us. This is who you truly are. That's right. Out, two, three, four, in, two, three, four. Out, two, three, four, in, two, three, four. Feel the joy. Feel the passion. The body. The feelings of success and abundance. In, two, three, four, out, two, three, four. Step in to who you truly are, who you deserve to be. In, two, three, four, out, two, three, four. In, two, three, four, out, two, three, four. Breathe in gratitude, and breathe out love. Make your intentions clear. And embody this future moment where you experience the greatest joy, the greatest liberation, knowing you are on the path, the mission, to where you want to go, where you deserve to flow as you grow, become one to all that is. 'Cause you are amazing, a miracle; you already have everything you need to receive. Just open your heart, and let that love fall in. That's right. Creating adherence from your heart to your brain, expanding the field of electromagnetic radiation from your heart. Imagine this field is growing and growing; breathe in and out, amplifying your connection to everybody and everything. One, two, three, four. That's right; feel the joy. Feel the passion. Embody that feeling of success and abundance. Step in to who you truly are, who you deserve to be. In, two, three, four, out, two, three, four. Become one with that moment. That's right. Keep going; keep breathing; keep connecting. In, two, three, four, out, two, three, four. As you breathe in gratitude and breathe out love, make your intention clear; embody this future moment where you experience the greatest joy, the greatest liberation, to know that you are on the path, the journey to where you truly want to go and deserve to flow, as you grow to become one to all that is. In, two, three, four, out, two, three, four. Because you are amazing, a miracle of life, and you already have everything you need to receive. Just open your heart, and let the love flow. And now, take a full, deep breath in. Squeeze, and let go with full exhalation. Letting go all of that remaining air, and then hold your breath. Going back into that moment of absolute stillness, the deepest, most profound states of meditation as you connect with the essence of your soul. Imagine that all of this new energy is penetrating every cell of your body. The soma supercharging with your future, aligning your inner world to your outer world, to your truth, taking you into absolute states of flow as you go beyond what you thought was possible. And when you get the first urge to breathe, override the first sensation, and then take a little sip in, and exhale, and hold your breath, and go deep. As you go beyond the comfort zone, just slightly, this is when the strength grows, expansion, the magic, when you turn the impossible into "I am possible." And then when you feel that really strong sensation to breathe, count down in your mind, 10 to one. Push slightly beyond the comfort zone until you feel that strong energy building up in the base of your spine and your abdomen. And then breathe in. Send the energy up and up and up like a spiral of electric blue-white light, all the way up, and illuminate your midbrain to this higher power as you hold your breath and hold, sending this energy up, becoming a transmitter of your intention, like a command out to the universe. Squeeze and release with a tone. Come back to normal breathing, and allow your breath to just be free, however it wants to be. That's right. And imagine this white light is radiating all through your body, sending this information to your higher self to bring you in absolute alignment with your mission. You will move forward with a newfound sense of heightened energy, heightened awareness, and inspired thinking. As you become activated, take forward this energy and this feeling of gratitude and love and enthusiasm for life wherever you go. And notice how it rubs off around you, like a butterfly effect. That small change within can make a big change out into the world and beyond. And notice as you vibe with this higher frequency, you begin to attract the people, the tribe, that is at your wavelength, helping you and supporting you forward in your journey, your mission in life. Much love, positive energy, peace.

LESSON 8: Achieve Intermittent Hypoxia with Anaerobic Exercise
--------------------
<v ->Hi, it's Niraj, and in this lesson</v> we're going to talk about intermittent hypoxia through physical exercise; that's right. So, previously we talked about intermittent hypoxia through your blood, lowering your oxygen levels for a brief period in your blood, but now we're going to talk about lowering oxygen levels for a brief period in your muscles. So that's what intermittent hypoxia stands for, lower the normal oxygen levels. And when we use exercise in the right way, we can create a whole heap of different benefits for your health and your stress levels and your mental performance just through the right type of exercise. So how do we create intermittent hypoxia through physical exercise? Well, first there's two different types of exercise, anaerobic or aerobic. Now, aerobic is the one that we are quite well aware of usually, which is like aerobics; you've probably heard of aerobics where you're doing like some kind of dance routine. Maybe you've been to a Zumba class; that's an aerobic exercise, or long cardio workouts, running marathons; that kind of stuff is aerobic. Because what you're doing is you're continuously getting oxygen supply to your muscles, tissues and joints. But the problem with that is that you don't really train for strength and resilience to stress. The reason why it's 'cause it's like riding a bike with stabilizers. If you want to get really good at riding a bike, you got to take the stabilizers off, and in this case, the stabilizers is oxygen supply. When you take the stabilizers off, i.e., shut off the oxygen supply for a brief period, you actually stress the muscle for a moment, and that creates this brief period of intermittent hypoxia, lower than normal oxygen in your muscles, in your joints and tissues. And this creates strength; this is the mechanism. So, your body adapts to that low oxygen environment; you produce more growth hormone; you increase stem cell production, and all of this leads to actually increasing the myoglobin which is the energy reserves of oxygen, and glycogen which is another way fuel is stored in your muscles. You improve the quantities of these, making your muscles more resilient to stress and less fatigued so they can last longer; therefore, you get more endurance. So how do we create this? Anaerobic exercise, where we shut off the oxygen supply for a brief period, or very intense physical exercise, like weight lifting, or high-intensity interval training. And what that is doing is taking the stabilizers off the bike, 'cause you're shutting off the oxygen supply. And when you do that, that's when your body adapts, becomes stronger, more resilient to stress. You'll live longer, be happier, and actually have a much better experience of life and any physical performance you do, you are going to have the edge over others who don't do anaerobic exercise. So let's go deeper into the benefits of anaerobic exercise, and there are many. An anaerobic activity, like resistance training, actually increases the strength and density of your bones. So many studies are supporting this. It also promotes weight maintenance, so it can help you lose weight and stay in shape, increases power; this is why power lifters use anaerobic exercise to win their power-lifting competitions. It boosts your metabolism, increases lactic thresholds, so you don't get that burning pain when you're exercising, so it increases your endurance. It fights depression; it reduces risk of disease, and it even protects your joints. So, if you want to live long, if you want to live happy, free of pain, you want to start doing anaerobic exercise from today. So here are some examples of anaerobic exercises you can start doing from today. So just to recap, anaerobic exercises are exercises and movement techniques that require short bursts of intense energy. And here are some examples. So this includes weight lifting, jumping or skipping, sprinting, any high-intensity interval training exercises, riding a bike intensely at full speed or riding uphill. And also I'm going to share with you very superefficient and powerful anaerobic exercises you can do using just your body weight, where you don't need any additional tools or equipment and you don't need to even go to a gym. You can do this from the comfort of your own home. So the first set of exercises we call functional isometric training, and is inspired by the work of Bob Hoffman who many years ago wrote a book called "Functional Isometric Contraction". And this was a series of exercises that he developed by studying Russian power lifters, 'cause at that time the Russian power lifters were winning all the competitions, and he managed to get backstage access to find out their secrets, and he realized that they were doing an exercise completely different to what they were doing in America. And that involved not just using weights where you are constantly moving dumbbells up and down like this or pushing weights up and down like this; what it involved was actually static contraction where you are pushing against an immovable object. So when you push against an immovable object with maximum effort, so like some extremely heavy weights which you would never be able to lift but you just push against them, and you're trying to move them, with maximum effort you go into this contraction where you shut off the blood supply to your muscle, and you create this state of intermittent hypoxia in your muscle and joints. And what this does is it actually creates strength and resilience to stress. So what this way of exercising does is it dramatically improves strength and resilience to stress directly in the muscles that you are exercising. It improves the mitochondrial function, it actually wakes up stem cells in the area, creates strength and resilience to stress and an increase in the energy supply to that muscle, joint, tissue and bones. This is the way to create absolute power and strength. Actually, Bruce Lee, did the same kinds of workouts as Bob Hoffman was talking about, and, you know, he is famous for that one-inch punch where he has so much power in his punch, he can make a person fly from one side of the room to another; it's because he does functional isometric training. And there are a series of exercises that I've given to you in a tutorial where you can actually do this with nothing but your own body, all right? So I'll give you one example of it; I call it the prayer push where you put your palms together like this, you breathe in through your nose, breathe out, and squeeze with maximum effort for around 12 to 15 seconds. You don't breathe in or out during that time. And this dramatically improves strength, and it's something you can do at any time during the day. You don't even need to go to a gym, and you don't need to buy any extra stuff, and it's free of charge. So, there's no excuse to give this a go, so check out the tutorial that I've provider for you which gives you a routine with extra exercises. And you can also look up functional isometric training, if you want to go deeper into this, 'cause I know you're going to get so much benefit from this way of exercising. The second series of exercises I've given to you are powerful anaerobic exercises you can also do also with just your body. You don't need any additional gadgets, toys or go to the gym. And this is where you exercise with the absence of oxygen. So, if you take one example, push-ups, which we are all aware of, how to do a push up, well, if you do push-ups whilst holding your breath after exhalation, that is a very powerful anaerobic exercise. So you can actually count how many reps you can do with the first attempt, and then you'll see every day that you'll be able to do more and more reps. And this is a sign that you are improving with this anaerobic exercise. And then you can apply this to any type of body-weight exercise, from squats, lunges, to even step-ups and anything you can think of where you're using your body weight. And remember always to breathe in through the nose and never in through your mouth during any of these exercises. And I've given you an additional routine which you could follow that will give you a Daily Dose of intermittent hypoxia through anaerobic exercise to your whole body, exercising all of your muscle groups. This is a really powerful and effective way to exercise. I know you're going to love it 'cause it takes a few minutes to do; it's not like a long boring workout or anything like that, and now we have no excuse to get some exercise in our day. So what you're going to notice from doing all of these exercises is that your Breath Hold Time is going to dramatically start to improve, as you raise your CO2 tolerance and actually improve your oxygen efficiency as a result. So, your practice for today is going to obviously be measuring your Breath Hold Time first thing in the morning, and see from tomorrow onwards as you start to implement anaerobic exercise into your routine, how your Breath Hold Time starts to now steadily increase and improve. Remember, this is a recurring daily task, so make sure you do it first thing every morning. And then you can continue doing any of the reduced breathing exercises we've given to you, including the Daily Doses, and you can now start to bring in anaerobic exercise into your morning routine. You're going to feel more energized; you're going to have more energy to get stuff done in the day, and you're just going to feel more alive. That's the promise of doing these special exercises. So an important point about aerobic exercise is that it's actually not all bad, all right? In fact, you should do a little bit of aerobic exercise at least once a week 'cause that helps you stay flexible, nimble and loose. And it's a good way to also exercise and keep your joints and tendons nice and relaxed. However, if you do do aerobic exercise, let's say you do jogging or running, you must always remember to only breathe through your nose. And if you do intense exercise, never breathe in through your mouth, okay? Ever, if you get to a point where you're gasping for air on your inhale through your mouth, that means you went too far, and that's actually going to cause extra stress on your heart, all right? You know, it's quite common knowledge now that athletes suffer from heart problems because of that intense exercise that they do, and one of the primary causes of their heart issues is that they overbreathe and breathe through their mouth. So, avoid mouth breathing during exercise where possible. I want to give you a little story of something that just happened on the break, right? We just went on a little lunch break, and one of our crew members, he went for a jog, and he came back to tell me something because he actually used to be a mouth breather. He used to be a mouth breather, but I said to him, "Never breathe through the mouth again if you can," and he actually during this exercise that he just went on made sure he only breathed through his nose. So let me just actually call him in 'cause it's really fun, and I want to just get his side of the story. So, Audios, tell me, what just happened, man? <v ->I just ran 10 kilometers.</v> <v ->10 kilometers.</v> <v ->And I breathed just through the nose for the first time.</v> <v ->And how did it feel?</v> <v ->I could run another 10.</v> <v ->There you go.</v> And would you be able to do that before if you were breathing through your mouth as usual? <v ->No, no, no, I usually when I breathe through the mouth,</v> I sweat a lot and my shirt is sweaty; I'm tired, and right now I'm full of energy, and, yeah, I could go another 10. <v ->Amazing, brother.</v> <v ->Thank you.</v> <v ->Thanks for taking my advice.</v> <v ->Thanks for giving it.</v> <v ->Okay, speak soon, brother. Peace.</v> So there you go, all right? Try this yourself, okay? Test this out yourself; next time you exercise, try and exercise only through your nose. You can breathe out through your mouth, but never breathe in through your mouth. And if you get to a point where you're having to breathe in through your mouth, you've gone too far. So that's a little gauge for the level of intensity you should do when you are exercising. So, much love, positive energy; can't wait to see you in the next lesson.

- [Narrator] Take an inhale, then an exhale. And then on the inhalation, holding your breath, pull down from the top of a cupboard with one arm with maximum effort for around 10 to 12 seconds, and then repeat the process with the other arm. And you can also do both arms together at the same time. Take an inhale, then an exhale, and take a full inhale, and now tense your abs as tightly as possible for around 10 to 12 seconds. Take an inhale, then an exhale. Now holding your right elbow with your left hand, try and pull them apart while taking a deep inhalation and holding your breath for 12 seconds, and really apply maximum effort in pulling them apart. Then repeat the process on the other side. Take a breath in, and then a breath out. And now, try and lift up your chair while sitting on it, with maximum effort, whilst holding your breath in for around 10 to 12 seconds. Take a breath in, and then out, and then take a full breath in and hold your breath in, whilst pushing your left fist against your right hand for around 10 to 12 seconds, with maximum effort. Then repeat the process on the other side. Sitting in a chair, inhale, then exhale, then grip both your fingers with your left hand over your right hand, and try and pull your fingers apart, and hold your breath in for 10 to 12 seconds. And pull apart as strong as you can with maximum effort, then repeat the same process with your right hand over your left hand. Do this exercise while sitting in a chair: bring both your hands together in a prayer pose; take a deep breath in, and then out, and then in again, and hold your breath in while squeezing your two palms together as hard as you possibly can for around 10 to 12 seconds.

LESSON 8: Additional video - Demonstration: powerful anaerobic exercises

- [Instructor] Find a place where you can do squats, lunges and push-ups whilst holding your breath. Hold your right earlobe with your left hand and your left earlobe with your right hand. And breathe in; breathe out, through both your nostrils; hold your breath, and do as many squats as you can whilst holding your breath. And count the number. When you feel you can't do anymore squats, just come back to normal breathing. You can also extend your exhale with a smooth exhale and a slight inhale in order to calm your breath down and calm the rhythm of your heart down, back to rest. Then, you can perform the next set of exercises. And now, perform lunges. Raise both your hands to the sky, and take an inhale through both your nostrils; exhale through both your nostrils; hold your breath, and start to do lunges forward, with your right foot first, then your left foot, one after the other, making full lunges, where your knees are almost touching the ground. And do as many of these lunges as you can, as you feel a strong urge to breathe. And then, come back to normal breathing. Use the extended exhale technique to slow your heart rate down back to rest, before performing the next exercise. And now, perform push-ups. Breathe in and then breathe out through both your nostrils, and hold your breath, and count how many push-ups you can do whilst holding your breath, until you feel that strong, big urge to breathe. Then come back to normal breathing, and this completes the sequence. You can also do an easier alternative to push-ups by just kneeling on the ground and using your arms to do the push-ups only. Count how many push-ups you do for this sequence. What you'll notice every day practicing this technique is that you'll be able to do more reps gradually, and you'll also have shorter recovery times between each exercise.

- And follow along with this breath meditation that'll give you restoration and rejuvenation to every single cell in your body. Filling you with abundance of positive energy for the day ahead. This is also a time, a moment, where you can set an intention for something you want to call in. Perhaps you've got something you want achieve this day or the next day. Set your intention by visualizing this event as though it's happening right now. As if you've already done whatever it is you want to achieve right now. Imagine those feelings, and conjure up those emotions as you do this next meditation. Lie down on your back in a comfortable position with your arms by your side, where you'll not be disturbed. Bring your awareness to the area in your body that needs healing, and give this area a color, maybe dull, a dark color. And as you breathe, in a rhythm, imagine you are breathing out this color and turning it into a bright white light. That's right. Now, bring your awareness to your breath, and get ready to breathe in a rhythm. And as you breathe, in and out, imagine every single cell of your body is becoming aligned with the highest power, with the healing white lights. That's right. In, 2. Out, 2, 3, 4. In, 2. Out, 2, 3, 4. In, 2. Out, 2, 3, 4. In, 2. Out, 2, 3, 4. In, 2. Out, 2, 3, 4. In, 2. Out, 2, 3, 4.

LESSON 9: Build Strength with SOMA Breath Yoga
--------------------
<v ->Hi, there.</v> Niraj, and welcome to this next important lesson on SOMA Breath Yoga. So, here we're going to learn a traditional yoga routine which actually helps you increase your longevity and cultivates this peace of mind. In fact, the point, the goal, of yoga is Chitta Vritti Nirodha, which means bring tranquility, peace, to mind. But there is a big difference between mainstream, modern yoga and traditional yoga, which we must be aware of. So the difference between mainstream yoga and traditional yoga is that most mainstream yoga styles like Vinyasa flow, for example, which is very common, you actually do each exercise aerobically, so you're moving from one pose to the next, okay? What this means is that your muscles are constantly moving, and you're constantly getting blood supply to those muscles. However, this doesn't build strength and resilience to stress in the same way as traditional yoga does because traditional yoga is actually an anaerobic exercise, where you're holding each pose to the maximum effort and you're doing it with breath control, so you're actually reducing the oxygen supply to the muscle. And, you're doing it under what's called static contraction, okay? So a yoga pose in a traditional yoga asana, you're going to hold the pose. And for example, if you just contract your muscle like this, what happens is you shut off the blood supply when the muscle's under contraction, and then the muscle's forced to use the reserves that it's got. And this creates a state of intermittent hypoxia, lower than normal oxygen, and this creates a cascade of positive effects, where you get more blood vessels forming, you get myoglobin, glycogen forming, increased reserves of energy, so that your muscle becomes stronger, more resilient to stress. And other poses, actually, you put contraction on the bones, and this further increases the strength of the bones as well. And there's numerous studies now that are out there that support static contraction exercise as the most efficient way to build strength and resilience to stress. This means that you're going to be able to live longer and actually reduce the risk of disease and ageing itself. So, let's talk about this routine I've got for you, which is the SOMA Breath Yoga Routine, which uses the most traditional yoga asanas. And there's only a few; you don't have to remember lots. It's a very simple sequence, but we're also using breath control with each pose. So, the general rule is in yoga, in traditional yoga, when you do a forward bend you breathe out and hold your breath after full exhalation. And then when you do a back bend pose, you breathe in and hold your breath after full inhalation. Okay? So, what that means is that you're actually reducing the oxygen supply to your muscles, tissues, joints and bones, even more. All right? This is what's creating this anaerobic exercise effect. All right? But what will happen is you'll be able to hold your pose usually much longer than you can hold your breath. So, when you're in that pose, you can take a sip of air in and go back into the pose with an extended exhalation. Or if you're in a back bend, you can actually breathe out and breathe in again and hold your breath in. And then you can keep holding that pose till maximum effort, until you can't contract any longer. So you get muscle fatigue, and then you have to relax, okay? So, actually in traditional yoga, it says you must go into each pose with the mindset that you have to hold each pose forever. All right? That's a trick, a mental trick, to make sure you hold it till you can't contract anymore. That's the magic of traditional yoga. That's why it was such an amazing science that they developed so many years ago. However, now science is catching up to back up the benefits of these techniques, which the ancients somehow intuitively knew, thousands and thousands of years ago. But this, in my opinion, is a way more effective form of exercise than mainstream yoga. And since I've been doing yoga this way, I feel so many more powerful benefits, and other people I've taught this to also start to fall in love with yoga, find that they can suddenly become more flexible, they become stronger and more able to do these poses. But maybe like I was, you're intimidated by yoga classes, all right? I don't blame you; like, when you go there, there's all these people doing crazy gymnastic moves. And sometimes it's even difficult to keep up with the instructors, especially in these advanced classes. So, what you're going to love about this yoga style is that actually, you can go at your own pace, you can do it at home, you don't need a class. And the asanas are very, very simple. That's right. And, you're not going to be holding each pose forever; don't worry about that. You're just going to hold that pose for your own measure of what your maximum effort is. So there's no competition; you're just going against yourself. You're not competing with anyone else in the class; you're just competing with your own self and your own ability to hold the pose. And, in this routine that I've created for you, I teach you the core yoga asanas that you need to do, in a logical routine which is easy to follow, and you're going to hold your breath for just eight seconds in this routine. However, if you want to gradually improve with this exercise, what you want to do is add on seconds. So, you can hold for eight seconds; then you might be able to hold for 10, then 12, and you can keep adding on a couple of seconds and keep increasing your breath retention times. You'll see that this will naturally happen anyway, as a result of practicing this regularly and you're going to suddenly get more flexible, stronger and have more energy to do the stuff you really want to do, and have more fun in the day. Have you ever been to like, Varanasi or Kumbh Mela, the big festival where all the yogis come down and show off all of their amazing abilities? Well, you may have heard of the yogis who hold one arm up forever, literally forever, or stand on one leg, literally forever. Well, maybe they took that saying a little bit too literally, that mindset of holding each pose forever. You don't need to do that, all right? In the yoga sequence that I've created, actually, you're just going to be holding your breath until your effort, your maximum effort. The holding your breath forever thing is really just a mindset trick to tell you to hold your breath until maximum effort. Because, actually, you can hold your pose and your breath longer than you think you can. It's the conscious mind that distracts you. And it's what tells you actually, oh, I'm holding it too long or, it gets distracted about something else that's going on around you. But if you can stay focused, stay centered, you'll actually be able to go slightly beyond your comfort zone. I don't mean going into pain. I mean, going slightly beyond your comfort zone, until you get muscle fatigue where you can't contract anymore; you just go into relaxation naturally, but without pain. That's how we do traditional yoga, all right? And this yoga routine that I've created, you're actually going to hold your breath just for eight seconds, all right? And then you'll find, as you're holding your breath, you'll be able to add more seconds to your Breath Hold Times. Naturally, it will increase over time, showing that you're improving with this technique. And before you know it, you're going to be like a superhuman yogi, where you're going to be holding your pose for minutes and minutes, and holding your breath for several seconds or minutes, much longer than you thought you actually could. And when you go to a yoga class, you're going to really start to impress people at your abilities, too. So your practice for today. Well, the first thing we always do every morning, is measure your Breath Hold Time, all right? First thing in the morning. And, remember to do the reduced breathing exercises in the morning because this is all going to help you increase your Breath Hold Time. And I'm sure by now, you're going to be seeing some real improvements with your Breath Hold Time. And when you now add on this extra yoga sequence, okay, our SOMA Breath yoga, all right, you're going to really dramatically start to shift this Breath Hold Time. And this exercise is so efficient, so effective, that it also creates a flood of nitric oxide around your body, and it has many other numerous health benefits associated with nitric oxide. That's why I believe if you were just to do one type of exercise per day, if you just chose SOMA Breath yoga, you'd be getting more than enough exercise in your daily routine. So, give that a go today, and I can't wait to get your results with this. So, much love and positive energy. See you in the next lesson.

LESSON 9: Additional video - Demonstration: soma breath yoga routine

- Welcome to SOMA Breath Yoga Sequence for Beginners. In SOMA Breath Yoga, you'll be holding your breath after each pose in various ways. When doing a back bend, you'll breathe out and breathe in and hold your breath after a full inhale for eight seconds. When doing a forward bend, you breathe in, breathe out, hold your breath after a full exhale for eight seconds. What you'll be able to do is increase the number of seconds every single day as you practice this sequence, and notice how your flexibility and strength and abilities to hold the pose and your breath improves. This is a beginner sequence; however, it will teach you some of the fundamental traditional yoga asanas. However, for this beginner's yoga sequence, you shall be just holding for eight seconds and then gradually building up. To work on this on a more advanced level, you would actually focus on each pose and hold each pose to maximum efforts whilst controlling your breath. You can repeat the number of times you hold your breath; however, you must hold your pose until you cannot hold that pose anymore. But do not cause any pain or stress. Each pose should be with stability and ease and to the point where you cannot hold it any longer, where your muscles have to relax for it to be a proper asana. So let's begin. Point your right hand to the sky, your left hand to the ground, and make a twist, where you're pushing the pressure down on your left foot. Hold for eight seconds. And then repeating on your alternate side. Take a few recovery breaths. And now, place your right foot behind you with your straight leg, and then your left foot lunges forward, and then you arch and stretch your side and hold your breath on the inhale for eight seconds into the stretch. And then repeat on your alternative side. Take a few recovery breaths. And now sit. And place both your feet together, touching, and make it as though you're opening a book with your feet, and your feet are the pages of a book. Breathe in and then breathe out, and hold your breath and stretch forward by bending forward for eight seconds. And now, place your right foot over your left knee, and put your right arm over your left knee, and make a twist and hold for eight seconds, breathing out into the twist. And then repeat on your alternative side, holding your breath after the inhale or exhale, whatever you find is comfortable in order to make the most of the stretch. Now, keep your right leg over your left knee. Clasp your right hand and your left hand together. And then breathe in; hold your breath on the inhale for eight seconds. And then come back to normal breathing, and then breathe out and hold your breath whilst bending forward into the same pose for eight seconds. Now, take a few recovery breaths, and then repeat on the other side. And then stretch and bend forward, holding your breath after a full exhale. And then place both your legs in front of you, out straight. And place your left foot against your right thigh. And raise your arms to the sky. Bend forward. Keep your back straight, exhale, and hold your breath for eight seconds. And now, stay in that same position. Place your left foot to one side, and arch and twist, holding your breath after exhale for eight seconds. And now, holding your left arm on the ground, stretch your right arm up, arching your back, and hold on the inhale for eight seconds. And then repeat on the alternative side. And then take a few recovery breaths. Place both your legs out, stretched in front of you, with your feet curled up towards you. Raise your arms to the sky. Bend forward; exhale fully. Hold your feet with your toes, or touch your toes with your hands if you can, and hold your breath after full exhale for eight seconds. Come back to normal breathing, and lie in shavasana, on your back with your arms by your side, and take a few recovery breaths for several breaths until you feel more calm and relaxed. Now, hold your left knee, and draw your knee towards your nose whilst exhaling into the stretch and contracting. And hold this pose for eight seconds. And then repeat on the other side. Now, repeat the same process but with both your knees. Now, do a few recovery breaths. And then go into a shoulder stand by raising your feet to the sky and supporting your lower back with both your hands, slowing your breath down and even extending your exhale or making an Om sound or a tone whilst holding this pose for eight seconds. Exhale fully, then allow your feet to then generally fall towards your head, but keeping your legs straight, so your feet or toes touch the floor behind you. And hold your breath for eight seconds. And then lie down on your back with your arms by your side for a few recovery breaths. Now, raise both your feet off the ground and your back off the ground, the arms stretched out in front of you. You can also point to your toes. And hold this pose after an exhale for eight seconds. And then have a few recovery breaths. Sit up straight. Take your left foot with your right hand, and try and touch your left foot to your right ear lobe. And hold after exhale for eight seconds. Have a few recovery breaths. Then repeat on your alternative side. And hold after exhale for eight seconds. Now, lie down on your front with your chin resting on both your hands. And take a few recovery breaths. And now, using both your hands, push up, and at the same time, inhale and hold your breath on the inhale, arching your back up and holding your pose for eight seconds. Exhale; come back to resting position, resting your chin on your hands. Take a few recovery breaths. And now, this time, with your arms against the side, with your palms face down, arch your back up, holding your breath on the inhale, for eight seconds. And then go back into recovery position with your chin resting on your hands in front of you for a few recovery breaths. Now, come onto both your knees, and let your arms touch your heels, and stretch backwards whilst inhaling and holding your breath for eight seconds. Have a few recovery breaths on your knees. And now, whilst kneeling, raise yourself up into a semi seated position with your back straight, so you feel the contraction in your quads. And then hold this pose for eight seconds whilst holding your breath on the inhale. This completes the SOMA Breath Yoga Sequence.

Part 3: The SOMA Within - SOMADI

====================

LESSON 10: Unlock the SOMA Within: The Bliss Molecule
--------------------
<v ->Hi, it's Niraj, and welcome to this next lesson</v> where we're using our technique called Somadi, creating the Soma within. So, everything you've done on this Quest is leading up to this last three days of absolute powerful transformation. Where you have now prepared your mind and body to be able to hold your breath for a length of time, which is around 90 seconds where we start to release the Soma within. This is the special bliss molecule which is a combination of different tryptamines that creates the sensation of pure bliss. That's right, and it's released from your pineal gland and drips down into your heart and spreads all over your body. All right. So, how do we get there? Okay, so we are using again, the Soma Awakening Technique, but a variation of it where we're now bringing in some special, magical components to it. First one is, we're going to be actually using vocal toning on every exhale. So, you're going to be breathing in and letting go with a tone, "Ah," like that, or a "Mmm," however you feel like making that tone, but, remember to completely relax with our exhale, and it's going to be rhythmic breathing to a beat again. And, what you'll feel is that you'll start to actually start to feel this bliss sensation building up with every tone you make. And you'll start to get into your own rhythm, and your body will start to take control of itself. And you'll actually flow into your own breathing rhythm even whilst you're doing this technique. So, allow yourself to just go with the flow, whatever feels comfortable, but stay with the rhythm. It's not about the depth, it's the rhythm that's most important on this, and making those sounds and tones actually activates the vagus nerve which is your connection to your autonomic nervous system. Sending signals directly into your nervous system that you're safe, everything's amazing, and you're connected to something higher than yourself. At this point, with enough rhythmic breathing, for long enough duration, we also wake up gamma brain wave frequencies. This is what we've shown in previous studies, but now we have Cambridge University studying this technique right now, showing that this is what's actually going on. So, what happens is we actually quieten down the activity of the ego part of the brain. This is called the default mode network. We quieten that down to a lower brain wave state, and we leave a resulting frequency of gamma. And when you quieten down the ego, what happens is you actually wake up a, another part of the mind, which is this superconscious part of the mind. This part of the mind is tapped into something higher than your physical self. You start to tap into something ethereal beyond yourself. Carl Jung called it the superconscious mind, the consciousness of all living beings on this planet where we can create some divine downloads and have deep moments of inspiration through accessing these higher brain wave states. And so, what this can also do then is allow you to seed an intention powerfully into your unconscious mind. Imagine you're now being the computer programmer, programming your own operating system of your own mind. This means you can actually visualize exactly what it is you want. Perhaps it's a result that you've been wanting to create and call into your life. And you can see it happening as though it's happening right now and draw this into this meditation that you're going to do. And what you'll do is program your operating system of your mind to create that result. It will mean that you will start to make the right decisions and the right actions to create the results that you want, by making an alignment of your inner self with the outer world which you want to create. So, in order to do this we must do it in steps, to make it really safe and effective. So, today is just going to be a gentle exercise to introduce this till you get comfortable with it. Then we're going to add on extra layers over the next two days where we'll then end up with doing a peak experience breath meditation. Where you're going to actually have a connection to something really beyond yourself. That's when we really will begin to start releasing a flood of this Soma within, and this is the Somadi technique that we'll be finishing on. So, what exactly is the Soma within? So, there is this legend in the world's most oldest religious manuscript, called the Rig Veda, which tells a legend, a story, of a time when the ancient Rishis were addicted to a substance which was giving them all of these amazing benefits like immortality, connection to the divine. It was really like some kind of psychedelic experience that they were doing. And they proposed different theories for what this Soma might be. Some historians think it's the Amanita muscaria mushroom, the magic mushroom, that looks like a toadstool with red and white dots, or it could have been a combination of cannabis and ephedra or Ayahuaska. There's many different theories for what Soma is, but, the Soma within has the same active ingredient, or our own human version of it which is akin to DMT, dimethyltryptamine. And dimethyltryptamine is also supposed to be released by the pineal gland before you die and when you have the biggest psychedelic trip of your life every night which is when you dream. But this hasn't been fully measured in the lab, so we can't say it is the same thing as the DMT in plants. But what we do know is that, when people do this practice I'm going to share with you today, people have their own psychedelic-like journeys. But the way I have morphed this technique and adapted it to modern times is using the music, using rhythmic breathing and using the right sort of guidance and techniques; we're doing it in a controlled way, so, it's very difficult to have a bad trip. That's the problem with some psychedelics is that you lose complete control, especially if you get the dose wrong. With this, you're in complete control of the experience, but you're still achieving the same results. You see, in our scientific experiments that we've done, neuroscientists showed that we are creating the same changes in the brain as a dose of Psilocybin, or MDMA used to treat severe depression. That's right, in just, that was just in 22-minute session, we were showing the same changes going on in the brain. But we are now going to do a more powerful session, with an additional guidance and with extra components, that is going to actually elevate this even further and create the perfect brain chemistry for your brain to change according to your will. So, when you come with this with a powerful intention, that intention can manifest. Have you ever heard of sex magic or tantra? Well, sex magic is a secret ritual used by these secret societies, which is manifesting on steroids because they would cultivate sexual energy in a practice, with an intention to manifest and create things in the world. But you know, whether it's for good intentions or bad, we're not quite clear. But the same principles we can apply, but without needing to have sex, we can actually cultivate that life force energy. The sexual life force energy through just breathing and breathing with vocal toning. And also using energy locks and using what's called the Ashwini Mudra, which is the muscles around your sphincter, to draw this life force energy up and release and let go as a pump. So, on your inhale, you pull this energy up; on the exhale, you let go. And that pump actually starts to circulate this life force energy around. Okay. Now what's some of the benefits of this is that we actually quickly create a full-body orgasmic state. All right? And for some people it can happen in just a few minutes; others it takes a bit longer and a bit more deeper practice. And here's the thing. There is a psychotherapist called Wilhelm Reich, who studied under Freud actually, who actually studied sexual life force energy, and he believed that a lot of neurotic tendencies and issues and habits that form later on in people's lives, that cause issues and limiting beliefs and habits and patterns of behavior that are not healthy, can be the result of unresolved sexual energy. Energy that is not cultivated and not used and not released. So, in tantra, tantric yoga, sex magic and the use of sexual energy, and to move it from here, but to circulate around the body and actually to wake it up and not just have it dormant and stagnant, is one of the most important factors in tantra. But it's done in a safe way, in a special way, which can also be used to create magic. That's right. So, what we're going to be doing here today is actually an ancient tantric yoga practice. And you see, this is the practice that the ancient Rishis used to replace their need for the external Soma. And if you think about in this day and age, we have all these external Somas. We have the media. We have advertising. We have TV. We have drugs, pharmaceutical drugs, and we have all these distractions which we get hooked on and dependent on and addicted to to create happiness and bliss. But, when those things are taken away, we get freaked out. We get stressed out. And actually, this is why we're all about cultivating peace of mind, all right? There's a difference between peace and love because love needs a lover. You need a lover to have love, and the problem with that relationship is that, if the lover goes away, it can be very traumatizing. Okay? It can be quite disruptive and can be quite addictive. When you fall in love, it can be quite addictive, and that can also actually be quite disruptive. All right? So, what we talk about is cultivating a state of peace, peace of mind, because with peace of mind if the love goes or comes, you're okay; doesn't matter. You're not fazed by it. So, with this technique, not only can you create ecstatic states, but you can create at the end of it, a state of absolute full-body bliss and peace which is Somadi. That's the state we're going to achieve, and through this, we actually can fall in love with the practice, rather than other things, and, then your dependency and addictions fall away. So, if you're somebody who's addicted to things, and we've seen this with many, many cases of people who have addictions to things like alcohol, drugs and other things that aren't helping their life, that are disrupting their life. They end up falling in love with this practice, cultivating a peace of mind where they no longer need so much stuff, external stuff, to feel happy. And this is really what we're trying to achieve here is to take away your desire and need for so much stuff in your life. When you need less stuff, you're more content and more happy with what you've got. And through that, society becomes better as a result because we're not consuming as much stuff. We're not affecting the environment as much, and we're much more in harmony and balance with nature, with our surroundings and other people. So, this is the real goal of Somadi. So, the purpose of all spiritual practices is to make your default state better. Your state of being when you're not doing any of these practices. So, that means that if we can create, cultivate, a state of peace, peace of mind, when we're not doing any techniques, that's the ultimate quest. And that's why we want to improve our Breath Hold Time 'cause with the Somadi technique and all the other techniques we've done in our Quest so far, they're all going to help you to be able to have a smooth, silent, subtle, rhythmic breath into the diaphragm. And what that means is that your mind is at peace. You're content and your health is at its best. Meaning you're going to live longer, happier, with a more peaceful mind. So, your practice for today is, again, to check in with your Breath Hold Time. Do this first thing in the morning. And now by now, it should be actually at 40 seconds or even beyond. If you're not, don't worry. Just stick with the exercises. You will change. I guarantee it. And then continue doing those reduced breathing exercises and the anaerobic exercises. So, you're starting to create your own perfect morning routine. Then, I want you to bring in this amazing Somadi technique into your life which revolves around our Awakening technique and Somadi at the end. And over the next few days you're going to build this up gradually, to have that big peak experience. So, make some time for your day in your morning to be able to do this technique on an empty stomach. So, make sure you don't do this after having heavy food, okay? If you're going to eat food, do this two hours after you've had food, so you've got enough time to digest your food, and then report back, and let us know how you get on with this special session. So, make sure you check out the audio that we've got for you, and much love, positive energy. See you in the next lesson, and peace.

LESSON 10: Meditation: Peaceful day

- Welcome to SOMA Breath, "Awakening Journey: Average Peaceful World," for awakening that feeling of deep relaxation, tranquility, and peace of mind. This special SOMA Breath journey combines our three-in-one methodology of breathwork, music, and visualization techniques for the most powerful and effective transformation. Do this on an empty stomach in a place you will not be disturbed, with your back straight in upright position or lying down on your back with your arms by your side. Just follow along with the simple instructions and note that with this special breath journey, you should also be activating the life force energy by using energy locks. You do this by engaging the muscles around your anus or the sphincter muscles by drawing them up, contracting on every inhale, squeezing, and then letting go with a sound of good feelings on every exhale. And breathing with no force or strain with the rhythm and groove of the music. Bring your awareness to the sound, any sound that draws your attention in this moment. And notice as you become more and more present with this sound. The voice in your head that worries about the future and gets hung up in the past, gently begins to drift away, fade away, taking away all of the cares and worries and frustrations with it into the background as you become more and more present with this sound. And the sound of my voice shall be your guide on this journey. And now imagine there is a movie playing in your mind's eye. And in this movie, you are being teleported away into your average peaceful day in an average peaceful world. A day that's aligned with your truth, your true values, your true desires. A day which you can live over and over again sustainably. That's why we use the word average, average peaceful day. Because this is a day that's not of extremes, but it's a day you can live over and over again sustainably, comfortably, with contentment and fulfillment, knowing that you're living by your truth and that you are completely content and satisfied with everything you've got because it's in perfect alignment with your true values that bring you peace of mind. How would it feel? How would it look? How would it touch, or taste even, to be living your average peaceful day right now, as though it's happening right now? Where would you be living? Who would you be living with? What would your home look like? What would the world and the environment around you be like? What would you need to change and let go? What would you need to call in? Who would you need to call in? What would you need to do to deserve this average peaceful day in your average peaceful world? Allow your ideas and visions and thoughts to run freely as we breathe together. Know that this feeling of contentment and inner peace will become more and more present and your thoughts and ideas will become more and more vivid and real in this movie projected into your mind's eye. So now, get ready to breathe in beats. Three, two, one. Exhale and inhale.

And then when you feel that very strong big urge to breathe and you feel that energy building, awakening the base of your spine, the abdomen. Take a deep breath in. And send this light all the way up. That's right. Send it up, all the way up, like a spiral of electric blue, white light, up and up and up, pulling up the pelvic floor, the muscles around your sphincter, up, drawing them up. And then letting go with a tone. ♪ Om ♪ ♪ Om ♪ That's right. And just bathe in this ethereal wonder as though you're floating on a cloud, looking above this planet, this average peaceful world that you have created as a vision. And know that you have the power to awaken a state of inner peace on command whenever you wish. And from this foundation of a peace within, we can bring peace to this planet and all things that live together, to be in harmony, to be in oneness. That's right. To be connected and content. So we enjoy this feeling, this big release, and letting go of what doesn't serve you to call in your average peaceful world. Much love and positive energy for your day ahead. Peace.

LESSON 11: SOMADI Intermediate 1: Experience GAMMA Frequencies
--------------------
<v ->Hi, it's Niraj, and welcome to this next lesson in Somadi.</v> So if you've just arrived here, I really recommend that you actually do the previous lessons in this Quest because they're designed to actually build you up safely to enter in these powerful breathwork states you're going to receive today. So what I want you to do is actually test out this next audio track, which is now a more advanced version of the following session that you did; it's going to be faster, longer, and deeper in the rhythms and duration of the breath. You're going to go much deeper into the breath meditation, and you're going to wake up even more of these powerful gamma brainwave states. You may start to get inspirations and divine downloads, so write things down, journal, and all those new thoughts, ideas and visions that arrive from this session are important because they're coming from a higher place; that's right. So your practice for today, again, as always, do your Breath Hold Time; it's a recurring task, by now your Breath Hold Time should have really improved dramatically. And then reduced breathing exercises, some anaerobic exercise; it's a great way to prepare you to go superdeep into this next session. Remember to always do this audio track on an empty stomach; if you're going to do it after food, make sure you haven't eaten food for at least two hours because that gives you enough time to digest and have an empty stomach. Then you can go superdeep into it, all right. I can't wait to hear your results for this; so, much love, positive energy; peace.

====================

LESSON 11: Meditation: Your supreme council

- Welcome to the SOMA Breath Awakening Journey for channeling the spirit of your Supreme Council, your avatar. Imagine that you have the power, the ability to tune in to a higher power and to tap into this higher power by believing, seeing, embodying the characteristics, values, virtues, skills, talents, qualities, which you would like to install as meta programs into your operating system, allowing you to operate at a cellular level. You don't need to know how this works or even believe that it works. It just works. So allow the magic to unfold as you step into this journey into discovery, what it is that you really want, and how to truly embody it. With this special breath journey, you shall be also using the life force energy, activating it by harnessing the muscles around your sphincter, your anus, engaging them, contracting them up , drawing them up on the inhales, contracting, squeezing, and letting go with a sound on the exhale of a sigh of good feelings, just completely relaxing with no force and keeping a rhythmic breathing action with your breath and the contractions of the pelvic floor . There should be no pause as you inhale or exhale. In the second half of this journey, you shall be breathing in a more active, fast-paced rhythm, and then instructed to just allow your breath to come to a natural stop. You won't be forcing or controlling, trying to hold your breath. You'll just allow your breath to come to a stop naturally, easily, and effortlessly. This is samadhi, the breathless state. And when your breath stops in this state for more than 60 to 90 seconds, the soma begins to flood from within, that's right. So always do this on empty stomach, either sitting with your back straight or lying down on your back in a place where you'll not be disturbed. And all you need to do is to completely relax and follow along with the simple guided instructions. Get ready to breathe in beats and completely transform yourself from within. Bring your awareness to the sound, any sound that draws your awareness in this moment. And as you become more and more present with this sound, notice the voice in your head, the worries about the future gets hung up in the past, gently begins to fade away, drift away, as you become more and more present with the sound and the sound of my voice that shall be your guide on this journey, a journey into creating all of the values, skills, talents that you need to program deep within in order for you to achieve whatever it is that your heart desires. To imagine for a moment that there is a movie playing your mind's eye. And in this movie, you are being teleported into an environment where you are sat at a table with a Supreme Council, a council of beings of which each person or avatar embodies the talent, skills, virtues, which you wish to embody yourself. These are your spiritual mentors. With every breath you take in and out, you're going to begin to transmit into you the spirits to the Supreme Council.

- In, two, three, four. Out, two, three, four. In, two, three, four, out.

- That's right, make this vision real.

- In, two, three.

- Play with this image of your Supreme Council, being invited in to their presence as someone who deserves to be at the seat of this table, ready to channel in...

- Two, three, four. Out, two, three, four. In, two, three, four. Out, two, three, four.

- Now, take a deep breath in , and breathe all the air out , and hold your breath after full exhalation. And notice that your mind becomes completely still. And imagine there is now a light from your Supreme Council, beaming down through your crown, the top of your head, illuminating your midbrain with a light of a higher power, which then begins to illuminate the rest of your body, the soma, with the light, that's right. If you feel a need to breathe, see if you can override that first urge. You can even take a little sip in, blow the air back out, continue holding, going deeper. You're becoming alive with divine high power. When you feel this charge building up inside, count down in your mind from 10 down to one so you can go even slightly beyond the comfort zone, that's right. And then taking a deep breath all the way in , and hold . Breathing in and drawing in the light of this higher power, filling you up and up and up, shining out in all directions, radiating, transmitting this higher frequency of thought with every single cell in your body becomes activated, with every single cell in your body becomes activated, the spirit of the Supreme Council. And then release with a tone . And allow your breath to come to a natural stop as you enter into samadhi, the breathless state. Connected to the lights, the source of all things. Become a channel, the higher power. Three, two, one, exhale, and in.

LESSON 12: SOMADI Intermediate 2: Experience GAMMA Frequencies
--------------------
<v ->Hi, Niraj here,</v> and welcome back to this next lesson in SOMADI where we're going to take SOMADI up a notch even further. So if you've just arrived here, make sure you go back and do the rest of the lessons in this Quest in the right order because this Quest is designed to build you up to this massive breakthrough that you're going to receive towards the end of this course. Because I guarantee if you follow exactly what I say, you're going to have the most profound states of ecstasy and bliss you've never had before. All right. So some points with this session, it's going to be a little bit more deeper. There'll be faster rhythms. And to remember to use those tones, and really let go and feel safe, absolutely safe, in letting go when you're making those sounds on your exhale. The more you just relax and let go on the exhale, the more powerful and pleasurable this experience is going to be for you. All right, you can also find you can hold your breath even longer and longer in this session. All right. And you might also find, as there are faster rhythms, you might get more tingly cramping sensations, and it's a good idea to breathe through this. Go through the resistance. When you get to the other side of that resistance, that's when the magic happens and bliss is invited to enter in to the entire body, the Soma within. So your practice for today is, again, check in with your Breath Hold Time. Remember to do this every morning now; make it a habit for life, and then you can follow on with the reduced breathing exercises, anaerobic exercises and then prepare to go superdeep with this next SOMADI breathwork session. All right, much love, positive energy; peace.

In this breath meditation, you're going to also engage the body, move your arms and the motion of your breath. The more you bring your body into the breathing, the more powerful this transformation becomes, and your ability to reach those peak ecstatic states, engaging the pelvic floor through mudra, contracting the muscles around your sphincter with every breath on the inhale, letting go on the exhale, letting go with a tone, a sigh of good feelings, that's right.

====================

LESSON 13: SOMADI Advance: Full Power
--------------------
<v ->Hi, Niraj here, and welcome to Somadi,</v> the full power session. That's right. Now, everything we've been doing up until this point in this Quest has been building up to this moment, the moment where you're going to have an extraordinary experience, a peak experience like none other. So if you've ever done anything like psychedelics before, like mushrooms, many people who do this session report like this is like doing a full-blown mushroom trip. Others experience this like going into an Ayahuasca experience but without any of the horrible weird stuff that can happen and the bad trips that can happen from doing psychedelics. So whatever it is that's your psychedelic of choice, you may find that this one actually is something that becomes more memorable and more powerful than any of those previous experiences. This is the kind of feedback we've received over and over again. In fact, one of our Mindvalley authors, Ben Greenfield, he says that this particular session changed his life completely, and in fact, he created a whole new sense of purpose and meaning for his life as a peak performance bio hacker who likes to dabble in all these kinds of amazing practices. He found that this one was the one that really changed his mindset about what is really important to him. And he started to feel that community was more important, friendship was more important, family and spending time with loved ones and doing time that is more creative was more important to him. Compared to spending hours and hours down at the gym, trying to look like a body-building champion. He realized that the simple things in life, love, connection, were more important than all of those things. So he had a complete ego dissolution. This is something that people say after this session is that they go away feeling like they're a whole new person. And this is what scientists have shown with our technique is that it really quietens down the activity of the ego mind and creates this peak gamma brainwave state which allows you to tap into something higher than yourself and to see yourself with a new light. Now, I don't want to give you too many expectations before you try this session, but I want you to actually keep practicing this beyond this Quest. You can always go back to this. It doesn't mean you only do this once and never again. You can go back to this. You can go back to any of the techniques that have been in this Quest and do them over and over again and create your own routine out of them. But this one in particular is a very powerful session. So you don't want to repeat this every single day. You can do this like once a week or once a month, and you can even make it into a ceremony. You can actually do this with a powerful intention to go superdeep and to create and cultivate the peace of mind that you've been wanting to create. So that's the thing that Ben Greenfield told me was that, actually, he is known for being an expert in longevity and bio hacking, but he realized that this also gave him a peace of mind. And that's what we want. We want to cultivate a peace of mind because through peace, we can actually be in control of our life much more and be able to accept all of the things, the stresses, that life throws at us and not get so aggravated by them and so triggered by them. When we can let go of some of these triggers and aggravations, and when we can accept ourselves, and the world as it is more, and this is a regular best practice that you need to do. Even I struggle with this sometimes but by doing practices like this, you can get more in touch with yourself, realize more about who you truly are, and make the right decisions for yourself in alignment with your truth. Because your truth comes from tapping in to the inner layer of your being, not the many layers of conditioning that have built up over the years of your existence from any early age where all of these imprints form that creates your identity. With one single session like this, you can peel away all those layers and let go of things like hate and grudges from the past. Let of go attachment to old stuck emotions, and resolve all traumas and emotional blocks that have been holding you back. And circulate this life force energy, this energy of creativity, of the ability to create magic in your life. And you can circulate this, wake this up and actually embody it with this one practice. And this then becomes a celebration of life, your existence and all the things that exist in this experience of being alive on this planet today. So some points to bear in mind for this session. As it's an hour long, you're going to be doing more intense breathwork. You may get even more of these tingling, cramping sensations and pain developing, but just breathe through that resistance. Don't worry if at some point where it gets too much, if you really feel you need to stop, it's okay, but you can carry on doing the session again the next day, following day, and start to repeat this until you get through the whole session with ease. That's when the real magic happens. All right, so you're also going to wake up a lot of this life force energy, and this activation, also as you're sending this energy up to the third eye, to the pineal gland, is going to create a deep activation of the third eye or the pineal gland, which will release a flood of this Somadi down into your heart. Now, here we may activate some special powers of the mind, deep intuitive powers of the mind, because our brain is like a layered brain, three different layers. So in the core of the brain is the reptilian brain. In the reptilian brain, we have actually a lot in common with reptiles and birds in nature. This deals with our sense of awareness in the world. And reptiles and birds, they have like a sixth sensibility. They can spot danger miles away. They can see the back of their heads. And they have this intuitive power. In fact, reptiles can control the autonomic nervous system. And you may actually wake up these dormant abilities because what happens is when you get layers of brain forming, we exercise out this intuition that we have as children, this creative imagination because of the education system, because of this left brain culture we're in, working in very robotized careers and professions. So when we tap back into the core part of our brain, the brain stem, the reptilian brain, and we wake this up, that's why we call this the awakening, we can have a full-blown Somadi awakening experience which awakens us to our deeper intuitive powers. Now, this might not happen for everybody. For some people, this will be very effortless; others, it may take time to develop. But some of the things you may look out for are very deep levels of intuition where you can really feel empathically how someone's feeling and know what's the right thing for them to do. You'll be able to also sense danger in a room much more easily. So you'll have like a radar for what to look out for if you want to stay in your high vibration and not get taken into the wrong path. You'll also have a deeper understanding of yourself and the things that are good for you and what are not good for you. You'll also start to feel like you're bending reality. Vishen loves to talk about bending reality and creating the reality according to you, your truth. Well, this is a technique that can accelerate that even more, and when you go deep into this practice, you can actually use this as a magical tool 'cause you can start to use visualization techniques to literally bend reality, create the life that you want by projecting like a movie in your mind's eye exactly what it is you want to call in and making it real as though it's happening right now. So you can use this magic for self-healing; you can use it for manifesting the things you want in your life. And even attracting people into your life. I've done it for attracting the kind of people I want in my life, and it's worked like magic. And they say your vibe attracts your tribe. Well, trust me, when you raise your vibe through this technique, magic really happens. You start to bring in, call in, some amazing, incredible people into your life. And this is the community of high vibe, high and happy people that I want to create where we spread this like a butterfly effect across the world, where we make this world a more happier, healthier and more peaceful place for all. So your practice for today is going to be, once again, measuring your Breath Hold Time first thing in the morning, and making this a regular daily task for the rest of your life. And then you're going to do your reduced breathing exercises, anaerobic exercises, and you can now create that sequence that is going to be right for you to be able to go deep into this next session. So check out the audio we have for you today. You're going to need to set aside at least an hour to do this one audio track. It's longer than the previous sessions. And you want to have no distractions. You'll need to allow yourself to go superdeep and fully into this experience with absolute surrender, with no expectation of what it's going to bring to you. Through that state of no attachment, that's when the divine downloads come. That's when the big aha moments and the moments of deep inspiration can spring forth. So again, write down the ideas, thoughts and visions and dreams that come forth from this one experience, and pay attention to them 'cause they are important. All right, so much love, positive energy. I want to see you in the state of ecstasy. Much love; peace.

Sitting up will help you use the energy locks that will help you harness the power of the Mula Bandha and these energy locks, for further activating the hormonal centers that will help you witness the white light of creation. The white light of your third eye activation. You can also do this lying down if that is more comfortable, and also whilst lying down, you can also use the energy locks, but you may not be able to apply the neck lock. So when you're lying down, the idea is just to be extremely still and comfortable and just go with the flow of the breath and the music without any discomforts. That's right. Let's begin. Now with your eyes closed, bring your awareness to your breath as you breathe in and out, that's right. Now bring your awareness to the music. And as you bring your awareness to the sound of the music and hypnotic tones, try and just be present with the sound and take your awareness away from your thoughts and quiet those thoughts down to silence, where you are absolutely focused on the music alone. As you meditate on just the sound and the music and the tones with absolute stillness and concentration, this is the art of meditation. This brings you close to your subconscious mind. Brings you into the presence of your low alpha brainwave state, and your parasympathetic nervous system. Just notice how you feel more relaxed, more calm as you simply meditate on the sound. So now just take a deep breath, fully in, squeeze, and let go with a sigh of good feelings, letting go of any more tension in your body, becoming more and more relaxed, allowing my voice to be your guide on this journey. A journey to your highest vibrational state. A state where you connect with the divine white light of your higher self, your higher power. We're going to first wake up the soma using the vibration of your voice through vocal tones. And together we'll be singing the chant of om, bringing your awareness to the three tones of om, corresponding to the specific endocrine glands that elicit the hormones, giving you the physiological changes, emotions and feelings that shapes your reality. Bring your attention and awareness to the third dantian and make the tone, ah. And as you make that tone, contract the Mula Bandha, holding that contraction as you make the tone. Now bring your awareness to your heart. The thymus gland responsible for your immune system, and your heart that produces life. Your seat of compassion, empathy, and connection to everything that exists. And this will be activated using the tone of uh. So now fully in . Uhhh Get playful by imagining an image of your heart emitting a white light, as you make this tone. The third sound is a hum, where you'll place your tongue on the roof of your mouth pointing towards your midbrain. And imagine, as you're making the tone, your tongue is vibrating the roof of your mouth with this area where your pituitary and pineal gland are present. You can also enhance this effect with your eyes closed, converging your eyes so that they are also focused towards the center of your forehead, the third eye zone. So making that tone and vibration fully in, . And imagine as you're making this tone, you're projecting a white light out through your third eye, connecting with the future reality that you want to call in and manifest. And now we're going to put this mantra into a sequence. So follow along for a few minutes of om-ing to a rhythm. So imagine each time you're making this tone, that you are breathing in this white light and you're starting to activate through the chant the sexual energy, producing and energizing, harnessing this white light up into your heart and then transmitting through your third eye into a big, giant ball of intention. So as you make this mantra, imagine you are now projecting out into this ball the important steps through a visualization, like a movie of a scene projected into the future, what you need to do next, the next thing you need to do to bring you closer to your average perfect day, the reality of your dreams. That's right. As you bring your inner world in alignment with your outer world, this reality will manifest. So be very, very clear with exactly what it is that you want to call in. So imagine now what it would look like, what it would feel like, what it would touch like, taste like, to have done, accomplished the thing that would make you feel so grateful if you had accomplished it, that is going to bring you closer to the reality of your dreams, to your perfect world, your future, the day that you are going to want to live over and over and over again. That's right. So make this real, make it vivid, see it, touch it, taste it, become it. And as you're making that tone, imagine you're bringing up even more good sensations up through the soma, activating your body to this highest vibration. Wake up the sensations of success, gratitude, love, self-love, passion and joy. Wake it up with this mantra, this tone. That's right. Bring your awareness to a time when you felt really, really good, most ecstatic you've ever felt. A time where if you could make this your default state, you would feel so complete, so grateful. The time when you felt so much bliss, ecstasy, connection and love. Love for yourself, love for everyone else. For when you are so grateful for being born into this life. Witness this in your mind's eye right now. As though you're seeing this playing like a movie in your mind's eye. I want you to imagine right now that you are in that movie, that vision. How would it feel? How would it look, how would it touch, how would it taste? If you could feel that right now, imagine feeling it. Play with that. Become an actor in this movie. Play, experiment with how you would feel, how would it look, how would it touch, how would it taste, to be reliving this moment of absolute gratitude? Notice as you breathe in a rhythm, these good sensations, these good vibrations begin to expand with every breath you take in and out, that's right. You can even imagine that there is a dial on this movie that you can turn up, that will turn up these good feelings. And notice as you turn up the dial, those good sensations expand and feel even more ecstatic, more excited. So let's get ready to breathe in a rhythm, breathe in beats, and as you breathe, turn up the dial even further for those good sensations. Expand and they rise and grow with every breath you take in and out, that's right. Out, two, three, four. In, two, three, four. Out, two, three, four. In, two, three, four. Out, two, three, four. In, two, three, four. Out, two, three, four. In, two. Remember to make that breath smooth, slow and consistent, so there's no pause between the inhale and exhale, like an ocean wave. Out, two, three. And now you can start to activate the pelvic floor muscles with every inhale, letting go on the exhale and letting go with a sigh of good feelings, like an, ah. The sound you'd make when you felt really good. It's a sigh of relief, that's right. Breathing in. And letting go, ah. Out, two, three, four. In, two, three, four. Out, two, three, four. In, two, three, four. Imagine your Mula Bandha is like a pump, drawing up those good feelings from your sex up, circulating this life force energy, the current around your body. In, two, three, four. Out, two. You can even move your body up and down, side to side, with the music, with the rhythm. Out, two, three, four. Pumping the Mula Bandha, drawing up its good sensations with every breath in and out. In, two, three, four. Out, two, three, four. Build up those sensations as you connect to the rhythm, your voice is your guide to the state of this. Out, two, three, four. In, two, three, four. Out, two, three, four. In, two, three, four. Out, two, three, four. In, two, three, four. Out, two, three, four. In, two, three. Move your head from side to side. Rock your body or move it up and down with the music, waking up the soma even more. Waking up that state of ecstasy. In, two, three, four. Out, two, three, four. In, two, three, four. Out, two, three, four. In, two, three, four. Out, two, three, four. In, two, three, four. Out, two, three, four. In, two, three, four. Out, two. Keep breathing, keep breathing in the light. That's right. Now faster. Out, in, out, in, out, in, out, that's right. In, out, in, out, in, out, in, out, in, out, in, out, in, out, in, out. It's easier if you use your mouth to inhale and let go when you exhale. In, out. Move with the music, move with the rhythm. In, out, in, out, in, out, in, out. Moving your arms up and down the body, waking up the ectasy. Waking up the life force, that's right. In, out, in, out, in, out, in, out, in, out, in, out, in, out, in, out, in, out, in, out, in, out, in, out, in, out, in, out, in, out, in, out, in, out, in, out, in, out, in, out, in, out, in, out, in, out, in, out, in, out, in, out, in, out, in, out, in, out, in, out, in, out, in, out, in, out, in, out, in, out, in, out, in, out. Now fully in. Squeeze and let go. And hold your breath. Witness the white lights as you open your heart and let the love pour in. Imagine. Imagine this light is shining through, connecting you to the light within. This is amazing. This is ecstasy. This is love. Bathe in the white light of your higher self. Nirvana. Heaven. Sammati. Moksha. The state of divine ecstasy. When you can't hold your breath any longer, override that first sensation to breathe, pushing past comfort zone, going deeper into the ecstasy. And then when you get that strong urge to breathe, take a little sip in and blow the air back out, going back deeper into that state of inner bliss. As you imagine you're floating on a cloud, drifting into space. And transcend the pains and burdens of life and ascend to states of peace, tranquility. And when you get that real strong urge to breathe, take a deep breath fully in, squeeze, screw up your forehead, shooting up, illuminating your third eye with this white light. That's right. Squeeze the Mula Bandha pelvic floor muscles, pulling up this energy, the sacred life force. And then let go with a chant, ah. That's right and just bring yourself back. And then let another inhale in. Now take another inhale and repeat the chant. Ah. And as you make the chant, draw your awareness to the white light in the center of your third eye. And the center of your mind's eye. Just enjoy those good feelings of a higher vibration. Take a drink of the soma, as you become the embodiment of the soma. Now we're going to get ready to breathe together. Breathe in beats for the next round. In, two, three, four. Out, two, three, four. In, two, three, four. Out, two, three, four. In, two, three, four. Out, two, three, four. In. Repeat the process of waking up the soma. Pumping the life force, the Mula Bandha. Moving the body, the rhythm and move to the music, as you breathe in and out.

Synapse connections to shape the reality. Out, two, three, four. In, two, three, four. Out, two, three, four. In, two, three, four. Out, two. Feel the ecstasy, feel the love, that's right.

The divine ecstasy. And hold your breath. Now go into your breath retention. Open your heart and let the love pour in. Let the light shine from within. The divine white light of your higher self, your higher power. You are the lights, you are the soma. When you get an urge to breathe, take a little sip in and blow the air back out, falling back deeper into ecstasy. And when you get that deep urge to breathe, push past the comfort zone a little bit, maximizing potential of this life force energy. And then harness its power. Take in a full deep breath, fully in. Squeeze the pelvic floor muscles, screw up your forehead and shoot this white light energy, as you hold your breath, up into the midbrain, the seat of your super conscious mind. And hold it. And then release. A sigh of good feelings. And then take a deep breath fully in. And chant om. In, out, in, out. Now we're going to take it to the next level. In, out, in, out. In, out, in. When you get ready to breathe deeper and stronger than before. In, out, in, out, in, out. This is a faster rhythm, so you can use your mouth on the inhale. Move your body. Get with the groove of the music. The more you play and move your body, the more you'll create this new imprint, deep into the architecture of your heartbeats, your super conscious mind. In, out, in, out. The more you'll create positive imprints deep into the architecture of your super conscious mind. In, out, in, out. In, out, in, out. In, out, in, out. In, out, in, out. In, out, in, out. In, out, in, out. In, out, in, out. In, out, in, out. In, out, in, out. In, out, in, out. In, out, in, out. In, out, in, out. In, out, in, out. In, out, in, out. In, out, in, out. In, out, in, out. In, out, in, out. In, out, in, out. In, out, in, out. In, out, in, out. In, out, in, out. In, out, in, out. In, out, in, out. In, out, in, out. In, out, in, out. In, out, in, out. In, out, in, out. In, out, in, out. In, out, in, out. In, out, in, out. Lose yourself into the music. Become one with the groove. Connect to the beats, the rhythm of your breath combined as you breathe into ectasy, breathe into the future. That's right. In, out, in, out. In, out, in, out. In, out, in, out. In, out, in, out. In, out, in, out. In, out, in, out. The more you let go on the exhale, the more you relax, the more you'll wake up the soma, the life force, the divine ectasy. In, out, in, out. Imagine you're moving this life force up from your root into your third eye, activating higher mental faculties to its optimum potential. In, out, in, out. In, out, in, out. In, out, in, out. In, out, in, out, in, out. Feel the ecstasy. Feel the energy. Feel the power of the orgasmic bliss radiating through to the soma, activating into your higher power. Feel the energy, feel the bliss. Feel that ecstasy. Raise your vibration, that's right. Yes, that's right. Feel that beautiful sensation growing bigger, brighter, deeper, harder, that's right. Connect. You are amazing. You are in love with life. Life is in love with you. You can achieve anything you want. You have the power to manifest. You deserve the best. Breathe in the light. Now, together, fully in . Squeeze. And let go. Let go of all the air and hold your breath. Witness the lights as you connect to your higher self, your higher power. This is the evolution of your consciousness. The infinite intelligence of your subconscious mind reveals to you your true place in life. The infinite intelligence of your conscious mind. Hold these ideas as commands to your subconscious mind. Infinite intelligence in your subconscious mind reveals to the true place in life. Infinite intelligence of your subconscious mind reveals everything you need to know at all times everywhere. Success is the fortune flowing towards you in the river of abundance. You attract success and prosperity with all of your ideas. Success and achievement are natural outcomes.

It all comes from within. And you now have a gift, a tool. Power to change your state, your vibrations, whenever you need to. Whenever you receive challenges from life, you can now, instead of giving in, stand up. Just remember you are now a vessel of truth and light in the world. There may be many challenges you may have to face, but remember that you have an amazing community of friends, of kindred spirits that will support you. No competition, only collaboration. No guru, you are the guru as you discover the guru within. By teaching others, you will learn even more about yourself. Spreading the love, you'll get even more love back many times more than you give. So as long as you find a way to spread love in your life, the soma will guide you and direct you. The soma is about the love. The L-O-V-E. The soma is connected to love, the higher spirits. The spirits' breath is love, is life. Life is love. Love creates, love grows. Love expands. By love we mean truth. Sometimes the truth is not what we want to hear, but the truth is more loving. And by understanding your truth and your true will you can truly love. So you will make the highest value of love and truth, being true to yourself, then the love will grow and spread. Om, namaste, peace.

LESSON 14: Your SOMA Daily Routine
--------------------
<v ->Hi, it's Niraj, and welcome to this next lesson</v> which actually brings together everything we've done in this Quest. And it's the final conclusion where we're going to create the perfect SOMA Breath lifestyle. So this is also going to be a summary of everything we've just done today. And what we're going to be able to do is create your own morning routine. You see, our breath meditations and the SOMA yoga techniques are best done in the morning as part of your morning routine. That's right. Because we're talking about longevity. If we want to alleviate the issues of morning hyperventilation where most heart attacks happen, we want to do our practice in the morning 'cause this calms down your breathing and brings it under balance and control, right thing from the morning. So morning practice is great. But then all the other techniques we've been doing such as conscious, mindful breathing, always breathing in through your nose, making sure you chew your food 30 times, counting in your mind, all this conscious activity should be a day thing where you're doing it all day long. Not just for every now and then when you feel like it; these should be a lifelong habit that you stick to. That's how you're going to get the best experience of your life and cultivate that state of peace. Because if you can live long but with quality of life, meaning you're free from disease, you've got strength because you're doing the SOMA Breath Yoga, creating the strength you're doing, the Functional Isometric Training exercises. You are actually doing lots of amazing exercises that builds up your stamina, fitness and endurance. What's going to happen is you're going to get less sick. You're going to get less issues of inflammation. You're going to feel less pain as you age. So as we get older, that's when our body starts to break down. So we need to take care of this vehicle that we've got. And science shows us that all of these practices, especially Intermittent Hypoxic Training, helps you to keep your telomeres the right length because when you're telomeres shorten, and telomeres are like your measure of your age in your DNA. When your telomeres strands shrink, that's when we age. And when your mitochondrial function is disrupted because of intoxicating your body, not living the right lifestyle, doing the wrong things, not having peace of mind, all that stress affects the parts of your body that deal with making energy. And when you get into optimum control and balance of your energy, that's when magic really happens. And you start to get longevity with peace of mind. And with our deeper SOMA Breath meditative practices such as SOMADI, you can actually really start to realize your truth. And when you start to also go deep into the Ayurvedic lifestyle and understand your energy type which is very simple practice, very easy to do, you start to be able to actually create a lifestyle plan that is aligned with who you truly are, your truth. You go after the ambitions and goals in your life that's really aligned with who you are. Therefore we create peace of mind. You let go of pain from the past, grudges; you don't hold onto emotions like hate anymore or anger. You let them go. And you look at the future with optimism. When you look at the future with optimism rather than worry and anxiety, the stress fades away. And that means your default state, the time when you're not doing any techniques, is the best it can possibly be every single day. That's the real aim and the goal of this Quest is to make your default state, when you're not doing any techniques, better. And that means you're not dependent on any other techniques to bring you happiness. You're just in tune with yourself, and you've learned how to take control of the remote control of your mind, body and spirit. So let's recap on Breath Hold Time. So this is the morning activity we've been doing every single day, measuring the state of your health. So if your Breath Hold Time hasn't improved much, okay, go back and have a check, and see have you really honestly been doing every single technique that's been recommended? Have you just been picking and choosing the ones that you feel like doing? Have you really been following this Quest? If you have and you still haven't reached the range that we're looking for, then keep practicing. Don't give up because over time you will improve. However, if you are now going above average, 30 seconds and beyond, hitting 40 seconds and beyond, experiencing those benefits of getting into those healthy Breath Hold Time ranges, then you can really start to enjoy the deeper, more powerful intense breathwork sessions that we have in SOMA Breath. And we actually have SOMA Breath instructors who are trained to take you even deeper. So if you had a mind blowing experience with SOMADI technique, then if you actually hire one of our SOMA Breath instructors, they are trained to take you even deeper and deeper. And they're also trained to coach you on creating and cultivating the perfect lifestyle, plus taking you into peak experiences to really take you to the next level in your life. So you can always hire a SOMA Breath instructor from our somabreath.com website. There's a link here for you to check out. Or perhaps you've now been so inspired that you want to become a SOMA Breath instructor yourself. So we actually have an entire school dedicated to training instructors. We actually really want more instructors to join our community. It's growing at a really fast rate, but the more people we have like yourself going out there inspiring other people, becoming high and happy themselves and making others high and happy around them, then my mission is complete. Meaning, we create this butterfly effect of spreading happiness and bliss and good feelings all across the world. And that good vibration will set off a cascade of good vibrations around the world that will make this world a better place for all. That's really my higher purpose mission with SOMA Breath. But maybe you don't want to become a SOMA Breath instructor or hire one, but you still want to go deeper on our SOMA Breath techniques 'cause you absolutely love them. So we actually have on our website various courses which you can choose to go deeper into. And we actually have a flagship 21-day Awakening Protocol which is our most signature course, which is currently being studied by Cambridge University right now. So definitely go and check that one out. So now let's look at a summary of a perfect SOMA Breath daily routine. So, remember point 1 is always, first thing when you wake up, within the first 10 minutes of getting up, measure your Breath Hold Time every morning, and see how well you're doing. This will tell you how well you did the day before with your quality of sleep and whether you've had any disruptions to your health. Point 2 is after measuring your Breath Hold Time, it's a good idea to hydrate. All right. So we actually get dehydrated during sleep. So drink at least two glasses of good quality water. You can even add some fresh lemon into it and make a tea out of it if you want 'cause warm water's better than cold. Never drink really cold water 'cause it really messes up your digestion. Warm water or hot water, like a tea, is much better. Point 3 after that is you can start doing your routine of reduced breathing exercises. Okay. You can even repeat some of these exercises on an empty stomach several times a day, all right, for around a one- or two-hour total duration. It's up to you. These are very powerful techniques but very safe as well. And then you can also add in here some anaerobic exercise and do SOMA Yoga routine. So you can actually make a total time there of two to three hours of breathwork activity where you are consciously being mindful of your breath and doing some exercise at least for 10, 15 minutes a day, physical exercise, low moderate exercise, is great. But what you should also ensure is that you're not sitting down still for long periods of the day. Every hour you should get up and move; move around. Don't sit stationary for too long 'cause you want to keep your body and blood flow circulating loose as well. 'Cause if you don't use your body, you lose your body. So move it or you lose it. Point 4, be very mindful of your breathing throughout your day. So remember always to breathe in through your nose and into your diaphragm. And now start to look at your breath as a mirror reflection of what's going on in the inside and your emotional state. So remember the goal what we're looking for is a smooth, subtle, rhythmic, diaphragmatic breath that is into the diaphragm. This means that you are calm, collected and at your present state where you're not worrying about the future. You're not hung up on things in the past, and you're physically healthy and fit. This means your default state is better. So remember the aim is to make your default state better. And somebody whose default state is at its best is somebody who presents themselves with smooth, circular, subtle, rhythmic breath into the diaphragm where they hardly look like they're breathing. Remember the Lao Tzu quotes, "A perfect human breathes like they're not breathing at all." This means that you're calm, collected and at your best, present where you are physically healthy and your mind is in balance. So as the breath is the mirror of your mind, be mindful of how you're feeling. Are you huffing and puffing? Are you overbreathing? Or are you calm and collected? So have a think about that during your day; be mindful. And when you start to answer the questions in the morning such as, "Am I waking up with enthusiasm to do a hard day's work, or am I waking up with enthusiasm to be kind of compassionate to other people?" If your answer to that is "No, I feel like I'm just doing it 'cause I have to; I have to pay the bills," or "I don't really like the people around me, but I'm just pretending. I'm faking it just to fit in." That's the moment stress kicks in. You'll start to see changes in your breath and your breathing patterns as well. So this is a time when you need to make a change and go back and figure out what's your truth. What is it that you truly want? That's right. And the breathwork exercises and our more powerful breathwork techniques can help wake you up, shake you up, so that you can start thinking with more clarity. That's right. One of my favorite exercise of all is humming. That's right. So when you're having your break, when you've been maybe talking a lot, like I have been right now, it's a good idea to spend a few minutes just to hum. Or perhaps you have got sick, and maybe you've got a cold or flu. Remember to hum and you produce the nitric oxide. Remember NOSE, NO, nitric oxide. So nasal breathing, humming, is a way to make your own medicine for free every single day. So bring humming into your life, and humming in the sauna is one of the most powerful things you can do. I love sauna as my ritual. It's like going into church. And I go into the sauna and I hum in the sauna, and we even do it sometimes as a group practice, it's like a celebration in the sauna. It's a very powerful ritual that I love to do. And here your powers of manifestation are amplified 'cause you get more blood flow going into your brain, and the sauna's also shown to stimulate the growth of new brain cells. So humming combined with sauna is one of the most powerful meditative practices you can do. And here magic can happen. So I'm leaving you with that final nugget of my favorite ritual which is sauna humming. That's right. Point 6, I really recommend you go deeper into the Ayurvedic lifestyle. Really get to learn who you are. My mantra is know thyself. Through that you can really choose the right lifestyle for who you truly are. And then also go in deeper into traditional yoga. Start to really go deeper on these asanas I've taught you in that routine, and see how far you can go with holding each pose for as long as you can. That's right. That's where the real strength and growth can occur. And then also try and go deeper into figuring out what is it that you really want to do with your life? How can you give back? How can you contribute more in this world? One way of doing that is actually becoming a SOMA Breath instructor. Another way of doing that is to share exactly what you've learned in this Quest, by...you could even just recommend this Quest; get your friends to do this; get them involved with this. Because once you start to get these benefits, it really is your duty to share it with others. Because imagine if you've got lifesaving information, isn't it your responsibility then to get it to as many people as possible? Imagine the gratitude you'd get and receive when you create incredible testimonials in your life. That's what changed everything for me was when I started to get letters from people telling me I had changed their life completely. That is what made my life fulfilling and worthwhile. And I want the same for you. So, much love and positive energy. Peace.

So sit comfortably in an upright position where you'll not be disturbed. Or lie down on your back, in a place where you can be completely relaxed and comfortable. Remember to breathe in through your nose and out through your mouth in a relaxed, rhythmic way with no force or tension, allowing your exhale to be completely smooth with no tension, no force, and with a absolutely relaxed diaphragm. Let's begin. Bring your awareness to the sound, any sound that draws your awareness in this moment. And notice, as you tune into the sound, the voice in your mind, the worries about the future, gets hung up on the past, gently drifts away, taking away with it all the worries of the world. That's right. And now bring your awareness to your breath. As you breathe in, and out... Letting go. On your exhale, the sigh of good feelings. That's right. Becoming more and more comfortable and relaxed. In a moment, you shall hear a count and a rhythm with the music that will become the guide of your breath. And as you breathe in this special rhythm, you will be turning off the stress, turning on relaxation, breathing in through both your nostrils and breathing out through your mouth the smooth, consistent rhythm with no pause between your inhale or exhale, making sure that with every exhale, you just completely relax with no force and your breath on your inhale shall be silent, smooth, and quiet, just as your mind becomes. So now, exhale slowly and fully, getting ready to breathe in a rhythm. Three, two, one. Exhale. And in two, three, four. Out, two, three, four, five, six. That's right.

Bonus Meditations

LESSON 15: Scientific Om Meditation for Stress

- Welcome to scientific om meditation by SOMA Breath. Sit comfortably with your back straight or lie down on your back in a comfortable position where you'll not be disturbed. You can use this simple exercise whenever you are feeling anxiety, stress, or tension as a way to relieve that stress, and anxiety, and tension. So it is good to do this on the onset of those symptoms. So first, begin by scanning your body for the location of tension and anxiety by closing your eyes and just observing where in your body you feel you've experienced the feeling of anxiety. It's quite common for this to be in the upper chest region where you may feel a tightness. Others feel it down in the stomach, gut area, and the abdomen. Or you may experience it as headache and tension in your head. It could also be a combination of all of these three. So for a moment now, just allow yourself to scan the location of this tension in your body. If there was a color that represents this tension, what would that color be? Just see this color in your mind's eye, and notice as you perform the scientific om meditation that with your toning you can actually transmute this color from what most people will see as a dark, dull color to a bright, white light. So imagine that every time you make the tone of om, you are turning this color into the equal and opposite color that you would represent as being relaxation and peace. You may also not see a color, which is okay. So just instead feel what it would feel like to be vaporizing this stress away and releasing this tension with every tone that you make. Each of the three syllables of om correspond to certain regions of the body. The tone of aah corresponds to the lower part of your body, the gut, abdomen, and the region of your sex. The ooh sound, ooh, corresponds with the heart and the middle part of your body. And the hum, humming sound, corresponds with the upper part of your body, the throat, your third eye, pineal gland, and putridity gland. So by simply chanting each one of these tones in sequence, you can turn any darkness, dull color associated with stress, or tension, and anxiety in these regions to a bright white color, the opposite of what represents stress and anxiety to you. And then notice, as you do so, the tension just drifts away and fades away. That's right. So we'll be making each tone in turn after a full inhalation, and then at the end of the tone you can hold your breath on the exhale for 5 to 10 seconds. This will further bring your heart rate down and create a sense of relaxation in your body. If you wish to hold your breath a little bit longer, as you enjoy that sensation, you can do so, as you wish. So let's begin. Breathe in through your nose, let's make the sound of aah, bringing awareness to the lower region of your body. So inhale. And hold your breath. And now let's make the tone of ooh, bring your awareness to the middle part of your body, the region of your heart, chest, and lungs, and observe any darkness intention turning into a bright light of peace and relaxation. So breathe in through your nose, the full inhalation. Hold your breath after making the tone for a few seconds. And then coming back to normal breathing. Now bring your awareness to the upper part of your body, your head and your throat, and notice if there's any tension that remains there, turning any dark color into a bright light. So breathing in through your nose, full inhalation, make the sound of hum. You can hold your breath for a few seconds. Then you can inhale and come back into normal breathing. That's right. So now we can make one long tone out of each one of those three individual tones of aah, ooh, and hum. So it will sound like this. Breathing in through both your nostrils with a full inhalation. And hold your breath for a few seconds. And inhale, coming back to normal breathing. This time as you make that singular tone of om, scan your body for any tension, and notice as you make the vibration, imagine you are dissolving and releasing the tension, turning any dark color into light as you scan the awareness of your body. That's right. So again, breathing in through both nostrils after full inhalation. And now making the tone. And repeat and then hold your breath a few seconds. Inhale, come back to normal breathing. Have a rest for a few seconds and repeat the same process. Inhaling always through your nose with a full inhalation. And now keep repeating the same sequence for as long as you need till you can feel completely relaxed and the anxiety and tension has faded away. By simply breathing in through both your nostrils, the full inhalation into your diaphragm, then making the tones. And now the music shall play on its own for you to be able to perform this scientific om meditation for as long as you wish and need to for the desired effects and results. Much love and positive energy for the day ahead. Peace.
