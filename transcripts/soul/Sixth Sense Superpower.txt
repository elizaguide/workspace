Preparation 1: Welcome to your Sixth Sense Superpower
--------------------
Hi, I'm Sonia Choquette. I am an intuitive guide, and I've been doing this for a long time, over 40 years. And I'm really happy that you're here with me today because this is going to be a life-changing adventure for you. The first thing I want to acknowledge is that the fact that you're even here at this point, engaged on the threshold of this big Quest, tells you and it certainly tells me that you are dialed into your intuition. It's what brought you here. It might be very vague, and there might be a lot of questions about, I'm not so sure what's this all about, which we'll answer. But before we do that there's a wonderful Chinese saying, "The way it begins is the way it ends." I will mention this frequently. And the way it began is you're here. Your intuition brought you here. So let's address all the reservations that you might have before we even get going. The first is what is intuition? Fair question. And on the most practical level, on the minimum level, it's the part of you that fills in the blanks and gives you insight and direction where your five senses can't, where you're caught in a situation where there is no logic to guide you, where there is no five sensory kind of input. For example, like if you were in the middle of the country at night and your car runs out of gas and you're at the fork of three roads, which one do I take? Well, that's where intuition comes in. This one might take you to the closest gas station. This one might take you to an even deeper black hole in space. This one might take you to trouble. So do you see, there are times in life that it's not predictable and where our five senses fail to inform us fully. And your intuition comes in and says, never fear I'm here. On the higher level your intuition is the gateway to your most authentic self, to your superself, to your spirit, to your greatest potential. It's the gateway to the life and the expression and the beingness of who you really are. It is the ultimate self-empowerment because it guides you in a way that transcends everyone else's control and influence. So it's your superpower. Now, what will you learn? So much. You're going to learn how to quiet the chatter of your brain. You're going to learn how to make quick decisions, the kind that leaders make, not spending your life trying to manage and do damage control on your life. Just letting your fears and your anxieties dictate every choice you make. You're going to learn how to actually attract the kind of support and connection in people, community, and opportunities that really lift you up, that put you in the flow, like the superpsychic highway of potential opportunity and successful outcome. It'll help you feel better because it reduces stress. Your health will improve. Your energy will amplify, and your joy will pop back in. So these are the minimum promises, and I assure you, you won't be disappointed. You'll learn so much more than that, but these are some you can really count on. So who's this for? You. It's for all of us. It's restoring a fundamental element of who we are, a hardwired part of us, and putting it back into operation. Science has already established, and this is current, so this is something you can go check out, that we actually have three brains, not one. We have our rational brain which is an impressive and an important organ, but we also have our heart brain and our gut brain. Science will basically say your gut's your second brain. And I believe that's true, but I believe and want to give you a little evidence that the first brain is your heart brain. It's the first organ in your body to develop. It's the one that broadcasts to the rest of the embryo how to organize and become this full, amazing outcome of you. Second brain is your gut brain which takes care of you. It protects you; it alerts you to danger. It alerts you to what's incongruent and not in your best interest. And then your head brain comes in and organizes it so that you can make decisions that are well informed, grounded, and serve you. So the other thing that will happen as you work with this is it's not just for the outer you that wants your life to be safe and secure; it's for the inner superyou that wants to have an opening that you can step back into life and really become present and express who you really are. Create what you're fully capable of creating, and contribute what you came here to contribute. That's who it's for. It's for the best you to dive into life and take over. Now in the course, not only do I have the daily tools that are going to be introduced in bite sizes; and heads up they're really fun, and you'll have instant response; but you'll also get two bonus meditations. Now, meditation in and of itself is a bonus because it's a vacation from your constant mental banter that exhausts you, gives you nightmares, gives you anxiety attacks, panic attacks, and keeps you from being joyful. So that's bonus number one. The morning meditation is going to reorient you so that your attention is not on the noise, and your attention shifts to that part of you, that superself that's in your heart, that authentic guiding light of you. And you're going to connect to that and reorient yourself to letting that be the conversation you listen to, the input, the guidance that you listen to. The evening meditation is an extra added bonus because it reactivates your imagination. It reactivates your possibility. The morning meditation is short and sweet and clear, sets the intention and possibility for the day. And the evening meditation is like an invitation on a magic carpet to adventureland. And that's more what I call a channel transmission. It's a big adventure where you begin to, you nightdream and daydream and imagine and begin to lift out of this very contained, constrained, immediate world and puts you back in touch with the world of all possibility. So you can listen to it at night, and you can fall asleep to it even. And you'll fall asleep to sweet dreams. Both meditations that I offer are more than traditional meditations. They're not just a set of instructions that try to play whack-a-mole with your talking brain. You know, whack, whack, whack, which is a lot of what meditation is, and it doesn't work. I know it doesn't work for me; it's annoying. It's actually a transmission. When I give meditations, I'm speaking and I'm channeling from the source of intuition. So you feel it, you sense it, and you entrain to the part of you that I'm reconnecting in you. So you will experience a shift that will naturally quiet your brain and will sort of mesmerize you back into this beautiful part of you that's long forgotten. So in the first week, I'm going to teach you how to begin to befriend and recognize your intuition. It's like a relationship. You know, you come into a relationship; you're optimistic. You have all your projections. This could be great, but how do I really know who you are? How do I trust? So I'm going to help you become familiar and understand your unique intuition because it's not one size fits all. For some of us, it's a gut feeling; for some of us, it's in our heart. For some of us, it's, we get it in our dreams, and it floats and changes. But I will teach you how to recognize your inner voice, your inner guidance, your inner teacher, and really help your head get out of the way. You know, that part of you that's protective, and understandably so, but suspicious and cautious and scared. So we'll address all of that the first week and just teach you what intuition feels like so that you don't have to guess at it. You experience and recognize its specific and unique signatures. And there are signatures that you can visually see and feel and sense. So in week two, well, now that we kind of have connected with our intuition and it's a part of you that you've been waiting for even though you may not have known it consciously, then we start to have some fun. I'm going to teach you how to put intuition to work without threatening you, because we can't trust something unless we have enough experience of it. So this is not blindly asking you to leap into the void. It's actually a journey where I'm going to have you leap back into your authentic self. So I'm not exaggerating to suggest that you're going to feel a bit more, you're going to feel quite a bit more whole; it's like a healing. And the definition of healing that I like to use is to become whole again, that there's a sense of integrity. There's an experience of confidence that starts kicking in, and joy, sense of humor, and trust. So that's what we're going to work on for the second week. Now, the third week is the game changer. That's when it gets really exciting because you'll have experiences in the first two weeks that are going to give you enough evidence that your intuition is not something that is hit and miss or unreliable. It ... actually, you'll have enough experience to see, sense, feel that I can count on this. And it's working for me. It's improving my life immediately. It's protecting me. It's saving me from wrong decisions. It's just giving me a bit of life force that I just didn't have, bit of like what I call gives you your mojo back, that sense of your spirit and essence. So in the third week we're going to start letting it drive the bus of your life. We're going to start allowing it, first in non-threatening ways, and then more and then more and then more. And here's why that won't be too difficult. Because it's natural. It will feel natural. You'll naturally have positive experiences right out the gate. And moreover, you're hardwired to be intuitive. Our sixth sense is not something that you either believe in or you don't believe in. If you're going to be fully current and work with the science of today, it absolutely emphasizes that we have three brains. We have our head brain, our heart brain, and our gut brain. And this course is to reintegrate your heart and gut brain so that you're a whole brain, and it's not a linear shift. It's an exponential shift. It's like ripples in the lake. Pretty soon, you begin to see and understand and make decisions from this really well-informed place. So I just want to make clear intuition is not about predicting the future. It's about empowering you to make the most informed, creative, authentic, and well-grounded decisions, in the moment, to create the future that you really want. That's what it's about. And when you do that, and when you give yourself permission to do that, you lead your life. And not only that, you actually recognize you become a leader in life. So it not only helps you; you become someone who instantly starts to help others because intuition and leading your life has a really good energy about it. And we are all sentient, energetically responsive beings. So when you're leading your life and you're aligned and congruent and enjoy, you have what I call good vibes. Good vibes are something people gravitate for, people gravitate toward and start to resonate with. They start to entrain with that energy. So your good vibes spreads good vibes. And it's sort of the gift that keeps on giving. So not only are you benefited, everybody's benefited, and that's how it really works. That's sort of the natural plan. That is the plan that will really give you not only confidence and joy and a sense of power but it also gives you a sense of contribution that you cannot get without your intuition leading your life. And by the end of three weeks, I promise you, you will be. However we have to get ready. We can't just sit back on a hammock and swing and close our eyes and expect the intuition of our inner spirit to guide us. We have to meet it with our preparation and our intention. So I'm going to give you a few suggestions so this class works for you. Now, the first thing you want to do is get a journal. You want to record what your intuition says for a couple of reasons. First, when you write things down, you actually put value on them. And this is the biggest problem we've had so far. I truly don't believe that you've not had intuitive feelings before. Everybody has, because it's natural. However, we haven't necessarily been given the encouragement to recognize that as this is gold; this is important. I need to listen to this. So when you write it down, you're validating it. Secondly, when you write things down, you're training your body to recognize when your intuition is speaking to you. And the third thing is it opens up what I call the portal to your expanded superself. Now I have a word for it that's my code word. And that is, it opens a portal to your spirit. Maybe that's not your language; that's fine. Whatever your language is, there's a superself that comes into your body and gives it the power to beat your heart and wake your consciousness up. That self can come directly to you and through you and guide you by writing things down. I recommend a journal that is particular to my intuitive Quest because it's going to be the most interesting book you've ever read. So you want to set it aside and make it something that this is where I catch the gold. The second thing that's superimportant and really essential for success is to engage and join the tribe, the community, to introduce yourself and allow yourself to get the kind of support you need. One of the biggest objections that I hear and have heard from the beginning of my intuitive life as a teacher is that I don't want to be treated as a weirdo. I feel like I have to hide, have to be in the closet about this. I don't want to be rejected. I get that. One of our primal fears is being shunned. And people have a fear that if I let people know I'm intuitive or I'm doing this, I risk being shunned. Now the truth is probably not but you might get a few raised eyebrows. We're going to just bypass that altogether. And we're going to go right into the community where you're going to meet kindred spirits. We need those kindred spirits to help build our confidence and to mirror us and encourage this part of our life so that we begin to develop the confidence and the trust to go with it. Now, I always like to refer to metaphors and fairy-tales about intuition. And my fairy-tale about the beginning of the intuitive life is the ugly duckling. When you're a five sensory, you're an ugly duck. You just only see things a certain limited way. And if you pop in as a, what I call a six sensory, someone who's intuition begins to wake up, you begin to recognize maybe I'm not the same as the others. And they're going to recognize that in you as well. So there is a little bit of what I call "othering" that could go on; you're other than a five sensory. It doesn't mean there's anything wrong but when you're in the process, that othering can leave you feeling self-conscious unless you have other others, and you immediately have your community, your connection, your people, who say "I get you." And that expression definitely means I receive and I intuitively understand what's up with you and who you are and how wonderful you are. So we need the tribe, and you want to engage in the tribe. And frankly, it's going to be superfun because they'll validate you. And that's what we're seeking in life all the time. It's just that the five-sense validation is called approval. And that doesn't feel good. When you get approval from that sixth sense, you're getting approval and mirroring, and you're getting encouragement and celebration of your authentic self. That's always validating. That always feels good. So we're going to do that. We're going to set that up for you. And I want you to engage in that. The next thing is that I want you to set up some time for this because, you know, I have a saying in one of my books that I wrote called "Your Heart's Desire, Creating the Life You Really Want". And this saying is this, "Build your life around your heart." Don't try to shove your heart into your busy life. You'll choke it off. So you have to prioritize that this is important. Now the good news is it's important and fun. And how much fun are you actually having in life these days? For real, like silly fun, like happy fun, like being spontaneous fun, and adventure fun. Give yourself this 20 minutes daily for the adventure fun. And this leads me to the next point which is to actually have fun. However, there's only one way to really have fun. When you were a kid, you did this naturally, and I'm just going to invite you to do it again. And that is play full out, two feet in, and not one foot in and one dragging your butt. One being suspicious and one being preoccupied 'cause you'll be fragmented. You're going to be all over the place. Now this is another good reason for full out and two feet in. I mentioned that we have three brains, head, heart, and gut. Now this is science. But when they're aligned, you take off; you are congruent. You are in the flow; you are connected to the quantum field. You are operating with connection to your true self, connection to other people's true self instead of their fearful self. And you're connecting to the quantum field. But if your head's here, and your heart's here, and your gut's here, you're spinning in circles, and you just get a belly ache and a headache, and you certainly don't feel good. So it feels good to do something full out. So give yourself permission for three weeks. "I'm going to play full out with this, and I don't have to win approval." When you're playing as a kid you didn't sit around and say, "Did that work?" "Did that work?" "Is that right?" You were just in it. That's what this is about. Be in it, 'cause you're being into who you are. And it just is so fun. So I invite you to dive in, to join in. Don't miss the fun; don't miss the possibility; don't self select out from yourself. Things can be really exciting, really fulfilling, really satisfying. And I really truly wondered if I should call this course how good can you stand it. So let's see, how good can you stand it? How much fun can you let yourself have while succeeding, while healing, while feeling better, while making great friends, while connecting to your people, and bringing in your most beautiful potential and making it a reality. That's what this is about. So come join me. Let's play full out. Let's have a good time, and let's put you back in the driver's seat and really lead yourself to the life that is authentic, fulfilling, you came to live.

Part 1 - Get Started With Your Intuition Superpowers

========================================

LESSON 1: The Way It Begins Is the Way It Ends
--------------------
Welcome to your sixth sense, your superpower. I think that you might be a little bit hesitant to get that excited about, is it a superpower? But it is a superpower, and it will change your life for the better if you really give it a chance. But in learning anything new, the success is really going to depend a 100% on you and the effort you bring. I'll match you, but you have to actually put two feet in and want this, to at least give it a try, at least see what happens. So I want you to check in with your motivation. How are you generally motivated in life? Do you drag your butt through life? "I have to." "I got to do that." "It's no fun." Because that clearly is an indication that the decisions you've made in life have taken you on the wrong path. This awakening is going to put you back on track, get you in the flow, get you back in the rhythm and the joy of life, but you have to make the decision; you have to be motivated to make the change. So there's a Chinese saying that I just love: "The way it begins is the way it ends." So let's begin this with a really elevated, high, energetic motivation. My teachers were really good, and I started learning with them when I was 12 years old. I grew up in an intuitive family, and that was just the way we did things. I was not raised in a family where we had to get permission. I was raised in a family where we had to ignore people who tried to block us because the permission that was coming from within was what we valued. My mom, who was so creative, so intuitive, so her own person, would never say to us ever, "Do what I say." She would say, "What does your inner voice say? What does your guidance say? Check that, and then we'll decide together." So that was the gift of my life, was being empowered to check in, to be really connected to who I authentically am. So what voice brought you here? What brought you to this course? I personally think that you were brought here by what I call in my language, doesn't have to be yours, a divine appointment. Sort of a universal kind of agreement from your your spirit or your superself to my super self that we were going to meet at this point in time, and it's not an accident. You were intuitively guided. So I want you to feel and recall what moment did you decide to even enroll in this course and check it out? What happened in you? What experience did you have? Did you have a curiosity? Were you looking? Did someone point it out to you? Did you just tumble into it? No matter how you got to the course, you had to at some point in this beginning stage, say, "Yes; I'm going to check this out." That is your intuition, the part that signed you up, the part that brought you to this conversation. So let's pause right there, and locate that somehow, in whatever way you can, locate that impulse that brought you here because we're going to grow that impulse. We're going to amplify it, and we're going to let it take over your life. Doesn't that sound fun? Trust me; it is. Okay, so this is a sign that it's working a little bit for you already. I want you to really begin to recognize, you know, it's not that I'm not intuitive; I actually am. It's just that I haven't learned to work with it in a way that's serving me. Maybe you're very intuitive, but you're just frustrated because every intuition you get you're really good at ignoring. You're really good at fighting with. You're really good at going, "Ah-la, I can't hear you." So we have to change that by thinking about and naming and recognizing, well, what's in it for me? If am actually going to become intuitive, I have to do some things different. I have to try some new techniques. I have to respond differently. I have to make an effort. Now it's not an effort that's painful. That's the good part, but it's nevertheless an invitation to change your behavior, and that's always an effort. You'll make that effort if you're motivated. So let's name the things that do motivate you, and I'm going to help you. Perhaps you're motivated because you just don't feel energized. Maybe you wake up in the morning, and you're just in the funk. You don't have the energy, the enthusiasm, the joy, the interest; it's as if your body's sitting here, but the the real spirit of you left the room. And you're hoping that maybe this course would kind of bring that back and get your vitality and your sense of interest in life reactivated. Maybe that's a motivation. So check. Or maybe your relationships are just like not flowing. Maybe they're okay. Maybe you're putting up with it, but maybe you're not having any fun. You're not enjoying the experiences of relating to the people you've surrounded yourself with in life. Maybe you're hoping that my intuition could help me better understand, A, should I be in this relationship? B, if I am not showing up correctly, how can I adjust to make it better? Or C, give me the energy to leave so I can attract myself to the right people that will work for me. Or D, E, F, kind of get into the place of where I'll meet my people and be myself. Maybe that's your motivation because your intuition will do that. It can do that for you. Maybe your motivation is I just struggle in life with my survival. I'm not a creative person. I'm not making money the way I want. I don't feel abundant. I feel stuck. I feel like I'm making ends meet. I feel like I want to have an experience that's a little bit more expanded, has a little bit more resource available to me. Maybe financial resource, maybe resource of opportunity, maybe resource of inspiration. Because it's not just about money; it's about meaning. Maybe I'm looking for meaning. So is that your motivation? Just keep checking because we have to understand what's in it for me to show up. You did show up, but you may not understand why yet. Maybe you showed up because you actually are intuitive and you've had enough good experience with it that you know: this is the good stuff. This is going to bring me the joy. This is going to bring me the excitement. I want more of this, and I want to learn how to get more of this regularly, reliably. Wouldn't that be amazing? So maybe that's your motivation. You know what I don't accept though is the response, "I don't know. I don't know." That's laziness. That is your consciousness kind of going dark on you. Just be curious enough, interested enough, to ask yourself. I went this far. I got this far; I pushed this button. I pushed this button; I pushed this button. Something was moving me forward. I call that something your spirit; you can call it your expanded itself. You can call it your higher supereagle, whatever; something moved you, and that something is the promise that this course offers. That something is your best you maneuvering you in the direction of connecting with, experiencing, expressing, manifesting your best life. So what I want you to do is I want you to just pause the video right now. Take a breath, and just focus to the best of your ability. It's not a test. It's just an interesting question. If I could get something out of this, if I really could get what I want, what brought me to this degree, to commit this far; my toes are in the water. What am I hoping to experience? So I want you you to write it down, or at least, 'cause I know there's a lot of people in the world, the minute I say, "Do this," your inner self goes, "I'm not going to do that." So plan B is at least speak it out loud because when you name it, you claim it. What's your motivation? Is it relationship? Is it health? Is it money? Is it just meaning? Is it connection? Is it seeking joy? Is it seeking your people? All of the above? Leaving the life you don't love to finding one you do. All of the above? And I'll give you about one minute because it won't take longer to really name your motivation. But don't look in your head; look in your whole body. Take a breath and I'll be back in one minute. Okay. Welcome back, and I hope that you were able to identify at least a little bit of your motivation. That's very important because if you don't own your motivation, you're not going to show up. And that brings me the second part of this lesson. I'm going to ask you to do something that we're very, very rarely asked to do but is really essential for your success. Are you ready? I'm going to ask you for the next little while, working together over the next 21 days, to put two feet in, fully commit, and play full out. In other words, give it your all. Just try everything. You don't have to like it. You don't have to commit to it. You don't have to succeed at it. Just try it, for real. And try it with full, just like full enthusiasm, willingness, and curiosity. Don't show up part-time; don't cruise by like what I call drive-by, you know, just kind of, hmm. Because it won't work, and I want to set you up for success, okay? So I want two feet in; play full out, knowing your motivation, but also surprise. It's not hard. This is actually going to be a lot of fun. This is going to surprise you. This is going to be delightful but only if you show up a 100%. So here's an interesting question. I want you to think about what have you shown up to in your life so far 100%? Just consider, maybe in my work, maybe with my kids, maybe with my friends, maybe with my hobby, maybe with my creative passion, but where have you shown up in the past, up until now, a 100%? And how has that worked out for you? I can pretty much assure that it's working out. Maybe you're not at the highest, best place, but there's something in you that feels good about it. There's something that's congruent; something that's aligned; something that makes you happy and leaves you feeling I am being my true self. Okay. Just feel the vibe; feel the energy. Feel that because that is what intuition feels like. It feels good. Doesn't mean it's easy. Don't confuse easy with good. It feels true. Don't confuse it with right and wrong. It feels true for me. So notice that, and take a breath. Now I'm going to ask you one other thing: where are showing up now not a 100%? Maybe even, even if it's 99 or 98. Where are you showing up where it's 50%, and how is that working out for you? Now think about those experiences, and do you notice, do you get immediately tired? Like, you know, there's this classic movie called 'The Wizard of Oz' and there's this scene in this movie, 'The Wizard of Oz' where the wicked witch gets water thrown on her, and she's like, "I'm melting; I'm melting." Do you feel like that when you go to any situation where it's not a 100% commitment? Because that is how your energy's going; it's draining; it's going down. You're disappearing yourself. You're evaporating. You are losing yourself, and it leaves you feeling really tired. So at minimum, showing up a 100%, giving this a few weeks of your a 100% effort is going to energize you. It'll surprise you. It'll entertain you, I promise. It'll give you some confidence, but I can't do a thing for you more than you're going to do for yourself. Can't. Now, if you show up a 100% and I show up a 100%, we're going to have an exponential result. Not 100%, we're going to have exponential because then the universe shows up a 100% too. The quantum field joins in because there's no resistance. You know, that feels really good, and if there's nothing in your life you're showing up to a 100%, well, guess what? You were brought here by that inner knowing in you that's smart enough to say, this doesn't work. You need to be here. So trust that. You were brought here for a reason that your own inner self, your own guidance, led you to. So I'm not asking you to trust me. I'm asking you to trust the fact that you showed up and trusted a 100%, and have this experience of what life feels like when you're all in and you're aligned with you. Not with what's around you, but with you, your inner voice, your authentic self. It's mind blowing. It's fun. So your assignment: write down where you're not showing up, and write down what that feels like; share it on the community because we need to be witnessed, and we need to express. We need to have a dialogue with our kindred spirits. Where are you showing up a 100%? Again, share your successes; share how that feels. Pay attention and actually ask yourself and make a commitment. Not to me; I'll teach you and move on. To yourself; write that commitment down. State it on the community board. This is my commitment to me because then you can ask yourself, "Do I have the capacity to show up a 100% to me, for me, listening?" It's okay to be a beginner. You don't have to be good at this, just willing. So if you're willing and I'm willing, we're going to have a good time. So that's your assignment, and I'll see you tomorrow.

====================

LESSON 2: Intuition Speaks in Vibrations Not Words
--------------------
Welcome back to your sixth sense, your superpower.</v> Oh, I'm very excited because I trust that you are going to show up. And you know what, you'll know it, I'll know it, the tribe knows it; everyone will know it because we feel it. So I want to give you just a little bit more motivation to show up to our new process because it's something we never ever talk about, but I want to talk about it today. Not only does how you choose to listen to your own energy affect you, it affects everyone around you. You're obvious, even if you feel like nobody's looking. If you're putting out a positive, aligned, congruent vibration, you're showing up; you're listening; you're making choices to give everything a full effort; you have good energy. And it can be measured; it can be felt. But if you're at cross-purposes with yourself, and you're listening to your head, and you're listening to other people, and you're listening to your parents, and you're listening to your neighbors, and you're listening to your partners, you are a mess. And it feels like a mess. And it's confusing, and people won't trust you, and they won't really show up for you. So we're going to set this up that well, for at least this little while, I'm going to go for listening to my inner voice and being in a new experience, and everybody can just have that experience of me, and we'll see what happens. So you know what that's called? An adventure. We're going to go on an adventure, and we're going to step out of the world of right and wrong, where most people live. And it's just a mess because everybody's struggling for I'm right; you're wrong; you're right; I'm wrong. And nobody's right; nobody's wrong. Everybody is just in a struggle because they have abandoned themselves. We're going to hop up, and we're going to start this adventure in a new space called the third space. Exciting, huh? It's like a new world. And in the new space, in this new world, we're going to listen to a new language. We're going to listen and experience. Just like if you go to a new country, you can't bring the old version of your old communication to a new country because all you're going to be then looking for is who recognizes my language, and you're going to miss the experience. So this language, fortunately, everyone speaks. It's called vibration. And we all started out speaking that language. We all came into this world without any words, without any ideas in our head that are other people's imprints. And we just tracked our world by energy. And it gave us clues, and it gave us signs, and it gave us information. And that's the language of intuition. It is the language of energy, but it has a lot of dialects. Let's just kind of continue with this metaphor. Some of us feel that energy in our hearts, so we use the language of saying, "You know, my heart says;" it's just kind of automatic. Now, some of us feel that vibration in our gut, in our stomach. And as we say, "My gut says." Naturally, it just kind of comes out. And you know, when you say it, people understand it. Nobody's saying, what does that mean? I've taught this, I've taught intuition for over almost 40 years in every quadrant of this world. And nobody ever says, "I don't know what that means." And some of us feel this energy that kind of translates to sort of an inner voice. It's like, "My inner voice says." Maybe that's how it's coming for you. And also, maybe it's coming through images; maybe things flash in your head. That vibration and that energy kind of distills into pictures. I get these visions. So, some people say, "I get a vision. I have a vision." And we understand. So we're learning a language that we already know, inherently, that is natural. So, we are reawakening a way to interact with the world that's different than just the five senses. So, guess what? Most people, we understand. I have never met anybody who says, "I have no idea what you're talking about." Even the most hardheaded scientist will say, "Whoa I pick it up, and I won't be giving it any importance." But they do still say, "I pick it up. That crosses my mind. I just can't validate it" So, what we need to learn in this lesson is when you name it, you claim it. You have to give a language to this part of your life, and a language that is positive. Most people are afraid to be intuitive because they don't even have the words to comfortably say, "This is my intuition." So we don't talk about it. And if we don't talk about it and if we don't language it, we disappear it; we ignore it. So it's so important for you to come up with your language that is comfortable for you. Now, my language is I say, "I trust my vibes." That's one of the ways I talk about my intuition because I experience it as vibration. Someone else says, "I go with my gut." I have a business partner who's really grounded. And he's very protective, and he's solid. And he doesn't even say, I'm intuitive, but he says, "You know, I'm not going to use that fluffy language, but I do go with my gut." It's your language. But come up with one; be able to express this, instead of don't know what to say for fear of being rejected, for fear of being perceived as weird. And that's another thing. I love language. I write books. I've written a lot of books, so I've learned a lot of language, and I've learned to improve my language and see how it works. And one of the biggest objections to being intuitive is this, "I'm afraid people will think I'm a weirdo. I'm too woo woo." So, I hear this all the time, but if you look up the definition of weirdo or weird, it is a word that literally means, out of this world, or in other words, out of this physical world. So, you have to be a weirdo if you're going to be intuitive. You have to be in the energetic field, what we'll call the quantum field, because that is what it is, the holographic field of the universe. I'm out of just the physical world. I don't ignore it. I just know it's not all there is. Woo woo is a fun one because woo woo dismisses everything that is intuitive and creative and cannot be validated in the moment. Well, intuition can sometimes be validated pretty quickly, but sometimes you're picking up something that is in the process of unfolding. So, it may happen next week or tomorrow, or it's coagulating and coming together. So, you don't have to, there's no evidence just yet. So it's like, you know, I'm a bit woo woo. But it makes sense in time. So, you have that language. And the other thing is you want to language it, so that you are not telling the people around you to judge you. Don't say, "Oh my God, I have such a weird, uncomfortable, scary feeling," because everybody's going to want to run away from you. That's not good energy; it's like, I don't want to hear your scary feeling. I don't want to hear your negative energy. So you can say, "You know what? I'm picking up something that's alerting me to pay attention." Now, this is where your conscious ego and your intuition can become partners. They're not enemies. We're not saying that the unseen world is the only world that exists. What we're saying is, we have the physical world, and then we have the energetic world, and it's a continuation. So, you have to be able to speak vibration, to speak comfortably about your intuition. Now, one of the most famous speeches ever at a commencement speech, for, at a college, was Steve Jobs was speaking at a graduation. And in that speech, he is saying to all these highly educated people, "Trust your heart; listen to your heart." He is validating that. Now, if he didn't say that, there would've been no game-changing, earthshaking shift for all these students to hear. When you validate it with your language, you're saying to yourself and others, both. To yourself, first, and then to others, "This is real." And secondly, when you name something, you actually validate it. This exists. If we don't talk about our intuition, we're not validating it. We're having the experience, but we're like, I can't say it, so I'm going to just let it go. And you regret it. It's very empowering to come up with your own language. So here's your lesson. I want you to ask yourself, "Do I have any comfortable words that I can wear like comfortable clothes? That I use to talk about like, for me, my vibes, my gut, my hits, my ahas?" What are your words that you can use that just roll right off, and it feels good? You don't hesitate; you don't freak out. And then try them on a few people; try them out; try them in language. And you know, there's language we already have like "my heart says;" "my gut says." And secondly, here's one that's really intuitive. It's a phrase we say all the time: "I get you." What does that mean? Other than, intuitively, I am taking in the totality of you. I am internalizing and receiving the full vibration of who you are. "I get you" is a very intuitive affirmation that we are having an exchange that transcends appearances, that goes beyond the surface. And we crave that. Human beings are sixth-sense creations, not five. And that sixth sense is not a linear step. It's an exponential one. We are craving that acknowledgement, that witnessing, and that validation. And you can start today. Don't look for anyone else's language. It's your experience. So I want you to write down what you can say, 1, 2, 3 words, and then I want you to reflect, if there are any words I say that are negative. Do I couch it in a negative way? Do I go, hold on everybody. I got a psychic feeling; you better get ready? Because that's just setting yourself and everybody else up for drama and trauma. That's not useful. Be fun, be easy, be creative, and own your language. Because when you name it, you claim it. And it's vibration, no matter what you call it. It's like Shakespeare says, "A rose is a rose is a rose, and by any other name, it's still a rose." So find the rose in you. Find the spirit in you. Find the superself in you, your expanded self, and begin to recognize it's communicating to you. And you have to acknowledge it if you're going to have any benefit from it. And you have to acknowledge it comfortably; you have to know, I'm in a new land. I'm in the third space where we don't just deal with the physical literal world. I've just entered a world where we communicate, and I communicate, with energy. I don't pay just attention to what is physically in front of me, I pay attention and I take in and I acknowledge and I name and I listen to the full spectrum of what is available to me. And that's what being an intuitive person is about. It's being complete and whole and expanded. So, have fun creating your third space language,; try it on. Speak a little; talk to the community. Get comfortable, just like when we're in a new foreign country, we're afraid to say the words wrong, but it's your language. Can't go wrong. Have fun with this. Get at ease. And I will see you tomorrow.

LESSON 3: Embrace Your Superpower
--------------------
Welcome back to your sixth sense, your superpower.</v> And today we're going to actually begin to experience this wonderful energy intentionally. So there are four decisions that you need to make in order to get this sense awakened, like turned back on. It's inherent in your body. It's inherent in your experience, but we've been ignoring it. Now we've turned it on. So by being open, that's your first decision. Are you open to seeing, perceiving, experiencing yourself as an intuitively guided person, a well-guided person? And my intuition really works for me, and I'm going to use it in my life. So that's a change of attitude for most of us. Something brand new, but it's like, if intuition is broadcasting energy to you, bringing information, you are the receiver. And if you're not open, click, it's off. So you have to turn the receiver on by making the decision to be open. I have a client who said, I asked her one time. I said, "How open are you to intuition?" And she said, "Well, it never occurred to me to consider the question. I just didn't think about it." And I pointed out, "But you're here. So your body showed up. We have to bring your attitude to show up too. Be open to that your intuition works for you." She laughed; she said, "Well, that would be different. I just thought you'd give me some information that I'd think about." And I say, "No, no, no. We're learning in a different way. You can't experience intuition until you decide in advance, I'm open. However, part of you's open, or you wouldn't be hearing this conversation. So trust and bring the rest of you to the conversation by saying, "Okay, I'm open." That's the first decision. And the second decision is to expect your intuition to work. Now we're talking about something you haven't experienced consistently yet for most of you. So this might be a bit of a leap. I want to start by introducing you to what your inner vibration guidance superpower feels like. So here we go. What I want you to do is let's do this right now. Follow along with me. I want you to shake your hands out like this. Breathe; don't hold your breath. Shake them out, ah, and breathe. And then I want you to shake them again and rub 'em together like this. And then slowly pull them apart. And you're going to feel something bouncing back between your two hands. And some of you will say, "Well, it's just my body heat." But no, not when you get this far away, and you still feel it. Or this far, and you still feel it. Not when you do this or this and still feel it. So, let's do that again. Rub your hands together; pull 'em apart, and just feel the energy. We're going to name it. What does it feel like? Just as I'm talking, start calling to mind what does this energy feel like? Some call it thicker air. Some people say, "Well, it feels a little bit like hot, hot energy." Others say, "Well, I experience this as cool." But give it a word because once you acknowledge what you're feeling you're not going to ignore it ever again. Okay, so now energy changes. There's different energies at different places. So do this again. And this time, shake it out. Put your hands like this, and have the experience of the energy going from one palm to another across your head. Some of you could think, "Wow, this is weird." But that's just your ego talking. Just experience what you're feeling. Okay, breathe and feel it. And you'll notice that it feels different than the energy here. So this is what you're picking up. This is what you're receiving. It's almost like different radio stations broadcasting different messages. Shake again; shake out. Put your hands one over your heart and one over your belly. And continue to breathe and feel the energy there. First, just experience it. And again, give it language. What does it feel like? Now, I'm not talking about emotions when I say feeling. I'm talking about actually an experience that you're having other than your thinking brain and other than the traditional way you feel things with your senses. You're feeling vibration and energy. So, how does it feel? How does this feel different than this? Or this or this? It's very fun. So pick a person in your life today. You have a friend, a child, a neighbor, a partner. Just say, like, "Do this." And then put your hand to their hand and feel the energy connect. And then back up and see how far you can back away and still feel the connection. So that's really a wonderful way to kind of understand, "This is a real thing I'm responding to." And this is what is giving you the information. So I want to share a story with you about a client. This just happened two days ago. I have a client I've been mentoring for quite a while, and I've been teaching her how to feel vibration and to acknowledge it because we want it to inform you. We want it to inform your decisions. She shared this with me. She said, "At first I thought this was all funny and fluff. I didn't think it was very practical. However, at work I have two partners; we're three of us working on a project. And the project has not been going very well at all. And I didn't know what to do about it other than just keep showing up and hoping that it's going to work out, but I have a lot of stress about it. And so I thought I would use the experience that you invited me to do with the hands, with them. Well, the first woman that I worked with when I put my energy next to her energy, I was surprised 'cause her energy felt pretty chaotic. Very different from mine. It was like I'm classical music, and she's frantic jazz over here. I mean, we're just on a whole different rhythm. And I experienced it even though my intellect was fighting it. That's how I organized my experience. Her energy was all over, but it wasn't bad, just different." Okay, good to know. "Then I tried my other partner, and when I rubbed my hands with hers and felt her energy, her energy felt like concrete, but not bad, just kind of immovable. And I was surprised because it's not necessarily how her personality comes across. It's just my experience. And I had this big "aha" moment, that my energy was very different from theirs and I was trying to control it all. I was trying to get us all on the same vibrational wavelength, namely mine because I was assuming my energy was the superior energy. But when I worked with you and I just thought, just observe the different energies. I kind of contemplated, what can I do so this is not a battle? So I can work with my partners. I can continue to finish the project, 'cause we were almost done, instead of quitting which I had been obsessed about doing 'cause I wasn't enjoying the music." And I said, "So what did you do? What did you do with that information? What came spontaneously?" She said, "What came is that everybody had their own process but I felt that I could trust them in their process. And I had to quit controlling it." She said, "I decided to just let go, trust them to do their thing. I'll trust myself to do my thing. And we all come back together. These three pieces will somehow work." She said, "You know what? Everything changed; everything changed." This was just two days ago. "And the next day," she said, "We had the best meeting ever." She wrote to me and said, "I let it go. I let her do her music, her do her music. I did mine and intuitively my guidance, what came to me that I didn't plan, was just let everybody do their thing because they know what they're doing." And she said, "I decided that I could stay in this partnership. I don't have to quit my job. I don't have to hate on them. I don't have to tell myself that I can't trust them. And I gave myself a little bit of freedom to recognize I too have my own energy. And if I respect it, instead of trying to manage theirs, that I could get more done." So this is just a practical application of learning to assess energy. Instead of trying to shove it into one tunnel, let's just see what is actually there. One of my very important early teachers of intuition said, "Actually, Sonia, intuition is a keen sense of the obvious on an energetic level." So, what we're doing is we're beginning to see that, "This could really change my life. This could help me assess things more accurately. This could help me see where I don't have to fight everything, but make choices based on what I'm experiencing." In her case, the choice was "Everybody knew what they were doing, they were just doing it differently than me. So I'm going to trust that." And it worked out for her. Maybe what you pick up is, "Everybody's doing things in a way that feels terrible for me, and I don't want to participate." So you get to make that decision. Maybe it feels like, "I can't explain it. I don't know why, but I love being here. And so I'm going to stay, even though I can't logically come up with a reason, and I'm going to make that decision. It works for me." But we have to start recognizing that energy is communicating as much as words, body language, sound, and every other avenue of influence. Intuition is communicated by vibration. And when we start assessing and speaking this language, it then becomes superinforming. And that's the beginning of your superpower. Your assignment today is to go experience other people's energy. You can do it with your hands. You can also do it with your heart and belly. Just put it out and feel it. You can do it with your eyes; put it out and feel it. You can do it with your ears. You can put it out and feel it. But we're not thinking it; we're feeling it. That's why I gave you the language yesterday, so you can name what you're feeling. And the more you experience and language it and the more you recognize there's all kinds of differences, then the more informed you can be and make choices that help you be in energy that feels good to you. And that's a big part of what this is all about. Have fun with this. Communicate on the community board what you experienced, what "ahas" you had. Don't be heady about it. Trust and express what comes immediately. It'll be very informing. It'll be a lot of fun, and I'll see you tomorrow.

====================

LESSON 4: Stop Talking & Start Listening
--------------------
Welcome back to your sixth sense, your superpower. Isn't this exciting? It's just like a brand new adventure where you're going to get all kinds of gifts. All kinds of positive benefits are going to come in. As we proceed, you're going to start being guided to right place, right time, right people, right opportunity. Things will drop in that will be so exciting and creative. In other words, you're kind of rolling into being and living the life that is your authentic and expanded true self. So I just want to start by reminding you of that. And I'll remind you often throughout the next few weeks that this is you becoming more of you. You listening to more of your authentic self. You reclaiming more of your sovereignty and autonomy and your power to direct your life the way your blueprint is designed, the way that your spirit wants to go, instead of being incongruent with life as most people who live in their heads experience. So that brings me to the point of this particular lesson: intuition isn't in your head. And part of it is, do you know that your brain actually can't even feel? They do surgery on your brain with, they probably drill through the skull or whatever, but when you're actually poking around the brain, it doesn't have any feelings. So your brain is not a good receiver. It's your body, it's your throat, it's your heart, it's your gut, it's your skin. It's your feel, but it's not the words ping-ponging back and forth in your brain. The second thing about intuition is it's not talking. It's listening. You are receiving. You are listening. And you're not listening just with your ears. You're actually listening with your entire body. And recent science, because it keeps evolving, is beginning to understand that your entire body does have the capacity to receive, to hear, and to take in energy that informs you. I actually have a colleague whose name is Gregg Braden. He's a wonderful guy who is a scientist who said that his research says that the heart is actually 5,000 times more perceptive than the brain. And I believe that. And I live in Paris, and last year, I saw a magazine. I didn't understand it 'cause I don't speak French that fluently, but I did see on the cover it said your stomach is an intelligent organ. Hooray for science; they're catching up. I'm so relieved. So we are learning to be whole and expanded in our ability to receive energy. But it all begins with your capacity to listen. So the first thing we need to do is clear away some of the distractions. If you don't make room to listen, you're going to miss everything. Now, here's a very quick tool, and I'll expand on it in a later lesson, in how to quiet your brain. So the first thing I want you to do is look around the room very quickly. Notice where you are. Notice what's new; notice what's different. Breathe in and then exhale like you're blowing out candles. Pulling your belly to your spine and it completely empties you, not just of oxygen, but it empties you of conversation. The end of that breath, listen. Gets quiet. Try it again. Breathe in with me. Exhale. At the end of that breath, your brain is quiet. That's why people naturally do this. Naturally, when they're oversaturated, overwhelmed, just too much going on in the head, they do this. All over the world, because it is a natural expelling of too much information in the head, too much talking. The next thing I want to do is to remind you, I just want to make you aware actually, that our ears and our capacity to hear has shrunk. With our focus on our phones and our focus on our computers, our attention and the range of our hearing is getting really tiny and very selective. And that's a scary thought because your ears and your physical body as part of that extended listening faculty, if it shuts down, you just get pushed around, and you get swept up, and you get sidelined, and you get side-swiped, and you just lose all sense of being aware and perceptive of what's happening, so you can't make any decisions. You just react, react, react. So our exercise today is to expand your hearing. The first thing I want you to do is I'm going to ask you in just a moment to stop the video for a few seconds and just close your eyes. So let's do that now. And I'm going to have you close your eyes and just listen for maybe 10 seconds. So close your eyes and listen. Take a breath in; open your eyes, and just notice what that was like. For most of us, we don't have that experience until we pass out in bed at night. And for a lot more of us, we don't even have it when we go to sleep at night. We're still chattering all night long. Just listen. Just listen. Now, what we're going to do is we're going to expand that experience. I'm going to have you pause the video, and I want you for two minutes to listen to all the sounds around you, what you hear, and I want you to distinguish different sounds. Maybe you're going to hear the family in the background or a roommate or a partner. Maybe you'll hear the sounds of traffic outside the door, outside the window. Or nature. Maybe you'll hear birds. Wouldn't that be remarkable? Maybe you're going to hear some busyness next door, downstairs. Maybe you're going to hear silence. Even that has a sound. So listen for just two minutes, and pick out different sounds. I call that a little psychic sit-up because what it does is it stretches your capacity to tune in to energy and listen. Okay, how is that experience for you? Just noticing different sounds. It's like, wow, I didn't even know that was there. Well, we're so busy, so preoccupied, that we're not picking up what's clearly being communicated, and unless we stretch our awareness, create more quiet, and a little bit more opportunity to listen, we are not going to get the kind of information that we need. We're going to miss it. I want you to have fun with this exercise of kind of waking up and stretching your capacity to listen. And the most important motivator to listen is to be interested. When we are not interested in something, we tune it out. Remember the last conversation you had with someone where what they were saying and what they were talking about didn't really interest you and how much of it do you actually retain? One of the big important things about intuition is that it is almost 100% a faculty of listening. So we have to do a little psychic sit-up and work that listening energy out by going in different circumstances, be with different people and listen, not to what they're saying, but to what they're vibrating, what their energy is telling you. Now, one of my clients said, "You know what really gets in my way? I'm super controlling. I really feel very burdened with responsibility. I'm really locked down, and I have a terrible aversion to any kind of risk. So I don't want to hear what anybody else has to say or vibrate or need because I know that it's going to invite me to have to give it importance. So I can see that that's my block." And I really asked her, "How's that working out for you? This strategy for tuning the world out, is it taking care of you?" And she said, "Actually, no. I'm miserable. I'm lonely; I'm disconnected. I know people have a bad vibe when I come in. They don't like me because I'm not listening. I'm not receptive, but I'm scared." Good point. And I asked her, "But are you really scared? Are who you are today in this moment, not your old self, not your child self, not your traumatized self in high school, who you are sitting in this chair in this moment with me today, do you really feel that threatened that you can't listen to the world around you and put any importance on it?" And she was really surprised. She said, "Actually, not really." And I pointed out most of us have the habit of tuning out, and we have the justification of the habit. I'm overly responsible. I don't want to have anything go wrong. But it's not current. This is not what you currently feel. You wouldn't be in this course if you currently felt that. You know that that perception to tune the world out isn't serving you. That, you intuitively know. So listening doesn't mean you have to go along with what you're hearing, what you're experiencing, what you're perceiving, but it gives you information to make decisions in the moment. So one of the big blocks for us is that we tune out because we don't want to be influenced. We want to be in our cave. We want to be in control. We want to shut down. But do we? Do you? And that, for now, I want you to just take a breath right now. Check in. Let out a little sigh. Could you twist and spin this into something different? Instead of being averse to hearing the world, could you be curious; could you be interested? Could you have a little adventure to see what you might discover? Because that's the invitation when you start listening. And you still get a choice about what you're going to do with that. As you listen, pay attention and notice, well, if I hear something, it might be telling me, go here, don't go there. Step in here. You belong here. Here's the party. There's the drama. It's informing, very informing. So I want you today to practice this listening. Go for two minutes. Maybe a little bit later, go for five minutes. A little bit later, we'll stretch, okay? If you're up for it, let's go for 10. And you're not just going to begin to hear the world around you. You'll also begin to hear, and I use that word, not meaning ears, but come to your awareness. Maybe some of the guidance that's been trying to get your intention internally. Maybe you're going to hear something informing about a circumstance you shut down. I had an experience I want to share with you really quickly. I had to go meet some of my cousins in Romania a couple weeks ago because I had a court experience to go and work on some paperwork with my family history. And I had a cousin who was to show up there for this event with me, but she never would confirm. So here I am trying to decide and kind of gauge whether do I get on this airplane, do I go to Romania, do I make this big effort that's not easy where there's a lot of gates and a lot of restrictions because of the pandemic? And do I go? Will she show up or not? Now, my brain was angry and not interested. It's annoyed that I didn't have communication, but I got quiet. I put my hands here a little bit to clear the space. I got quiet and I listened. Should I go? And I got a yes. So I went on the plane, got up and went. She showed up. She never explained why she didn't communicate. She never gave me any reason, but she showed up. We went to court; we fulfilled the papers that we needed to fill, and we had the most beautiful afternoon after that. And then I flew away. So my listening gave me the green light to go, to show up. I had a positive experience in a situation that I had been waiting to happen for years. But I had no outward encouragement, no outward indication that she would show up. Still don't know why she never responded, but I'm so glad I was able to listen to the energy and go ahead and show up and trust the energy that this would work out. So that's just a little anecdote to share with you. Listening gives you information that your brain and your five senses cannot give you. But you have to practice listening in this way. Your assignment? Listen; write down what you hear outwardly that surprised you and then what you heard internally that you didn't notice before. Share it with the community. Pay attention. This is the beginning of the superpower. Okay, everybody? Wasn't that fun? Wasn't that great? We'll see you tomorrow.

LESSON 5: Create Your Energy Container & Clear the Field
--------------------
Welcome back to your sixth sense, your superpower. Now what we're learning so far, I just want to recap really quickly is that we're learning that the world of vibration is constantly communicating very important information to us. And the more we become available to these subtle vibrations, this subtle information, communicating to us through vibration, the better informed decisions we make. So it's a skill to learn, to expand, pay attention, notice, be present. What's actually happening? What's changed? What's going on? What's different? For example, what's changed? I have to tell you the brain looks at things that become familiar. You keep going to the same place. By the third day, fourth day, you actually are no longer present. You're working from memory. You're just projecting what you saw yesterday. Oh, I know what that is, oh, I know who you are, and you're no longer tracking. You're no longer clear, connecting. You're no longer experiencing what is happening now. Intuition is the skill of learning more and more and more, to be fully present and to fully notice, pay attention to what is happening now. What's new, what's different, what's changed? For example, if you noticed, I changed my clothes. That's different, that's a surprise. That's not something that you might have expected, but, and it's not going on on a conscious level, it's going on on an unconscious level. So if we see something that's very familiar, we immediately project what we knew from before, and we tune out what's happening now. So we have to change that. We have to begin to create an experience for ourselves that allows us to be fully present, and not bombarded by the energy around us, so that it confuses us and it saturates us. But actually that we have a nice clear frequency. So today, I'm going to teach you a game changing tool that you will want to use every single day for the rest of your life. So the first thing I want you to be aware of is that we need to create an energetic clear space around us, where we can control, we can be in charge of what's rushing at us. It's just like, if you're on the phone, and someone rushes here, and if you have children, they rush here and then your partner rushes here. And then the doorbell rings with the packages, and you become overwhelmed, ungrounded, saturated, and you don't know what's what, and you're no longer making decisions, you're just reacting. So if we begin to create first the container, in other words, the energetic field, so I want you to imagine that this container is like a little energetic house that has a front and a back, side to side, above and below. And this container is my personal energetic space. So the first thing I want you to do is look around the room wherever you are, and this is the practice, it's going to come in several steps, but notice, notice, notice, notice. So wherever you go, I want you to look around and notice. So I want you to stop right now when I'm finished in a moment, and I want you to look around, and notice three things in front of you that are different. And if you are in a familiar space, three things you never noticed before. Okay? So you might know, for example, there's a photo on the wall, or I'm looking at the rug, or there's the curtain or here's the window. And I want you to notice as you're breathing, there's the rug, breathe, curtain, breathing, and slow down. Why you do this is because it gets you out of your head, into your body, and into the present moment where you begin to read the energy, okay? So let's do that. Welcome back. Now that you took a moment to notice, what I want you to do is I want you to feel the energy around you as you notice and breathe in through the nose, tongue on the roof of your mouth, exhale . Now I want you to shift your attention, and I want you to now notice your internal energy. Don't look at the story of the reason, the why, the what, just what you feel. Just what is my internal environment right now? Do I feel tired? Do I feel heavy? Do I feel anything attached to me or me attached to anything? And again, you want to just kind of scan, and notice the nature of the energy without getting involved in the why of that energy. And then again, I want you to breathe in slowly , tongue on the roof of the mouth , pull your belly to your spine, and completely empty yourself of all that you're holding onto or might be holding onto you. So let's just practice that, breathe in. I'll walk you through it. You can let me just continue to watch, you don't have to stop the video, close your eyes. Turn your attention inward. Notice your energy. Slowly, slowly breathe in until you can no longer inhale anymore. Tongue on the roof of your mouth, pull your belly to your spine, and like you're blowing out candles, completely empty . Now we're going to do this one more time. Breathe in. When you completely reach your full saturation, tongue on the roof of the mouth, exhale with your belly pulled to your spine like you're pushing everything out. You're emptying yourself of all saturation . Now breathe up as though your feet have an ability to breathe, breathe up from the center of your feet, up through your body slowly, slowly, slowly, bring your breath up. And you'll notice your ribcage opens when you use that visualization to breathe up through your feet. And as you do, smile, and it kind of opens up the chest, the ribs, the heart, and this time, instead of the tongue on the roof of your mouth, I want you to open your jaw until you hear a click in your ear. And as you do, you're going to feel an opening through your jaw, your throat, your chest. It's like everything opens. And then I want you to let out a deep sigh like you're going down a slide like this. Ah. And at the end of that breath, your attention is going to be centered right in your heart space, right above your solar plexus. And this is your power center. So let's do that last part again. Breathe up through your feet, open the jaw. Ah. Now it's important to make sound. It's important to let the sound out. One of the reasons that we are not able to perceive subtle energy is the world's got us by the throat. We have learned to keep our mouth shut. Don't say anything, don't reveal your truth. Don't speak up. And when you cut this off, we cut off our capacity to feel in our heart and in our belly. So what it does is it pushes you up into your head, like, and so you're up here, ah. Allows you to drop in, and occupy the full space of who you are. Now this is a naturally soothing nerve calming thing that we do. Ah. And you end with a smile. This is natural. It's like, ah, I'm home. Ah. Then feel that experience. Just do this now, breathing up, click, open the jaw. Ah. You know what you'll notice? Your mind is quiet. So this is instant meditation, instant. You shift out of the head, you drop into your body, you're present, you're here. You can feel energy differently, you're aware. Now the next thing we're going to do is we're going to let, imagine a white light coming right out of the center of your heart where your heart beats. And we're going to imagine that that pulse of the heartbeat, that place where your heart begins to beat as a pure white light. And I want you to begin to imagine it filling your space in all six directions. Like it's expanding exponentially out of your heart space, and it's going to the space above your heart and beyond your body about two feet. Below your heart and below your feet about this far, two feet. To each side, pushing everything that's intruding upon you. Everything that is in your psyche, we're just pushing it out, ah. Above and below, front and back, and to both sides. Two feet in all directions around your body. And I want you to envision this as clear space. This is clear space. It's pushing out everything that's intruding upon you, and just keep breathing. Now a good thing to to know is that science has never discovered why the heart beats, but that is the place where your divine consciousness, where your expanded consciousness if you're not used to the word divine, or you're not comfortable, where your superconsciousness comes in, it's the part of you that gives you life. And you're clearing away all the intrusions, above and below, side to side. And that's, so you've created the container, and now this white light coming through is what I call clearing the field. So it's the space in the container. And I want you to imagine yourself in the perfect center, and you have white light all around you. You have boundaries, clear energetic boundaries. We heard the expression, give me space. Well, give yourself space, because that space energetically, above and below, front and back, and to both sides allows you to be fully present, to be quiet in the mind, to have the energy field clear, so that you can begin to notice what's going on around you and respond as opposed to being overwhelmed and rushed by energy, and react. So this is a power tool for you to create the container, clear the field. And on the side of that, other side of that, then you can be present. So this is a practice I want you to do every morning and every night, just takes a few minutes. Also, I want you to do this whenever you feel insecure, unclear, uncertain, or need guidance, because this is sort of what I call your spaceship. This is your space station if you will. You know, a lot of people say, "Give me space, give me space." I do. But this is you giving you space. You know, it's interesting in a garden, the most beautiful gardens, when you look at beautiful flowers, the most beautiful gardens, each flower uniquely has its own space, and then it can flourish, it can grow, it can respond to the environment. And it's when the everything's all bunched together that things languish. You're the same, so we want the container to be clear and sound and grounded. And with practice and consistency, this energy field becomes your natural experience. People will hit you at this place, and they won't rush in. This boundary is felt it, is experienced, and it is respected. People with power, people with, who are in command of their experience, who are at ease within their energy, are operating in this field, in this container and clear field of space. So when you create that for yourself and you reinforce it with practice in the morning, anytime during the day, that doesn't, that where you need space, and don't get in your head about just, "Do I need space? Do I feel like I want to go ah?" Ah. So the steps are breathe, look around, notice, exhale. Look within, notice, exhale. Breathe up from the bottom of your feet to your heart space. Open the ears, click, ah. Go down the slide, slide home, your power center. Breathe in the light and push everything out. Instant meditation, instant quiet, instant presence. Instant availability to be able to accurately read the energy around you. So that's your assignment, practice a lot. And notice what happens and talk with the community. What happened when I did this? Did I have any different experience? Was anything good about it? How did I feel? What awareness came through that I didn't notice? Share everything. When it comes to learning your intuition, everything counts, discount, dismiss nothing. Okay, this is a great game changing experience for you, and I'll see you tomorrow.

====================

LESSON 6: Naming Your Spirit & Your Barking Dog
--------------------
Welcome back to your sixth sense, your superpower. I love teaching this course because actually, I am not exaggerating, this is your superpower, and you need it to be able to respond to life in the best possible way, make the best possible decisions, the ones that'll take care of you, the ones that'll help your health, that'll help your relationships, the ones that'll pop in and bring in your creativity, the ones that'll keep you safe and protected, the ones that'll connect you with right place, right time, right people, synchronicity. It's all packed into this supersense. What you need to know is it is not in your head. It is not the voices bouncing back between your ears and making you crazy. Your intuition is not the voice of your ego. It is not the voice of other people's egos occupying space. It's not others' opinions. It's not what you've learned. It's not what you've read. It's not the input you're hearing on television. All of that is opinion. That is not fact or truth. Your intuition is the truth of your spirit. So now I want to introduce to you that there is a part of you that transcends your ego. There is a part of you that is your superself. Now I call that your spirit. That is your essence. That is your most elegant, graceful, expanded you. Some people are not so comfortable with the word spirit, but everybody in the world understands it; everybody does. Maybe if you lean more intellectual, it's okay. The key is to be playful. Call it your superself. Call it your superego. And we've had so many things that we've called it, but just like Shakespeare says, "A rose is a rose is a rose; by any other name, it's still a rose." So you want to know that your essence is connected to the quantum field which means the energy of the entire universe. Your ego is what we call localized awareness. It is just connected to ... not even the moment. Do you know that most of your ego, almost all of it, is connected to past input? Has nothing to do with the present, has nothing to do with the experience that you are having now. Your ego is a noisy, opinionated animal. So we're going to separate these two today, and we're going to say it is your spirit, as you like to call it, whatever, that is your intuitive guide. It is your spirit that is the part of you that knows the truth for you for now. And your ego, it's not the enemy. A lot of people, especially if you've begun a spiritual evolutionary path, sometimes you say the ego is the problem. It's not the problem. It is the assistant. Einstein said it best, the classic, classic statement of Einstein is, "A human spirit is your sacred gift and the rational mind, its faithful servant." But sadly, we've thrown away the gift, and we've become really kind of subjected to the servant, submissive to the servant. So our ego is our lower-self. It is our dutiful helper. So what I like you to perceive your ego as is your assistant, your helper. It's like your barking dog. It's like your pet dog, and it wants to help, and it wants to be good, and it wants to assist, but it's not the leader. So if you let your ego lead, your barking dog's going to be in a lot of dog fights. It's going to be patrolling the borders, and it's going to be attacking, and it's going to be defending, because your ego by nature is fearful and territorial. So if you're fearful and territorial, you're not opening up to what's available. You're just closing down and you're contracting into what's going to threaten me. So we don't want your ego to interfere. And you know what? Because your ego is like your pet, we don't shoot the dog. That's not our goal. We train the dog. We train your ego to support the leader of your life, your spirit, your intuitive, exponential, quantum-field-connected, incredible self, and your dog is the support. So how do we make that supersimple? Easy, first, I want you to take a breath. And exhale. Just feel how good that feels. Let's do it again because it feels so good. Take a deep breath. Ah. And feel how good that feels and how it quiets your brain. That calms and tames your pet. Now I want you to name your spirit. Give that expanded, intuitive, brilliant, creative, quantumly connected, gorgeous part of you a name that distinguishes, this is my guiding self. Now this is not that original. Carl Jung, who was the pioneer of intuition as he explored our psychological development, he had a name for his spirit. It was Philemon. And Conrad Hilton, who developed all the Hilton Hotels, he would sit in a dark room, and he would just say, "Leave me alone. I'm talking to my spirit." Now I've named my spirit, the part of me that knows, the part of me that tunes into the truth, the part of me that can dial into what's going on, the part of me that can inform me and connect me in the moment. I've named that part of me Bright Light. So whenever I'm going to check in with my intuition, I'm not checking in with my ego which is fearful and territorial and nervous and insecure and opinionated and reactive. I'm tuning in to Bright Light. So I go up to that exponential view, and I have that point of view be my intuitive compass. What is the name of your spirit? Isn't this fun; name your spirit? You know, Beyoncé had a spirit, you know: Sasha Fierce. What's your spirit? And a lot of people think, I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. You do know. Just listen; ask. Ask your spirit, what would you like me to call you? Now it can be Tinkerbell. It can be Barney. It doesn't matter, but see what comes up right now. Just stop the video and say, "Okay, spirit." "Okay superself." Whatever you want to call it, "What name would you like to be known by?" And please have fun with this. Be spontaneous, and don't figure it out. Now that you're back, what name did you come up with? Now I know a good part of you are going to be like, "I didn't come up with one. I just got nervous, and my brain froze." So I'm going to give you a technique to unfreeze your brain. It's a shocking one but it works. I want you to take your thumb or your fist like this, your hand with your thumb, and I want you to go, "Ha!" Frightened you, didn't it? But it's like uncorking the bottle, popping the champagne, clearing the throat, dropping in, and you pull your belly and heart, "Ha!" Not like, ha. That has no force. You clear it out, breathe. And then, instantly, quickly, say whatever name pops in first, whatever name. You could say, George. Now don't worry about getting it wrong. And besides, it's your spirit. You can change your name if you want to later, but anything to be the indicator that I am elevating to the high place of my exponential view and the truth of what is going on and takes me out of the subjective, ego part of me that's always going to be defensive. It's going to be suspicious. It's going to be protective. And frankly, that ego part of you kind of puts out a bad vibe, generally speaking, just so you know. It's a blind spot for us, but we're kind of unaware of our own energy. So now we have our beautiful spirit, whatever the name is, it could be Flower. Now be careful that you don't give it a pretentious name like Swami, Banam, Babam, Badam, Babam because that's your ego faking you out, and your ego's going to go, I'm going to stay in charge anyway, so I'm going to give you some elevated, arrogant spirit name, religious name. I wouldn't trust that, and you know how you know? Does it make you smile? Does it put a light in your eyes? That's your spirit. Does it make you contract? Does it make you frown? Is it kind of in your head? Not your spirit. Don't make this hard. Make it fun. So we have our beautiful spirit here, and the second thing is we got to name our barking dog. We got to name our ego because unless we name it, we can't train it, right? So the first fun part of this is I want you to consider what kind of dog? What kind of dog; if my ego were a dog, a protective companion, what would be the dog I would choose? What kind of nature does my ego have if it were a dog? Now, for example, my dog, if you know me, is a poodle. Now poodles are really snotty and they're like kind of arrogant, and they think they're human, and they really like to be treated well, and that's my poodle self. She likes to dress well. She likes to drink champagne. She likes to have people treat her decently, and I call her Fifi. Now Fifi is the kind of part of my nature that's very lovely if you're treating her well, but if you don't treat her well, she'll let you know. But I know that's not my spirit. So I have Bright Light who is not reactive, doesn't need approval, isn't connected to all the drama and the dog fight of the planet, just can zero out, dial in, and tune in to what's true, and that's fun. And my barking dog, she's trying to protect me, so Fifi's fun. She takes me shopping, and Fifi likes me to create and make choices that are elegant in my life, and she likes me to pamper myself, and so we're friends, but I know that she's not my guiding light. She's a fun companion as long as she doesn't try to be the boss. Now, what kind of dog is your ego? Is it a German Shepherd that patrols the borders, walking back and forth and suspecting everyone of possibly invading you? Or is it a Labrador? Is your ego like, I want to be your friend, I want to be your friend all over the place? Or is it a nervous Chihuahua? Is your ego scared and hides under the bed and just gets really small and shakes? Or maybe, some of you, I know this is happening. There's a whole bunch of you out there going, oh my God, mine is not a dog. I'm a cat. And that's for sure. So are you like the bored cat who just like, I can't be bothered with all of this because that too is your ego. So barking dog or exceptional cat, name it. You might call your cat Aloof for example, but the point is you can laugh, and you can see, okay, this is a part of me that's just trying to control things, not where I go for my intuitive guidance. I go to my spirit. That part of me is not at all in any way ever in need of approval. That part of me is never tied into the drama. That part of me is whole and complete and connected to the quantum field and can give me accurate direction at any moment. So that's your assignment today, to actually name your spirit and describe the qualities of your spirit. For example, my spirit is extremely clear, confident and spontaneous. My spirit doesn't think. It just shows up and trusts that everything will work out. My spirit can dial in and know the nature of something instantly because of practice. My spirit can sense something far away, and I have such a great relationship with my spirit, I never worry at all. I just show up because it always takes me to the best level of awareness in every moment. What is your spirit's qualities? I want you to write them down. I want you to name them. I want you to share them in the community. Tell the community, these are the qualities of my spirit, and introduce your barking dog or fluffy, aloof cat to the community as well. And what is that element of you? What is the name of that part of you? They have very different vibrations. Your spirit is open, expansive; it's elevated. And when you're in your spirit, there's some distinct signatures, always. There's a light in your eyes, always. There's a smile on your face, always. I don't care where you are in the world, always. And there's just a little wiggle and a little flex and flow in your body, always. Now, when you're in your ego, there's no light in your eyes, like this. There's no smile. Actually, your jaw gets very tight, and you do this. And the last thing that happens is you have a very tight butt. Your butt squeezes. Your hips squeeze, and you get real rigid. We call it TBS, tight butt syndrome. So that's how it is, you just kind of, down, and you're obvious, and you push the world away. So are you open? Are you flowing? Are you light, you smile and you're expansive? Or are you contracted, no light, tight jaw, tight butt? You can tell it every time and watch other people. Are they in TBS? Are they in expanded flow? They have a light, or do they have dead eyes? This is a fun, fun game-changing tool. You're going to love it. Redefines you forever and puts you in your superpower position and I will see you tomorrow.

====================

LESSON 7: Be Open, Be Honest
--------------------
Welcome back, beautiful spirit and barking dog to your sixth sense, your superpower. I hope you had fun discovering your spirit. It's like allowing your true self to finally like a genie out of the box, you know? It's like, "Finally, I have room to breathe." It's kind of what I call the container, my room to breathe. Now we've been setting up the circumstances that you need to really be intuitive. And today I want to introduce the four basic decisions you need to make in order to just take off and, it's like, turn that light on. Now the good news is this. To be intuitive is really to understand I have an inner mechanism that connects to everything, and it's hardwired. So I don't have to wire myself. I just need to know where the mechanism is. And it's not here; that's what we've been setting up, and it's not my ego. That's what we've also been setting up. And I need some space in order to really tune into where that mechanism is. That's what we've been setting up. I need to know that it's not my noisy barking dog or God forbid anyone else's noisy barking dog. So we're not going to listen to everybody's opinions. That's not it. We're in our space; we're in our spirit. Our barking dog is nice and quiet because we've taught it to breathe. And so now in that space, we have to make four decisions to activate your intuition. Imagine that you're in this beautiful mansion, just beautiful, but it's dark. The lights are out, and you don't know where the light is. So you kind of fumble around, and you look for it, and you don't want to trip, and you're really scared, and you can waste an awful lot of time, and you may never find it. But if you put yourself in that expanded space, I'll show you where the light switch is. It's right here. The light in your heart is here. This is where intuition comes through; here. And here, primarily. So you're never going to go to your head, and you're never going to go to your intellect. We learned that. We're going to go to our spirit because where does your spirit live? Right here. You know, I've been teaching for a long time, over 30 years, and I've taught all over the world. I've been in China; I've been in Canada; I've been in Argentina; I've been in Mexico. I've been across the United States, across Europe, Asia, everywhere. And I ask audiences everywhere the question, "Where does your spirit live?" And they instinctively put their hand on their heart. Nobody ever does this. I've never had, and nobody ever does this. It's like, we know, my spirit lives here. This is where the voice of guidance comes from, okay? And it kind of hovers between my heart and my solar plexus because my spirit is also protecting me. That's why you go down the slide. You breathe and slide and smile; breathe, slide, smile. That will always put you in the space of your spirit. Create the space, above, below, front, back, side to side, sort of like the genie appearing, your superself. Now the four decisions you need to make to empower your superself, to let that part of you become the leader instead of your barking dog, are first to be open to intuitive guidance. Now you think, "Well I'm open," but are you really open? Do you really have a space and a place in your perceptions to say, "My intuition is going to influence my decisions above all. What I feel for my superself is going to be the final choice. That's what's going to determine my guidance, my direction, my beingness." So are you open to that? This is, for a lot of people, a choice they haven't made yet. But I encourage you try it with me through the rest of the course, that I'm just going to be open, just open, and see what happens. Now I use the metaphor of being open like a radio receiver. So unless you turn it on, you're not going to receive anything, and that's what being open is. It's like imagine you go into a radio, and you turn it on. Okay, here. So that's step one. Now step two is even more intentional. And that is this. Expect your intuition to be present and to guide you. Expect that direct connection to work. You're hardwired. Your gut, your heart is hardwired for guidance. So when you turn it on by taking your attention here through breathing, breathe and slide right home, turn it on, and now you start expecting your intuition to guide you. And how do you do that? You ask it. It's a simple thing. I grew up with a mom who was completely deaf, had no education because she was a refugee of the war, and she didn't go to school past 12. She didn't speak the language when she came to America as a war bride; she had no outer influences. All she had was her spirit. But her spirit saved her life. Her spirit met my father. Her spirit brought her to America. Her spirit made her life work. So when I grew up, she would always ask us, she would say, "Don't listen to what other people say. Don't count on what appearances are in front of you. Don't listen to anybody else's opinion. Ask your spirit, 'What do I feel?' What does your spirit feel?" I remember one time, I would say, I would ask my mom as a teenager, I had this idea that I was going to go out to a party and sneak out and we're going to smoke pot, and we're going to do all kinds of bad things. And I had this whole plan with my mom that I was going to tell her I was going to go babysitting. And so I go toodling up to her as a 15-year-old and I say, "Mom, can I babysit tonight? I got a job; can I babysit?" Of course, I'm just lying through my teeth. And she looks at me and said, "You know what? Before I give you an answer, what does your spirit feel?" Like, darn! Because my barking dog had a whole plan, but my spirit told me, "This is not a good idea." You know what happened? I didn't go to the party, and I was really bummed out because I couldn't live with the dissonance and the incongruity. But that party was raided. And at that time all the drugs were very illegal, and half of my friends got arrested. Protected me. I was bummed in the moment, but my spirit gave me the guidance, "Don't go." It also gave me the guidance, "Don't lie." So that's a very important part of intuition. You have to be open, but you can only be open if you're going to be honest. Your intuition won't work if you're not honest. And so you have to get clear that it's about the truth. It isn't about what's right; it isn't about what's wrong. That's opinion; that's barking dog. Because right or wrong according to who? What's right for me is wrong for you, and right for you and wrong for me, and so we'll never go there. We go to the third space. The third space is what feels true. True feels true. Not what I think. What feels true for me. Not for everyone, just for me, for now, in this moment. That is the front door into intuition. It opens and invites you in. You have to be willing to ask what feels true for me and then stand by that. So being open and expecting that to guide you will happen if you're honest. Now, the interesting thing is most people want to live this alternate reality that doesn't want to deal with truth, that doesn't want to deal with what's real. That's like, I have had people as I've done intuitive readings my whole life. I've had people come and say, "I don't want to hear anything bad." And I just smile and I say, "Well, what do you consider bad? Information that's truthful but, well, it might disappoint you? For now, but could save you a big heartache later?" I remember I read for one woman. She said, "I just met the man of my dreams. I don't want to hear anything bad. I just want you to, but I want you to tell me what you intuitively feel." It's like, "I can't; you just blocked me." Because what I'm feeling isn't mirroring what you want to control. So here's the bottom line. Don't ask your intuition to guide you unless you want to hear a real answer. And you might think that's obvious, but pretty much about 80% of the time, we may not. We want to hear an alternative answer. We want to hear, "That guy loves you." Or, "She's my partner." Or, "That job's the best." Or, "You're going to make a million dollars," instead of the truth which can give you the foundation to actually have the experiences and attract the experiences that you want. So you have to be open and expect your intuition to guide you with the truth of a situation, the truth. Not the absolute empirical truth for the whole world, just for you, right now. That's the key to living an intuitive life instead of being constantly disappointed, constantly wasting time, and telling yourself things that aren't true. So, you know what this boils down to? Don't betray yourself. Don't want to betray your inner guidance by saying, "Well, I go to this job and it'll eventually get better." Or, "I have to do it." Or, "I need to stay in this relationship." Because the truth is you hate it. The truth, which your intuition is trying to say is, "Look, I'll get you out of this mess and take you to where it'll work for you, but you got to want it." And this is really the bottom line, and we can't go forward unless you're willing to be honest with yourself. Now, the reason why we don't want to is because we want to believe some alternate reality that one of my teachers called "emotional bullshit". Pardon me, and that's pretty intense, but it is. We give ourselves a lot of feedback that, "No, this is really okay; this is going to be fine." And everything within the container in the field is chaos, saying, "Alert, alert, alert! "Wrong place, wrong time, wrong relationship." It'll never be right for you. Now that is something that's really essential if you want to live an intuitive life. Now here's the thing. I'm breaking this down to four steps. And we're only on the first two: be open, and expect your intuition to guide you with the truth. And you want to be willing to hear the truth, but... The truth will set you free. You have to think about, "Okay, maybe I'll be disappointed." I'm going to give you a quick story. A woman came to me for an intuitive reading. She said, "I just got the best job offered to me. "It's a dream job; it's to run a startup in San Francisco. They want to move me right there. The price of the salary is beyond exponential. I will be wealthy, and we have to go next month. I just want you to read and let me know what you see." And I just said, "I don't see that it'll pan out." And she got really angry with me. I said, "I feel like it sounds good. It looks good on paper, but this isn't going to work out. There's something about this that isn't correct." And so she left, she said, "I'm disappointed." But she got mad at me. So like, bam, shoot the messenger. But I didn't see that, wasn't what she was hearing, wasn't the truth. Well, you know, she went. And that company collapsed shortly after she got there. She disrupted her whole family. She ended up right back where we were in Chicago. I looked at her and said, "Did you really not know? Did you really not feel it? Did you really not?" She said, "I did. I just didn't want to." And that's exactly why most people are not intuitive. People actually do get intuition all the time. You do; I know you do. That's not the trick; that is not the challenge. The challenge is are you going to be honest enough with yourself to listen? So I just want to sit and end this lesson with my favorite fairytale. The fairytale of the intuitive person is "The Princess and the Pea". If you don't remember the fairytale, there was a princess. The prince needed to have a bride, but she had to pass a test. And the test was to sleep on top of 100 mattresses under which the bottom mattress was placed a little tiny pea. And the princess, the true princess, had to notice that. So everybody came and tried out, then slept, and then the queen would say, "How'd it go?" "Oh, great. I slept so well." And they were shown the door. One said, "Oh, you know, "I don't mean to be rude, and I don't want to disrupt, and I know that you did your best but I could not sleep all night. What what under the mattress?" Aha. She proved to be the true princess. She passed the test. She married the prince. She inherited the kingdom. So what does that mean? The princess is your intuition. It needs a partner, your intellect, your ego; that's the prince, and the kingdom is the expanded, exponential superlife. But it didn't happen. It wasn't enough to feel the pea; she had to say so. She had to acknowledge it. She had to be truthful, be honest. So this is a big deal. It'll change your life, but you have to do this. You have to get honest. Maybe you're not in the habit of being that honest with yourself, but do. I want you to write down the questions in your life today that you really are troubled about; write them down. "What troubles me? What decision am I troubled about? Should I, shouldn't I, yes or no?" Breathe and slide. Ask your spirit; write it down. Ask your barking dog, just for comparison, or write it down. And then sit with it. And I'll see you tomorrow.

LESSON 7: Meditation: Light Up Your Daily Intention With Intuition
--------------------

Take a look around the room and notice exactly where you are in this moment, bringing your attention out of the past or the concerns and worries of the future.

Breathe in through the nose and allow yourself to get perfectly comfortable, either seated in a chair with your feet on the floor and your back straight, or, if you prefer, lying on a bed.

Take a few moments to adjust your body so that you feel able to relax.

Once again, breathe in through the nose and enjoy the feeling of this breath washing through your body. As you exhale, allow the energy that you’re holding on to—or that is holding on to you—to begin to lift out and wash away, turning back to the light as you exhale, leaving you in clear space: peaceful, relaxed, the quiet mind.

Breathe.

Bring your attention now to the center of your forehead and allow all the tension from that very spot, and throughout your forehead and around and behind your eyes, to begin to melt away.

With it, your mind becomes very quiet. All the chatter gives way to a deep inner peace.

As you exhale, allow your awareness to drift from your forehead all the way to the center of your heart.

Breathe.

As you breathe, can you imagine how peaceful and relaxed your emotions feel? No concerns, no worries, no troubles, no anxiety. Just completely at ease, calm like a mountain lake at sunrise on a beautiful day.

Breathing in, notice at the very center of your heart a beautiful light connected to your heartbeat, like a golden flame that becomes brighter with each breath you take. Breathing in and out.

Notice how this flame pulls you in, so that with your awareness you become one with the flame. You are the flame.

Breathing in, your light becomes stronger. Breathing out, the light within you expands and begins to fill your entire body—above and below your heart, front and back, into both sides and beyond the edges—until you find yourself a beautiful illuminated light of inner knowing.

You recognize that this is the light of your divine intuitive spirit: the part of you that knows, the part of you that sees, the part of you that connects to the truth of what serves you at the highest level throughout each day.

This inner truth is the part of you that moves you toward opportunity, creativity, connection, and love. This inner light naturally moves you away from disturbance, danger, anything that is inharmonious with your spirit, your integrity, your safety, and your joy.

Breathing in, allow this light to become stronger and brighter, knowing that this is the guiding light of your life.

Surrender into this light and feel how good it feels to recognize and reconnect to this brilliant inner intuitive intelligence that can lead you moment to moment—gracefully, easily, almost magically—through each day.

Like a beautiful dance, like a beautiful choreography with the universe, illuminating your mind with creative, inspirational ideas and the way to execute them; leading you toward people who will help you and away from those who will hold you back; strengthening your body, increasing your vitality, enhancing your joy and confidence, and moving you away from everything that would invite you to compromise or betray your spirit.

Breathe and enjoy this beautiful light, surrendering into complete confidence, allowing this light to become the guiding force of your life today and every day as it is naturally designed.

Breathing in, notice how peaceful your mind has become, knowing that you are no longer troubled by figuring things out or second-guessing—uncertain and unsure.

Your inner light, your intuitive guiding light, knows what is best. All you must do is be aware of its energy, its subtle vibration originating in the heart and reverberating throughout your entire body—guiding you with frequency and vibration, a feeling that is not emotional but energetic, clear, grounded, calm, and relaxed.

Breathe.

Notice how peaceful your emotions are, knowing that you are connected to the part of you that knows the truth: what is best for you, what is best for your body, what is best for your relationships, what is best for your creative expression, and what brings the best out of you to contribute to the world.

Breathe.

Relax.

Feel this illuminating light pulsating through every cell in your body, clearing away all confusion, calming your mind, replacing thinking with absolute knowing, replacing uncertainty with clarity, and replacing physical stress with peace, calm, and grounded security.

As you breathe, surrendering into this guiding intuitive light—the light of your truth and spirit—notice how everything begins to ease, open, and relax in your entire being.

Breathing, listen to the guidance of your heart, not in words, but in subtle pulsating vibration of inner knowing. Know that this pulse of inner knowing will be with you throughout the day and every day with your breath.

Breathe in and exhale.

Breathing in, the light becomes stronger. Breathing out, you release everything into perfect knowing.

Bring your attention back to your body, back to the sounds and feeling of the room around you, back to the confidence inside of you, back to the light guiding you, back to the peace fulfilling you.

Very gently bring your attention back to whatever is supporting you. Then gently rub your hands together and place them over your eyes.

Allow your eyes to gently open.

Bring your awareness back to the room, opening your eyes gently, breathing in with confidence, knowing your inner guiding light is leading you throughout the day—and that this day will be the best day ever.


--------------------
LESSON 7: Meditation: Relax Into Your Intuitive Spirit Voice
--------------------

Take a deep breath and look around the room, allowing yourself to notice exactly where you are in this moment.

Breathe in through the nose gently and slowly.

Make yourself perfectly comfortable. Turn off your phone. Turn off the lights. Make certain you won’t be disturbed. This time is for you.

Either lie down or find a comfortable spot in a chair where you can place your feet on the floor and allow your back to relax so your body can unwind.

Feel supported and safe.

Without rushing, take another look around the room, reassuring your ego and your emotions that you are indeed safe to close your eyes and turn inward for the next little while.

With the next breath, breathe in through the nose, and exhale as though you’re blowing out candles. With it, allow your eyes to close.

Imagine that you’re releasing this day and all the tension you’ve accumulated and that has been holding on to you, giving you some space, some freedom, some rest to breathe.

This time, imagine breathing up from the ground and through your feet if you are seated, or up through your entire legs, back, and spine, even your head if you’re lying down. Feel the support of the earth beneath you and the vibration of unconditional love coming into every cell of your body, to the best of your imagination.

As you exhale, let go of everything that doesn’t serve you, doesn’t support you, doesn’t belong to you—giving it back to the light, back to the earth. Vibrations, frequencies, and energy that don’t belong to you. Energy from the past. Energy from other people.

Exhale and breathe in refreshing light.

Once again, as you exhale, imagine breathing out everything that doesn’t support or serve you: your troubles, your anxiety, your fears, other people’s fears. Exhale everything that doesn’t belong to you—responsibilities others have put on you, expectations you’ve carried that served no purpose.

Release everything back to the light as you breathe in through the nose, now out through the nose, allowing the attention around your eyes, behind your eyes, even through the back of your head and jaw, to completely drain out.

With it, you begin to notice your mind becoming quieter, just by releasing and breathing—letting go, easing the tension around your eyes, relaxing all the stress in your forehead.

Take a nice deep inhale without raising your shoulders or forcing. Then release a slow, calming sigh.

Imagine your awareness shifting from your head and the outer world and settling deep into the center of your heart, where you feel as though you’ve come home.

Breathe gently in through the nose and out.

Notice how good it feels just to breathe and be quiet—to be out of your mind, out of thoughts and the noise of the world, in the quiet, calming center of your heart.

Breathe in more deeply, gently, without raising your shoulders or forcing. Relax and allow the breath to rush in.

Imagine that in the very center of your heart there is a bright light, almost like a golden candle flame, connected to your heartbeat. It feels familiar, comforting, and draws you in with your breath.

Focus more closely on this inner light and how the light and your heartbeat are one and the same.

Breathing in, imagine becoming the flame, noticing how natural it feels. In fact, it is true—you are this flame of divine knowing. You are one with the light in your heart.

As you exhale, notice how all tension and worry naturally fall away, as though they belong to another universe, not yours.

In your universe, everything is peaceful and calm, and with the benefit of this beautiful guiding light, everything is perfectly clear.

Breathing in, see the light. As you exhale, realize that this guiding light communicates with you clearly—not through words, but through something more subtle: energy, vibration, inner knowing.

It guides you like an inner teacher, an inner leader, filling you with understanding that transcends thought and effort. There is no figuring things out. It simply becomes clear.

Breathing in and out, you find yourself drawn to this light, as though it is the missing piece you’ve been looking for. It feels so good to merge with this inner knowing.

You may have heard of your inner guide, your intuition, but now you are experiencing a reconnection to this inner intelligence. It is clearer than anything you could describe.

Without thinking, without effort, you simply know what is right, true, and good for you—what is possible, what will protect you, what is in harmony with your true self.

There is no effort. It is as clear as your breath.

Breathing in this light of inner knowing feels like deep healing, as though a lost part of you has found its way back. Every cell in your being relaxes, relieved that your inner light and inner knowing are once again present, illuminated, and engaged.

Breathing in, breathing out.

Listening to your inner light, your mind becomes alert, attentive, quiet, and available to follow guidance. This feels true. There is no struggle, no resistance—only relief.

Your true leader takes residence once again: your inner knowing, your intuition, your guiding light.

Notice how your emotions calm, like rough waves settling into a peaceful, rippling lake. Fear drains out of your body as you breathe. Your intuition takes over—it knows.

You know what is good, true, and correct for you. Accept and embrace this divine power.

Breathing in, this inner light grows stronger. This inner knowing becomes clearer. It communicates—not exactly as a voice, not exactly as images, but as energetic truth: real, safe, and powerful.

As you breathe in through the nose, part of you awakens, as though something lost is restored. You move out of chaos and struggle and into grounded, confident calm.

Your intuition guides you. Your inner light illuminates the path. There is nothing to fear. There is no wrong decision. There is no confusion. You know when to step forward and when to step away.

This knowing is not emotional, but vibrational—deep, steady, and true.

Breathing in, you relax, knowing there is no need to fumble in the dark any longer. No need to give your power away or feel unsafe or unclear.

Surrendering into this knowing quiets your mind and gives you space to breathe. In that space comes inspiration—new ideas that feel joyful and possible because your inner guidance will show you how.

You know you will be led into wonderful relationships, or guided to transform the ones you have. You know you will move forward naturally toward what serves your spirit and your ability to create, contribute, and receive at the highest level.

No struggle. No worry. No anxiety.

You know.

Your inner teacher, your intuition, your inner light knows.

As you surrender into this guidance, every part of you relaxes.

Breathe.

Marvel at the deep relaxation, peace of mind, ease in your body, calm in your emotions, and joy that comes from placing your inner knowing in charge of your life.

Something deep is healed. Something misaligned is corrected. Something powerful is happening.

Bring your attention back to your body, noticing how calm and at ease you feel. Back to your heart, back to the light.

Bring awareness to your emotions—peaceful and steady. Back to your mind—quiet and listening. Your inner light can be trusted to guide you now and always.

Back to your body. Back to your breath.

Rest in absolute confidence that all going forward is safe and well.

All is good.

Follow your breath. Follow your light.

Gently allow yourself to enter the day, or drift into sleep, or simply rest—whatever serves you in this moment.

Know that your inner guiding intuitive light, the part of you that always knows what is best, is now back in charge.

You are safe.
You are supported.
You are secure.
You are loved.
You are creative and successful.
You are in divine flow with your purpose.
You are at ease.

And so it is.

Part 2 - Master Your Intuitive Guidance

====================

LESSON 8: Clear the Path
--------------------
Welcome back. We're now at Week Two. So, I want to congratulate you for all that you've done so far, and I hope that you're having a good experience and really starting to remember, to wake up that natural super, exciting, expansive, creative, in-the-know, glorious part of you that is in your heart. And that you're beginning to get the feel, the vibration, the excitement, the energy of living a life that isn't blocked or structured or controlled, but really allows you to be your most authentic, creative, expansive self. The key is you can trust yourself, and that's what you're learning. So, we are going to begin this week by clearing the path. And we're going to address some of the blocks and some of the ways to get past the blocks without diving into the garbage of the blocks. I mean, we can go over what they are and why they're there, but we could also just bypass them. So, one of the things to do is know that your intuition comes through the other side of your brain. It's not your left brain. It's not your logic brain. It's your creative, curious brain. And so, we're going to start with a brand new tool right off the bat. And the name of that tool is "I Wonder". So, just say out loud with me right now, "I wonder," and notice what happens. Just notice. I wonder. First thing that happens is your eyes go up. You're not going into that frown, that place of, "I got to figure it out." I wonder. Just feel the words of that. It kind of puts you into a place of listening. So, notice that. I wonder. Your head will turn. Your conversation and your internal conversation will stop, and you will actually be open to learning something new. And this is what intuition is. The logic brain is always saying, "I know. I know. I know. I got that. I understand. I've been there," because it's working from yesterday. I wonder puts you in a brand new place of being receptive and allowing yourself to receive something new. Something you didn't expect. So, our very first tool is to play a game called, "I wonder". And the way you play the game is you actually question out loud and wonder about things that you know nothing about. And there's three rules to the game. The first rule is you have to play the game willing to be, not needing to be right. Not needing to be right. We're going to let go of that attachment. When I play, "I Wonder", I don't have to be right in the game. The second thing is you have to be willing to be wrong. Even more so. I'm willing to completely blow it. To be wrong. I mean, that is what stops so many of us so much of the time in our lives. I can't be wrong. Because we have some big, ancient feeling that comes up from our past, from our schooling, from our education, from our upbringing that, "Oh my God, if I am wrong, there is a catastrophic consequence." So in this game, no consequences. We're actually going to welcome the idea that I could be wrong. And so what? We're going to give ourselves that freedom. And the third is that you can't ask anybody else if you're right or wrong because we are now jumping out of the world of right and wrong which is really barking dog to barking dog. And we're going to jump into a third space. And this is the space where we intuitives live. And that space is a space of what feels true for me in the moment, for now. So, here we go. Let me start giving you some ideas. I wonder why the sky is blue? And then you play; if you play with someone else, the only response they can give you back is, "I wonder." I wonder what we're going to have for lunch. Hmm. I wonder? I wonder if I will go on vacation to Tahiti this year. Hmm. I wonder. Now, your intellect is going to jump right in and say, "You're not going to Tahiti. And you know what we're having for lunch." And that's what happens instantly. And that's a part of you that ruins it all. So, you have to let yourself wonder, and not let your barking dog bite your butt with its reprimands that you can't wonder and this is what's right. So, the imagination is the front door to intuition, and wonder is the front door to imagination. And we have lost our capacity to wonder which is the ability to open up to new possibility. Leonardo DaVinci would have his students wonder, aloud, about 100 things a day. I wonder how those petals turned purple and fuchsia. I wonder how you make, I wonder who designed this cloth. I wonder what play I'm going to write next year. I wonder if I'll fall in love. I wonder. Now, be aware of that barking dog that's growling in the corner and wants to say, "You're not going to do any of that. Who do you think you are?" And the way you get around the barking dog is you laugh. You laugh. Shut up. You don't know. The ego mind's like, "I know." You don't. So, when you hear that, say out loud, "You don't know. All you know is what happened yesterday. You don't know what's going to happen tomorrow." So, I had a woman that was playing this game in one of my workshops with another guy, and the guy was there semi-committed. He was there, but he wasn't there, there. And as they're playing the game, she said to him, "I wonder if you're going to fall in love with a foreigner and move to a foreign country?" And he instantly broke the rules, and he said, "No, I'm not. I have no intention." And she said, "You broke the rules. Your barking dog has tight butt syndrome. You can't do this." So, we tried again and she said, "I wonder if you're going to maybe fall in love and move to a foreign country." So he said, "Okay, I wonder." You know, you can really feel how that ego wants to stay in control and doesn't want to surrender. So, they go on and she writes to me six months later. He was on a flight to San Francisco, and he met a woman who lived in Beijing, but she was from Germany. And they started up a relationship. He fell in love with her. Last she said, "I think he's on his way to Beijing. And who knows if he'll end up in Germany." And I said, "I wonder." So, that's what we want to do is learn to play in this space where we are not in the structure and the constriction of always needing to know. Because if we're just always needing to know, all you're going to be working with is memory, other people's opinions, and past experiences that are not informing you in the moment. So, your first assignment today is to get used to playing "I wonder", and play the game of how many things can I wonder about. So, your friend calls you up and says, "I have a terrible problem with my partner, and I'm going to complain, and this is what's going on. And what do you think?" Now, you can let your barking dog get in there and will have plenty to say, or you can say, "I have no idea. I wonder." That stops the control because the minute you wonder everybody's just got boosted up into the third space. So, wonder is something you have to reactivate. When's the last time you said, "I wonder"? Or even better, when's the last time you actually did wonder. Actually wondered. So, I have to tell you another story because the barking dog really likes to ruin the game. I was teaching a workshop in a beautiful place in upstate New York called Omega. And I had about 40, 50 students at the time. One of the women there was again, she wanted to be there just like you want to be here. You showed up. Even if your barking dog's like, "I don't know. I'm suspicious." You want to be here 'cause you're here. And so she was playing in the game and got very annoyed with the partner that she was working with. Very annoyed. And came up to me and she said, "This game is stupid. I can't do this. This is wasting my time." I said, "Okay, well before you leave, tell me what brings you to this conclusion?" She said, "Well, when I'm playing I wonder, all I could say to my partner is 'I wonder if you need jelly beans.'" She said, "I was embarrassed to say that." And I said, "Well, did you say that?" She said, "No, I didn't say that. That's stupid." And I said, "You don't know if it's stupid. You don't know. Your barking dog's telling you it's stupid. But you don't know." So she went back and she said, "Okay." She, of course, she was no fun to play with. I just have to make that known. But she went back to her very patient partner, who was holding the space for her, and she said, "All right. I'm in the game again. I wonder if you need jelly beans." Well, the woman instantly burst into tears, and she said, "What's the matter. Why; why this?" And she said, "My husband died a few months ago, and I'm trying to get over it. It's why I'm in this workshop. And my neighbor who lives not far from me, her dog just had puppies. And she offered me a puppy, and his name is Jelly Beans." And it just stopped them both. So, when your brain says, "I know." You don't know. You have no idea. And it's so fun to live in the third space. So, that's what this is about. Part B. I'm going to give you a tool that's going to liberate you if you can actually put it to use. The tool is "I don't know." I don't need to know. My intuition will guide me. I don't know. I don't need to know. Okay. There might be a time where you do need to know. I need to know if I'm taking an airplane, what time it leaves. I need to know I'll get the ticket. There are places and times where I know. It's just anchoring yourself in the physical world and time and space. But when we're talking about other people's experience, we're talking about your creativity, we're talking about possibility, we're talking about relationship, we're talking about creativity at work, you don't know. Can you go to that third space? And what I've noticed, 'cause I've been teaching for a long time, that actually we are educated to need to know. To have the right answer. It scares us to not know. Because when we were little kids and we were getting graded and tested all the time, if we didn't know and we got a bad grade, we lost value. We maybe were humiliated. We were maybe given a punishment. We were maybe mocked by our peers. So, we've gotten really integrated feedback that not knowing is the worst. Well, you're not that little kid anymore. And you don't need approval and grades from others. You don't. "I don't know" is your taking your power back. But here's how you have to play the game. You can't waste time between wondering and going to this place. So, let's wonder together. I wonder, for example, if I could write a book. I had a client who said, I said to her, "You're creative. I see you're very creative." And she immediately said, "I'm not. I'm not creative. I wouldn't call myself creative at all." And I said, "That's interesting because as I look at your energy, I see you completely creative. I wonder if you create fun things for people." She goes, "Oh, well actually, I do. I help people create videos that really help them in their work. I help them with the little vignettes. I help them with the dialogue. I help them with the structures." I said, "Oh, I wonder if that's creative." She started laughing. See our brains get the idea like creative means paint a picture or play piano. So, we don't even see what's actually so. So I wonder how I can be more creative. I wonder if I could write a play. I wonder if I can make a movie. I wonder if that person across the room can be my new best friend. I wonder. Or I wonder if I actually picked up the phone and called someone that's been on my mind, it might be a really good idea. We might have a perfect synchronicity. Now, your barking dog is going to say, "Don't take the risk. Don't put yourself out there. Don't try anything at all that's going to get you in trouble." But when you live in the intuitive world, we don't live in the world of anybody's approval. So, there is no risk for trouble. So, I wonder. Now, here's the final piece about this. Your barking dog doesn't know how to play. Your barking dog is much too afraid, much too insecure, much too worried about losing control. So, only your expanded self, the spirit I asked you to name, your essence, can play the game. Not your barking dog. So, I want you to wonder about a hundred things a day out loud. I want you to write down a hundred wonderings. Get your phone and record a hundred wonderings. Invite people to wonder. Go to our community, and bounce it back and forth with one another and see how outrageous you can be. See how many crazy things you can wonder about because that's what opens the intuitive umbrella to receive and have drop in brilliant creative ideas. Someone wondered if we can go to Mars. Someone wondered if we could transplant organs. Someone wondered if we could break the DNA code. I wonder what you'll wonder. Have fun with this, and I'll see you tomorrow.

====================

LESSON 9: Intuition Is the Great Disruptor & That's a Good Thing
--------------------
Welcome back to your sixth sense. I'm sure you're actually starting to feel now this could be a superpower. I'm loving it. I wonder. Wonder if you're feeling it. I am, and I'm so excited because we have even something better to learn today, and that is we're going to address the biggest reason why people hesitate to use their superpower. Because I know, I've been teaching a long time. I have talked to people for so many years really intimately. I know that you know your inner voice is working. I know you're actually hearing it and feeling it and sensing it and receiving it. I know you are, but you've been playing hide and seek with it. And la la la, I don't hear, and I'm too busy, and I'm on, you know I'm so in my busyness that I can't really stop, but that's exactly what you have to do. Intuition stresses us a little because it's the great disruptor. The whole point of our intuition is to help us make the best decisions. And so consequently, it often suggests just in the middle of our rock and roll life to do something different. And that really irritates your barking dog, that just really sets off all the alarms. "I can't do something different. I have to keep doing what's expected of me. I'm going to upset people. I'm going to make a problem. I'm going to cause myself trouble." That's exactly what your intuition may ask, in the moment, for the greater outcome in the long run. I call this the willingness to dance in the fire and in the heat of resistance. So I'm going to give you a couple examples. When I first got married years ago, I had this great ambition along with my brand new husband that we're going to buy a house. And he knew me to be a bit intuitive. Actually he knew me to be a lot intuitive, but he wasn't that familiar with what it's like to live with this energy. So we use our visualization because I'm very good at that and I decide all, I, we name all the things we want. And within two days, two days, we find the perfect house. It has all the requirements. It's beautiful. It has a yard. It has a fireplace. I mean, these are a big deal for us as a young couple, to be able to find something that ticked all our boxes that we could afford. And so we put in a bid on the house, and we put a very low bid 'cause we had no money. And I said, "Please, please, please ask them to sell it to us because we really need this house. It's perfect for us." So the realtor, she kind of feels emotionally attached and likes our enthusiasm. She said, "Okay, I'll do what I can." Well, she talked him into agreeing. We're going to get the house. We're going to close on the house in three weeks or four weeks, and we're going to have the house. Yay. Right. Except about a week later I woke up and I said to my husband, "I have a bad vibe; we can't buy the house." He's like, "What?" And I said, "Can't buy the house. It's a bad vibe; something's wrong." And he goes, "What; what?" I said, "I don't know. I don't know, but we can't do it." And he said, "We're going to do it." And I said, "We're not going to do it." He said, "We are going to do it." And I said, "You do it alone then; I'm not going to do it with you." Welcome to the world of intuition. So he looked at me, he said, "I can't believe this; you talked them into it; now what are we going to say?" And I said, "Tell 'em I don't have a good vibe. Tell 'em I have a bad vibe." He goes, "She'll think you're nuts." I said, "She'll think I'm nuts anyway." And he said, "Okay, you tell her. I'm not going to do this with you." So that's another story. So I did; I called the realtor and I said, "I'm sorry but I have to, we have to withdraw our bid on the house. I can't have it." "Again, "Why?" My tool, "I don't know. I wonder why, but we can't do it." She said, "Well, you have to." I said, "I don't have to." She said, "Well, you're going to lose all your down payment." And I said, "I'm okay with that because it'll be better than what I'm feeling and I can't explain." I said, "Tell 'em I'm psychic. That'll just, that'll upset them." And it did; they didn't want to deal with that. They didn't want to get into that. That was too creepy for them. So they said, "Okay, you're out of the house. We got to move on. Get away from this weird person." Okay. Comes and goes. No big deal. My husband's pissed at me. I'm incredibly relieved, and I wondered why. Three weeks come, we're supposed to own this house. Nothing happens. Four days after we were to have owned the house, it starts to rain in Chicago where this was occurring and rain and rain and rain and rain for six weeks. And that house was on a flood plain, and that house flooded. Took me almost two months before that information came back and we were spared. Phew! Dodged a bullet. But I took a lot in the meantime. But the realtor called me up and said, "I'm really impressed, I can't believe that happened." Now you've had those moments where you could have made a choice, and yet maybe you didn't listen. Maybe what happened to you instead was, "Oh, why didn't I listen? Why didn't I do it? I knew it. I felt it, but I froze." Let me give you another story. A more recent one. A couple years ago, I was in Chicago. I used to live there, and I was making my annual summer trip to Paris with my family. There were four of us and two friends. So there were six of us. So we go and we get our tickets, and we get our boarding passes, and we're standing in line waiting to board the plane. All of a sudden I had an intuition not to go. And I immediately walked over to the counter, and I asked the woman at the counter. I said, "Hi, I don't mean to upset you. I know you're really busy right now, but can we take a different flight?" She looked at me like, "What are you talking about?" And I said, "Well..." She said, "I just gave you boarding passes. The flight's ready to board." I said, "I know, but can we have a different flight today?" And she said, "Absolutely not; you can't have a different flight. Your flight's in 20 minutes; we're boarding." And I said, "Well, will you humor me and just look; just see if there's another plane going a little later?" And she thought I was a nut case. And her partner who was working the flight saw how irritated she was with me. So he comes out and he goes, "Can I help you?" And I said, "Yeah, I'd like to see if you can just check to see if we can take a different flight." He said, "What are you talking about? It's going right now." I said, "Well, I just want to know if there's a different flight." He goes, "Why?" And I said, "I don't know. I wonder. I just feel it." So he said, "You can't." Well, I travel a lot, so I kind of pulled rank. I said, "You know I'm one of your, like one of your highest flyers. I've been doing this for years, so could you just please amuse me?" So she starts looking, she's clearly annoyed because honestly she needs to board the flight; slam, slam slam. No, no, no. Full, full, full. And then I said, "By the way, there's six of us." She honestly, I thought she'd punch me in the face by then. Two seconds later the captain comes out, and he whispers in her ear, "This flight has a mechanical; it's not going anywhere." And her eyes popped up, and she said, "How did you know?" And I said, "I just had a vibe. I felt it. My intuition." She was so shocked and surprised, she starts tapping, tapping, tapping, slams out six boarding passes, and says, "Get out of here; get out of here quick; 300 passengers aren't going anywhere." So I grab the boarding passes, and we go running away. My family's used to me, knows to follow me although they don't know what the heck is happening. I was like, "Let's go." So we go running down the corridor of the terminal, and I hear the announcement, "Excuse me, we're sorry to say this flight has a mechanical. It won't be going anywhere. Please go to customer service." While I'm looking at six boarding passes to go to Paris. And guess what? One of them was first class. Yes! That's what it is to be the disruptor, to embrace the disruption, reframe it as your helper, as your protector, as a thing that's going to save the day, not ruin the day. However, as I pointed out, you have to be willing to stand in the face of the resistance. You have to be willing to take what I call the stink eye. You have to take the resistance, the "Why?" And so that's why I introduced prior to this, the tool, "I don't know." I don't need to know. Now this is really empowering, but it takes a little practice; you got to build these muscles. So guess what the first thing to do is, and you won't believe it. You have to dance. I mean really surrender to dancing. Now why that? Because when you actually dance, now I'm not talking about the white man at the wedding dance, you know the shoulders and the tight butt, and you're like bobbing back and forth. I'm talking about surrendering to the energy that moves you, moves your hips, moves your legs, moves your feet, moves your body, and gets you from not thinking, and empowers you to move with the energy in the moment. That's the energy you need to be intuitive. You can't sit and think about it and analyze it, and, "Is this right or wrong?" 'Cause you just left the third space. You're back in right and wrong. You're back in the dog fight. So every day I want you to dance for a few minutes. And you know, you know if you're barking dogs are like, "Woof, woof, woof; I'm not going to dance." You know, it's like, "Oh, come on, get off my tight butt." And you know, just leave me be; let me have some fun. Put on some music; dance in the shower; sing in the shower. La la la la la, just let yourself be expressive, and give up the contracted control of the ego. So dancing is a decision to trust your spontaneous nature because that's what dancing is. It's feeling energy and going with it. And that is the key element to living an intuitive life. You don't feel it, think about it, then shuffle around. That's a drag; don't bother. That actually is going to suck everybody else's energy off them around you. And you become the draino. You need to surrender and play, play; dance the fire. Now the other thing is when you do disrupt, people will be upset. So you have to have some tools that will help temper that; you don't want to get in a fight. So here's a good tool which my mom taught me. My dad was so tight butt and my mom was so spontaneous, and she would look at him and say, "Humor me; humor me. I know I'm crazy; humor me." Not you have to do that; I need you to do this. 'Cause that'll never get you anywhere. Like I said to the airline, I said, "Could you just please look; just give it a go." And when I got out of the house, I said, "I know I'm crazy. I'm not going to resist the perception, but I am going to tell you it works for me. I'm going with it." Now of course you don't want to put your entire security on the line day one, but how about little things? How about when you're in the flow and your friends say, "Hey, let's all go out." And your vibe says, "Not tonight." You can say, "That's such a good idea, but doesn't feel, it's not working for me right now." So you might disrupt the party, but who knows what you're avoiding. Part B, don't care; don't need to know. Don't need to know; let it go. You're in the third space. Now this is a whole new way of living. I get it. But I guarantee you it's a better way. It is a better way. You will be spared so many things that your barking dog leads you right into. If you just say, "I don't know I don't need to know. I'm going to dance through this. It works for me." So dance for three minutes; dance and breathe for three minutes. Pick your favorite song. One you know the words to, sing it out loud in the shower, and dance as hard and as loud as you can. Second, practice. It works for me. I know, it's like, be jujitsu with it. Be a little Kung Fu; don't fight it. Go with it. "Yeah, I know it's weird. Yeah, I know that's crazy. It works for me; amuse me." "I'm going to try, I'm sorry it's disruptive, but I got to be true to myself." Write down as many ways that you can, and share on the community page your ways of dancing in the fire; post a video if you can. Dance in the fire; it's fun. And I'll see you tomorrow.

LESSON 10: Notice the Signs
--------------------
Welcome back to your sixth sense, your superpower. Now, we're getting into a rhythm now. I hope that you're beginning to experience life from the third space. Just a little bit more aware, more present, more paying attention. So let's just start by paying attention to what's around you. Look around; look at me; notice what's different. That's a very important skill. Those people who are really intuitive, of course, that will be you, is paying attention, noticing everything, even the subtle. And when you notice what's different, what's right in front of you, you get out of your head, and you bring yourself fully into your body which is your full receiver for intuition. And you begin to be available for bringing in more awareness. So today we're going to work on expanding that availability. We're going to work on expanding your perception and beginning to notice how intuition speaks to you. It speaks to you energetically, but it also loves to speak to you with signs, symbols, metaphors; surprising ways to get your attention, snap you out of your automatic recording brain. Be present, take in what's happening right now, and make decisions that really support that. So I taught you about the Cube Of Space and I want to revisit that very quickly. We're going to do this often. So remember, you look around; you notice three new things. So just name that really quickly. So what we do is we breathe in; exhale, pulling your belly to your spine with your tongue on the roof of the mouth. Breathe in again, slowly, slowly. Go down the slide, ah. Smile. And what I want you to notice is that opens the curtains of your heart. You can actually feel your energy opening. Intuition is open, receptive energy, and you don't have to be afraid because you have your creative container; you have your protective, energetic field around you, so you can be open. You feel the protective energy around your gut, your belly, what we call your solar plexus, that opens. Ah. And that allows you to be able to be available, to perceive, to recognize energy, to receive it, to feel it. Now, once we're in this space, we now begin to interact with the world differently. I taught you about dancing in the fire. I taught you about being present. And now I want to teach you how to read the signs and then follow the signs. So, as I said before, intuition speaks in signs, symbols, metaphors, and sometimes jokes. So I want to give you a story about one that I just love. I had a student who had been working with me for a while and she is a flight attendant. She has to go to work, and it's a 45 minute drive. And she usually takes a very early morning flight. That's her schedule. So she was up at 3:30 in the morning getting ready to go for work. She packs her suitcase, puts it in the car; she's on her way to the airport. And she kind of senses this inner voice that says to her very simply, 'It's a good day for donuts." That pops in her head, and she kind of answers out loud because she'd been working with these tools. And she said, "Actually, it is a good day for donuts. When I get to the airport, I'll get a donut." So she's driving a few more blocks and she hears again with a little more enthusiasm, a little more energy, "Isn't it a good day for donuts?" And she laughs and she says, "It is a good day for donuts. It's a great, every day is a good day for donuts. I'll get a donut when I get into the airport." So she's having this conversation with her inner spirit, her intuition, her expanded self. She drives a few more blocks, and she's just about to turn to get on the highway to go to the airport when she hears one more time, "It's a good day for donuts." And she looks up and she sees a donut truck coming into the gas station to leave the early morning donuts for the customers that will come. It's only about 4:45 at this point. So she looks at the truck; she feels this again. And she says, "Okay, fine. I'm going to get a donut. And if I'm late for work, you're going to have to help me deal with it." So she's talking to her higher self. So she pulls in behind the donut truck, and she goes to shut off the ignition. And when she looks at the ignition, she realizes she is completely out of gas in her car. And had she got onto the highway, she would've run out of gas before she got to the airport. And her inner voice said, "See, it's a good day for donuts." And that's how intuition works. It plays with you; it gets your attention. It doesn't always just be in your face. It might be a vibe; it might be a joke; it might be a hit. It might be just sort of a thought that breezes by that's very different and unexpected. And it's giving you information in a way that's getting your attention. How do you get those messages? How do you not miss them Is you have to slow down; you have to create a little more quiet. She heard that, she experienced that kind of inner intuition guiding her, because she was in the car by herself; no radio, no distraction. She just had the space and the awareness and the quiet. So think about your own life. Do you ever create moments of quiet? Do you ever create moments where you're not being intruded upon by the noise, the voices, the input of other people. Now of course, we talk about meditation, and it is an important part of the course. And I said that at the beginning, but we're going to emphasize that in addition to meditation which we're going to take our morning and evening time for, we're going to create little moments of quiet and space wherever you can just to check in, just to receive and experience and hear what might be trying to be coming through. To notice the signs, to feel the energy, and be able to respond in the moment. Just like I did when I was standing at the airport waiting to get on the flight. I was quiet. I was standing there looking around, but my quiet picked up the frequency. The container is the breathe and smile. Those are things that kind of open up the field. So do that two, three, four times a day, and always do that when you're trying to tune in to what's happening, what I need to know, what would be helpful, what would guide me in this moment. I have another client who has a business; he owns many, many restaurants across America. And his biggest trouble, and it's the big challenge for a lot of people right now, to get good help, especially since it's post-pandemic and it's a new world, and everybody's mixed it up a bit. So he was really on a search for new help. Well, a woman came and interviewed with the company that he just loved and he thought, well, she's going to love us too. But to his surprise, after she went on her, after her interview, she called and just said to them, I don't want the job. He was shocked. He was like, we're a great company; we have a great business; she's perfect for the job. And she didn't leave a reason. So he said, "I used your tool, Sonia. I got really quiet. And I just went inward and I checked, what do I need to know? All of a sudden started hearing the Deborah Harry song 'Call Me'". And he laughed, he's like, what do you mean, "Call Me"? But it kept ringing in his head. He was thinking he'd get a yes. Hire her back or talk to her, but all he heard was "Call Me", this song. And he started laughing. So he said, "I'm going to call her. I'm going to call her myself. I'm not going to let HR, I'm not going to let the people who interviewed her call. I'm going to call her myself." So he called her, and he said, "I just need to know: you turned the job down. I'm calling because ... why?" And she said, "Well, actually I had every intention of taking the job. But when I called to discuss the details, the person that I was talking to irritated me so much that I just in that moment, because we weren't communicating well, I just said, 'I don't want it' and hung up. And I regretted it. So I can't believe you're calling me." Well, they worked it out; he hired her. And she ended up turning the whole company around and helping rebrand it. And it kind of pulled them out of the rut they had been in. And he said, "Sonia, I was expecting something else. I don't know what I was expecting because you expect information to come through your intellect and be very direct. I didn't expect a song from Debbie Harry, but there it was." So I want you to start noticing the different ways your intuition pops into your head. Do you ever get a hit, a hunch, a sense, a sign? Do you ever see a bus drive by, and it has a message on it? Or, I was driving one time to do a workshop myself. I came to the stop sign; I looked in front of me, and I saw this license plate on the car in front of me. And it just said S-L-W-D that's all, S-L-W-D. But in my mind, slow down. I just, boom! Got it. Slow down. And I was speeding. I was late. I speed anyway, all the time. So I'm cruising around the corner. See that; slow down. And just as I came around the corner, sure enough, there was the cop on the side of the road with the laser gun tracking the speed of the car. And I just cruised right by. Now, I might have been stopped, and then I would've been even later, but I noticed the sign, slow down. And I had a moment to make the decision. Now, this is another piece of this particular lesson. When you get the sign, it's not enough. You have to take it in as important information. So here's two parts to what I want you to do today. When did you get signs that you didn't pay attention to? When did you get a message, and how did it present itself? Did you ever get something in your head, kind of a song or a feeling or a buzz or a funny statement or did you see something or did you overhear something that just kind of triggered an idea, a thought for you, that you need to take an action? And did you? That's the really important thing. What did you do with that? We're only, we get so tunnel vision on our lives. We get so narrowed down to being very linear that we miss the full spectrum of guidance and opportunity that's trying to influence us. So take a breath; clear the space, ah; breathe in, down the slide, ah. Open up; listen; be quiet. Create the opportunity to receive guidance. We've been open; we're expecting; now we're drawing it in. So in the next period of time, I want you to just write down and notice all the signs. Go to our group, and share the signs that you picked up because noticing signs is like noticing stars. When's the last time you looked in the sky and noticed a star? But if you look, there's one, and then there another, and then there's another. And before you know it, bam! The whole Milky Way is right there. Now it was always there. What's different is you're noticing. So if you share it with one another on our little community, you're going to help each other start triggering more and more awareness. And it's starts an exponential kind of unraveling, and pretty soon everybody's noticing everything, and it was there all along. That's the fun part. So you do that today. Notice your signs, and I'll see you tomorrow.

====================

LESSON 11: Give Yourself Permission to Trust Your Vibes
--------------------
Welcome back to your sixth sense, your superpower. I'm confident that you're beginning to experience your superpower by now if you've been really working these tools and having fun with them, because it's natural. So we're not putting something in that doesn't exist; we're turning something on. And we're amplifying a sense in you that is inherent, that belongs to you. That is your inner compass, that gives you the guidance to live an authentic, empowered, really joyful life instead of just be a sheep, pushed around by everybody else's energy. So today's lesson is about the third decision. So let's remember, what was the first decision? Do you remember? Be open. Be open is like turning on a radio; let yourself receive energy. That's your attitude. That's your perception. That's your sense of I've got this, this inner sense, and it's going to guide me. Step two, that second decision, do you remember? Expect it. Because expectation is like dialing in on the particular channel that is called my inner guidance, my intuition. That means your inner teacher, your inner guide, your inner light, your inner true self, really. But that's not enough. We can pick up on something; we can tune in. It's like dialing in; it's like listening; all of a sudden you start hearing the music that's being broadcast. Because intuition is a lot like music; it waves and flows, and it's meant to move you which takes us to decision number three. And this is the one that will change your life. Trust your vibes. Trust what you feel. And more importantly, give yourself permission to trust what you feel. That is so liberating. That is so expansive. And it's a brand new thought for so many people. We've had so many authority figures in our life telling us what we can and can't do, what we can and can't think. We're used to it to the level that we don't even consider I have a choice. I decide. I'm going to decide to trust my vibes. I'm going to decide to trust my inner voice, my guidance, my intuition. So permission is A, and B confidence, to do that. So it begins with the idea that, who's running your life? Do you trust someone else to run your life? Think of the people in your head running your life. Are they doing a good job? Are you happy? Are you excited to get up and live your day? Are you laughing a lot? Are you feeling creative? Are you connecting to the things that really bring the best out in you? Do you feel like you're living your life? Or do you feel like you've been railroaded and contained and constrained to live someone else's version of your life? Because if you don't give yourself permission to trust your vibes, you're not living your life. And whose life are you living in? And frankly, how's that working out? So I'm just giving you a little motivation because I know that it takes a bit of a shift, a bit of confidence, a bit of courage, to trust your vibes. But I want to speak to you about the word courage. It comes from the French word that means heart. So you're saying I trust my heart. If I am a courageous person, I am a person who's moving forward in life with my heart. It will ask you to do things differently. And when you trust your vibes, you're receiving it; you're feeling it, but until you trust it, it'll bounce off you; it'll slide right off like eggs on Teflon. You'll just lose it. But if you trust it, you take it in; you say, "Okay, this is me guiding me. But this isn't my barking dog me, this is my expanded me; this is my divine me. This is my best most exciting, authentic me giving me direction." But you're not going to get a blast in your ear. It's going to be a, psst, whisper. That's the paradox. On one hand, it's a big deal that comes across in a subtle way. But it will make a suggestion one way or another to you. The first thing I hear when people get a vibe is they say, "I don't know why. I can't explain." As if their ego mind is the gatekeeper and until the ego mind has a reason and explanation that you can do this and follow this. And so don't even let your own ego be a gatekeeper. Push it all away. Breathe and smile. Go down the slide, ah. Out of my way. And make the decision to trust your vibes. Now start in little ways. I'll give you a story about my own life. When I moved to Paris seven years ago, my vibes told me to move here. And I came within 30 days, and didn't have a clue as to what I was doing, where I was going, but I just said, "Yes." I just went with it. Well, we looked around, I stayed in an Airbnb for a while. But if I was going to stay, I had to find a longer place. A place where I can live a longer time, like a real proper apartment. I asked my intuition to guide me. And sure enough, my intuition took me to a beautiful apartment, beautiful. Furnished, no less, which I needed. It was glorious, except it was several thousand dollars too expensive. I walked in, and I knew this is home. This is it; got to take it. So I'm looking at appearances. I'm looking at everything. And certainly I'm looking at the price. And everything in my brain says no, but my spirit, my Bright Light said, "Ask if they'll give it to you for the price you can afford." And so, because I'm used to doing what I asked you to do, I did. Realtor was showing it to me. I said, "Could you ask if that ..." I say, "I love it, it's mine. It belongs to me. This is perfect. It feels good. It's matching. It's congruent. I love it. But I just need a discount of about $2,000." And she looked at me like I was insane. And the realtor said, "Well, I'm sorry; that's not possible." And I said, "Well, you don't know. I wonder if it is." Using my wonder tool and she said, "Probably not." And I said, "But you don't know, so would you ask?" And she said, "I'm very uncomfortable to do that." And I said, "Well, then don't say it's your question; say it's my question. I just want to know if it's possible." Because my gut, my heart said ask. She was not happy, and I said, "Just please ask." And she said, "Okay, I will." And I said, "I don't believe you." Because I didn't believe her. I knew she wouldn't ask. So I said, "Can you call him right now and ask?" She clearly thought I was a pushy American. I know that for sure. But I felt it, and I gave myself permission to insist. So she called, and she said, "Excuse me." She walked in the other room, and I said, "I'm listening." So she asked. That conversation didn't last very long. And she came back and "He said he'll think about it. I'm just shocked," and I said, "Okay, well, I started out with it's not possible to I'll think about it. So I'm going to hold this space. And I'm going to just see if our energies match. And I'm going to feel like this is yes, so I'm not going to take the appearance of no. I have nothing to lose." Well, the next morning, I got a call back and she said, "I don't believe it; he said yes." And that was my first apartment in Paris. It was fabulous. And my landlord came, and first of all, became a really good friend of mine. He said, "I don't know why I said yes to you. I have no idea, but nobody was ever so bold as to ask, and it entertained me." So, I was here with my daughter; he said, "You and your daughter seem like nice people. Enjoy your new home." And not only that, I just have to say to follow that up, he helped us get settled, the bank account, all the things you need to actually be grounded here. And what if I didn't ask? What if I didn't give myself the permission to ask? So this is where I'm encouraging you to do something radically different. Don't wait for other people to give you permission to trust your vibes, to go with your inner voice. You have to find that ability yourself. Now here's what needs to happen. Be willing to hear no if you ask for something. I was already willing to hear no, because it was a no at the price that was given to me. It was already a no. I had nothing to lose, so I asked. Like when my client that I shared in the previous lesson got the message to call, he had to give himself permission to pick up that phone and do that, quite possibly with the potential of being told, "Why are you calling me? I already told you to get lost." We're so afraid to meet with any pushback or any resistance or any disapproval that it just disempowers us, and we become like sheep, like lamb chops being led to the slaughter. We just lose our power; we lose our possibility. But if you look at any true inventive creator, they're going to tell you, I followed my inner guidance; I gave myself permission, even when the world said you don't have it. I gave myself permission. So that's your assignment today. Can you give yourself permission to follow your vibes when you get them, to follow your instinct? Can you say, "I'm going to do this, it matters, even if the world around me is going to give me resistance." And you know what? It will. It's not used to people being so bold and so self-directed. So you can't be, don't be angry, don't be scared. Have fun with it. Have fun with it. Ask. Ask him if he'll let me have the apartment for $2,000 less. Ask. I'm willing to hear no, but I'm also willing to hear yes. And isn't this such a game changer? Say you go to a restaurant, which is a new opportunity for so many of us these days, you go to a restaurant, you look at the menu, you don't see anything you want; ask. "Can I have what I want?" You don't have to ask aggressively. Ask with love, humor, an open heart. Ask with good vibes and the willingness, "I could hear no, but I could, and I wonder, if I'll hear yes." And this is what gives people the ability to live in the third space, to just consider that what appears is not all that's possible. What's on the surface does not give you the full picture. How many times have you felt an intuitive hit, a guidance of some sort? You felt it, but you didn't trust it, so you didn't do anything. You didn't trust it. And until you trust it, you don't own it. It can't help you. It can't do anything. Unless you trust your spirit, that's what I call, your higher self for some of you, your expanded consciousness, your superego; whatever you call it. Trust that innate inner compass is working for you. And it is giving you information that isn't apparent on the surface but is real and authentic and true and is opening a door that you didn't know was there. So practice asking; practice expressing your vibes by just saying to people, be forward about it, be open about it. I trust my vibes. I trust my intuition. It works for me. Instead of thinking, "Oh my God, what are people going to think?" Flip it and tell people. "You know, I'm that weirdo that trusts my interests. I'm that kind of weirdo that trusts my intuition, and it works for me." It's okay. Have fun with it. I don't really fully believe that what's on the surface is all there is. If I'm feeling something else, it's something else. Remember princess and the pea. It's something. It's something. Don't wait for other people give you permission because they won't. People are too scared. People are what, way too scared to say go for it. But those in your life who do say go for it, those are your good friends. Those who say trust your vibes; trust what you feel; trust that inner guidance. And don't look for it to hit you over the head. Look for it to amuse you, entertain you, catch your eye, but it's a feeling that won't go away. Breathe and smile. Go down the slide, ah! Open the curtains. And then step into the show. It's your show. Step into the stage; that's your life. And begin to make the decision. Use your own language because nothing is more influential in your life than the sound of your own voice. That's your authority. When you say out loud to yourself and to others, "I give myself permission to trust what I feel. I give myself permission to go with my inner guidance. I give myself permission even if it's uncomfortable, even if it disrupts. I choose that." You know what will happen? First, people might raise an eyebrow. They might look at you suspiciously. But they will respect you. And in a very short while they're going to start coming to you to ask you if you have any intuition or any vibes on their life. Promise. So today, I want you to walk around out loud telling people, announcing, announce it on the community, announce it to your friends, announce it to your family, with humor, but mean it. "I give myself permission to trust my vibes. I give myself permission to listen to my inner self." It works for me, and it works really, really well. Breathe and smile, ah! Go down the slide. Clear the space. And I'll see you tomorrow.

LESSON 12: Name What You Love
--------------------
Welcome back to Sixth Sense Superpower. It's actually a way of life. I hope that you're beginning to get the idea, get the feeling that I'm helping you walk out of one world that I call the jungle. It's like barking dogs; everybody's in a dog fight with an occasional cat scratch. And you just have to be so careful, and you're trying to figure things out, and it's just stressful. You just really can't find your flow, your fun, your confidence, in this lower-ego vibration. You know, the ego by nature is always fearful. It's suspicious; it's defended; it pushes life away, and it shuts down your opportunities. So I've been walking you into adventureland, into a brand new world that's like Wonderland where everything opens up. That your intuition becomes integrated. That you actually, by adding a sixth sense, you turn the lights on in the dark. You actually get a more accurate view which gives you more potential power to choose and go in the direction that really serves who you are and who you want to be and who you want to become. So you're not fumbling around and being afraid. Now I was thinking this morning, have you ever been in your own apartment or your own house and you're just minding your own business, and all of a sudden there's a blackout? And everybody's like, "Don't move; everybody be careful." And all of a sudden you feel completely threatened in your own house, and you're moving very slowly, and you bump into something looking for a candle. And then the lights come on, and you're looking around; you're about one foot from where that happened. And you realize, "Oh my God, what was going on in my mind? I was so scared. I was feeling so threatened, and I'm not really." Well, turning your intuition on is like turning the lights on in a blackout. And it gives you an accurate picture of where you are, of what's what's really happening. But I do want to recount a few things I've set up because there are some conditions that we've been working on that invite you into Wonderland, that invite you into this enlightened, clear frequency. Now, the first is it's not going to be in your head. Second, you're actually, as we felt, receiving energy. And that energy is then understood and interpreted by your body and you get back pictures. It's like the language of vibration then gives you either a feeling, a sense, a vision, an idea, an aha. But the first experience is that you actually receive and have a connection with the vibration. So how do you do that? You have to have quiet. You have to create quiet. Now I understand everybody's world is noisy, that life is noisy. Our brains are noisy, and who's got time for the meditation that I recommended in the warmup? Well, make the time, I want to encourage you. It's worth the time that the 10 minutes or 15 minutes in the morning and the optional meditation at night. Train your brain to get quiet. It's like training your barking dog to sit. Ssh, go to sleep. You're here, you can take care of me if I need you, but get off my butt, you know? Just come on. But also there are quicker ways to calm your brain, quiet down, and I taught you. So I want to remind you: breathe, slide, ah, smile. Now do that with me right now, and you'll see what I mean. I just want to remind you: breathe. Slide. Ah. Smile. Now it's important to make sound when you go down the slide because you're opening up this frequency. The throat is the chimney of the heart, and the heart is the broadcaster. So if your chimney's clogged, you're going to hear a muffled heart. This is important. So do it in the shower, do it out loud. 'Cause most people are a little bit afraid because you've been taught to be quiet. Doesn't cut it. It's got to be bold. Then I want you to be in your cube of space, in your frequency, your grounded frequency. So I want you to begin to travel through life with this sense of, "I've got a space around me, two feet, above, below, in front, behind, on both sides." Let's just call that your spaceship. And inside the field is clear. I don't have a bunch of garbage. I empty and empty. So I've taught you empty. Know what's there, and you just put your tongue on the roof of your mouth and exhale, like you're blowing out candles with the idea that you're emptying. You move energy. You don't want to be a landfill. You don't want to have inside your cube of space all the garbage that rots from your thoughts, someone else's thoughts, past experiences. You want to think of a, "I am in clear space, clear vibe, clear field, so I can receive accurately." So that's what we set up so far. And I think you're beginning to understand, or at least I hope that it's not just something you do, these random little techniques. This is a way of life. This is a decision to step into Wonderland, using your imagination which is the front door. Now in Wonderland, what you need to know is that your intuition will serve your heart. It doesn't serve your barking dog. It serves the true master of who you are, the spirit, the essence, the expanded best self, and call it whatever you want. Your intuition is aligned with that authentic self, and it will keep navigating you back to what serves your authentic self, from the most fundamental, keep you safe, to the most expansive, fulfill your purpose, fulfill your creativity. That's why you have to be honest. The barking dog isn't honest. Your ego isn't honest. It's always trying to manipulate things and force things and tell yourself things about yourself and others that isn't accurate. So we just can't look through that filter, that paradigm. In fact, I want to tell you a funny joke. There was this man who was, he lived with his wife in an apartment complex. And every morning he'd read the paper, and she'd look out the window and judge the neighborhood. So as he's reading the paper, she opens the windows one day, and she went, "Look at that neighbor. She put all her dirty laundry out to dry; it's embarrassing; come here; it's terrible." So he puts his paper down and he shuffles over, and he looks down and goes, "Yeah, pretty dirty." She's like, "Oh, this isn't possible. We got to do something." Next day, he's reading his paper, relaxing. She beelines to the window, pulls the curtains open. "Oh my God, has she no shame? How can she live with all her dirty laundry out for everybody to see? This reflects poorly on all of us. We have to do something. Come here." So he toodles over and he looks and he goes, "Yeah, it looks a little dirtier than yesterday." So distraught, she just is so distraught. He goes back to his paper. The third day, he gets his paper; he sits down; she beelines to the window, pulls open the curtains. "This is out of control! We have got to interfere; we have got to intercept. It makes our whole neighborhood look bad; look at this." "All right," he comes over, he says, "Yep, worse than before." Fourth day, he looks at the paper. She beelines to the window. "It's clean. Look, her laundry, it's clean; it's beautiful. What happened? Somebody must have told her; what happened?" So he toodles over to the window and goes, "Well, I don't know what happened to her, but I washed the window this morning." And that's what we need to do today. We need to wash the window. Because your perspective, which I laughingly call your stink eye, your view of everything from such a negative perspective, needs to be cleared a little. So how do you do that quickly? Simply leave what I call your ego, your ego I call the barking dog lives in a bad neighborhood. So when you're in your head, you're in a bad neighborhood, and nothing good is going to happen there. You're not safe; you're not comfortable, and everything looks menacing. Certainly it doesn't meet your approval. So you breathe and slide ... ah. and you come back to where you belong, in your heart, in your body, in your clear space. And then I want you to start focusing on what you love. Because your inner guidance system is in place to keep you faithful and connected and aligned with and in congruency with and in synchronistic connection with what you love. Because what you love is a reflection of your authentic self. And your authentic self is the self that will make you happy. Now just think about it. You don't have to believe me; look at your life. Are you doing what you love? In any part of your life? And does it make you happy? I have never heard in the 40 years I've asked people around the world, if what you love, does it make you happy? I've never heard "Absolutely not." What I have heard is "It's not easy." What I've had heard is "You know, I'm a little frustrated, and I'm not getting my results." But I've never heard "I hate this." I love it. And it keeps me going back and back and back because it feels true. So you have to recognize your guidance isn't going to ever lead you away from what you love. But what does lead you away from what you love is your ego. And other people's barking dogs. Your parents saying, "You should do this." And your partner saying, "You should do that." And your friend saying, "Oh, you should never do that." "Take a risk? No way." "Follow your dream? You're crazy." All of that is not going to serve you. So what you love is something you have to remember. And the word remember means bring it back, and put it back in you. So what I want you to do is I want you to name the top 10 things you love. And don't focus on work. Just focus on life. What you love. I love music, for example. Before I even come to this class, I turn on music so loud. I suggested dancing in the morning; it works. It brings your spirit home; it lightens you up. If you're not a dancer, 'cause I know a lot of people are really not a dancer, they're like, "Dancing, that's like not for me." Then run; that's another thing. Walk; do something physical, something, for a few minutes, that makes you happy. Work out; do yoga; whatever, but move the energy 'cause it brings your spirit home, and then write down what you love. Remember, remember, tell your barking dog, "Be quiet." This is not what you serve; this is what you serve. And watch how your energy opens up and begins to expand. Your guidance will serve that. But it can't start until you're on board. And don't figure it out. If you can't recall what you love right now, okay, take the whole day. And here's something really exciting. You can take it to your friends, your family; take it to the community. Ask, "What do you love? What do you love; what do you love?" And everybody start putting it out. Do you know that the most common conversation in the world has deteriorated to the conversation of "I hate"? People gather around, "I hate the weather." "I hate my butt." "Oh, I hate this coffee." "I hate this city." "I hate my life." "I hate your life." This will completely put you in a bad neighborhood, and you're going to just get assassinated, okay? There's nothing good that's going to happen from that frequency. "I love" is going to change everything. Everything. And it attracts. Once the compass knows what you're going for, it creates a vibration that sends out a signal, and that signal starts to scan for any vibrational match. And it will start navigating you to exactly, exactly what matches that. So if I know what I love, then your intuition knows what its job is, but it's not going to take care of what you hate. It's not a vibrational match. So your assignment is to get out of the dirty window. Breathe. Slide. Smile. Ah. Be quiet; listen to what your heart is telling you, what you love, and give it voice. If you don't vocalize it, you don't legitimize it. Give it a voice; write it down and have a conversation all day. If you're in conversation with people, if everybody's complaining, change the subject and say, "I have a question, everybody: what do you love? "What do you love, what is your," and even better, if you want it to be an exciting conversation, say, "What does your spirit love? What does your spirit love? I'll tell you what my spirit loves." It'll be the liveliest, most joyful conversation you've had in a while, I guarantee you. But you activate and amplify the mechanism that's not only going to direct you to what your heart and your spirit are looking for but it will simultaneously attract, so fast sometimes it blows your mind, the vibrational match. And that's how it works. So this is a fun assignment. What do you love? And feel it in your body. If it's true and you love it, you're going to have some signatures, real clear signs. One, you're going to have light in your eyes. You'll have light in your face. Your smile will come out. You will radiate, because the essence of you is light, and you will radiate light. You'll be more animated. You'll be over tight butt; you'll stop being so restricted and rigid and shut down. You'll be open. So we're back to step, decision one and two: you're open, and you're going to start expecting that there's a match here. And if you work on and begin to converse about what you love, you're starting to trust that this is the way this sense works. So I wonder what you love. I wonder. I'll be excited to hear about it, and I'll see you back tomorrow.

====================

LESSON 13: Expect Guidance From Your Intuition
--------------------
Welcome back to your Sixth Sense Superpower. I really want you to take that in for a moment. I have a sixth sense. I have an inner compass that, actually I got to tell you, personally I feel like it should be called your first sense. It shouldn't be the one that trails behind; it's the one to lead. It's the one that opens everything up. It turns the light on in the dark. It gravitates you toward the things that uplift and protect and serve you. And also to the places where you can uplift, protect, and serve others. It's not just a self-serving sense. It contributes to the greater good which is part of what gives you meaning in life. So it really is the key essential sense to make your life make sense. Because when you're figuring life out, it doesn't make sense; when you're in the barking dog arena, it never feels safe; it never feels fair; it never feels just; it keeps you worked up. It's exhausting. So we're going back to step two this next, not step two but decision number two, because this is a game changer. And it's the decision that I was taught as a child. And if anything was the gift of my life. People have asked me often, they say, "Oh, you have a gift. You have an intuition that's exceptional; it's a gift." And I say, "Actually, I was given a gift, but it isn't that I have something you don't have. The gift is I was given permission, and I was given instruction to expect guidance, to expect help, to never waste a moment of my life fearful that I'm on my own. Because intuition is the connector. It connects you to yourself. You know that U2 epic anthem, "I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For." It's inside; that's why you're looking in all the wrong places. You're looking for that inner connection, so it gives you that. When you expect guidance, you're tuning in, not wandering around. When you expect guidance, it connects you to the energy of the world around you and finds vibrational match, just like the GPS in your car. I want this address, I'm going to go, the car will navigate because it knows what you love to do. But it also connects you to the quantum field. I call it the loving universe. I do recognize because I worked long enough and in a lot of different arenas, from pure spiritual Nirvana workshops to business, in masters of business in Chicago, University of Chicago, where everything has to be really grounded. Expecting guidance changes the way you interact with life. You walk out the door having a positive, receptive, available experience. And you know what? Expectation is a magnet. Two people can go you into a big city driving their car; one will expect a parking space, and one won't, and they'll both get what they expect. Two people will go to a party; one will expect to have a good time; one will expect not to, and they're both right. They will have what they expect. So when you expect guidance, you relax. I learned that from my mom, and she would say, "There's always a solution; we just don't know what it is yet. And we just always have to be open for it." And she never deviated from that. Always a solution; we just have to expect it. I remember one time when I was about 20. I was going on a trip with my mom to visit my brother in London. And I was always, and I always have been just a little bit of a ungrounded person, in that I don't pay a whole lot of attention sometimes to the physical world because I'm tuned into the quantum field. We all have our challenges. So that day we were leaving at six o'clock to take our flight from Chicago to London. And at 2:15, it occurred to me that I better find my passport; I better go get it. And I couldn't find it. I couldn't find it anywhere. And we're leaving in three hours, and I am freaking out, and I'm going through my drawers, and I'm panicking, and my brother's saying, "You're so stupid." And I'm like fighting with him, to tell him to shut the heck up. And then I remembered that I need to expect guidance. And I just got really quiet, and I sat down, and just went to my cube of space, and I just said, "Okay, I need my passport. I'd love to find my passport." I don't want to be in fear that I won't find my passport 'cause that's the bad neighborhood. "I would love to have that passport in my hand." So I got up; I didn't have any big revelation, but what I did do quite spontaneously without thinking or having any thought about it, I went to my closet, and I got out my trench coat which was something I rarely wore. I don't even know why I owned the trench coat because I don't like trench coats. I'm not a trench coat person, but I had worn it at some time in the past. I just pulled my trench coat out and stuck my hand in the pocket, and there was my passport. Yes! Now from A to B was 15 minutes, but I wasn't thinking, go to the closet and look in your pockets, at all. I just did it. And that's why I teach you to dance, so your body can move into place without your brain interfering. Have you ever had that happen to you, ever? It's really fun; it's really fun. So that's why I'm setting all the pieces up, but when I sat down the key was this: I didn't expect, I expected an answer because I've been trained to, and I always get one. And it might not be instant; it might not be immediate, and it may not be what I expected, but I always get it, because it's a magnet. When you expect and in a calm, clear space, not in a dramatic freak out space. So I know that that's hard to get guidance when you need it, like SOS, I'm in trouble; how can I be nice and calm? Run around the block; go in the shower and scream; move the energy because it's adrenaline. Don't deny it; don't fight it; don't sit on it like a hot potato. Express it, because once you do the mind gets quiet and then just give your inner compass direction, like you're typing in an address. I need this, and it... you begin to do things quite spontaneously, and it's so amazing. Your brain is going, what just happened? Did that just happen? I wasn't involved. How'd that happen? And it works. And that's when your life, that's flow. I'm telling you it's Wonderland; it's flow. So, isn't that bold, to expect guidance? Doesn't that feel like, I know your ego's going, well, that's hard to believe. And of course it is because your ego can never have that experience, ever. It's much too controlling and much too limited. And it isn't imaginative. It's not open. So your ego will never, ever get anything coming out of it that's good. You have to remember your spirit. My Bright Light expects guidance. My barking dog, my poodle, my snotty poodle named Fifi, she wouldn't expect much of anything except to go shopping occasionally. But my spirit is in a constant state of expectation. So let's have some fun with this, okay? When you go into town, if you're driving your car, expect to find a parking spot. When you stand in front of a group of elevators, expect to know which one comes first. When you're playing with, like, putting out a message, like I want to hear back from someone, expect a positive call; expect good things. Now this is what my mom would say to us. I was one of seven kids. We had a very modest upbringing, truly. We were seven kids; she didn't work. He worked as a salesman. My dad worked as a salesman selling farm equipment. We were on a pretty slim budget, but every single morning when we went to school, my mom would stand at the door and say, "Expect good things, and I expect to hear about them when you come home." And that's what we talked about at dinner. And that set up this whole relationship with life that worked. So I want to tell you another really quick story about this 'cause I learned this when I was eight years old. There was, we had a little tiny TV, and on the TV we would get to watch it for maybe 15-20 minutes a day after homework. Well, I saw on the TV at Christmas time that there was this news channel that my dad watched. But they were having this promotion that if you put Merry Christmas WGN, which were the letters of the television station, in your window, in your house, the WGN Santa was going to be driving around Denver and would bring you a present. So I decided I want that present. And I made sign, a big one. I got my colors and tape from my mom. One of my brothers just made fun of me and made fun of me, and I would say, "Get out of here. I'm going to win. I expect it; now you leave." So I taped this up. I mean, the sign was just about as big as me. I kept putting all my little pieces of paper together from my little school tablet. And I went to school at eight years old. When I came home that day, my mom met me at the door and said, "You'll never believe what happened?" And I was like, "What, what?" She said, "Well, two minutes after you left, secret Santa rang the doorbell, and he saw your sign, and he brought you a present." I was like, "What'd he bring me? What'd he bring me?" And she said, "Come and look." He brought us a console TV that was color and dragged the whole thing in; it was on the news, and this is way back in the day. I'm dating myself, and nobody had a color TV, let alone a big one. I was like, I said to my mom, "I expected it." And she said, "I did too." And that's the kind of relationship you can have. If you have imagination, a sense of humor, do what you love, don't fear disappointment, play full out like I asked you and have fun. That's how it works. Can you do that for the next couple of days, for the rest of this course? Just for fun. The biggest thing that interferes is the fear of disappointment. Honest to God, I watch how much people are so afraid to be let down, they don't even try. Don't be like that; that plays so small, and that tells you you're so fragile, and that affirms that life is so bad that you just have to hide in your corner and in your cave and in your closet and just try to survive and endure. I've been disappointed, but never to the point that it trashed me, only to the things I wanted that weren't good for me, in the end, anyway. It's big; it's bold; it's dynamic to not only expect guidance, but expect gifts, support, connection, synchronicity and celebration, because if you expect it, just like you expect it not to come, you'll be right either way. So make that your today, what do you expect; for every moment of the day, I want you to say, "I expect good things." In fact, for the rest of your life, expect good things. And then expect to write them down or tell someone; tell the community; tell everybody: these are the good things that came, that I was gifted with today, that my intuition led me into. Because it won't let you down; it's how it is designed to work. So you're dialing in, not just you beaming up but connecting, so the universe can beam back in. It's a great connection. So have fun with this; it's a game changer. You'll never go back the other way; you'll stay in Wonderland. Okay, I'll see you tomorrow.

====================

LESSON 14: Review & Integrate Your Learning
--------------------
Your Sixth Sense Superpower, secretly your first. When you make the decision to live in Wonderland, to live in a place and with an inner compass that is oriented and open and awake to guide you to the best possible life, you've just experienced what I call a paradigm shift, and that's what we're going to review today. What we've learned so far is we've flipped the script. We've taken you out of the ordinary world. Five-sensory world is such a fumbling, freaky, frightening place. And the greatest thing that can happen when you don't have your sixth sense is you get by. You make it, maybe, but you don't have a lot of fun. That's for sure. I'll tell you one thing. The ego has no sense of humor. It's much too frightened, and it doesn't like people. Everybody's a threat. Even if you fall in love, then you're threatened by "You won't love me back." I mean, where's the end? It never, ever, ever brings relief. This is escape velocity. This is your escape route, to begin to experience life in a way that actually you can enjoy or actually begin to feel a little joy in. We have to go about this not as an effort. That's another thing that isn't going to work. If I say on any one of these tools, "You have to do this," I know what your barking dog's going to say, "I don't have to do that. I'm not going to do that." So I'm going to say, "I'm inviting you to try it," but it's a game. And you can either sit on the sidelines and watch everybody else have fun and snarl and bark or you can give up control, and you can dive in, and you can play. I had an experience of a student who came to my workshop. He was really barking dog. I was teaching a workshop in Chicago where I lived at the time, and I had about 300 students. It was a workshop on manifesting your heart's desire. And in the beginning of the workshop, he came in, suit and tie, clearly serious, with notebook. The first thing I said to him, and all my students, is "Put your notebooks away." Well, that pissed him off. "What do you mean put my notebook away?" I said, "Because anything I teach you, you're not going to remember if you write the note. You'll write the note, and you're going to forget it. Nobody reads those notes. Have you read your notes from the last workshop? Nobody reads the notes. It's just a way to think you're learning. So put it down and I'll have you learn in your body, so you'll remember." He was annoyed, clearly annoyed, let a few people know he didn't appreciate this interruption. Okay no problem. So we go on a few more minutes, and then I have everybody get up and start dancing. Well, that offended his barking dog so badly that he flipped out, ran up, grabbed my microphone in front of my class and said, "This is ridiculous. You're making a fool out of me. You're making a fool out of all of us. And I, for one, will not be humiliated. I'm leaving; who's with me?" And everybody just stood blinking, you know? And he said, "Fine," dropped the microphone, walked out. And I looked at everybody, and I looked at the door, and I looked at my helper, and I said, "Put the music back on." And we just started dancing again. I wasn't going to even respond. So the students were like, okay, okay, okay, well, okay, and off we went again. I never addressed it because I knew exactly what it was. The barking dog likes to hold you hostage and get a lot of attention and explanation and make it okay. And just don't; it is what it is. Well, guess what? Five years later, I am teaching the next level of that workshop. Who do you think is sitting in my front row? The same guy. Now, what do you think I did? I didn't give him stink eye. I wanted to, but that was my little Fifi. Instead, I just breathed and smiled and carried on. At the end of the workshop, he came back and he said, "I'm embarrassed to be here." And I said, "I admire that you had the guts to come and sit in the front row; bravo! That was your spirit. That was your true self that showed up." And he said, "I was so shocked to be put in my body and asked to play and asked to have fun, I forgot. It scared me." And I said, "I know. I said, "You weren't very nice about it. You had to scare the rest of us, but I forgive you." Well, he went on to actually write a book about how to use intuition to get you out of unhappy work situations, and he asked me to endorse it. So play is not something that we have been A, used to being encouraged to do, B, ever validated that it's important, C, ever, ever given the idea that it could actually be a conduit for inspiration. And it really does involve one thing that you need to do. It involves surrender, letting go. Most people have forgotten how to play, have forgotten how to be in the moment, have forgotten because we're mesmerized, hypnotized and held hostage to people's barking dogs, including your own. It's a noisy, frightening frame of mind. So we have to remember the tools I've given you. I am not giving you what you should do. Actually, here's a little secret about this course. Any one of these tools, if you really committed full out, would be enough. Can you imagine? If you actually did breathe, slide, and smile every day and expected things, it would be enough. If you actually would just kind of name your spirit and check in with your spirit and check in with your divine or your higher expanded self, whatever you want to call it, your superself? If you actually did just that, it would be enough. Do you believe that? It would be enough because these are all roads to the same natural mechanism that flips on. If you actually cleared this space, if you actually meditated for 10 minutes every morning, just to take your attention off the noise, so you could hear and feel at a deeper level, it would be enough. But if you start to do all these things, it's a lot of fun. It's kind of outrageously fun. You just have to get used to it. I mean, sometimes I think I want to call this course, "How Good Can You Stand It?" Because it really is an invitation to let life be better than you're comfortable with. So right now, I just want you to begin to really consider, what am I doing? Am I really going to do this? And don't ask your barking dog. Don't even ask me. Breathe and slide with me right now. Ah! Go here, ask yourself, your authentic self and your barking dog's, "Well, I'm scared, I'm scared." Of course, but you're not in danger. There's a difference. You're just scared of giving up control, but you're not in danger. You're not in danger. It doesn't threaten you to expect good things. It doesn't threaten you to have clear space. It doesn't threaten you to check in with your brilliant self. You can even call it your brilliant self. It's just different. The other thing is it's not difficult. It's just different. It's going from five to six, and it's an exponential shift. It's going from barking dog, barking dog fight, to Wonderland. Are you really going to do this? Because when you put those two feet in and say, "Okay, fine, I'll give it a try." But you can't go in and ... have you ever been, it's like dancing with the universe? So we open, and we expect. We turned the radio on. We're hearing the music. But if you're like, mm-hmm, mm-hmm, tight butt, tight jaw, dead eyes, you're not letting it in. Have you ever heard the expression, "the spirit moved you"? Well, that's what we're trying to do, to let the essence of you move you, and it takes your availability and practice. Now you have to do one thing that's a bit, it almost feels like a paradox. You need to slow down, but you don't necessarily have to slow down your life. Just slow down your breathing. Let's just try that right now with me. Just breathe in. Ah. And if you really want to slow down your breathing, use your imagination, and breathe up through your feet into your heart space because you'll notice your rib cage opens when you do that. Just try it with me right now. You just go here instead of trying to shove it here, okay? Ah. And let that light open up, above and below, front and back, and then scan the field. Scan your energy. Scan your body. Is there anything like "The Princess and the Pea," is there any little niggling thing trying to get my attention? Well, it's not enough to think it; say so. Remember the fairy tale: you have to say so; and don't figure it out. Just say, "I wonder. I wonder." Here's a fun story. I mentioned in an earlier lesson that I had to go to Romania from London. I'm part time in Paris, part time in London. So I had to go to Romania, and I did a vibe check, and I got this message. I'd purchased a ticket to go, and I got a message to buy another ticket, another flight. I thought, "Well, that's weird. I bought a flight." But I got the message, so I bought. I had two trips to Romania and two trips home. I thought, "That's weird." My barking dog Fifi, she always loves to have a comment, but I ignore her. So going day by day, I definitely check into one, and I check into the other, and here's how you play this out. I'm wondering, how this is going to play out? Because I trust that I did this for a reason, and I'm really wondering, how is this going to play out? So the morning of the trip, I have an option. Do I go on flight A, or do I go on flight B? Flight A is at 8 in the morning and will get me there very early. Okay that's not that fun. I have to get up at 5 AM to be on flight A. Flight B is at noon, and it will get me there a little later, but it's easier to get to. I asked my body. Fly day, get up and go. Okay, I get up and go. And I'm wondering why I bought flight B and why then I chose not to go on flight B. Flight B was the first flight I bought. Flight A was the second. So I go to the airport. I get on; I get early. I get into Romania, Bucharest, no problem. Flight B had a mechanical. It didn't go as it was supposed to. I got a message, "We're sorry for the inconvenience. The flight's delayed for two hours." I'm think, "Good, that's why, but not really." Three hours later, I get another message. "We really are sorry for the inconvenience. The flight is now delayed until 10 PM." Now I'm in my hotel room comfy and enjoying myself with a cup of tea before bed. Then, I get a message at midnight. "Sorry, this flight will not be going. Please contact customer service for reimbursement." It's like, "Ah, yes! That's why I bought two tickets." I wondered, but I didn't need to know. Now that's a crazy way to live, isn't it? It is weird and wild and fun and crazy, and it works. And I'm not the only one that this works for. Every single person who really works with their intuition will have a thousand stories to share that are similar to mine. So what do you do? You decide; do I have enough curiosity to live this way? Am I having a really good time living the way I'm living? Is that working out for me? Am I really committed to being locked down and protected and isolated and at war with everything in my life, mostly myself? Would I be curious to just let it go? Just do my morning meditation for a few minutes with the idea of clearing, clearing, clearing? Clear space; clear field; vibe check, and go with it. You have to do two opposing things; buy two tickets, okay. Now people might say, "I don't have the money to waste on those sorts of things." I didn't get any money wasted. I had the flight reimbursed. But this is where you're really being invited to try some things differently, and I know you're scared. I wasn't exactly thrilled. I just know that there's a reason. If you get a vibe, there's a reason. There's a reason. And if you expect that reason to reveal itself in time and that it's protecting you and you just need to stay congruent and check in, your life will be magical. Honestly, that's why I brought in imagination. If you can imagine and expect things to work out for you, I promise you they will, but you got to do things differently. Slow down; be present; breathe; check in. Expect good things. Know it's a disruptor. It's a disruptor. You got to do things differently. You can't keep doing the same. Start in little ways. Know what you love. Tell the universe what you intend, what you need, what you want, and let the universe, let the mirroring of the quantum field for my more scientific types, guide you there. Your barking dog doesn't know the way, but your divine self, your inner self, your expanded self, it's a GPS; it knows. It knows better than you. It just, it knows better than you. So this point, you have to get clear and honest with yourself. That's the only thing, and your barking dog can say "I don't have to," but you do. But it's a choice, not an obligation. It's just your decision: door A, Wonderland; door B, bummer; your choice. Door A, expect good things, lots of surprises, will completely entertain you. Door B, I get to be right all the time and alone, and a lot of people won't like me. I won't like myself very much either. You choose. Door A, I give up control, and I let things better than I can figure out influence and benefit my life. And door B, well, I'll be in control, and I'll be right all the time, but I won't be myself. I'm not going to be myself. I don't know what I'm being, but it won't feel good. Certainly, I won't be very happy. If you try full out, even a few of these tools, you get quick results because this is the natural way. This is not something you have to work and earn. It's something you have to expand and receive and go with. The music's on. Run with it. You don't have to invent the wheel. You just have to surrender and hop on the merry-go-round. It's fun; it's different. It's not difficult. It's not difficult, and it's not dangerous. It's just different. So be curious; make the space, and just try. See what happens. Because what'll happen is you'll get good results quickly. So for our exercise, I want you to write down any good results, record any good results, and share with the tribe any positive aha's, didn't expect that, this was fun, and also, what are the objections? And are you actually recognizing that those are from your barking dogs? So if you have an objection, if you have a resistance, Fido says this, you know, Bruno, my dog, says this, recognize that it's that lower self that wants to keep you locked down and hostage. By now, this should be a little bit, I'm sure you've had results already because it happens pretty quickly. It happens very quickly because it's like the light in the room. You're wired for the light. If I turn it on, it doesn't take a while for it to turn on. It turns on; that's how it works. So you can't bypass creating the space. You can't bypass going in; breathe; smile; slide. Ah. Check in; feel what you're feeling. Name what you're feeling. Then, you can decide what you'll do with it. Break it down. Share what your feeling. Share your experiences, and I'll see you tomorrow.

Part 3 - Let Intuition Lead Your Life

====================

LESSON 15: How to get into the Flow
--------------------
Your sixth sense, your superpower. It's really true. And I'm really confident that you're starting to feel and experience the potential. We're in week three. So congratulations because it takes a little bit of courage to come into this Wonderland. It takes a desire to break out and bust free and not be a sheep, just being led around like a lamb chop in life, and to really be your own person, to reawaken your own inner compass. And you have to build your muscles; I understand that. And train your barking dog; I understand that too, and you've been doing that, so congratulate yourself. Because it's really an exceptional decision to make, and it will give you an exceptional life. It's not a popular decision going into Wonderland, but on the other side, you meet your people. You meet other people living a wonderful life, a magnificent, creative, dynamic life, because it's all vibrational match. So once you cross that threshold, once you put two feet in, get on the path, clear the space, train your barking dog enough to be quiet, connect to your spirit, and recognize that that inner self is like your inner genie. It's just sitting here, ready to comment and ready to guide, but just like the GPS in a car, you have to engage it. It's not going to interfere in any way. It might give you a little niggle here, a little tug there, a little hmm there, but your free will is your gift, and it's up to you to be willing to make the shift. Breathe; slide; smile. Ah. Come home, and listen to your inner genius. So we want now to make the decision today to let this inner genius lead your life, not just occasionally comment from the bleachers, but actually assume the lead role, the deciding voice. Because we had the first decision: you're going to be open. Okay, you've been open. You're hanging in there with me. Two, you're going to expect it. And that's fun, because when you do, it happens. Three, decision number three we touched upon before, and I want to remind you: trust what you feel; trust what you receive. That is so empowering. Then you're not a follower anymore. You are actually really taking your power back. And it is a disruptor. You're not going to get applause; you're going to get people's fear. So just expect it. They're not trying to hurt you; they're just trying to protect themselves. A friend of mine who wrote a beautiful book, a very good friend of mine, in fact, her name is Julia Cameron. She wrote a book called "The Artist's Way." And we go back 40 years. And she talked about this point: it's called escape velocity. Just when you're ready to elevate to this new, more authentic, guided vibration, all your detractors will kind of swoop in. So expect it. They're going to come in, and they're going to trip you up, and they're going to give you doubts, and they're going to mirror back all the reasons why living from your heart is dangerous. So what do you do about that? Well, that's what we're going to talk to you about today, protecting your clear space with some very practical things, very practical. And the first is don't ask people's opinion. Don't invite a barking dog into your clear space to poop in your space. Don't do that. My teachers taught me if you're going to ask for input, be very thoughtful. Is it from someone who is actually leading their life authentically, joyfully, happily, successfully? Because if not, why bring that energy in? Because it's going to pull you down. So that's going to take a lot of real attention because we are taught that we have to get permission from others. So don't do that. That's the first decision you have to make, once you're going to trust. If you're going to trust your inner voice, then don't solicit the distractions of others. Secondly, in the escape velocity, in that point where you're about to take off, the biggest voice you want to not listen to is the voice of your barking dog, who's going to start snarling and putting up all kinds of reasons for you to be careful, because it's about to lose its position on the throne. So it's going to fight for the throne. And you just, the way to get around that is humor. And also, I told you the sound of your own voice is one of the most, if anything, is the most powerful. So you have to say, "Be quiet." "Hush, Fifi," I say out loud. "Hush!" And then I laugh. So don't fight the voices; don't stuff 'em; express them because you move the energy. So try it right now. Think of the name of your barking dog. And if you don't have a name, give your barking dog a name. Bring it up in your mind. What kind of dog is it? Do you have a Chihuahua who's sniveling under the bed? Do you have a pit bull who's ready to lunge? Do you have a German Shepherd who's just as suspicious as they can come? I had a client say, "Well, I have a mutt, and he humps everybody on the street, going, 'Do you like me? Do you like me? Do you like me?'" Don't do that either. Know the nature of your barking dog, and say, "Hush; shh." And decide that if I don't lead my life, who is? If I don't lead my life, so this takes us to the biggest decision: responsibility. Take responsibility for your life. It's your life. Don't give the keys to your life to someone else. Don't let someone else drive the bus of your expression. Don't let someone else dumb you down. And I know they have been, and they will continue to, because everybody wants to bring you to their vibration, because we energetically crave a match. And if you start elevating, there's a point of tension. It's sort of like when you engage a gear in a car, from going like third to fourth, there's a point of tension where there's a little resistance and you have to push right through, not hang in there. And when you push through, not only do you elevate, but you can pull people up. The key is not to fight. Don't get into the dog fight, 'cause that's what happens. You go to humor. Humor is your ally right now. You have to have a sense of humor. If someone says, "You're crazy," you need to say, "I am, and it works for me." If someone says, "That's not a good idea. Where's your security?" Say, "I'm insecure, but it works for me because being secure is bumming me out." Rather than resist, what you resist persists. So don't resist the feedback; agree with it, and say, "I'm going to do this anyway." "You're scaring me. I don't want you to do that." "It's okay, I'm sorry I'm scaring you. I scare myself too, but I'm doing it anyway." So that's a big tool for you to let it lead, let your inner guidance lead your life. Let your inner brilliant genie genius self lead. That's when you go from an ordinary life that's pretty miserable to the exceptional life. Not everybody in this world is miserable. Not everybody is struggling and surviving. No matter what the news says, it's a very select point of view. Not everybody is struggling and can't be happy, only the barking dogs. And you don't have to live a life of a barking dog; you have to change the channel. So I want to give you some hacks that will help you quiet the barking dog, yours and others. In addition to don't ask people's opinion; just don't do it. And if they offer it, see your container as a very high vibration frequency, and anything that doesn't support it bounces off. It's not a match. If it doesn't match my inner guidance, I'm not going to internalize it. So that tool I call observe, don't absorb, okay? I'll observe it. I'll observe it over there. I'm not going to absorb it. I'm not going to internalize it, and I'm certainly not going to let that be the leader of my life. Just breathe; smile; go down the slide. Ah; I'm doing it anyway. Ah, I'm going for it anyway. Ah, hang on, I'm crazy, I'm running with it. People don't know what to do with that, and they actually get excited. They'll get on board, but first they'll test you. You're going to be tested, and then they'll say, "Can I come?" Here's another hack. If your barking dog is really giving you trouble, there's three things you can do to stop it right now. The first, turn your music on as loud as you can and dance, and I mean two feet in and commit to the movement, okay? Ideally, a song that you know the words to, and I mean as loud as you can. It could be a two minute song, because once you dance, your divine self, your expanded self takes over and completely occupies your space. The barking dog goes outside the container and sits. Instant. Second, take a shower; always works. Wash that barking dog just out of your hair. Always works. So if you can get in the shower and you can scrub it out, it stops everything. It just opens up all the channels, and that water just wakes up your body, so your brain stops. You can't have an obsessive shower, okay? You can try, but it doesn't work. The third hack, breathe out loud like this: hah hah; hah hah; for three minutes. You won't pass out. Your barking dog might get bored and start cooperating and quiet down, but your energy will expand. So put your timer on for three minutes, and better yet, move your body. And every time you do it, do a movement you've never done before, because this scrambles your egg. So it goes like this: hah hah; hah hah; hah hah; hah hah. I have a friend who works with regenerating the brain, and she actually helps rehabilitate parts of the body that have been damaged and no longer work. Her name is Anat Baniel, and when she saw this tool, she said, "That is the most brilliant, brilliant tool I've ever seen for waking up your whole brain," and for reintegrating the parts of you that have shut down or have entropied, or aren't working; it activates the part of you that you're not using, and it reminds that part of you to engage. So three minutes. In the first minute, your brain goes, your barking dog goes, "What's happening?" In the second minute, your barking dog goes, "I don't like this. I'm bored. This is stupid." You got to keep doing it. And in the third minute, your barking dog goes, "Okay, I'm out of here." And then your spirit comes alive. So that's another hack. And then the last one, when you are really obsessing, and you're really in the muck of the bad neighborhood, sing, and I mean sing. Sing out loud, because singing, again, goes to the heart, opens the throat, gets you out of your head. And the best song to sing, believe it or not, is the song from "The Sound of Music," "Do-re-mi-fa-so-la-ti-do" because it balances your energy. You know, that's when it's ♪ Doe, a deer, a female deer ♪

- You can find it, and you can dance to it too. It stops the barking dog; it aligns and puts you in congruent energy; it quiets and keeps you completely available and receptive, and it's fun. And that's the key to letting intuition lead your life. Are you enjoying yourself? These things will instantly put you back into the experience of having joy in being yourself which is what enjoying yourself means. So we make the decision, trusting my inner guidance. And it's a decision that you just make, like an executive decision. Don't be talked into it; don't wait till you're safe. Your barking dog will never be safe. Don't wait till everybody approves. No one will approve. Just decide. There's a beautiful saying, again, it's a Chinese saying, "There's one power in the universe, the power of decision." Everything else follows. So today I want you to decide. Try some of the hacks; see what happens, and write down, record, and share on the community. And I want to remind you, we have to meditate. Take that 10 minutes. Don't think of like, "Oh, I got to meditate. I hate to meditate." That's not going to help you. Think of it as a drink at the well of wisdom. It's, it's like a break, an elixir of life. It's just like, I get to take a break and rest in Wonderland, because that 10 minutes in the morning and the meditation at night is where a whole lot of brilliance is going to drop in. So consider it where the gold flows. Hope that interests you. Okay, share everything that you can with the community. The more you acknowledge it, the more it leads, the more fun you have. Love your barking dog. Don't shoot your barking dog, but definitely, you don't lead anymore. And again, name your spirit; name your divine self, and start to be best friends. I'll see you tomorrow.

====================

LESSON 16: Acting On Your Intuition
--------------------
Welcome back, my super sixth-sensory friend and person in the Wonderland. Just start to see yourself as someone different. This is time to reframe your identity and to begin to envision yourself as someone who really is guided, as someone who's confident, as someone who will have the answers when you need the answers, not in advance, but I expect good things; I expect guidance. My inner self will take over. I don't have to worry. My barking dog's not in charge. I'm good. I trust. And with that, we're now going to go to the last decision and the fun, fun, fun game-changing decision of acting on your intuition. So, today I want to make the invitation, not the assignment, the invitation, to consider Play Is the Way. And I'm going to give you several ways to play, to have dialogue with the self that knows your inner genie, your own bright light. And begin to have a regular conversation that invites that part of you to take over. So step one, start talking to your divine self, your guiding self, your inner compass, your light first. We've already shut off all the input from the outer world, but that doesn't mean we have turned up the dial yet to this inner conversation. The simplest way to have it is to use a tool that I call my head and my heart. So, instead of having these two things fight, you give both a voice. Now you have to bring a question or a consideration or a concern to your inner self. You have to be authentic and genuine and available to real guidance; we've already discussed that. So, don't ask your inner self for guidance if you are not available. But if you are, first, we're going to do something I call empty the garbage. We're going to just let all the barking dog noise be recognized and eliminate it. And the way you do that is you start saying, very quickly and you have to answer fast, "I'm afraid of..." and fill in the blank. So, let's present the option. I want to leave my job, and I want to start my own business. I've been thinking about it for a while. I've been feeling it; I've been dwelling on it, but I haven't made the move. I'm afraid of going broke. I'm afraid of getting over my head. I'm afraid I don't have the skill I need. I'm afraid that I will fail miserably. I'm afraid that I'll succeed, and I won't know what to do with that. You just say, "I'm afraid of..." and fill in the blank until there's nothing more. And you know, it's okay to repeat what you're afraid of because some of that gets really burrowed in there. And then when you're done, I want you to look around the room and notice three separate things and say and name what they are. I see the wall. I see the books. I see the window. I see the floor. This brings you out of the bad neighborhood, back into your body and present. "My spirit says...," or "My heart says...," or, "My inner genie says...," fast. Don't think. My inner genie said, it's okay. My inner genie says, you're ready to do this. My inner genie says, ask for an assistant; get some help. My inner genie says, you're not ready, but here's the next step. You don't know what's going to come out, but you have to say it fast and quick and just do this for 30 seconds. Then breathe, down the slide, ah, and smile, and then pay attention to how you feel in your body. One of my big questions I have been often given is "how do I know it's guidance instead of my my emotions or my ego?" Or, "how do I know?" It's a good question. You know because of how you feel. If it's real guidance, you feel peaceful. You feel congruent, calm, and quiet. It feels like a key that fits into a lock. Ah! It feels true. If it's your intellect, if it's your barking dog, you feel agitated. You feel like you still want to talk. It always has some more to say. Intuition is very subtle, very quick, and very simple. It doesn't talk a lot. It doesn't go on and on and on. It's direct and simple and ah. So, this empty the garbage is a really good tool to use to get that inner guidance right now. You want to do something better? Have this conversation, and do this tool, use this tool when you're on a walk outside, alone. Out loud; let everybody think you've lost your mind; it doesn't matter if you see anybody on the street. But as you're walking, voice my fears. Voice my fear. voice my fear. What do you see right in front of you? "My inner guidance says..." "My inner guidance says..." "My inner guidance says..." You'll always get an answer. So, that's a really effective tool. Another one is, what I love, what I love, what I love. Again, same thing. We're opening this channel, letting the heart speak. So, as you walk along, you just say, "I love..." "I love good coffee in the morning, the real stuff with real cream." "I love disco music." "I love a real hug and not a burp." "I love laughing so hard, I want to wet my pants." "I love when somebody else cooks for me, and I don't have to do the dishes." Just keep naming what you love because it keeps bringing you right back to your authentic self. And then, take it from what I love from before to what I love going forward, as if it were the present. "I love writing my own books and signing them at the book signing." "I love the applause I hear when I've just done my first film, and it's being displayed at it's opening." "I love that real hug with that wonderful person that I know is looking for me and found me." And this really brings you into alignment and starts to direct you right to where your heart belongs, right to where your life belongs, right to the path that is for you. The key is this: none of this is in your head, none of it. It's in your heart, in your body, out loud. When you start to express your intuition, you train your barking dog to not fight it. You train your barking dog to get on board, to support it. It's playful. Now, Einstein, when he was older, right before he died, someone asked him, "What do you attribute to your genius? What was the most important thing you ever did in your life?" And they actually asked him, "How did you discover the theory of relativity?" He said, "I wasn't looking for it. I was listening to a beautiful piece of music because that's my favorite recreation, and it dropped in." So, that's what happens when you go to the I love experience. You start to expand, and it's like opening a big available receptacle for the things in your life, the people, the ideas, the creations, to drop in. And you have to open that space, and that's what the I love space does. I had a client that I've known actually for 30 years, very talented client. She was a caretaker by skill. She did hair; she did massage. She did all kinds of things that helped people feel better, but her love was music. And her other love was studying metaphysics, studying spirituality, studying intuitive things. Her whole life was just one series after another of disappointments, bad relationships, disappointing jobs, a lot of accidents. And I just talked to her the other day after I haven't talked to her in 20 years, and she said, "Sonia, I just, I hate my life. I don't have the right life; I have the wrong life." And I said, "You have the right life; you have the wrong attitude. Because everything that you love is valuable, and you can use it. You can put your songs on, now, we don't need gatekeepers; you can produce your own songs. For all this 35 years of studying all this spirituality and coaching, be a coach; sing your songs." And she said, "You know, every day people call me for guidance. And every day I give those people my song. I just don't think that it has any value, so I give it away." I said, "Well you're doing what you love." And she said, "That part I am." "Then put value on it. Your attitude is what's missing. Your life is working." She's like, "Aha, never thought of it that way." Who knows what'll happen with her? That was a very recent conversation. But you have to spin around and change your perceptions and recognize what is of value in your life. Are you doing what you love? Put value on it. Other people told her there was no value to her spiritual interests, even though she was a very talented coach. Other people told her there was no value to her music, although people have asked her every day for 30 years for her music. So, you have to see that. And now there is another little tool that's kind of fun. This was the one of the first tools I learned. It's called fishing for ideas. Fishing for inspiration. Fishing for the answer. Where you sit down, you close your eyes, you just imagine: what guidance am I looking for? And again, let me remind you, it has to be real. You have to be really available to the answer. So if you are enmeshed in a relationship that you're not ready to leave and every ounce of you knows it sucks, and you don't want to go, don't ask your guidance. Should I go? Because you've already decided I'm not ready. But if you're actually uncertain and prepared and you're feeling a guidance, is this correct for me? Show me what's true. Then present it to your guidance. And don't ask it as a should I question. For example, moving to a foreign country, fish. See the little fishing rod go out, the little worm; pull it in; what do you see? Yes or no, something will pop up. Or, wait. You don't know but the minute you get the first answer, say it out loud. It's a game; we're just playing. This is not a test; it's a game. And you don't have to follow the guidance, yet. Just receive the guidance. You still have a choice. Get practicing the guidance. Get into the conversation with your divine self. Create a space and a place for the input to come. And I have a final and really fun tool. It trains your brain to be creative and to open up the pathway for real divine inspiration, really good ideas to come in. And it's called 19 solutions. Now, in our traditional training, perception, education, there's one problem, there's one answer; it's very linear. But when you begin to live in Wonderland, I was taught and I've used this my whole life, that there's never one answer to anything. There are actually 19 answers minimum, to any problem, any obstacle, any question, any uncertainty. So, this is a game you play. Present the issue that you're struggling with. "I'm miserable in my relationship; what do I do?" And then instead of trying to figure out the right answer, write down or say out loud, but it is fun to write it down, 19 solutions, 19, just, "I could live next door." "I could have three girlfriends or three boyfriends." "I could leave all together." You know, it's sort of like the song, "50 Ways To Leave Your Lover." That's was actually one of my of favorite songs because I thought, okay, this is another version of 19 solutions. You might even play that song just to give you the idea that it's not all or nothing, black or white; that's never true. And it starts to train your awareness to connect with your divine, your intuitive self and become receptive to things you never considered. One of my clients used the 19 solutions because she had a job that she felt she was tied to, for security, but she hated it. Should I leave? Should I go? I don't see any other alternative; been here so long, lot of reasons. So, she wrote down 19 solutions. One of them was to actually tell her workmates she didn't like them. And she thought, well, that's rude; that's bold. So, because she was leaving anyway, she thought, well, maybe I will. Maybe I'll just do that because she was so resentful, and she was so resistant, that she said if I'm going to lose my job, I'm going to lose it on my terms. If I'm going to walk out, I'm going to walk out telling everybody what I think. So, she called a meeting, and she said, "I'm leaving today, and the reason I'm leaving is I don't like any of you." One of her workmates said, "Well, actually that's pretty obvious. You put out such a bad vibe, and you put out such resistance and such defensiveness, we don't know what we did." And she was surprised. She goes, "What do you mean? I'm not doing that." And they said, "Oh yes you are. You don't feel good; we don't feel comfortable trying anything with you. We actually want to work with you. We want to try some projects with you. But you're hard to get to." It never occurred to her, never occurred to her that maybe she was the problem. So, one of her workmates said "Why don't you just stay for another month? If you still don't like us in another month, then quit. But can we tell you if we don't like you too? And if you're showing up in a way that we're not enjoying? I mean, if we're going to be that open and honest around here." It made her laugh. And you know, when you laugh, you're on the way up in the elevator to a higher vibe. And she said, "Okay." So, for the next month she stayed, and everybody started playing, "I don't like you." "I don't like you." But it got sillier and sillier and sillier, and at the end of 30 days, she was having the best time. They were having such a creative experience together. None of the barking dogs were out, were in hiding and ambushing one another; they fought it out and started playing, and the next thing you know, they elevated up to spirit. She didn't quit her job; she's still there, and she's having the time of her life- 19 solutions. So try that, but do remember the way to get to this place is you have to meditate in the morning. You have to train yourself to create this space to receive good ideas. You have to create this space at night to rest the brain and be receptive because a lot of your intuition will even come in your dream state. So, this is just a different way, play. Play is the way. And the more you play, the more connected you'll become to your own spirit, to your authentic self, to the spirit and the authentic connection with others. Like what happened with my client. And to the quantum field, where you connect to the beautiful genius that resonates and matches where you're going. So play is the way, meditate is the door, into the playful arena. Have fun, put anything on the community board that shows up. Speak out; it's very important. And I'll see you tomorrow.

LESSON 17: How to Vibe Check Everything
--------------------
Welcome back to Sixth Sense Superpower. I am confident that you're feeling the energy. I am confident that if you're playing and you're giving it your all and you're trying even some of these tools, things have really started to shift. And the more you throw in the different tools, you begin to see this isn't something you do occasionally. It's actually a way of life. And frankly, it's a superfun way of life. It's a way of life that keeps bringing you "aha" moments and synchronicities and connections and surprises, and it gives you an opportunity to get a real pulse on the truth of every situation, so that you make the best-informed decisions. Now I've mentioned and it's true, sometimes those decisions are going to be challenging, but with practice, it gets easier. And the more you practice and the better the results, it starts to make sense. So you start to develop a different value system. And that really, you know, our value system is what moves us in life. It's what makes our decisions. It's what motivates us. It's what kind of governs how we live. And if we have a value system that's so five sensory and so barking dog, and it's running our inner mechanism, then we will feel drained, and we will feel kind of secretly like we're impostors, like I'm not living the life I was designed to live, that I was born to live, that I am authentically craving. So part of what we have to do is upgrade your value system and start naming what you value now. I value my spirit. I value the voice of my inner enlightened genie. I value listening to my vibes. I value speaking out and being true to myself. I value living authentically. I value having the courage and the confidence to choose to follow what feels true for me, for now. I value my boundaries. I value my container. I value a clear space. I don't invite anybody's barking dog to poop in my space, anybody's bad energy to camp out. I value my beautiful vibration. If you start writing those things down and really embodying those things, then you're automatically going to start shifting and aligning naturally with your intuition. You won't have to think about it because it starts to kick in, and it becomes the way you are. Now one of the things that you want to have at this point in time is people who mirror you. One of the big objections that I've run into is "I'll be alone." "I'll be so weird." "I'll be so different." But not really. There are other people like us out there. They're in your community, but you need those people to mirror you. We've been so used to being mirrored by people with what I call stink eye. You know, the "Who do you think you are?" And "Don't get a big head." And "You better take it easy, and you better be safe." And "What do you think is out there?" You know, "Just take what you get and shut up." We've heard a lot of that because it's common. We sixth sensories, we don't live a common life. We live an extraordinary life. But we run our lives on a different set of values, and one of those values is "I value kindred spirits." So I want you to recognize the importance of the community, that when we start having people that mirror us, it builds our confidence. I call that believing eyes. We need believing eyes. People, when you say, "You know, I'm thinking of writing a book." You need someone who says "Yes. Yes, I'll read that book." Or "I'm thinking of being an artist." "I'm thinking of writing a play." The person in your life says, "Yes, I want to be in that play. I'll sell tickets for that play. I'll tell everybody about that play." Instead, we surround ourselves with people unfortunately who say, "You? Who'd want to read that play?" "You? Good luck; any kind of business you want to start in this financial environment is just a bad idea." You know, my mom was a really important teacher to me, and she said, "You know, there's never a lack of anything except imagination." That's the only thing that people lack, and if you lack that, you lack everything. So part of what we need is to start surrounding yourself with believing eyes, people who believe you. "So, okay, how do I do that? Everybody around me has stink eye and bad vibes and barking dog." Well, it's easy. Become that first. You put out the vibe. You put out the frequency. When somebody shares a dream, an aspiration, say, "I'll be the first to support that. I applaud you; do it; go for it." I had an experience when I was doing readings in my 20s. I was late 20s, and a cute kid came to me for a reading. He said, "I want to start a restaurant, and everybody tells me I'm crazy, but I want that. My heart tells me that's what I want to do. What do you think?" And I said, "Well, it doesn't matter what I think, but I can mirror back to you intuitively that you're on the right track." He said, "But I don't have any money. I'm from a poor family. I don't even have a degree as a chef." And I said, "It doesn't matter. Get your friends together. Tell them what you want, and you'll be able to pull it off." Well, he did. He believed me which made him believe his own vibe. So he went for it. He just got five kids. They're all in their early 20s, and they all scrounged up somehow $10,000, and they opened a restaurant. It was called Mia Francesca's. Well, do you know what? When I looked at it and he said, "Well, what do you see?" I said, "I feel like they're going to line up. They'll just line up to get in that little place." And sure enough, they did, and do you know, now he has over 35 restaurants across America? He is the business owner and employs almost 5,000 people. And to this day, he comes back and says, "It was that conversation. My inner voice said 'Do it,' but nobody around me did except you. So when you said it, I believed me." And this is part of what we need to live an intuitive life. One, two, three people who are going to mirror your intuition accurately and not put their stink eye on you, not put their barking dog, not put their what I call their poopy diaper in your world and say, "That's your reality." You have to be really selective. Pay attention to who you're surrounding yourself with, and pay attention to not what they're saying but what you feel. Do they lift you up and bring you out? Do they give you the courage and confidence to trust your inner guidance? Or do they trip you up? Like the people who want to hold you back because they're too scared to try something. That's what's really essential. That's why we need a community. What I grew up with, not only a mom who would say, "Trust your spirit; do what your spirit says. That's the most important." I had six brothers and sisters who said the same thing too, and we all did it for each other, and we all championed each other, and every one of my family members is living a life they love, every single one. And we're all living a bit of an original life because we had these mirrors that said, "Go for it." We are pack animals. We need, we need some reflection of encouragement. But if you start being that, you start attracting that. Starts with you. First, tell yourself, but don't think you have to go this alone. I mean, even Jesus had 12 helpers, so we can learn from that role model, that there's some value to surrounding yourself with good energy. And do make that a priority. So when you check your vibes, check the vibes of the people around you. Do they have imagination? Are they creative? Do they have dance in their pants? Or are they tight butt? Do they have a sense of humor? And will they support lifting you up? Or do they want to keep you down because they're too controlling? Don't fight what is, and don't try to change what is. Don't try to change the people in your life to get them up to speed because you won't succeed. That is an inside job. But do start putting out the frequency, the intention, that you want support. And frankly, the genius of this particular play date with us is you have the community. So already you have instant available support. Pay attention to you. Often, we are a lot more negative than we realize. Barking dog is naturally oriented to be negative, so pay attention to what you say; pay attention. I had one client the other day call me. She called my office and told my business partner, "I have to give Sonia a message." She said, "When I came to see her 15 years ago, she said the silliest thing to me but it changed my life." She said, "I came for an intuitive session with her, and I was so traumatized by my negative, angry father, and you said he's just a mouse in big shoes." And that was just something that popped in my head as a vision because that's how intuition works. I thought somehow conversation and let's dialogue your father's patterns and yours wasn't going to work, but I got an image, a little mouse in big shoes. She laughed so hard. She could never be afraid of her father again. Changed their relationship, and they're best friends today. She actually had a friend of hers make a little mock-up toy of a little mouse and big shoes and gave it to him for his birthday recently, and it changed everything. So intuition brings the signs, but she said, "That was my believing eyes, that I could see him in a way that I wanted to see him instead of be cowering and afraid. We both benefited." So this is a dynamic moment in your life. Be believing eyes. Be the uplifting vision. Look from the viewpoint of your spirit. Don't look from the viewpoint of your barking dog and stink eye or others. Don't look through other people's dirty window. Tell people, "If you have that vision, I'll support it." It takes courage. Don't be the person to protect everybody from disappointment. Be the person to fan the flames, to say, "Dance in your fire. Be a fire dancer, and go for it." So today, I want you to think about this. Are you believing eyes, or are you stink eye? Don't judge; just notice. And if you are stink eye, wash the window. Fake it till you make it. Put out positive energy. Support people because people will let these little snippets of truth come out, but they're used to them being slammed down. And the minute they are, it feels threatening; it feels demoralizing, so we go inward again. But if you are that person, you'll attract that back, and that's one of the dynamic reasons why when you live the sixth-sense life, when you really begin to integrate this energy, the universe will match you. The frequency, the quantum field physics will start to bring that in and lift you up. It works quickly, very quickly. I have to tell you this story. My believing eyes was Julia Cameron. She was my client at the time. We were both in Chicago, and I was doing readings for her intuitively, and she went on to write the very famous book, "The Artist's Way". Well, one day she came to me and said, "I feel like you have a book in you." And the truth is I actually did have a book, but I took that book that I wrote and gave it to a client of mine before. I'd written this book, and I called it "The Practical Psychic." That's what I came up with at 20. When I took the book to the editor, she asked me one question. She read it, read it, read it, and she said, "I only have one question. Is English your first language?" It was like, pshh! You know, embarrassed me to death. I threw the book in the closet, shut the door, and I never mentioned it again. I was so humiliated. When Julia asked me, "I have a feeling you have a book in you." I got scared and I said, "I don't have a book in me." She goes, "I think you do." And I said, "I don't." She said, "What do you mean?" I said, "English isn't my first language." Just popped out and she laughed at me and she says, "Well, I don't care what language you speak." She goes, "You're speaking some other language all the time anyway. But would you teach me what you know?" So I said, "Okay, I'll teach you." But she didn't live in Chicago anymore. She lived in Taos, New Mexico. So she said, "Will you write to me?" And I said, "Okay, I guess." This was all very new to me. And she said, "I have an idea." I'm really dating us, but this is back in the day. She said, "I have a fax machine. Do you have one?" And I said, "Well, actually, we just got one. We're just figuring it out." She goes, "Will you fax me every day? And if you fax me, I'll be your student." So I started writing her letters. "Dear Julia, I grew up in an intuitive household. We listened to our vibes every day." And she would write back, "That's so interesting. Tell me more." "Dear Julia, I had six brothers and sisters, and we played intuitive games all day long, and we had so much fun, and we never followed the rules." "That's so interesting; tell me more." This went on and on and on for like six months. Then one day, I wrote to Julia, "I don't have anything else to say. How are you today?" And she wrote back and she said, "You just changed my life. Everything you wrote is a whole other world than I've been living in. Do you mind if I put this together and see what we come up with?" "I'm okay with that." She helped me organize that. She took it to her agent in Random House, and they published it as my first book, and that's how my first book was written, with believing eyes. I had it in me; I tried. I got shut down. She came in, lifted it out of the garbage, out of me, started over, and that's how it all began. You can be that believing eyes because I was her believing eyes when she was coming to me. It got reciprocated. We're friends to this day. So I just want you to know this is not a solo journey, and you can open up to others. You can be the force you're looking for, and it will come back to you in so many miraculous ways. I never had an agent. I never tried to get my book published. I never looked for anything. Just showed up, but I did follow my vibes, and I did be the person I was meant to be by being an intuitive guide when everybody said you're crazy. So that's my message today. First, be the good vibes. Look around, notice the good vibes. Run away from the bad vibes. Just tell them you have to go and don't explain. If you do it really fast, they won't stop you. Like, "Oh, I got to go." They won't question; run away. Connect with the people and be the mirrors of your spirit to other people's spirit, and your whole life will change so fast and be so miraculous. It'll blow your mind. Write on the tribe community page believing positive feedback to one another. Rehearse this; it's not very practiced. Most people aren't that generous. Generosity is a big part of living in this world. Be generous; reflect the goodness back to people. Encourage them to follow their hearts; encourage them. Encourage means to amplify their heart wisdom, and it will ricochet back, and it's a win-win. So you'll love it. It's really another massive game changer and I'll see you tomorrow.

====================

LESSON 18: Choose to Listen to Your Intuition
--------------------
Welcome back bright light of the world's six-sensory superpower genius. I'm so excited that you are actually part of this new vibration. The world needs you. The world needs a lot of people in this vibration because this is the vibration and this is the frequency that's not only going to heal your life, but you're going to become part of a force that's going to start healing other lives because this is contagious. Living this way is so contagious because we are reactivating something that's been dormant that we need. And for every one of us that makes choices to go with our guidance, not only are you affirming and returning to your own authentic and just really cohesive self, you're putting out a vibration that invites other people to return and elevate and start vibrating to theirself. And so one by one by one, it ripples out like ripples in a lake. So wherever you go, I call it good fairies. Just good earth fairies. Wherever you go, things spin and turn and begin to get better because we influence one another. So the more you are modeling and living and choosing to go with your vibes, the more you become part of the solutions of the world and really begin to be part of the help for those who are struggling. So how does that play out in your day-to-day life? Well, the first thing I want you to notice is stop thinking. Whatever you're looking for is not going to come here. Maybe you need, after you make your choices, the guidance of your intellect; okay. My vibes say start a business; the guidance of my intellect says, "Okay, let's make a plan." But you don't let your intellect say, "Well we're not going to start." Make the decision. I was thinking of a client of mine in London, a beautiful young man who fell madly in love with a woman, but they weren't in the same religion. And he was a very religious man, and he loved his parents who were even more religious. And he loved this beautiful woman, and they didn't match in their training, but his heart said go for it. He was scared; he was pretty sure that it would either be the girl or the family, but he couldn't have both. Being believing-eyes, he asked me what I thought. And I said, "Well, follow your heart and trust, trust that it didn't lead you down a wrong path that would cause you such a catastrophic consequence. It appears that way, but you don't know. Choose your heart and see what happens." So he said, "Oh, I've never been in love like this. I'm going to choose my heart. I'm going to tell my parents, and I will live with, I will dance in the fire," which I've taught you. "And I'll just trust that I wasn't led here to be in a disastrous end result." Well, his parents weren't happy, but they weren't also completely uninterested. They were more interested than he thought, at least slightly available, willing to at least deeply express their disappointment. But at the same time say, "Well it's your choice," which shocked him. Then he took his girlfriend home, and within three hours, all the resistance, all the suspicion, all the projection ended, and his parents loved his girlfriend. They got married, and he can't believe it because he never in a million years thought that could happen. But he chose to go with his heart. I pointed out it's a disruptor. But you know what, it was not just good for him and his girlfriend, it was good for both families. Because the family opened up to a new reality on both sides. And that ripples out into more understanding in the world, back and forth. We're not alone, we're not islands. We're influencers, positive influencers, if we choose. I have another client who was a coach for a big consulting firm. And she worked with this one company, coaching them in middle management for many years. It was a comfortable job; it had a certain consistency; it even lent her prestige. But frankly she said, "I'm way underpaid, and my job is to coach the company to make more money which they've made over 10 years. So my guidance says I should ask for more money." She said, "Okay, well, you can choose what my intellect, my barking dog, says: this is a perfectly good job, and if I ask, I could get turned down." I said, "You could; are you willing to dance in the fire? What are you going to choose?" She said, "Well, I'm so mad when I go to work every day and have been for at least two years. I'm going to ask for a raise. I'm going to choose to ask for a raise." So she asked; she got fired. She got the raise turned down, and the middle manager job position was replaced, and she ended up on her ear back home. I said, "How do you feel about that?" And she said, "Well, I'm out of a job, but at least I'm congruent. I was so mad." and she says, "I'm scared, but I was more scared to stay because I was betraying myself." And I said, "Well you chose that; don't believe that your guidance is going to lead you ever to a dead end. It doesn't, but you may have to hold space, which is why we've created this space, and be patient a little longer." Two months later, the president of the company called her and said, "You've been with us for 12 years; you really took our company to a higher level. I know you lost your job there, and I understand why. You really were underpaid for that job, but you also outgrew that job. You deserve a different job." And he hired her to be his personal executive coach at double the salary. Now she had to wait in the middle, but she made a choice, and we have to make those choices. We want everything all lined up, but sometimes there's pauses. That's why you need the community; that's why you need your believing mirrors who say, "Look, hang in there; hang tight." Your heart, your inner guidance, your intuition will never lead you to an absolute dead end. But it might lead you in a direction that appears to be a detour or invites you to look at things quite differently. I have another client who was really invested in her speaking. She had a speaking program, and she was another type of coach that taught public speaking. And she worked hard, really hard, at this. And it was going along, kind of anemically. And she liked it, but she didn't love it. But she worked with her intuition. I taught her and coached her a little bit. And one day I said to her, "Just let the magic come out in you." Something about those words hit. And she said, "You know what I did with that? I started studying magic. It was so much fun. I started showing magic tricks to kids, starting with my niece and nephew. It started to work. The next thing you know, I am inventing this brand new kids' program for bringing the magic out in them." And then she wrote a book about bringing the magic out in children; then she wrote a whole bunch of kids' songs that are brilliant. And she has started this brand new business about bringing the magic out in children. And she said, "It's so brilliant; I am on fire with joy. From just that two words and the desire and the encouragement to trust my heart. So I'm not coaching people to be good public speakers anymore, I am teaching kids to continue to let their magic grow, and I've never been happier in my life." So this is how, do you see how it's all starting to work together? It's not just you on a linear track; it's you in an exponential network. Above, below, side to side, in all directions, you become this radiant light, and it's like a satellite. It beams out what I want; it beams back what I need. It beams out good vibes; it beams back good connections. It beams out I need to stay congruent; it beams back where you begin to drift off path. It beams out I want kindred spirit, communication and connection in relationships; it pops those people in your path spontaneously. And the best part is you don't have to figure out any of this. Don't, because what you figure out is never going to be as good as what the universe, what the quantum field will mirror back. It's more generous for you than you. What you do have to do is make that fourth decision. Choose to trust your intuition and go with what you feel instead of play it safe. Choose, and know that choice could be uncomfortable. And yes, that choice could definitely leave you temporarily, that choice could definitely leave you temporarily uncomfortable. So that's why you have your believing-eye companions. That's why you dance in the fire; that's why you play a lot; that's why you create the stamina and the life force to navigate these segues, to navigate these gate changes that take you to different types of future than the one perhaps you thought was the answer. You just have to partner with the quantum field, with the universe, with your spirit, with the goodness all around and trust that if I stay true to myself, I don't have to figure out the details. I just have to be willing to dance with the clues. I just have to be willing to surrender and go forward and not be in control. I have to have a sense of humor. I have to expect good things. And here is the final thing that you need to be able to live this way. You have to be grateful for the life you have. You have to be supergrateful and say so. "I'm grateful for my friends." "I'm grateful for you." Tell people that you're grateful; tell people that you appreciate them. And try this one; try this one 'cause I love this one. When I ask people for help, they sometimes say, "Can't help you." And I say, "Maybe not today; maybe not in this moment, but maybe tomorrow." And I have constant people coming back saying, "You know that request you made?" I have an apartment in London that I needed to find very close to my daughter who just had her first baby. My request was for a very simple apartment in her neighborhood, that was beautiful, for a very low... Again, I always like to get the best rent. And we talked to a realtor, and he says, "I can't help you." Of course, and we know real estate changes quickly, but so quickly, and I said, "Maybe not today, but maybe tomorrow." Sure enough, the next day he said, "You're actually right: today I have what you asked for; it wasn't here yesterday." So ask, and say, "I'm grateful you're going to help me, and you don't even know that." That's what my mother always used to say to people. "I'm grateful you're going to help me. Guess what; you don't know you're going to help me, but you're going to help me. And it's going to be fun for both of us." See how playful that is, how fun? It's another version of expect good things, and it's teaching others you can be a good thing in my life, and I can be a good thing in your life. And we don't even know how that's going to work out, yet. 'Cause it's constantly growing, constantly evolving. I want you to share with our community, the things you're grateful for, and some things that you're grateful for that haven't happened yet. That's when the game gets fun. That's when the game gets fun; then it's not just sort of a religious practice you learned at church. "Yes, thank you; I'm grateful" because that's useless. I'm talking about, "I'm grateful for the wonderful thing that's going to happen to me tomorrow that you might be involved in. I'm grateful for that." That creates a magnetic vacuum of expectation with a dollop of sweetness and a whole lot of fun. Starts to work out that way. Remember we're in Wonderland. Okay, so you check in with your tribe; you write down your gratitudes; you tell people "I'm grateful." And if they say, "I can help you," just say, "Maybe not today; maybe tomorrow. I am open for that." And watch how fun life gets, and people will come back because they're not often mirrored in a positive way. They're not, and they love it. I'll see you tomorrow.

LESSON 19: How to Lead From Your Intuition
--------------------
Welcome back. The sixth sense is your superpower. Your sixth sense is your superpower. And now, it's time to get a little bit fluent with it. You know, you've called it in; you tried it on; it's starting to work for you. Now, we want to amp it up and really let it become the major conversation of your life, the major influence. The influence of your spirit to override everything, to the point that that is what you're listening to. And that you actually flip the script, and you tune everything else out that was distracting. That it no longer is even a choice. You begin to be dialed in. And that goes back to choosing as the fourth decision. So let me just reiterate the four decisions. First, you're open. That's like turning the radio on. You're turning your heart on. You're turning your consciousness on. You're turning your receptivity on. Two, your intuition. The second choice. I'm going to expect it. I expect good things. I expect my inner guidance to work. I expect the universe to work with me. I expect to make vibrational connections that are matches, that pull in and broadcast out and receive everything that allows me to live at the highest vibrational creative frequency. And when I feel that, I trust it; I don't roll it around my brain. I don't shop it around with my friends. "What do you think?" "What do you think? I'm feeling this. I'm having problems." Unless, unless it is someone who is in your community of believing eyes. And in that case, you go back and you share, "I need some support. I'm having this vibration and I need to have you assist me because it's a big shift and I need an energy boost. I need mirroring." Now, there are times when your ego will interrupt and try to sneak in there and try to fake you out and try to give you guidance that is really just a disguised way to sabotage you. So I want to remind you, check the vibe. Do you feel open, spontaneous? Do you feel confident? Is your mind quiet, or are you contracting? Are you shrinking? Are you losing energy? Are you feeling? Are you thinking too much? And look in the mirror. Is the light gone? No smile. Little tight butt. You can tell. There's always the signatures that your spirit is present. You radiate. Your eyes light up. You smile naturally. And you move because spirit is fire. This essence of your life force is energetic; it's dynamic, and it's always moving you forward. It's moving you to the right connections. It's moving you into place. It's not dense. It's not stagnant. And then we come to the place where I am choosing to have that be my main conversation, I choose to be the channel that I listen to. So open, I turn the radio on. Expect, I dial in. Trust, I hear the music and act on your intuition. That's the fourth step, choose to act. I move with the music. And better yet, the music moves me. I don't think about anything anymore. If I have a vibe, I do it. If I feel something that feels true, I don't challenge it. Can you imagine? I don't challenge it. I just go for it. And when you shift and start making those connections, life becomes really fun and funny. It's fun and funny because there's a lot of humor in the quantum field. Life wants to lift you up. Life wants to make you laugh. It wants to surprise you. The other day, I was with my daughter in London. She has a brand new baby. And she, like me, is very particular about vibration, about energy, about who's going to be around, and especially with a brand new baby; we're very territorial about good vibes only. So she said, "Well, I need someone to come and watch the baby for a little while, a couple hours a week. And I don't know where to go or who to ask because I don't want to go to agencies. I don't want to invite in the traditional people because this doesn't feel right to me." So we were walking the baby around the park, and we came down the street, and she saw her neighbor's chef. She has a neighbor who has a cook who comes in and out. And she said, "That's my neighbor's chef." And I said, "Oh, really?" And we walked a few more steps. And she says, "Yeah, she's so lucky. She has a chef who comes in. I've talked to her before a couple times but very briefly." I said, "That's interesting. How fun. I wish I had a chef. I don't cook." So as we walked by her, the minute I got right in front her, I said, "Hi, how are you?" And she said, "Great." I said, "Excuse me; can I ask you something?" She said, "Sure, what?" I said, "Well, this is really kind of not your area, but I just feel inclined to ask you. Do you know anybody who might be in the neighborhood that has good energy that could possibly work for my daughter a couple hours a week? It's not a real big job. It's just a little bit of a baby job for the baby." And she saw the baby. And she said, "Well, actually, as a matter of fact, I just talked to my friend two days ago who is someone who works as a nanny. She lives two blocks from here, but she was in Brazil for six months, and she just came back a couple weeks ago and doesn't have a job. Would you like to meet her?" I was like, "Yes, I would like to meet her." She was like, "Yes." And now, it worked. Direct connect. Not even five minutes between my daughter saying, "I'm looking for someone" and someone showing up. Key is I could have thought about it. I could have even said, "Let me think about it." I'll ask her tomorrow or in a few days, or the next time I see her. But maybe then, her available friend wouldn't be available. She was looking for a job. So this is what the magic of synchronicity is. It's the dance of the universe. It's the choreography of magic where you move into place, and you move into place, and you move into place, and bam, everything starts to move together. When I was first beginning my public career, I was invited to speak, to actually introduce Deepak Chopra, who was giving a big talk in Chicago at the time. And this was when the Chicago Bulls were, a basketball team, were the champions of the world. So this particular talk, they were having this kind of small cocktail party for the VIPs. And I was, first of all, I was just so excited that I was even invited 'cause I had just published my first book. But part of the VIP group was the head of the Bulls. And I was so excited. I was more enamored of him than I was of Deepak Chopra really 'cause I love basketball. So I found the courage to ask him. I said, "Can you tell me how you choose champions? Because you have this whole team of champions, like everyone, so how did you pick the champions? How do you judge?" I was just wondering how his intuition worked. And he said, "Well, it's a good question. I watch the player's hips. And I said, "What do you mean?" He said, "Well, a champion in sports, when they're playing the ball, their hips move with the ball, and their head comes after. So their energy is tracking the ball and not their head trying to follow the game." And I thought, "That is exactly what I do." My hips are tracking the flow and my head, thank goodness, is not even in the game. It just shows up. So that is kind of what you need to do. Let your hips, let your solar plexus, the place in you that makes decisions, lead with your heart, not trip over your head. That's why I keep encouraging you to dance. Like for real, dance. Because it lets your hips lead and you know, let your hips swing, and do your own version of the hula, so that when it's time and you get a vibe, it doesn't go from heart to head. Because heart to head, you lose your moment. You lose your moment. If the player's looking like this and this, the ball's already gone. When you move from heart to hips, you don't lose your moment. You stay in the game. It's all about play. So I want you to allow yourself to drop in, have a direct connect. Let your creative compass, let your expanded genius, inner genie, bright life, divine self, spirit, whatever you want to call it, move you. Don't let your head hold it back. And that takes a lot of practice. Just a lot of practice. So I think the most important thing to do is tell everybody. It's sort of when you name it, you claim it. Tell everybody I am such an intuitive person. I just run with whatever I feel. Even if you're not quite there yet, your own words will start informing your inner barking dog that this is the new way we do things. I just go with it. I'm just flying with it. I don't stop and think about it. I remember going one time. I was invited to apply to speak to a group of like 5 or 6,000 members of the American Chiropractic Association at their national convention in Las Vegas. This is a big deal. People apply for that from all walks of life, to be the keynote speaker. Most of the people applying are very accomplished people, tons of best-selling books, a big reputation. And my girlfriend who is one of my believing eyes and a chiropractor, said to me, "Sonia, you should apply." And I said, "Okay, I'll do it," because I'm not afraid to hear no. I don't fear that disappointment. So she then says, "Well, you have to make a video, and you have to make a PowerPoint to present your case and convince him. And you have plenty of time, and I'll help you. And we'll give him and when he sees the energy you have, he'll go for it, but you have to have this PowerPoint." Well, I don't know how to do a PowerPoint to this day. Let alone then. I don't think in PowerPoint. It's like not my steez, as my girls would say. It's not my style. But she was really adamant, so I would tell her, she'd say, "How's it coming?" I'd say, "It's coming; it's coming." "Are you getting ready?" "I'm getting ready." Okay, I'm really excited. So she meets me the day we're supposed to go and talk to this guy. When I showed up, I didn't have my computer, and she was really distraught. "Where's your computer? How are you going to do your PowerPoint? Do you have a little drive or something?" I said, "No, I didn't bring my computer." "What do you mean you didn't bring your computer?" I said, "I only brought my book, 'Trust Your Vibes'." She said, "What do you mean you brought your book? He probably gets 5,000 books a year. You need to give him your PowerPoint. It took me forever to even get you the interview." I said, "I'm sorry. "That's all I was told, all I feel to bring." She was very disappointed in me and very annoyed and very invested in me getting a chance and being considered, but I didn't do it her way. And so her vibes were off. And I said, "Will you do me a favor? Don't go with me. Sit in the lobby." And "I don't want to feel your energy 'cause it throws me off of my game." And again, that really irritated her, but she knew me well enough to say, "Okay, okay. I tried." I said, "You did." So I go into my meeting. I shake the guy's hand. And he said, "So what have you got for me?" And I gave him my book. He didn't even say, "What is your name?" He just said, "What have you got for me?" So I give him my book. And he takes my book, and he puts it on his forehead and closes his eyes. Then, he takes it off, and he said, "You're hired." My whole interview was like less than 60 seconds long. And he said, "Tell them the details. "I'll see you in Las Vegas." I got the job. But it really meant jumping over a lot of gates of the way we do things. And that's where you have to learn to build up those muscles, and it's with sense of humor. Defensiveness will suck you down. You have to have a sense of humor, and you have to dance in the fire of a little bit of other people's frustration at times, other people's fear, and just say, "Trust me. I trust me, so you trust me. "And if I'm disappointed and I disappoint you, forgive me." I say that a lot. Forgive me if I blow it, but I'm going to try it this way. Now, I told you, this is wonderland. I told you that we're flipping the script. I told you this is not the ordinary way; it's the extraordinary way. It's really fun. Might sound outrageous, but you know, if you talk to people who are at the top of their game, I don't care if it's art, it's science, it's medicine, I don't care. That's how they do it. That's how they do it. They are in the moment and make a choice. I have a beautiful client that I mentor. She's a breast cancer doctor. Just fabulous, devoted healer. And she was sharing with me just recently a story where a woman had this, she had a recurrence of a very, very vicious cancer. So in her operating room when she's taking out the tumor, she did something she never does. She was moved to put her hands on the tumor and dig underneath it and literally pull it off the muscle. And her operating helpers were like, "What are you doing?" And she said, "I'm following my instincts." This thing's burrowed in, and I'm going for it. So she said she maneuvered it out with her hands, but that was where she could see she got the edges. She said, "I know that woman's going to be okay now." But in the moment, she had all this conditioning, all this training, all this influence, and all these people who had another idea in mind. But she is used to trusting her vibes, and in her case, thank God because she's saving lives. So this is not for the faint of heart. This is for those who really want to live to the edges and beyond and not color in the lines but erase the lines. All the tools I brought to you up until now will give you evidence that this works. I'm not saying jump into the void. I'm actually saying jump back in to yourself. Jump in; connect, and you will have evidence. But for fun, what I recommend is every time that you get a gut feeling, an "aha", a hunch, an instinct, an inclination, an impulse, an urge, guidance, say it out loud. Say it out loud. It doesn't work, it isn't validated, and it won't move you to action if you ignore it. Now, if you don't speak it, if you don't express it, it won't move you to action. The minute you say it out loud, it takes on an energy of its own. The minute you say, "I have a vibe; I have a feeling; "I have a guidance;" you can't erase that. You know what's exciting about that? Even if you don't follow it, it's still there. And you will know and have evidence later that I should have ... I should have done that. I was warned. I was alerted. I did have the opportunity. I could have done that. It's up to you. I remember this one time I was in, there's a city not far from Chicago, St. Louis, and I was taking a flight from St. Louis back to Chicago when my daughters were very young. They were like two and three years old, and my husband and I at the time went to a wedding. And we were flying back on standby. And we're waiting for the last flight of the day, and it was very overfilled. And the agent said, "I don't think you're going to get home." But my vibes said, "You're going to get home." So the agent boards the flight. It's the last flight home. My babysitter's only booked till midnight. It's 8:00 PM. It's an hour flight. He puts everybody on the plane. He looks at me and my husband and says, "I'm sorry, there's no seats. Everybody go home; go home." So my husband gets up and starts walking away, and my body won't move, and I'm sitting there. And he looks at me and he says, "Come on, we blew it. Call the babysitter." And I said, "Just wait, just for a minute. Just wait." And he was annoyed and said, "Okay, whatever." So he started to walk back to me and we sat for 10 minutes. We saw the plane pull away from the gate, pull away from the Jetway. And he said, "Well, what are you waiting for? Are we going to fly with our wings?" I mean, it was one of those tense, fun moments in my dance-in-the-fire life. But then, the agent comes running down the corridor, down the terminal, opens the Jetway, runs; the plane comes back. Three people come running off, a man, a woman, and about a 10-year-old child. And the agent says, "We boarded three people and there were only two seats. We had one, the child had no seat, and they didn't want to break up, so I guess you're on." Yes! It's the game. But I had to sit with it for a minute and deal with all the judgment. But when you tune it out, it becomes fun. When you tune it out. So flip the script and say, "This is fun. I wonder what'll happen?" Knowing full well, maybe nothing. But if nothing happens, you're right where you started, right? You're already kind of told it's not going to happen, so what do you have to lose? It's all about the body. It's all about listening with your whole being. It's all about the meditation every day for a few minutes. It's keeping the space and the field clear, so you can feel, like "The Princess and the Pea," the impulse that guides you. But tuning in and turning the volume up on that information, and tuning down and pushing out the other information. One of the ways that you can do this is automatic writing and inspirational writing. This is really fun. Just write a question down to present to your inner genius, your inner guiding light. Again, knowing full well the question has to be a really authentic question. And then, as if it's your inner guiding light, your bright light, your spirit answering, answer. Just write the answer, but you have to do it fast. You can't sit and think and contemplate. You can even close your eyes as you're answering and see what starts rolling. See what starts tumbling out. You may do draws and doodles and tic-tac-toes. But you may not even write anything that's coherent, but it'll drop into your awareness as you're writing the answer. So I do this all the time. I've written 27 books, and I've never once had any sort of a prospectus or a book layout. I don't even know the language. Well, you know, you write out the book and you say, "This is what I'm going to write." I couldn't do that. I just sit down and write. 27 times. Just write because the spirit in you is organized. If you, say, are a really gifted chef, you probably go in the kitchen and you just cook. You're not in your head going A, B, C. If you're an artist, you just paint. If you're a musician, and I have many musician clients, you just sing; you just write; you just jam. It works. So it's like, what's your jam? Do that a lot. And you can write as a way to amplify your jam. It's fun. It's important to give it space. It always works. Inspirational writing can really turn into what's called automatic writing. That's how I wrote all of my books. Never knew what I was going to write. I never planned it out. I never had book proposals. See, now my barking dog, Fifi, helps. I never had a book proposal. I never could write a book proposal. I don't know how that works. My brain doesn't go there anymore. I don't live in that brain. Fifi figures it out, and she helps me find the people who can help me. This creative brain is not mine alone. Anybody who has had any great creative breakthroughs will say they did the same thing. They did the same thing. I'm not an original. I just know that this, which I'm sharing with you, is the way. Play is the way. Flip the script. Make room, and then choose to act on your vibes. Dance the dance. Get into your jam. Have fun with it. Your lesson is to try automatic writing today. Try some inspirational writing. Give it about five minutes at the most. Write a question; close your eyes, and as if your divine self, your spirit, your higher consciousness, your superconsciousness is answering. So you are having a direct conversation, a direct connect with the part of you that's connected to everything at the highest level. And the reason the writing works is because it involves the kinesthetics. It trains the muscles in your body. It trains your brain. It trains everything to reorient and go to where the real answers are, where the true answers are, where the true inspiration is. And it's fun. It's really fun. And the best part is you have evidence if you write it down. So it may not make sense today, but it'll make sense tomorrow or eventually. And that's how it works. Again, meditate morning and night. But see it as a way to renew yourself, not a task, not a job, not a duty. Like a drink at the well. And also, check in with the tribe. Tell them; share with them your automatic or inspirational writing experience. What happened? What evidence do you have? It's really fun to share with your believing eyes. Okay. That's it for today, and I'll see you tomorrow.

====================

LESSON 20: Live Full Out
--------------------
Your sixth sense is your superpower. And let's just for the sake of it shift it to the front and let it be the first sense. Let it be the leading guiding light of your life, and really turn it up brightly. So how do you do that? Well, again, we talked about your value system, and I propose and I hope you wrote it down, but I hope and propose that you put at the very top of your value system the number one thing, "I do what I love. I choose what I love. I choose what I love. First and foremost, I choose what I love." And if you have to do something that you don't love, choose to do it with love. If you are obligated to some assignment or you find yourself in a circumstance where you have some kind of obligation or some kind of thing to fulfill, you can at least choose to do it with love instead of resentment and bitterness and passive aggressiveness. Which by the way, you're really obvious. And I want you to know that nobody's bad vibes are ever invisible. Never. I told you earlier that the fairytale of the intuitive life, of choosing an intuitive life is "The Princess and the Pea." It was the princess who said, "What's under that mattress?" and had the courage to say so. She inherited the kingdom. Well, there is the fairytale of the fake life. The fake life is the life that you live where you're going against the grain of who you are. You are ignoring your vibes. You're completely in distress energetically. You're in energetic chaos about it 'cause ... you know what I mean. You can never get away with making choices that don't respect and honor your heart and really be in a congruent energy. It seeps out into your field. It reeks and ripples into the world around you. So that vibe, there's also a fairytale. And the name of that fairytale is called "The Emperor's New Clothes." So if you remember that fairytale, the emperor was a really insecure guy. So he surrounded himself with people who flattered him all the time. And if you didn't flatter him and didn't reassure him that he was the ultimate best, he punished you. So, couple of really witty people showed up in his life, and they knew they were going to take advantage of this. So they said, "Well, you know, someone like you, so special. We have some fabric for you for clothes that only the most special people can wear." And they held it up just like this. And they said, "Can you see it? Because only the most special people can see it, you know." Well, he looked around, and of course he saw what you see. And the emperor said, "Well, yeah, I see it. Do you see it?" And all the court said, "Yeah, I see it. Oh, it's beautiful, lovely, look's great on you." So the emperor says, "Perfect, make me an outfit, and I want a parade. And I want to know who's special in my kingdom, who can see the clothes. I want to know who's special and who's not. So we're going to have a parade." So the word got out: the emperor's going to have a parade. He's going to be in his new clothes. And not everybody can see them and not unless you're special. So all the dogs in the kingdom were getting organized. We're going to see; we're going to see. Do you think you'll see? I'll see, but will you see? So off comes the parade. The emperor is marching down, completely buck naked. Everybody's saying, "Do you see his new clothes?" "Oh yes; he's beautiful." "Do you see his new clothes?" "Magnificent!" "What color." "Do you see his new clothes?" One after the other. And then there was a little boy in the parade, and he pointed him out and he said, "The Emperor is naked!" And everybody gasped. They looked at the little boy. Emperor looked at the little boy. The little boy looked at the Emperor. Everybody looked at the Emperor. Everybody looked at the little boy. Everybody looked at each other. And do you know what happened? The parade went on, and that is the way the ordinary world goes. The parade goes on, and we are more obvious, but everybody's pretending that's not the truth. It's the little boy that said he's naked is your spirit, is your divine self, is your intuitive self. 'Cause the self that is giving you guidance is the truth teller. And the truth teller is the one that reveals that everything's fake that isn't resonating with the heart. It's not worth it. And that the big game of life is a big waste of life if you're not living authentically; it's just a charade. I will have to say, as we kind of get at this point, I had the beautiful experience of working for about five and a half years in hospice which really is just holding people's hands until they walk to heaven. And just being with them at the part of their life as they're starting to die. And I had this one woman that was so meaningful. And as she was struggling; she said, "I'm so troubled, Sonia. I just can't... I can't live with myself." And I said, "Why?" She said, "I forgot to live my life. I lived the life that everybody approved of, and I didn't live my life." She goes, "I know I'm dying, but that's not what bothers me. What's bothering me is everybody's celebrating me for living the wrong life. I was head of the PTA. I was at the school taking care of everybody. I was the first to volunteer. I did everything that won approval, but I didn't do anything that my heart wanted. My husband wanted to have us move to Italy for six months. And I said, 'Eventually,' but we never did." She said, "My heart told me to paint, but I don't even own a box of crayons. Everybody comes and says, 'I love you.' And, 'You're so wonderful' as they know I'm dying. And I want to tell them, 'I'm not, I'm fake.' And, 'What I did wasn't worth it. I didn't live my life.'" She said, "What do I do? How do I die in peace? I'm not going to not die, but I can't... I'm so troubled. How do I die in peace?" And I said, "Tell them. When people come and say goodbye, tell them,; maybe they'll listen." Well, I never heard from her again, but I did hear from her daughter several years later, and she said, "I don't know what you said, but the last three weeks of my mom's life were the most intimate, most meaningful, most real moments of our entire relationship." And she told me to follow my dreams, and she was too chicken to follow hers 'cause she was too busy getting approval. And that's what I want you to really think about. Now, you can stay safe and get approval, but it's an empty reward. It's way overrated. And there's nothing in the end that really allows you to feel like you had a meaningful life. So this is a point where I want you to really take this in. How much are you living for approval versus living full out? How much are you aware that how you live affects everyone else? And if they're rewarding you for the fake life, then they're also realizing that vibration is what I should do. I should live a fake life too. And we'll all live a fake life that has no oxygen, that has no spontaneity, that has no fun, no fire, no truth, and no brilliance. Because the spirit in you, the intuitive side of you, isn't a thing you do. It's not even an extra sense. It's your center. It's the light in you and what lights up. Everybody lights up. And that's what an extraordinary life is. So don't forget to live your life; just don't. Just care enough to not forget, to not buy into "See this? Only the best people get this reward." Flattery, flattery, flattery; empty. So you can see, as I said in the beginning, it's an exponential shift and a different way of life, and it's joyful and wonderful, but you have to choose it. So where are you right now at this point in our experience and our joy together? Where are you aware that you're either betraying yourself, holding yourself back, playing it safe instead of playing it true, being small instead of being bold? And what are you afraid of? We'll go back to, "I'm afraid of," and revisit that tool again. What are you so afraid of now? The one thing we cannot recapture is time. Don't waste it. It might be time for you to just put at the top of your value list, "Did I live full out for me no matter what?" Because I can tell you, there's a point in time where you will be looking at the whole experience and you can say, "Did I live my life or did I give it away?" And that's really what this particular moment in time is about. Because if you choose to live full out, it's like a roller coaster. I mean, you might be like, "Ahhhhh," but you will love it. You will love it. But if you stay on the baby ride, you'll get bored and you'll be boring. Sorry to say, I have to tell you, shoot the messenger, but boring. There's no excitement. There's no joy. There's no life. Live full out, and you will be someone who not only has a beautiful life but you will be that light in you don't know how many people's lives that they will say, "You know, I had an encounter with someone. It was two minutes, five minutes conversation on a bus or in a plane or standing in line at the grocery store. And they changed my life. I don't know why; they just had such a dynamic energy that it helped me remember who I am." So the inner self, the light of who we are is as an activator, activated in you, and it starts to light the fires in everyone else. And then you feel like you have a life that's not just meeting your needs but it's a life of meaning, connection. It's a life of belonging. It's a life of contributing, and it's a life worth living. Got to make this clear. You choose; you choose. But don't just think of yourself because the one thing we all share is the breath, and the breath is the spirit. That's why I call the inner self, the guiding intuitive self, the spirit, because it comes from the Greek word, "Pneuma," which means the spirit or the breath. And it's the breath in you that animates everything. It's the breath in you that is the power to guide. So that's why. Breathe; go down the slide; ah, and smile. Pull the curtains back. Your assignment today is to look at where have I dialed it down? Where have I turned the light off? Where have I snuffed out my fire? Who am I adapting to and I'm not being true to myself? I have to look at that, and I have to say so. I have to adjust. What am I holding onto that's making me a slave? What am I so afraid of? And how long have I been afraid of it? How many weeks, months, years? Because the one thing you can't get back is time. My teacher, I had a beautiful teacher who said, "The minute you feel a vibe, go for it." Don't have the pause. It's just like the game; swivel the hips; go for it. At least go for it enough to say, "I have a vibe. I have a feeling this isn't right. Something's off; something's off." You can just say that. "This isn't working." You don't have to find the answer. Just step into the fire and say, "You know what? This feels so right. And I can't explain it." So that's the other tool. Never feel the need to explain. Just say, "I can't yet. I can't defend this yet. I can't justify this yet. But I'm going with it because it works for me." People won't argue if you say, "It works for me." And if it doesn't work for them you can say, "Well, I understand. I can see how that might be annoying. It does interrupt your plans, but I got to live in my own skin. It works for me, and I'll just live with it." So your life won't necessarily be smooth sailing all the time, but it'll certainly be high flying, and it will be incredibly fun. And you know, people will come back and thank you because it is truth serum. Your intuition is truth serum. And not only for your life to be a true and meaningful life but it is contagious. It helps others reflect on their truth. It helps others begin to reflect. That's why they get uncomfortable because they've been really, really good at avoiding the reflection. When your believing eyes, your light actually helps everybody reflect. It's just the way it goes, but it's worth it. So, revisit your priority list; revisit your values; adjust. And if you have to make some changes, I suggest the sooner the better. Don't be the person who forgot to live her life. Don't be that person. Get your crayons; get your paints; get your ticket; get your dancing shoes; get your hula hoop. Go for it. I assure you, you'll never regret it ever, ever, ever. Post a picture of yourself, even on the community page if you can. Share, "Living full out! This is my vibes." And watch it ripple across the community. It really is a joyful and infectious energy to reclaim who you are and help others do the same. Okay, I'll see you tomorrow.

LESSON 21: Start Celebrating Yourself
--------------------
Hooray, Day 21; can you believe it? Have we been having fun or what? Isn't this a wonderful new way to live, a wonderful new way to express and be and breathe and reclaim who you are? So now what we have to do is celebrate and really make your life one of regular celebration instead of waiting for other people to celebrate you. I'm going to introduce to you a tool, a form of celebration that we had in my family that I have extended to my daughters and friends and students for years and that's called the You're So Great Party. You really need to have it, and the You're So Great Party is instead of waiting for other people to point out what's good about you, which they probably won't because they'll miss it because they're too preoccupied with their own internal chaos that they don't even see you, that you start celebrating yourself. Now, I'm not talking about your barking dog, although we can give our little Fifi some credit for cooperating. Why not? You give your Fido, your little Bruno, whoever is there, thank you for helping, thank you for being on board, but I'm going to start celebrating who I am. I'm going to celebrate who I am. You know, this is really going to break you out of the final kind of chains of that old sort of play-small- and-be-submissive and let-me-take-your-power-away life that we've been indoctrinated into. And it's ending, thank God. We're all popping out one at a time, but let's pop out with a little joy. So at the end of a day, I want you, for five minutes, out loud, to actually enthusiastically say, "You're so great for..." and whatever happened in the day that you feel great about. "I'm so great I did this course today." "I am so great," and then, "Yeah; I am so great." If you can find people to witness and join you, invite them. "You're so great," and then they tell you back, "Well, you're so great," and then you both say, "Aren't we so great," It's so silly. You can do it with the community, but this is what really keeps us enslaved. Our inner child has been so conditioned to live, breathe, wait, want, and yearn for approval from "them," but "they" really don't have permission to give you approval because "they," whoever "they" are that floats around in your head, don't have the authority to live your life. They don't have the grace. They don't have the power. They don't have the authority. They don't have the right. So when you start celebrating yourself, you begin to remember that the truth is you are so great. The breath in your body that popped in and opened your eyes and gave you the power to think and feel and create and manifest, even if you manifest a huge mess, it's still creative; isn't that great? That none of us are powerless, not one of us, and the you're so great, celebrate your life is a decision to remember, recognize, and live from that place of real joy, not a empty yearning that if I do the right thing for whatever, whoever, for long enough, that maybe I'll get the reward. Won't come. But if you start celebrating from within, it feels really good, and it keeps you in your inner world smiling. So when you walk into a place, instead of "I hope they like me." You walk in with a light "I'm so great." Not arrogant; not ego spirit. My light is so bright. My joy is so strong. My integrity, which actually means wholeness, I'm not broken into parts. I'm congruent, and I'm dynamic, and I'm whole. I'm all together here. People love that vibe. People feel it. It's refreshing. It's actually great. Now, the other thing we've been conditioned to believe that if intuition is going to live, you know, kind of be in your life, it better make a big impression. It better come in in a big way, like Elvis appearing in the room. It better have a big dramatic effect so that you can justify it. But the truth is, it's never a big deal. It's always the littlest deal, the pea, the littlest deal that you choose, and it makes a big difference. It's a pivot point, a turning point, big difference, and that's really great. So when you can begin to live from that inner fuel, "I'm so great." "I love myself," in other words. "I am not going to live in fear and judgment. I'm going to love my spirit. I'm going to love who I am. I'm going to start appreciating who I am, and nobody will do it better than me anyway," 'cause nobody will do it quite better than you. I don't care how much you try to get it from others. It doesn't hit the spot because the spot is the heart of you that wants to open up. So what I would love for you now to do is decide what's so great about you. I want you to even pause right now, and I want you to write down and name out loud 10 things that you know are great about you, and the truth is, you don't need anybody to tell you that's true. You know. You know. "I am a great support person." "I am a great artist." "I am a great friend." "I am a great creator." "I am a great designer." "I am a great cook." "I'm a great arguer. I'm great at it." You can even be a great troublemaker, but you know you're great at it, and when you start acknowledging that, you start pulling back all those pieces of you that you lost or gave away or were stolen. Every one of them starts coming back and starts to fit back in to the integrity and the wholeness and the brilliance of you. So name 10; write them down, and say them out loud, and I'll be back, and we're going to do this for a maximum of one minute because you know. So I'll see you in one minute. Okay, welcome back. How does it feel to come out of the closet of playing small and shine bright in the room? Because this is how I really want to encourage you to live the rest of your life, knowing deep inside that I love who I am, and I love all these qualities of me, and every day, I'm going to add another one and another one and another one and another one until there is a point where I never doubt myself again. I never question the value of who I am or the capacity to trust my essence to lead my life, and I'm going to start fueling that by being believing eyes and start telling others, "You're so great." "You're so great at making coffee." "Man, you are so great at makeup." "You are so great at design." "You are so great." "You are so great at making meals." "You are so great at sitting here and putting up with me and listening to me. You are such a great listener." When you start acknowledging the greatness in others, it's taking believing eyes up exponentially. Those people that get acknowledged, you don't know where they're going to go in the world. You don't know where they're going to end up, but they will never ever forget you, and they will continually beam back to you good vibes, good energy, for the rest of their lives, and pretty soon, there's this whole vibrational network of energy that wherever you go, good things come back. So I want to tell you a story about this to just let you know how amazing this can be. A few years ago, I went through a big life disruption. My brother died quickly. My father died right after, and then my husband of 30 years left. Okay, big disruption. Opportunity for me to reset my life and get back in alignment with my true spirit which I knew I had to do. So I decided to walk the Camino de Santiago, which is this 600 almost kilometer walk across Spain, and I took with me my childhood toy which is this little Gumby doll, and I put that Gumby right here because that toy represented my authentic, joyful, fun, flexible, happy spirit, and off I went. Now, I'm not a hiker. Look at me. The only thing I ever hiked to is to the grocery store in Chicago about four blocks away. So this was definitely a leap of faith. So I'm walking on this thing, the Camino, and finally, I reach a point on the Camino where I have to walk straight up, and I decide I'm not going to do that, and I find these people renting horses that are going to take you up. Have never been on a horse. I'm a city girl, but I hopped on the horse. So I hop on the horse, go straight up. The horse goes crazy. I go crazy. I'm screaming my head off for 20 minutes. Get to the top, get off, sit down, look around, and Gumby left. He flew off. My childhood toy, my totem, my essence, my representation of all that I believe in hit the road when I was on the horse, and I couldn't believe it. So I went, there was a church there, so I went and had a funeral for Gumby. And I just sat there and said, "Okay, I don't know what this is about, but I'm going to accept. Maybe my childhood needs to be over or maybe the suffering part of my life needs to be over, but I'm going to sacrifice and give this up, and I am going to just say, 'I'm great that I made it to the top of the mountain.'" Well, because I'm a writer, and I tell stories, I write this in a book called "Walking Home". Well, five years later, a woman in New Zealand reads the book "Walking Home", and she gets so inspired by the book that she decides that she is going to walk the Camino de Santiago as well. Hooray, that's how it ripples out. Well, on day 20-something of her walk, she's walking up the whole, steep mountain, not taking the horse because my horse was really crazy. She sits down to rest, puts her pack down. Guess who's there? Gumby. Boom, not only is Gumby there, she knows who Gumby belongs to, and she wrote to me and said, "I found Gumby," and she sent Gumby back to me, and Gumby is now sitting on my altar at home. Went on a big adventure, and she said, "Gumby is why I went, and when I found Gumby and sent him back to you, I was a believer." Isn't that great? It is great. Now, that's the kind of life, needle in a haystack. Who would find Gumby? Five years later, from the other side of the world, and know who it belongs to and get it back to them, all in a very short period of time. Fun, huh? It is fun. And it's that kind of life you can have if you just live courageously, which means move from the heart. Recognize you have fear, but it doesn't mean you're in danger. It's not, and don't let it control you. Celebrate yourself; celebrate others, and instead of putting out bad stories, put out good ones. Put out good stories. Tell people good stories about your life, their life and life. Change the script. Lift it up, and believe in beautiful, miraculous, exciting new things coming your way. Believe it. The more you believe, the more room you wait, you open for them to come in. They may come through inspiration, creative ideas, brilliant new ways to start businesses, brand new relationships that are beyond what you ever imagine, brilliant connections, best friends, opportunities that are so incredible. All my life people have told me, "You're really lucky." I am. Living the intuitive life is a superpower, and to the unaware, it does appear really lucky. It does, and it isn't luck; it's grace. It's grace because when you live in congruency with your spirit, with the world, with the universe, with your joy, and your divine self truly appreciated, it brings you so many blessings; even ones you think you lost come back to you. Everything that belongs to you and more and 10 fold, 20 fold, 10,000 fold, come back. You go in the door. You walk into wonderland. You let go of control. You let your barking dog come, trained, never leading, and you're going to have a fantastic, fantastic life. I guarantee. So my request for this final day is to stay true, go back to the beginning, work this again, and then go back and work it again 'cause every time you work it, you'll do something more. Continue to communicate with your community and be a bright light and believing eyes in the world. Every day, give yourself, at the end of your day, three, four, five statements that, "I'm so great" and not I, ego, barking dog. I, spirit, brilliant light in the world. You'll be so surprised, and the final thing I want to say is this. I believe that all things happened by what I call a divine appointment. We didn't meet by accident. You didn't show up here with me and stay the course with me by some random event. This was your intuition that brought you here. It's working, alive and well. You heard this because your spirit needed this reminder of your greatness, and every one of us who lives this light is going to make this a really beautiful world. Don't believe the barking dog version. It's like someone once said, "It's true, but incomplete." I say, "I don't know if it's so true. I just think that it's the way most people without imagination experience life, and most of what we're hearing isn't what's out here. It's what's in here." So thank you for living this beautiful life with me for the last three weeks, and continue; carry on. Share your stories; live your edges; be bright. All my love.
