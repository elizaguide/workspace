Intro 1 - Meet Charlie Morley

For many people, when they think of lucid dreaming, being conscious in their dreams, they just think it's for fun. And I could fly about or I could have sex with movie stars and stuff like that. It's like, yeah, you can do that in lucid dreams. And if you want to, that's totally fine. So although I often say the first two years of my lucid dreaming were just spent on skateboarding, actually, I did have a really profound set of lucid dreams when I was about 17. Before I got into Buddhism, I was really, really wild. Drugs and gangs and all this kind of stuff. And when I was 17, I had a drugs overdose. And I had a classic near -death experience. Life flashing before my eyes, tunnel of light. But I came to the end of it, and it opened up into this huge, infinite blackness. And then in this infinite blackness, there was a voice. And it was my voice, like my voice, my accent. And it said, do you want to live? Or do you want to die? And I remember in the near -death experience just going, live, like screaming it. After that near -death experience, I know some people have like really amazing insights after NDEs. I didn't. I had panic attacks. I had nightmares. I was questing reality. I was deeply traumatized by the experience. So I'm having these terrible nightmares, and I remember in the books I'd read on lucid dreaming, they always had a chapter on how lucid dreaming could be used to treat nightmares. There was quite a lot of scientific research, even back then, 20 years ago. In the first three of these nightmares, where I'm basically reliving the near -death experience, I became lucid, but I couldn't face it. I just had to wake up. I bailed. But the fourth one... i managed to get lucid and i go okay i'm dreaming i'm dreaming i know this isn't real i know this is just my trauma playing out so i turned to face the trauma rather than getting out the dream i turned to face it and the dream was integrated and my nightmares stopped like four months of post -traumatic stress disorder nightmares stopped after one lucid dream That's when I really woke up to the power of lucid dreamings. This led me on a path of training with some of the most amazing Buddhist masters alive, teaching me the ancient practices of lucid dreaming and dream yoga. Eventually, they asked me to start teaching, and that's what I spent the last 12 years doing, teaching people how to wake up in their dreams as a way to wake up to life. Since then, I've written four books on the subject and run workshops and retreats around the world. More recently, I've started giving lucid dreaming lectures at some places I thought I never would. such as cambridge university oxford university and even the ministry of defense in london but what's happened in the last 10 years is that science has caught up with what the ancient traditions already knew that lucid dreaming is one of the most powerful transformative mind training exercises in existence that can radically shift the perspective we have in the waking state by training in our dreams so to be able to share it with people to be part of this movement brings me joy And I'm passionate about it because it's changed my life and I've seen it transform the lives of others. So I ask you to be part of this movement with me.

LESSON: Intro 2 - Getting Ready for Your Lucid Dreaming Quest
--------------------
<v ->Hello, dreamers.</v> My name is Charlie Morley, and I'm so excited that you've decided to join us on this Quest towards lucid dreaming. So what's this Quest all about? Essentially, it's about learning how to lucid dream. whether you're a seasoned pro or an absolute beginner, I'm going to take you step by step onto a journey into the land of dreaming. By the end of this Quest you can absolutely expect to see changes in the third of your life that you spend sleeping. But many of you will find also that you have changes in the two thirds of your life you spend awake. This Quest will teach you how to have lucid dreams. That's our primary aim. But we'll also explore how you can use lucid dreaming to heal from trauma, to have an improved spiritual life, to increase your emotional intelligence. You'll also find that engaging with dreamwork helps improve your creativity and leads to better self-awareness. In week four, we'll explore the concept of the shadow. And this will ask you to open up to your own authenticity and vulnerability. The two main qualities required for shadow integration. As well as leading to lucid dream experiences. Many of you will find this Quest will lead to lucid living experiences as the increased awareness that we start to implant into our dreams starts to manifest into our lives. This Quest is for anyone who wants to learn one of the most powerful psychospiritual practices ever developed, and for everyone who wants to learn how to change their life while they sleep. So what's the structure of the Quest? Essentially, every day for 30 days you're going to receive instructional videos, guided meditations, daily exercises, and we'll even have weekly PEP talks to keep you motivated. Some of you will start getting lucid straight away but the first couple of weeks are mainly about laying the foundations and then in week three and four, that's when we really start cooking. In week one, we'll explore the science and psychology of lucid dreaming. In week two, we'll learn how to make friends with our dreams, decode meaning from our dreams and be aware of our dream signs which will lead to lucidity. In week three, we start looking deeper, questioning reality and becoming lucid. Week three is when the practice really starts cooking. Week four is called the cave you fear to enter, transforming nightmares and the power of the shadow. So be ready to dive deep once we get to week four. And week five, onwards into the dream. How to keep your lucid dreaming practice even once the Quest is finished. Throughout this Quest, we will be building new habits and establishing new practices that will help to successfully lead to lucid dreams. So if you miss a day, every Sunday we'll have a review and implementation day where you'll get a chance to catch up on anything you've missed and to double-check anything that wasn't clear. Also on those days, we're going to have a weekly quiz, a PEP talk to keep you motivated and even a bedtime story which I will read to you in leopard print pajamas. How to get the most out of this Quest? All I need from you is to follow the formula with enthusiasm and determination. These techniques work, but they do require hard work on your part to help them manifest. Make sure you set aside at least 20 minutes a day over the next 30 days of this Quest. I say even schedule it into your calendar so you make sure you have the time needed to explore these practices. Be sure to introduce yourself to the other members of the Tribe. Be an active participant on this Quest and let the other Tribe members know who you are and what you're dreaming about. I'll even be asking you to start the dream circle, a sharing group, where you can safely explore your dreams and hear the dreams of others. And finally, I want you to set your intention for this Quest. Ask yourself, why do I want to learn lucid dreaming? What's my motivation for doing this Quest? So what do you need to prepare? All I need you to do is to start becoming more aware of your current relationship to your dreams, and perhaps even consider this question. If you were to become lucid, fully conscious within your dreams tonight, what would you choose to do? A large component of the Quest is remembering and writing down your dreams. Don't worry, I'll teach you step-by-step how to do both of those. But for now, it might be good idea to go and buy a dream diary. Maybe a notebook or a notepad or you might choose to use your phone but just to plant that seed, explore keeping a dream diary. And finally, I advise that you try and schedule in some more sleep time than usual for the next 30 days of this Quest. If you increase your sleep time by two hours, you double your chances of having a lucid dream. So see if you can get a little bit more sleep than usual and that'll be really helpful for Quest. So here are your tasks for today. The first thing I want you to do is to set your intention for this Quest and then reflect on it in your journal. Ask yourself, why do I want to learn to lucid dream? I'd also like you to introduce yourself to the other Tribe members on this Quest. Community and dream sharing is going to form a vital part of our time together. So get to know the other people who you're on this journey with. Let them know what would you do in your first or next lucid dream. Until then, sweet dreams. I'll see you for day one of the Lucid Dreaming Quest.

Week 1: Being Aware of Your Dreams

====================

LESSON 1 – What is Lucid Dreaming?
--------------------
<v ->Hello, dreamers. My name is Charlie Morley.</v> And I've spent the past 12 years teaching thousands of people of all ages and abilities how to lucid dream. It's what I was put on this Earth to do. And I love to do it. So as you can see, I'm excited to be journeying with you on this 30-day Quest, a deep dive into the depths of your own mind. Taking this course may well change your entire life and will definitely change 1/3 of it. So I ask you before we begin, are you ready to wake up? You are? Then let's begin. Come join me on a journey into dreaming. Let's begin with a definition. What exactly is a lucid dream? A lucid dream is a dream in which you know you're dreaming as the dream is happening. So you're sound asleep, dreaming away, but within the dream, you had an aha moment of lucid awareness. You know that you're dreaming. Once you know that you're dreaming within the dream, you can interact, choreograph and direct the dream at will, choosing to do whatever you like. You can fly around. You can have sex with movie stars, yeah. But more importantly, you can also integrate trauma, rewire your brain and heal your mind from the inside out. In a lucid dream, you've not woken up. You're still sound asleep. If you want to know what a lucid dreamer looks like while they're having a lucid dream, they look like this. You are out for the count. But while you're out for the count, you are gaining access to the most powerful virtual reality generator in existence: the human mind. The first thing that strikes people about lucid dreaming is how realistic it is. It's not actually that dreamy at all. It's as real as this. You know that old saying, "Pinch yourself to see if you're dreaming"? In a lucid dream, if you pinch yourself, you'll just feel the pain of the pinch, even though you know that the dream fingers that are pinching and the dream arm that are being pinched don't exist. They're all a hallucination of your mind. A lucid dream is an experience of hyper reality. Now that may sound like an over-exaggeration, but bear with me on this one. Right now your experience of waking reality is limited by your five senses being filtered through the sixth. Perhaps in the waking state, your eyes aren't that good. Perhaps in the waking state, your ears aren't that good. Your experience of reality is limited by the sense organs. However, in a lucid dream, those limits are removed. This is why in a lucid dream, people often say, "How come I could see every little bit "of detail on that blade of grass? "How come in a lucid dream, "I could hear every aspect of that music?" Because in the lucid dream, you aren't seeing through your eyes, you're seeing through your mind. In the lucid dream, you aren't hearing through your ears, you're hearing through your mind. Of course, this is why lucid dreaming sex can be so seductive because in the lucid dream, you're not having an orgasm, you're having a mindgasm. Just last month I was teaching in Czech Republic and I had this really powerful lucid dream in which I integrated a shadow aspect, more about that later. But after I'd done the shadow integration, I opened a room and there was an office. And I thought, "Oh, wow. "Maybe it's like the office of my mind. "Maybe the CEO of my brain lives in here." But it was empty. So I thought I'll just explore. I'll just kind of look around. So I go over to the desk and there's all these plants like office plants. And I go and I touch the leaves and I'm thinking, I know this leaf doesn't exist, but it feels so realistic. And then I saw on the top of the leaf there was dust. And I thought, I know my body's asleep in bed right now in the waking state. I know this has all a three dimensional projection in my mind. And yet my dreaming mind has even taken the time to put in the detail of dust on the leaves. It's a really mind blowing experience. And an experience that most people have had at some point in their life, but only about 25% of people have lucid dreams regularly. My job is to put you guys into that 25%. Lucid dreaming is a learnable skill. And in this Quest, we will learn how to do it. But before we do that, let's learn what it's not. Number one, a lucid dream is not a half-awake-half-asleep state. As I said before, in the lucid dream, you are sound asleep, deep in REM, rapid eye movement, dreaming sleep. Number two, a lucid dream is not just a really vivid dream. Lucid dreams can be really vivid but it's not the vividness that defines it. It's the reawakening of reflective awareness. The aha moment. And number three, a lucid dream is not an outer body experience. In an outer body experience, a genuine one, your consciousness has left the confines of the physical body. It is outside of your mind. However, in a lucid dream, the mind has flipped inwardly and is experiencing consciously the totality of its own projection. So a lucid dream is a dream in which you know you're dreaming as you're dreaming, that's it. And once that happens, you gain access to a three dimensional construct of your own psychology. Literally walking about or flying about your own mind. There is so much bullshit out there about lucid dreaming: on forums, social media, and, even worse, just in people's heads. So let's do some quick myth-busting before we go any further. Myth number one, it will make you tired. No. Lucid dreaming occurs in non restful REM dreaming sleep. In many stages of sleep, the brain and the body are resting, but not in REM. REM uses a lot of blood flow. In fact, in REM dreaming, you're using so much blood flow, that you're actually burning calories. So dreaming is not restful sleep. Becoming lucid within your dreams actually makes it more restful, not less. There's also some interesting studies there that have shown that once people become lucid, their brain often moves into gamma wave. Now gamma waves are usually associated with those monks who've done over 10,000 hours of meditation. So isn't it strange that once you become lucid, the brain goes into a similar state? Of course, the Buddhists who've been practicing this stuff for a thousand years, they don't think it's strange at all. They say, yeah, because once you become lucid, you are in a state of meditation. And the third thing to know, is that whatever you do in the lucid dream, the brain thinks you're actually doing it. So if you spend your lucid dream having fun, then oxytocin is released into the bloodstream in exactly the same way as it would be when you're awake. So most people wake up feeling not tired, but elated, full of the joy of having a lucid dream. Myth number two, it's messing with the unconscious. OK, every time we have a dream, the unconscious is trying to communicate with us. So surely once we become a lucid and we increase that line of communication, the unconscious would be pleased. And it is. The unconscious is so happy to have you conscious within it because now it can actually talk to you directly. The dreamer wants to communicate with you and lucid dreaming is the most direct form of communication there is. Let us look at the percentages on this. If you have an eight hour sleep cycle, you have five dream periods a night. So even if you have a lucid dream every night of your life, by the way, come and teach me if you can do that, 'cause I'm not at that level. Even if you get lucid every night of your life, 80% of your dream experience will be non-lucid. So for those who are having one lucid dream a week, which is a pretty good average by the way, then 97% of your dreams will be non-lucid. So don't worry about lucid dreaming messing with the unconscious mind. Still, 97% of the time your unconscious can do what it likes. Myth number three, "It will make me crazy". No, lucid dreaming will make you sane. It is used as a tool for treating mental health issues. And there's even a form of therapy called lucid dreaming therapy which is having great success in teaching post-traumatic stress disorder in veterans. Surely what's really crazy is hallucinating for two and a half hours every night that we call dreams and believing it to be real. That's what happens in our normal lucid dreams. So in many ways, lucid dreaming is an anti-psychotic, because at least you know you're dreaming as you're dreaming. Myth number four, lucid dreaming is dream control. Okay, for the uninitiated lucid dreamer, it can seem that once you become lucid, you're controlling the dream and at a subjective level, you are. Let's say you become lucid and you choose to fly through the sky. You're controlling how fast you go. You're controlling your distance. You're controlling your velocity. But what's controlling the trees that you fly over? What's controlling the dream characters walking in and out of the buildings that you're flying across? Although, we can come to a level of subjective control, the vast majority of the dream is out of our control. Just as no sailor controls the sea, so too does no lucid dreamer control the dream. Myth number five, only special people can do it. OK, kids lucid dream naturally. Not every kid every night, but Harvard studies have shown that most children report lucid dreams as part of their childhood development. So just as the artist Picasso once said, "Every child is born an artist. "The problem is how to remain one, once we grow up." So too it is with lucid dreaming. Lucid dreaming is your birthright. You've been doing it since a kid and now is the time to learn how to do it again. The two most important mental qualities that we need to learn to lucid dream are ones that many of us had as a kid too: enthusiasm and determination. If you've got those, you got everything you need to learn to lucid dream. ♪ These are your actions for today. If you haven't yet, introduce yourself to the Tribe. And share with them your current experience, if any, of lucid dreaming. And share how many of those myths you were aware of before. I'd also like you to talk to your friends and family about lucid dreaming. Ask them if they've ever had a lucid dream. So that's day one done, dreamers. Congratulations for taking your first step onto the path of lucidity. Tomorrow we'll learn our first lucid dreaming technique. Explore the neuroscience of lucid dreaming and learn how it can be used to change our brain while we sleep. ♪

====================

LESSON 2 – Remember Your Dreams with Dream Recall
--------------------
<v ->Yesterday, we covered the basics.</v> Today, we're going to explore how lucid dreaming actually changes your brain while you sleep. Although we think of dreams as a psychological experience because they are created out of our own psychology, once we become lucid, they absolutely become a neurological experience. And one in which we can literally rewire our brains while we sleep. Lucid dreaming science takes us all the way back to 1975 at Hull University in the UK. When lucid dreaming first became verified as a scientific phenomena of REM dreaming sleep. Before we learn how you can use lucid dreaming to change your brain, let's explore the neurology of lucid dreaming. When we're having a non-lucid dream, the back part of the brain is highly active. The visual cortex, the brain stem, the occipital lobe, but the front part of the brain, the prefrontal cortex, has very little blood flow. Now the scientists tell us that our sense of self, our sense of agency, our sense of "I am having experience", are linked and located in the prefrontal cortex. This is why in a non-lucid dream, you can dream you're other people. You can dream you're a man if you're a woman, you can dream you're a child if you're an adult because your sense of self is so much more flexible. A few years ago, I had a dream that I was the Queen of England, true story. I was standing in front of a long queue of people. I was wearing a pastel pink dress and this little matching hat and I was shaking people's hands and saying, "Hello, how'd you do and what do you do?" This long line of people. Now in that dream, because the prefrontal cortex was switched off, my sense of, "I am Charlie having experience" was offline, I happily believed that I was the Queen of England. Charlie had never existed. I had always been the Queen of England and always would be the Queen of England. Then my alarm clock went off in the waking state. I woke up, the prefrontal cortex came back online and I went, oh, I was dreaming I was the Queen of England, I'm actually Charlie. Now in a lucid dream, that same process of the reactivation of the prefrontal cortex occurs while you're still sleeping. So the front part of the brain lights up, you go, "Aha, I'm having a dream", and now you know who you are within the dream. Once you're lucid, the brain doesn't think you're imagining it or dreaming it, it thinks you're actually doing it because once the prefrontal cortex activates, the brain thinks you're awake. This opens up one of the most fascinating aspects of lucid dreaming, it's called neuroplasticity. Neuroplasticity describes the brain's potential to rewire itself in favor of a newly learnt skill. Essentially, the more you use a certain brain network, the more blood flow it gets and the deeper the grooves become in that brain network. Now in non-lucid dreaming, neuroplasticity is not engaged. So you can spend your whole night dreaming about soccer, in the morning you're probably not going to be any better at soccer. However, once you become lucid and the prefrontal cortex becomes reactivated, neuroplasticity is engaged. This means in the lucid dream, you can literally rewire your brain while you sleep. If you choose to practice soccer in your lucid dream, you may well wake up being better at soccer. And we're going to look at some of those exact same studies very soon. Here's a nice example to explain how neuroplasticity works. I've got a piece of paper here and I'm going to see how quickly I can fold it. Okay, quite quick, but nothing special. If I undo the paper and I try a second time, look how much quicker that was, why? Two main reasons, number one, I'd done it before and number two, the grooves were already there. That explains neuroplasticity. There are so many studies that have looked at the neuroplasticity aspect of lucid dreaming but here are some of the coolest. The University of Lincoln in the UK did a study that proved that lucid dreamers are better at problem solving. In the lucid dream, you get so much blood flow to these parts of the brain that see laterally, that think outside the box, that in the waking state the brain receives the same messages and people who have regular lucid dreams are proven to be better at creative problem solving. A study from the Max Planck Institute of Psychiatry, found that lucid dreamers actually have bigger brains. They have more gray matter in the anterior prefrontal cortex, thus making this part of the brain larger and making the lucid dreamers in the waking state, better at self-reflection. Now I know size doesn't matter guys but having a bigger brain is pretty cool. Lucid dreaming has a long history of being used by athletes to prepare for their athletic discipline. But before we look at how lucid dreaming can help train the body, let's look at how the waking state can do the same. A Cleveland Clinic Foundation study, found that fully awake subjects who imagined lifting heavy weights with their arms for 15 minutes a day, for five days a week, for 12 weeks in total, increased their bicep strength by up to 13.5% and the strength gain lasted for three months. This wasn't in a lucid dream, this was just waking state visualization. Now the limit of waking state visualization is that it's dependent on the subject's ability to visualize. If you can visualize really strongly, the gains increase. If you can't visualize that well, they decrease, but in the lucid dream, the playing field is leveled because in a lucid dream, you are in the most complete, three dimensional visualization you will ever experience. So once you apply visualized techniques within the lucid dream, they work with 100% efficacy. There've been loads of scientific studies looking at how lucid dreaming can be used to increase sports performance. These studies go way back to the 80's and all the way up to modern day ones at Heidelberg Uni. One of the latest, used 800 German athletes. Taught them to lucid dream and concluded that lucid dreams have a great potential for the athletes to use as a training method. What were they doing exactly? They were becoming lucid in their dreams and then practicing their athletic discipline in the dreams. This led to waking state performance that was measurable in a scientific lab. There was a study done in 2019, that wanted people who were good at lucid dreaming and who were also good at martial arts. So they asked me to be involved. We had to go into the lucid dream and practice a very specific kick sequence, a kickboxing kick sequence. And in the waking state, they tested us to see whether we got better. 81.3% of the participants got better at martial arts by practicing in their lucid dreams. Embarrassingly, I was one of the percentile that didn't get any better. Maybe I got it wrong, but 81.3% got better by training in their lucid dreams. If this stuff isn't shocking you, it should be. This means you can actually increase waking state experience while you sleep. "But so what? "I'm not into sport", you might say. Okay, but the reason I give these sports studies are because they have huge implications on how the mind can affect the body. They prove beyond doubt that lucid dream rehearsal leads to physical waking state changes and results. Think of the implications for public speaking. I want to tell you a story about my friend Leah. Leah is a clinical hypnotherapist, who's done lucid dreaming training with me. Before one of her final exams, she was nervous and she decided to have a lucid dream to work with her fear of public speaking. In the lucid dream, she called out to meet her fear, an embodiment of the fear appeared within the lucid dream. She embraced the fear, showed it love and she felt all of her anxiety dissolve. The next day, she gave a killer presentation. Maybe it's the integration of limiting habits that we can use lucid dreaming for. I had one gentleman come on a course about five years ago who had OCD, you know, very scared of germs. Didn't like to shake people's hands or touch people. He felt that this was really limiting him in his life. And he said, maybe I'd go into the lucid dream and call out, "I get rid of my OCD! I get rid of my OCD!" I said to him, you could do that but I'd advise something else. We don't want to highlight what we want to get rid of, we want to step in to how we want to be. How do you do that? I said, well maybe in the lucid dream, do what you're scared of doing, in the lucid dream, walk up and start shaking the hands of other dream characters, go and hug them knowing that they don't exist, you don't exist and the germs definitely don't exist. But remember your brain won't know that, your brain will think you're awake and actually facing the fear that's limiting you in your life. There's even some burgeoning research into using lucid dreaming for re-stimulating nervous system networks in people with spinal cord injuries. This is a very powerful potential. It's just burgeoning research, but in the same way as virtual reality is being used to help re-stimulate these networks, so too might lucid dreaming be able to do the same. And finally, there's the potential of placebo healing within the lucid dream. Because the power of visualization is so intense within the lucid dream, and because the power of the placebo is enhanced so much because you are literally inside your mind, there is the potential for healing physical ailments through lucid dreaming. Again, there's no scientific studies on this. All of it is anecdotal, but I'm currently applying for funding to do one of the first studies to prove that you can have inflammation markers come into the bloodstream after a lucid dream healing, thus proving that we can do it. I'll give much more information about this as the course progresses, but for now, let me at least plant the seed. There is the potential to treat physical ailment through lucid dreaming. Remember, the main thing is that the brain doesn't think you're dreaming in a lucid dream. It thinks you're actually doing it. Not that you're imagining it not that you're visualizing it, but that you are actually doing it. That's why it has such a powerful effect on our brain networks. Now, let's look at lucid dreaming as a tool for trauma integration. I've taught lucid dreaming to hundreds of people suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder, including military veterans, victims of terrorist attacks and those who experience abuse during childhood. And I've seen firsthand just how powerful lucid dream training can be, for integrating trauma. A 2009 European Science Foundation meeting, described lucid dreaming as such an effective treatment for post-traumatic stress disorder, that there is the potential for treating nightmares by learning to dream lucidly. Could this herald a time when lucid dreaming is prescribed in just the same way as mindfulness meditation is now? I hope so, there've been so many studies looking at the powerful effects that lucid dreaming can have on PTSD nightmares. And one of the latest ones that I was involved in, was at Swansea University in the UK. This study found that people who could train their minds to become lucid in their nightmares, had a great decrease in the nightmare frequency. In fact, lucid dreaming is such an effective treatment for nightmares, that in 2019, I gave a talk at the Ministry of Defense in London. It's a bit like the UK version of the Pentagon, about the power of lucid dreaming, to 300 military defense staff. 10 years ago, that would have been unthinkable. But now the science is in, lucid dreaming is powerful. This stuff really works, but how does it work exactly? Let's take an example of one of the veterans that I worked with. When he came back from Iraq, he had terrible post-traumatic stress disorder nightmares, which manifested as him being back in Iraq. When he woke up from that nightmare, he had the same feeling in his body as if he was actually there. He was sweating, heart palpitations, all of that. Once he trained himself lucid dreaming and he could learn to become a lucid within that nightmare, he could go, "Oh, I'm not really back in Iraq, "I'm dreaming I'm back in Iraq". In fact, now my body's safe in bed and this is just a hallucination of the trauma that occurred to me. That in itself was enough to pick up the needle on the stuck record of post-traumatic stress disorder and allowing the trauma that was creating the nightmare, to flow through his mind. So simply the act of becoming lucid in a nightmare, can be enough for many people to unstick them from the stuck state of PTSD. With the other veterans that I've worked with, some of them yes, did learn to lucid dream, but for others, even though they didn't become lucid, their nightmares started to become integrated, simply by learning about how they sleep, by depathologizing nightmares, knowing that they're not an attack from the mind but a sign of a healing mind and a dream that is shouting. We'll learn more about nightmares in week four. And you'll see that just opening up to the potential of what they are, even before you get lucid in them, can still have deep healing potential. And the reason why trauma integration in lucid dreaming is so powerful, is again, because the brain thinks you have actually faced the fear in real life. Once you're lucid, the brain doesn't think you're dreaming, the brain thinks you're awake. That's why it's so effective. For those of you listening who don't have heavy trauma, maybe you've got mild phobia. Let's say you're scared of spiders for example. Lucid dreaming can absolutely be used to integrate fear of spiders. How, you become lucid. "Okay, I'm dreaming, I'm dreaming." Don't call out "Spiders now", as one of my students did and everything in the dream turned to spiders, he freaked out and woke up. But you could go, "Oh, I'm dreaming, I'm dreaming. "Right, what did I want to do? "I wanted to integrate my fear of spiders". So then in the dream, you could have the intention or you could call out, friendly spider now. Usually in the lucid dream, reality manifests from a thought or intention, so a spider would appear. You could then pick the spider up in your hand. Remember it will feel incredibly realistic. You can allow the spider to crawl up your arm and yeah, you'll feel scared because it will seem so real but you'll know, "Hang on, the spider doesn't exist". But at the same time the brain thinks it does. So the brain thinks you are actually allowing a spider to crawl up your arm fearlessly. So it starts to rewire itself in favor of this newly learned approach to spiders and in that way, we can start to integrate our fear the spiders at a deep neurological level. I'm sure stories about the awesome potential of lucid dreaming for physical training and trauma integration inspired you. They still inspire me actually, every time I retell them. So I asked you, can you channel that inspiration into our first lucid dreaming technique? Which is dream recall. Dream recall is one of the most important aspects of lucid dream training. Some say that until you regularly remember your dreams, you might be having lucid dreams every night without realizing it. It's a possibility but actually it's far more likely that if you don't remember your dreams, you probably aren't going to be having many lucid ones. Why, because the more conscious you are of your dreams, the easier it'll be to become conscious within your dreams. Based on an eight hour sleep cycle, most people have four or five dream periods every night but not everybody remembers these. I believe the main reason is simply because they don't try to remember them. Think about it, when did you last really try to remember your dreams? Well, here are some top tips on how to do so. Tip number one, remind yourself that you do dream. Every night you are dreaming, even if you don't remember it. This is because dreaming is vital to the human brain because it's linked to our survival and our evolution. The only way to stop the human brain from dreaming is a stroke or a heavy head injury and even then within a few weeks, the brain will rewire itself, so you're dreaming again. So know that you are dreaming, perhaps you simply don't remember them. Dreaming is about trauma integration and re-consolidation of memory, so it's really important for the brain to do it and that's why it prioritizes dreaming every night. So you do dream, it's simply a question of, do you remember your dreams? Number two, fall asleep with an affirmation in the hypnagogic state, to remember your dreams. What is the hypnagogic state? The hypnagogic state is a transitional state of mind that the brain passes through as it's moving into sleep. So you're lying in bed, your eyes are closed, you're feeling very drowsy. You're not fully asleep yet, but you're getting there. That's the hypnagogic state. And as you can see from the term hypna-gogic, it's close to a state of hypnosis. And if you look at the brainwaves of someone in the hypnagogic state, they are identical to those as someone in a hypnotic trance, deep alpha and theta. So for this technique, you harness the power of the hypnagogic that hypnotic state that you pass through as you fall asleep, by reciting a hypnotic suggestion to remember your dreams. The suggestion is this, "Tonight I remember my dreams, "I have excellent dream recall. "Tonight, I remember my dreams, "I have excellent dream recall". Recite that 21 times as you fall asleep. I'll be offering you a guided audio meditation, guiding you through that 21 recitation, which you can use as you fall asleep tonight. Number three, the first thought upon awakening needs to be, "How am I feeling? "What was I doing, where was I?" Go straight back to the dream as soon as you wake up. Remembering a dream though, is a bit like catching a feather. Imagine a feather falling. If I grab for it, the feather stays out of reach. To catch a feather, we need to place our hand just beneath it and catch it gently, so too with our dreams. Tip number four, work backwards. When you wake up, even if you can just find the last image from the dream, you can work backwards, picking up piece by piece by piece of the dream, until eventually you've unraveled the whole narrative. Tip number five, don't move too much. Have you noticed how you can be lying on this side, dreaming away and then you roll over to hit the alarm clock and suddenly the dream memory goes. There's a theory that it's to do with the movement of your cerebral fluid in your brain but whatever it is, once you move a lot, the dream often shakes out of your memory. However, if you're dreaming like this, you roll over to hit the alarm clock but then you return to your original sleeping position, you may find the memory returns. And the final tip, once you remember your dreams, be sure to write them down. Tomorrow, we'll learn exactly how to keep a dream diary but until then, tonight just make some notes. Enjoy and remember your dreams. And now your actions for today. Firstly, practice dream recall, either using the guided meditation audio or by doing the recurring affirmation by yourself, as you fall asleep tonight. Secondly, I'd like you to write down your dreams once you remember them. As I said, tomorrow we'll learn how to keep a dream diary but for tonight, just write some notes. And finally, share your experience with the Tribe. Which skill would you like to improve through lucid dream training? See you tomorrow.

LESSON 2 - Meditation: Dream Recall Meditation

- Play this guided meditation as you drift off to sleep, either lasting at night in an afternoon nap, or any time that you want to train your brain to remember your dreams. Close your eyes and come into an awareness of your breath. Notice the movement of breath through your body. Notice how the in breath takes a little effort, but how the outbreath is effortless. Allow yourself to relax into the outbreath. With each exhalation. Allow yourself to relax deeper and deeper into the support of the ground or the bed beneath you. With each exhalation, allow yourself to relax deeper and deeper into the relaxation of the hypnogogic state. And now we begin by reciting our affirmation to remember our dreams. Tonight, I remember my dreams. I have excellent dream recall tonight I remember my dreams. I have excellent dream recall tonight I remember my dreams. I have excellent dream recall. Continue at your own pace in your own mind for the next few minutes or for the next 21 recitations tonight I remember my dreams. I have excellent dream recall tonight I remember my dreams. I have excellent dream recall tonight I remember my dreams. I have excellent dream recall tonight I remember my dreams. I have excellent dream recall tonight I remember my dreams.

LESSON 3 – Create Your Dream Diary
--------------------
<v ->Today, we're going to be adding the staple ingredient</v> to our lucid dreaming meal, by learning exactly how to keep a dream diary. We'll also be exploring the psychological benefits of lucid dreaming, so that you can appreciate just how practical lucid dreaming is for life optimization, and for not so much hacking your unconscious mind, but absolutely for befriending it. Now that we've covered how lucid dreaming affects our brain and how it can be used for life rehearsal and trauma integration, let's explore how it can be used as a self-development tool for powerful real-life manifestation. I first got into lucid dreaming in my teens, and by my mid-20s, I was pretty proficient at it. It was never seen as a career path, though. So when I was 25, and my Buddhist teacher first asked me to start giving talks about lucid dreaming, I felt really out of my depth. At the time he asked me to start giving talks, I was actually making my living as a moderately successful rapper in a hip-hop group. I used to put on break dance events, perform in hip-hop groups, that kind of stuff, a far cry from lucid dreaming in the Buddhist scene. But my teacher had faith in me and he asked me to start giving talks. So although he had faith, I didn't have much faith in myself, and I started having these recurring nightmares or anxiety dreams every time I was lucid. One of these manifested in a lucid dream where a huge tidal wave was coming towards me. I became lucid, I saw the tidal wave, and I thought, that's probably my anxiety about being asked to teach. So how do you hug a tidal wave? Well, I can't hug it, but I'm going to kind of surf it. So I allowed the wave to come and I bodysurfed it down the street. Now often, in a lucid dream, once you get the point that the unconscious mind is trying to highlight, you wake up, as if the dreaming mind wants you to reflect on the insight you received. But once the tidal wave crashed, I was still in there, and I thought, oh, maybe the integration isn't complete. So I thought, I'm going to call out a question to the lucid dream. So I called out to the lucid dream, "What should I do with my life? Should I do Throwdown," the name of the break dance group that I was in, "or should I be a lucid dreaming teacher?" As soon as I called out that question, boom! The dream transformed, and I was suddenly in a small house on the ground floor at a cocktail party. And I'm thinking, what the hell? Am I supposed to be a cocktail waiter or something? And I walk around this party and I realize that some of the characters, they're almost kind of larger-than-life. They've got this huge energy. And I realize, they're my internal archetypes. The first one I saw was kind of dressed like a Buddhist monk, but in white robes. And I went up to him, fully lucid, and I said, "What should I do with my life?" And he looked me, bowed, and said, "You must be a lucid dreaming teacher. That's how you can truly benefit." And I was like, "Whoa, that's so cool!" Then I looked to my left and I saw this character who was obviously my inner hedonism. He looked like I did as a teenager, with this long ponytail, he had his top off, and he was holding a bottle of vodka. And I went over to him and said, "Hey, man, what should I do with my life?" And he gave me the bottle of vodka and went, "Throwdown, Throwdown rocks!" So obviously my inner spiritual guide wanted me to be a lucid dreaming teacher. My inner hedonist wanted me to stay in the hip-hop world. I then asked two other characters. They both said to be a lucid dreaming teacher. And I thought, okay, I've got the message. But again, I didn't wake up. So I did something strange. I left the dream. I found the front door, walked out of the house, and continued down the street where the tidal wave had occurred. I thought, why aren't I waking up yet? Surely I've got the message! And then I turned back 'round to see the house, and as I turn around, all of those archetypes I'd spoken to were watching me walk down the street through the window. And when I turned around they saw me went, "Good luck! You can do it, you can do it!" And I woke up with this big rush of emotion. As I realized that although I didn't have faith in myself, there was something in me that did. There was something in me that said, this is your path. This is what you are meant to do. Now, it'd be really cool in the story if the next day I gave up the hip-hop world and suddenly became a lucid dreaming teacher. It didn't work quite like that, but within about six months, I'd found a way to wrap up the work in the music industry and start running lucid dreaming workshops full-time. And now 12 years later, that's what I do. And it all started from that one lucid dream. So if you're thinking, where's my life going? How can I find my life path? You can absolutely use the lucid dream to ask that question and receive that answer. The next case study comes from my friend Manny from New York. He's a life coach and he wanted to use lucid dreaming to go really deep into his own self-development. One of the questions he'd been looking at and working on with his therapist was his greatest fear. And he realized that the lucid dream, because you are inside your unconscious mind, it would be a great place to get the answer to that question. So he became lucid, "Oh, I'm dreaming!" And he called out to the dream, "Show me my greatest fear!" Suddenly a woman appeared from a pool of water. She looked at him and you said, "Being loved. Being loved is your greatest fear." Manny said the insight from that one lucid dream was more insightful than the years of therapy he'd been in. So the lucid dream gives us access to the truth of who we are, and the truth of the parts of ourself that we'd rather not look at. Our greatest fears, our greatest loves, our greatest challenges. All of this we can work with through lucid dreaming. My friend Sergio Magana is a practitioner within the Toltec Mexihca shamanic tradition. He uses his lucid dreams to plant the seeds of an idea that will manifest in his waking state. A few years ago, he had a lucid dream where he planted the seed of, a star will come into my life. Within a few months, he gets a call from an actor's agent named Michelle Rodriguez, made famous for her roles in "The Fast and the Furious" movies. They eventually became friends, started working together, and have now even written a book together. That's the power of lucid dream self-inception. So just like the movie "Inception," where they plant ideas in the minds of others, in the lucid dream, we can absolutely plant ideas in our own mind, which will lead to waking-state changes and optimization of our life. Let's now look at how to keep a dream diary. If you want to learn how to lucid dream properly, then keeping a dream diary is essential. Not only because by writing down your dreams, you solidify the memory of the unconscious dream into your conscious awareness, but also because every time you write down a dream, you reinforce the habit of viewing the dream as something valuable. This then creates a beneficial feedback loop, 'cause once you see your dreams as valuable, you'll naturally start to recall them with more ease. There are so many benefits to keeping a dream diary. But here are some of my favorites. Once you know what you dream about, you're more likely to know that you're dreaming while you're dreaming. For example, if you keep a dream diary for a week or so, by the end of the week, you might notice patterns. Oh, I often dream of being on a beach or I often dream of my dead grandma, or I often dream of being naked in public. By being aware of what you're dreaming about, you're then more likely to be aware of your dreams while you're in them, and that, of course, is the essence of lucid dreaming. Another great benefit of lucid dreaming is that it gives you insight into your own mind. If you want to look at the internal environment of your mind, you don't need to ask a therapist. You need to look at your dream diary. People spend a lot of money going to therapists saying, "What's going on in here?" You want to know what's going on in here? Look to your dreams. Who are you secretly in love with? What traumas from childhood are still getting you down? What future events are you worried about? The answer to all those can be found in your own dream diary. One of the core benefits of keeping a dream diary is that it helps us to start to recognize our dream signs. We start to see distinct patterns emerging within our dreams. And once we see those patterns, recognize them and acknowledge them, we can start to plant the seeds that will lead to lucid dreams in the future. In the coming days, we'll learn how to find dream signs, but for now, know that just by keeping a dream diary, you start to open yourself up to that potential. Here are my five top tips for keeping a dream diary. Number one, whenever you wake up from a dream, recall as much of the dream as you can and then write it down in some way. You need to document it. It could be written, it could be drawn, it could be danced. However you do it, document the dream in some way, even if it's in the middle of the night when you've woken up for a pee. Number two, you don't need to record every tiny detail of your dream. You'll know what feels worth recording and what doesn't. Focus on the main themes and feelings, the general narrative, and any strange dream anomalies that you can recall. Number three, you don't need to spend half an hour every morning documenting your dreams. In fact, you'll be surprised how much you can write up in just 5 or 10 minutes. If you do have half an hour to spend writing up your dreams, brilliant. But I'm yet to find someone who can add an extra 30 minutes onto their daytime schedule and not start resenting it. So 5 or 10 minutes is more than enough. Number four, feel free to use a smartphone, a pen and pad, canvas, whatever you like, to document your dreams; make it your own. But the main thing is that you document them in some way. And tip number five, write down something in your dream diary, even if you can't remember any dreams. It's totally fine to write down, "Ah, I know I was dreaming, but I can't remember what about." That's great! It's authentic, it's real. And at least it doesn't set up a feeling of failure, of, oh, I didn't write anything in my dream diary. And my final tip, work from where you're at. There'll be some of you watching this quest who already remember three, four dreams a night. Brilliant, try and bring yourself to the next level and remember five or six. For other people watching this, they'll think, I haven't remembered a dream for 10 years! So if you just remember one fraction of the dream tonight, that's a massive breakthrough! So work from where you're at. Here are your actions for today. Number one is to write down your dreams in your dream diary. In fact, I'm going to ask you to do that every single morning for the next four weeks. Remember, you don't have to spend hours writing up your dreams, just 5 or 10 minutes is enough each morning. Keeping a dream diary is imperative if you want to learn how to lucid dream. And secondly, keep falling asleep reciting the dream recall affirmation that we learned yesterday. See you tomorrow, when we will explore the top 10 benefits of lucid dreaming, and you guys will start your very own Mindvalley Tribe Dream Circle. See you tomorrow.

LESSON 4 – The 9 Benefits of Lucid Dreaming
--------------------
<v ->Simon Sinek's TED Talk has over 55 million views</v> and is one of the top five highest viewed TED Talks of all time, why? Because he explained the power of "the why". This Quest will absolutely teach you the how of lucid dreaming, but more important than the how is learning the reasons why. You need to know why you want to have a lucid dream. Because just as Simon's TED Talk teaches, the why is more powerful than the how. I've been lucid dreaming for over 20 years. And I've had literally hundreds of fully lucid dreams. Combine that with over 10 years of teaching lucid dreaming, and as you can imagine, I've got a pretty good idea of some of the most beneficial reasons why people have lucid dreams. So here in no particular order are my top benefits of lucid dreaming. Trauma integration. My new book is all about how trauma and stress affect sleep. So I've spent the last three years researching trauma. And one thing I can tell you for sure is this, everybody has it. It just depends how much we have and how deeply hidden it is. A second thing I can tell you is this, lucid dreaming is one of the most powerful psychological interventions for integrating trauma. And when we learn dream planning tomorrow, we'll explore exactly how to go about it. Spiritual practice. Lucid dreaming has been a spiritual practice within Tibetan Buddhism, Toltec Mexica Shamanism, and Sufism for hundreds of years. All of these traditions believe that lucid dreaming is not only a powerful spiritual practice in itself, but in fact that the lucid dream state is a powerful place to do spiritual practice. How exactly? By becoming lucid and doing your meditation in the lucid dream. It said that this leads to a very powerful upward spiral of energy because you're meditating within meditation. Don't believe me, try it. Whether it's completely secular mindfulness that you've learned off your app on your phone or whether it's a deep shamanic meditation that you know, do it in the lucid dream and it becomes very, very powerful. Shadow integration. It's said in the Gospel of Thomas, "If you bring forth what is within you, "what you bring forth will save you. "If you do not bring forth what is within you, "what you do not bring forth will destroy you." No better description of shadow integration have I ever come across. The shadow is a term popularized in the West by the Swiss psychiatrist, Carl Jung, used to describe the aspects of the unconscious mind which we have rejected, denied, or disowned. The shadow is the dark side of the human psyche. But crucially not dark, meaning bad, evil, or malign, dark meaning yet to be illuminated. In the lucid dream, you can actually meet your shadow side because your shadow side resides within the unconscious mind. Later in the Quest we'll learn exactly how to do that. But for now know this, shadow integration through lucid dreaming is one of the most powerful whys there is. As we mentioned before, there is the the potential to engage placebo effect healing through the lucid dream. The placebo effect works by the mind affecting the body. So if you engage the placebo effect within the mind it becomes mind within mind and has very powerful effects. There is burgeoning research into the potential for lucid dreaming being used to heal physical ailments. Many people say that lucid dream healing is just the placebo effects. Well, anyone who says just the placebo effect does not understand how the placebo effect works. The placebo effect is the only replicable element of every medical trial. It's so powerful that you can give someone a pill and tell them this is a placebo, there's nothing in it, but just the act of popping the pill, taking the water and swallowing it has such a powerful effect on the mind that healing can still occur. Placebo effect healing is insane. Within the lucid dream, it seems that we can harness the power of the placebo effect by engaging visualized healing within the dream. Later we'll learn exactly how to do this, but for now know this, I used to wear glasses. You'll see in my early YouTube videos I'm wearing glasses. I went into the lucid dream and on three occasions engaged the healing on my eyes. Eventually I went into the lucid dream and called out my eyes are free of conflict. And it seemed that by acknowledging the problem with my eyes as a conflict within my body, that conflict was able to be integrated and I now no longer wear glasses. There's another example we'll see later, my friend Bruno who had kidney disease, he went into the lucid dream, did hands-on healing on his kidneys and was able to stabilize his creatinine levels for six months after the lucid dream healing. Now it's important to know, six months later Bruno's kidney disease returned. He was too embarrassed to tell me about it because he thought it meant the lucid dream healing had failed. I was like, "It hasn't failed, man. "For six months you stabilize the level of your kidneys." So lucid dreaming isn't a silver bullet, it can't just cure stuff, but it can be used a powerful alternative therapy to be used alongside mainstream medical treatment as a powerful form of healing. Again, all this stuff is anecdotal, there's no scientific studies done yet but I'm currently applying for funding so we can do the first study proving that lucid dream healing works. Meeting our internal archetypes. Within a lucid dream, a unique aspect of it is psychological concepts become personified. That means in the lucid dream you can literally meet your fear. You can meet your shame. You can meet your anger, and you can also meet the internal universally existing archetypes. The wise man representing guidance, knowledge and wisdom, the mother representing nurturing, comfort, feminine. The higher self representing in inner unification, and of course the shadow as we mentioned before. Within the lucid dream, you can call out to meet your inner archetypes, becoming lucid and calling out "Inner child come to me," and then embracing and showing love to whatever appears can be a very powerful way to heal stress and trauma from our childhood days. As we learned before, we can use lucid dreaming to ask big questions. The unconscious mind is like a library of wisdom. We know this scientifically actually, the unconscious mind doesn't forget. It's a huge hard drive of information containing every book you've ever read, every spiritual teaching you've ever been to, every good piece of advice you've ever had, is all stored in this huge library of wisdom. Now in the lucid dream state, you get the keys to the library. You can go in there and call out questions like, "What career path should I take?" Or "How can I be more happy in my life?" And often an answer will be given to you. Some people like to say the answer's from God or an external deity. I think actually the real answer is even more far out, the answer's coming from you, your own higher self, your own inner wisdom. Another benefit of lucid dreaming is life rehearsal. I've used the lucid dream to rehearse for things happening in my real life. Whether it was a talk that I needed to write for a university presentation, or more recently an upcoming kickboxing competition fight. You can go into the lucid dream and actually rehearse for waking state situations in your sleep. Okay, this one's pretty far out but I'll give you a case study to back it up. Lucid dreaming can be used to work with addictive mind states. My friend Antonio was a smoker for 12 years by the time he came to one of my workshops. He said he wanted to use lucid dreaming to try and integrate his addiction to nicotine. When he asked me, I said, "Okay, well look, "anything can treat through hypnotherapy "you can also treat through lucid dreaming. "So I'd suggest is that you go into the lucid dream "and call out, 'I live a healthy lifestyle, "'free of the addiction of cigarettes.' "And just like a powerful hypnotic suggestion "that will implant in your unconscious "and make changes your waking state." Now, luckily Antonio is way more creative than me. He'd heard what I said about being able to meet internal archetypes and he thought, "What if I could meet my brain in the lucid dream?" So he got lucid and he called out, "Brain, come to me." And there's a woman appears and he walks up to her and says, "Who are you?" She says, "I'm your brain." He's like, "Oh, well look, how's my health." And she says, "Actually you're okay, but you know what? "You need to give up." And he went, "Yeah, the smoking, the smoking." And she went, "Mmh" she was quite sassy as mine. Actually he's quite sassy too. And then he says to her in the lucid dream "Okay, well, look, you're my brain, "every time I think about cigarettes or I want a cigarette "make me think or do something else." And his brain went, "Okay," and he woke up. Maybe it was a 30 second lucid dream in total. Within those 30 seconds Antonio seemed to implant such a powerful suggestion that he never smoked again. Two weeks later, he emails me to tell me about the dream, and to be honest 'cause I had some hypnotherapy training in my early 20s, I just didn't believe him. I said, "Hit me up again in two months." Two months later he emails again, says "I'm still not smoking." I'm then writing my second book so I decided to interview him and his boyfriend to see whether he was telling the truth for my next book. Turned out he was telling the truth, his boyfriend confirmed it. Antonio and his boyfriend, also called Charlie, said something interesting had happened too. Apparently each week Charlie writes the shopping list and Antonio goes and buys the shopping. Now Charlie was still a smoker, always had been. And for the weeks following the lucid dream, every week Antonio had come back he had forgotten to buy the cigarettes for Charlie. There's an interesting phenomena found in stage hypnosis called "negative hallucination" where you can hypnotize someone to such a deep level they literally won't see what they've been hypnotized not to see. There's a theory that perhaps the suggestion that Antonio placed in his brain was so strong he literally couldn't see the word cigarettes written on the shopping list. So it seems like we can work with addiction as directly as Antonio did or as indirectly as working through trauma integration. For as Dr. Gabor Mate says "The link between addiction "and trauma is inarguable". And finally, the greatest why of all, having fun. If you want to spend your lucid dreams flying about having sex with movie stars, walking through walls, go for it. I spent the first two years of my lucid dream experience just having sex. I trained myself to lucid dream at 16 years old. That's like three years before I got into Buddhism, moved into the Buddhist temple, all that kind of stuff. So of course, a 16 year old with access to a huge virtual reality simulation, you can imagine what I used to do, a lot of skateboarding and a lot of sex. So I'm not here to judge. If you want to spend your lucid dreams having fun go for it. Oxytocin is a vagus nerve tonic. And so oxytocin release is really good for us. And oxytocin is released in exactly the same way in the lucid dream as if we were awake. So being happy in your dreams means happy in your life. Simply by becoming aware of these powerful why benefits of lucid dreaming, some of you might find that you start to have lucid dreams already. So before we get there, let's move on to the lucidity spectrum to learn about the different levels that lie within lucidity. Level one, pre-lucid. Pre-lucid is a term coined by the lucid dream researcher, Celia Green to describe the state of mind in which we critically question the reality of the dream. So in the pre-lucid state, suspicions arise that we might be dreaming usually after we become aware of some sort of bizarre dream anomaly. For example, we might be in the dream going, "Hang on, why am I talking to my dead grandma? "She died ages ago!" Sometimes pre-lucid leads to the light bulb moment of, "Wow, I'm dreaming," but often not. Often we just have the dreams where we're saying, "Wait, why am I naked in public, that's so weird!" And the dream continues. That's pre-lucid. Level two, semi-lucid. Here, we experience the aha moments of lucid awareness but then we might slip back and forth between lucidity and non-lucidity. We might be lucid one moment then become distracted and slip into non-lucid dreaming the next moment. Also semi-lucid is often used to describe low level lucidity where you might be lucid enough to know you're dreaming but not so lucid that you're choosing to direct or choreograph the dream. Level three, fully lucid. This is a state of fully conscious reflective awareness within the dream coupled with volitional interaction with the dreamscape and dream characters. With full lucidity, we can maintain awareness for the entirety of the dream period which may be an hour or more in length. Now this is cool, you might be thinking, "But where's time in lucid dreams?" In a non-lucid dream time's out the window. But once you become lucid and the prefrontal cortex is activated, your estimation of time is pretty much the same as in the waking state. So if it feels like you've been lucid dreaming for 30 seconds, you probably have. If it feels like you've been lucid for an entire hour, you probably have too. Imagine spending 60 minutes flying or walking around the internal environment of your own psychology. Many people believe that fully lucid is the highest possible level of lucidity. I disagree, there is a deeper level, level four, super-lucid. This is a term used to describe the state in which we have a level of awareness that surpasses full lucidity. Due to an experience of partial non-dual awareness. What does this mean? Well, the fundamental difference between fully lucid and super-lucid rests on a subtle but profound shift of perception. For example, in a fully lucid dream, I might become lucid, remember my dream plan, "Oh, I want to go surfing" and then think, "Okay, I'm in a room." So I find the door, I walk out the door, out into the space, put my hand up, fly through the sky, find a beach and go surfing, fully lucid. In a super-lucid dream though, I wouldn't walk through the door, I'd just go straight through the wall. I wouldn't fly to the beach, I'll just go "Beach, now." We stopped interacting with the dream as if the laws of physics apply. In fact with super-lucidity, often your level of consciousness is so high that you probably wouldn't bother going surfing. You'll probably just stand in the dream, experiencing the deep meditation of the non-dual awareness state. Witnessing dreams, this type of dream falls within the lucidity spectrum but doesn't quite fit into any of the other levels. In a witnessing dream, we experience lucid awareness but it's as if we're watching the dream on a screen. So we're not in the dream in the first person, we're kind of watching it from a third person. So we probably won't be able to interact or choreograph the dream, but we simply watch the dream happening from a removed perspective. Witnessing dreams are often associated with extended periods of meditation. So if you're doing a lot of meditation you might find you have a lot of witnessing dreams. Human beings have been discussing their dreams around the embers of last night's campfires since beginningless time. What I want us to do on this Quest is to start sharing our dreams in a dream circle with the other members of the Tribe. This means checking in at least a few times a week with other members of the Tribe to discuss the dreams you've been having. Checking in about how many dreams you can remember, how your dream recall's been going, how is it to keep the dream diary. And also simply about connecting emotionally by sharing your dreams with another. There's been an interesting study again from Swansea University that has shown that when people share their dreams in dream circles it actually leads to an increase in empathy. And that makes sense, right? 'Cause when you share your dreams with someone, you're not sharing who you believe yourself to be, you're sharing who you really are. Our hearts open when we share our dreams with another. So by engaging our Quest dream circles, I hope your heart opens too. And one more thing, simply by speaking your dreams out loud you pay homage to the dreamer, that part of the brain that creates and plays out your dreams. Every time you speak a dream, every time you share a dream, every time you write a dream, you're sending a message to your mind that says "Dreams are something important to me. "Dreams are something I value." And with that, the dream will start to manifest with more value too. Now for your actions for today. Number one, start a dream circle and share your dream experience with at least a few other members of the Tribe. Number two, keep up the dream recall affirmation and the dream diaries. So I hope today's session has left you feeling hyped up not only by the top 10 whys of lucid dreaming, but also by the lucidity spectrum. Because awareness of that spectrum means that you may already have been having lucid dream experiences. I'm sure some of you may have already been getting pre-lucid, right? Or maybe even fully lucid, if so, share it with your dream circle and celebrate it with the Tribe. Tomorrow we move on the most important lucid dreaming technique of the entire Quest, lucid dream planning. See you then, sweet dreams.

====================

LESSON 5 – 3 Steps to Creating a Dream Plan
--------------------
<v ->Planning a lucid dream</v> is a lucidity technique in itself, because when we set a strong intention to do something in our first or next lucid dream, we not only start to attract the causes and conditions needed to make that dream manifest, but we also create an expectation of becoming lucid. And for lucid dreaming, expectation is very powerful. This technique used to go at the end of my books and courses, but now I put it at the beginning. Because as we learned yesterday, if you have a good reason why to lucid dream and a plan for how to get that dream to manifest, you don't need to go looking for lucid dreams, because lucid dreams will come looking for you. Dream Planning, whatever you plan to do in your lucid dream, should turn you on psychologically. It should make you salivate. It should really make you excited to go to sleep because you can't wait to have the lucid dream. Maybe you make a dream plan to meet you and a child and integrate childhood trauma. Maybe you make a dream plan to heal a physical ailment, to face a fear, to ask for career advice, to do your spiritual practice, whatever it is, make a plan. My advice is this. Even if you're a total beginner, when you make your dream plan, aim high. If you aim too high, your dream are simply won't comply or it will help you dial it down a little bit. So don't worry about going too far out. Go as far out as your imagination will allow you to. When I was in my mid 20s, I made a dream plan to visit Nirvana. Now I'm a card carrying Buddhist, and lived in a Buddhist center for seven years. So as you can imagine, the idea of Nirvana is a concept and idea that I'm very familiar with. So I thought, wouldn't it be cool if through the lucid dream I could actually go to or experience Nirvana. So I made my dream plan, I became lucid and in the lucid dream I called out, "Dewachen now!" Dewachen is a Tibetan word used to describe a Nirvana pure realm. So I get lucid and call out, "Dewachen now!" Now nothing happens. A second time, "Dewachen, take me to Dewachen now!" Now nothing happens. A third time, "Take me to Dewachen." A woman with a clipboard walks into the lucid dream straight up to me, looks down at the clipboard, looks up and says, "Dewachen, nah, you're not ready for that." Boom and I wake up. There was some aspect that my unconscious mind that knew that experiencing Nirvana, going to Dewachen, might blow my tiny 20 year old mind. So it dialed it down, it edited, it censored the dream for me. However, a few years later I did that same dream plan, and this time the woman with the clipboard didn't turn up and I did have that experience. That experience altered my life forever, because I realized if that's true, then maybe all the other stuff is true too. And then reality truly started to open up to me. Dream planning is done in three steps, plan, picture, sankalpa. Step one, the plan. Once you've decided what you want to do, check the top 10 whys for inspiration, begin to formulate your dream plan. Start with the sentence, "In my next lucid dream I," and then write a description of what you want to do once you're lucid. For example, maybe in your next lucid dream you want to heal a knee injury. So you write, In my next lucid dream, once I'm lucid, I do hands-on Reiki healing on my knee injury. As I placed my hands on my knee, colored light shoots out of the palm of my hands. I also call out an affirmation such as, "I am free of any and all non-beneficial disease. I am free of any and all non-beneficial disease. When I wake in the morning, the inflammation in my knee is greatly reduced." So there you go. There's a description of what you want to happen in the lucid dream, and the outcome you'd like to come from it. Step two, picture. Most of us dream in pictures and images. So draw a little picture of your dream plan and action as a way to get one step closer to the manifestation of that dream. Now I'm not much of an artist, so I just use like stick man and little pictures and speech bubbles. But if you are an artist, then go for it, do something beautiful, do something abstract, go as far out as you like. The main thing is, that you somehow pictorialize the idea of the lucid dream you want to have. Step three, sankalpa. Sankalpa is a Sanskrit word, which means will or intent. And when I use the term sankalpa here, I'm referring to a call to action. It should be a pithy statement that sums up the essence of your dream plan. So for example, if your dream plan has a complex description of how you intend to reduce inflammation in your knee and heal an ailment, then the sankalpa might be, "Healing my knee now" or "Healing energy now." It's the call to action that you engage once you're in the lucid dream, almost like a code word that unlocks the dream plan. So the dream plan can be a detailed as poetic and descriptive as you like, but the sankalpa should be short and sharp. Here are some examples of dream plans and action. A few years ago, I decided that I wanted to try and meet the essence of my divine feminine within the lucid dream. So I made a dream plan. In mind next lucid dream, I call out to meet the essence of my divine feminine. She appears in personified form. I embrace her with love and fully balanced both the female and male energies within my psychology. I wake up feeling elated and fully in connection with my divine feminine. Then the picture, was a bit rubbish, I just drew a little picture of me a little picture of the divine feminine, and then what thought was integration. The sankalpa was a simple as, "Divine feminine come to me." So about a week later, I become lucid in the dream. Oh, I'm dreaming. I remember what's my dream plan, to meet my divine feminine. So I call out in the lucid dream, "Divine feminine come to me, divine feminine, come to me." And rather than some sort of angel appearing or the mother Mary or some female Dakini embodiment of enlightened wisdom, this music started, ♪ ton ton ton ton ton ton ton ton ton ton ♪ Now, what the hell is that? Then suddenly these big double doors appeared. They swung open and three big guys walk through them. One white guy, one black guy, one Indian guy wearing a turban. They're really big, kind of like bounces at a nightclub. And the cool thing about a lucid dream, is that you can interpret the dream while you're in it. So in the lucid dream, I started to tell myself, "Oh, so maybe my divine feminine has manifested in this hyper masculine form. Oh, that's very interesting, that's really interesting, that the kind of gender dynamics there." But I was wrong. They were the entourage with the divine feminine. As they walk towards me these three big guys, the door swing open again and the music pumps up more, ♪ boom, boom boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom ♪ And then through door comes my divine feminine. How did she look? It was freaking Beyonce. Walking through sassy as anything I was, "Oh my God my divine is Beyonce." Suddenly the dream changes. I'm on the floor, looking up on my knees, and on a couch, like a kind of a chaise launch thing is this Beyonce divine feminine figure, completely naked. Now looking back on the dream, it's strange there was no sexual energy there, but to be honest the power of the divine feminine was so strong, I kind of didn't project anything sexual onto her. I was too scared to do so, she was pure female power. And on my knees, I look up to her and I say, in the dream, "Are you my divine feminine?" She looks down at me, touches my face and says in an American Beyonce accent, "No honey, you are." Suddenly this huge amount of energy rushes through my body and I wake up in tears. Now I have no idea whether that was actually the full integration of my divine feminine, now I have no idea if your divine feminine will manifest the Beyonce too, but the reason I'm telling you this, is to see just how differently the dream manifest from the dream plan created. Remember in the dream plan, I thought it was going to be some sort of angel or mother Mary figure, in the end it was Beyonce. So we make our dream plan, it doesn't kind of force the mind into anything. It just makes a suggestion to the mind. When you make your dream plan, it's like a love letter, written to the unconscious saying, "I'd really love to do this in my next lucid dream." Sometimes the unconscious follows to the plan, sometimes it hide us on the plan. The second example I want to share with you is a much more serious case. There was a lady who came to one of my lucid dreaming immersive retreats. And on the first night she had a lucid dream. This is before we'd really learn any other lucid dream techniques, other than dream planning. In her dream plan, she had decided she wanted to call out to meet her seven year old self. When I asked her why, she said, "Because around the age of seven, that's when some abuse happened." And that now she was an adult, even though she knew it was strange to still feel it, she felt a sense of guilt that somehow she was in the wrong, that somehow it was her fault at the age of seven. So she thought that through the lucid dream, she might be able to reconnect with that little girl, embrace her, show her love and tell her it wasn't your fault, as a way to help integrate the trauma in the waking state. That night she became lucid, and she called out to the dream. "Seven-year-old self, come to me, seven-year-old self now." Now nothing happened. The dream blocked it. Some sort of intelligence within her dreaming mind, knew that perhaps to meet her seven-year-old self, would have retraumatized her. Some sort of intelligence knew, nah, we shouldn't go there. But when she called out a third time, "Seven-year-old self come to me", suddenly a door appeared in the lucid dream, and on the door was a sign, and the sign read, "Caution", what amazing symbolism from the intelligence of the dreaming mind? She was in the lucid dream and she thought to herself, well what would Charlie say to do? I was like, "Push the door, push the door." And she thought, "Okay, well if the door is locked, I'll take that as a symbolic representation that the trauma is locked behind a door and I shouldn't touch it. If the door swings open, I'll proceed with caution." So she pushes the door in the lucid dream. As soon as the door opens, suddenly a three story building manifests. On each story of the building, is a different symbolic representation of the abuse, on the ground floor is a room full of vomit because there was some of the abuse where she was forced eat cause she was sick. And she walked into this room fearlessly and she was so sweet she thought, "Oh, Charlie always talks about hugging things in your dreams, hugging your demons, hugging the monsters, because they're all parts of you. Show them love. How do I hug a room full of vomit?" She thought on our feet and said, "Well, it's all symbolic, so I'll hug it with my mind." So she walked in and called out affirmations. "I set you free it, it wasn't your fault, I set you free." And she had a huge emotional release. And the next day it was such a privilege to hear her telling that dreams to me in the dream circle. A few years later, when I was writing my book, "Dreaming Through Darkness", I wanted to include that dream as a case study. So I had to make contact with the young lady again. And she said, "Yeah, absolutely, you can use the dream, but I want you to tell people this, that dream didn't heal me of the childhood trauma, but what did happen, is after that dream all the blocks had stopped me going into therapy, talking to people about it. Being open to healing my trauma, was suddenly removed." She suddenly felt the lucid dream had removed those blocks and now she could move towards the journey to healing. In fact, the last time I spoke to her, she was about to have Christmas with some of the family members involved. So deep, with the healing gone. The reason I tell you that dream plan, is not only to highlight the power of lucid dreaming for trauma integration, but also to show that there's something in the dreamer that knows what you're ready for and what you're not. So aim high, and if it's too much, the dream will bring you back down. There's a famous Tibetan Lama called Tenzin Wangyal Rinpoche who wrote a book called "The Tibetan Yoga of Dream and Sleep." When I saw him teach in London, he said, "You Westerners, you love your plans. So write your plan, put it in your back pocket and go and live your life." That's the attitude we need to have to our dream plans. Don't feel too rigidly confined by them. It's just an exercise to help us manifest the cause and conditions to get lucid. And finally, if you do make a dream plan and you want to change it in the moment, that's totally fine too. If you've made a dream plan to go surfing for example, and then you're about to go surfing in the lucid dream and the Dalai Lama walks in and says, "I've come to give you the meaning of life." You don't say, "See you later, Dalai, I'm going surfing." You say, "Forget surfing, tell me the meaning of life." There are main ways that your dream plan will manifest. Number one, in a lucid dream. So maybe tonight, maybe in one week, maybe in one month. But whenever you have your next lucid dream, you become lucid, you call out your sankalpa, you engage the dream plan. The second way it can manifest, is through a non-lucid dream. Some people find the act of creating the dream plan, send such a powerful message to their dreamer saying, "I really want this to happen" that their dreamer engages the dream plan, even before they're lucid. So basically your dream plan plays out in a non-lucid dream. And the third way your dream plan can manifest, is quite spooky. In this waking life, sometimes creating the dream plan has such a powerful effect on the energetic environment, that a bit like creating a vision board, you might find that your dream plan manifests in the waking state before it's manifested in the dream state. First time I ever saw this, was it one of the retreats I was running at a place called Holy Isle. Now Holy Isle is a tiny Island, off a tiny Island, off the coast of Scotland, very little cell phone reception. While we're at that retreat, a lady made a dream plan that in the dream plan, she wanted to meet her estranged father. He wasn't dead, but they hadn't spoken for many months due to a big family bust up. And in the lucid dream she was going to have the conversation she wanted to have with him, and then engage a healing. Over the four days of that retreat, she didn't become lucid. But when we were leaving the retreat, getting the boat off the Island, and everyone's cell phone started beeping again. She went, "Oh my God, look at this text." There was a text message from her dad. After four months of not speaking, her dad had texted her saying, "This is ridiculous, it's been too long, let's meet up, I want to make things right again." Could it be that the universe had heard the call of the dream plan? So even though she didn't become lucid in her lucid life, the dream plan manifest. However your dream plan manifests, whenever it's complete, write a new one for your next lucid dream. Some of you might get lucid in this first week. Some of you might not get lucid until week three or four, either is totally, totally fine. But whenever you've completed the dream plan, make another. Now your actions for today. Make your dream plan and share it with the Tribe, asking for feedback if you want it, and offering feedback very sensitively if asked of you. Once you have a dream plan that you're really excited by, please do share it with the Tribe. Why share it? Because it adds to the power of manifestation. Your dream plan has been witnessed by another. It's been heard by the universe and all that will add power to the intent and encourage your dreamer to help you get lucid. Of course, keep up your dream recall, dream diaries and the Tribe dream sharing. So that's dream planning done dreamers but don't forget, your dream plan can and will evolve. So don't feel confined by it. And remember if it doesn't make you salivate, make another one that does. So until then, deep dreams.

====================

LESSON 6 – Meet the Inner Dreamer for More Interesting Dreams
--------------------
<v ->The dreamer is the label that I give</v> to the part of the unconscious mind that creates and plays out our dreams. The dreamer is the part of you that directs, produces, and writes the scripts for your dreams. Although your dreamer lives in the unconscious mind, it is a conscious aspect of yourself, which can learn, evolve, and even be directly dialogued with. Neuroscience tells us, that although some dreams are just used for filing and working through the day's events as a way to update our survival mechanisms and reconsolidate memory, many of our dreams are used as mediums for psychological integration, and play a vital role in our mental healthiness. When you're in a lucid dream and you call out, "Inner child, come to me", it's the dreamer that sends the inner child from stage left. When you experienced trauma, it is the dreamer that decides to replay the traumatic event in your dreams as a way to work through the trauma and heal, and when you fall asleep asking for a lucid dream, it is the dreamer who grants your request. Make friends with your dreamer and the doors to your dream world is unlocked. So what's the best way to connect to your dreamer? By paying attention to your dreams. People often tell me that they don't write down their dreams 'cause their dreams are so boring, to which I always reply, "Your dreams are so boring "because you don't write them down." Imagine this, five times a night, your dreamer has to create original Hollywood pieces of script writing to present to your conscious mind. Now, imagine if every night of your life, you're not listening to that, you're not watching those scripts, you're not there in the theater seeing it be played out. I did a script writing degree at university, and I know if you asked me to write five unique scripts every night, and I knew there was no one in the audience to watch them or witness them, I just start writing really boring scripts. That's what happens with our dreams. Start writing down your dreams and the content of your dreams will become more meaningful. There's even a scientific study that has shown, people who ingest more complex narratives like people who go to the theater a lot, read a lot of novels, expose themselves to complex narratives, in theater, film, or storytelling, they have more complex dreams, because the dreamer learns narrative, the dreamer learns about red herring, the dreamer learns how to construct stories. So, if you're having boring dreams, you want to have some more powerful dreams, read Tolkien before bed, watch a film that's really complicated, go to the theater more, and your dreams will start to reflect those complex narratives. So that's why we have to keep doing the dream diary, yes. I know dream diaries are probably the least sexy part of lucid dreaming, but it really is a vital part of connecting with our dreamer, and trainings to have lucid dreams. But keeping a dream diary isn't the only way to connect with your dreamer. Look at how you about your dreams in everyday life. For many of us, we use words that have negatized and pathologized dreams and our everyday parlance. For example, you are a dreamer. It was just a dream. You're dreaming. We use dreams in a negative way. We live in a society that has pathologized a third of our life. So look at the language which you use to talk about your dreams, and look at your energetic connection to that third of your life that you spend sleeping and dreaming. Change the energy, and the energy of your dreams will change too. We need to start viewing our dream to something valuable. Once we start to view them as something more valuable than they are, the value they offer us will increase naturally. Once we start having lucid dreams, you're going to be able to meet your dreamer face to face. But until then, let me guide you in a meditation that will help you connect with your dreamer right now. In this guided meditation, we're going to connect with our dreamer, the part of the unconscious mind that creates and plays out our dreams. In order to connect with the dreamer, we're first going to show gratitude to ourselves, gratitude to our body, gratitude to our mind, and then gratitude to our dreamer. The reason for this is because gratitude undercuts the ego. Once we're in a state of deep gratitude towards ourselves, a direct line of communication opens up to the deepest depths of our mind. Take a moment to notice the ground beneath your feet or the connection points of your body with the ground or the bed beneath it. Take a moment to connect to your breathing. Notice how the body expands when we breathe in, and how the body releases and relaxes when we breathe out. on each exhalation, allow yourself to relax deeper and deeper into the natural state of relaxation. And then, using your breath to guide you, I want you to imagine that you breathe down into your feet and your legs, and as you follow your breath to your feet and your legs, your attention moves with it. I want you to put your attention into your feet and into your legs. Really feel into your feet and your legs. Take a moment to consider the amazing job that your feet and your legs do. They allow you to walk, to stand, to dance, to run. Your feet and your legs are amazing, but when did you last say thank you to your feet and your legs? Take a moment now in your own way, in your own mind to say thank you to your feet and your legs. And now, using your breath to guide you, bring your attention into your hands and your arms. Take a moment to really feel into your hands and your arms. Take a moment to consider the amazing job that your hands and your arms do. Your hands and your arms allow you to right, to touch, to feed yourself, to hug. Your hands and your arms are amazing, but when did you last say thank you to hands and your arms? Take a moment now to show gratitude to your hands and your arms. And now, allow your awareness to spread into the core of your body. Becoming aware of your respiration system, your digestive system, your ever beating heart. Your body is amazing, but when did you last say thank you to it? Take a moment to say thank you to your respiration system, your digestive system, your ever beating heart. Show gratitude to these parts of your body now. And now, allow your awareness to spread into the rest of your body, so that from the tips of your toes to the crown of your head, you are aware. Consider the amazing job that your body does. However broken or ill your body may seem, it is always trying its best, so take a moment to say thank you to your body now. And from our body, we move even deeper to our minds. Take a moment to become aware of your mind. Take a moment to consider the amazing job that your mind does. Creator of reality, filter of experience, the most powerful virtual reality simulator known to man, the human mind. Take a moment to say thank you to your mind now. From our body to our mind, from our mind to our dreamer. The part of the unconscious mind that creates and plays out our dreams. We say thank you to the dreamer, thank you for the nightmares that offer such guidance, thank you for the dreams of insights, thank you for the dreams of prophecy, thank you for the lucid dreams we have had or are yet to have. Take a moment to say thank you to your dreamer now. And now that we've shown gratitude to our body, to our mind, and to the dream that resides within our mind, we are in a perfect place to make a request to the dreamer. Think of a request that you would like to ask from your dreamer. Maybe you ask to remember your dreams, maybe you ask for lucid dreams, maybe you ask for dreams of insight, whatever it is, take a moment now with gratitude to make a request of your dreamer. Make your request now. And knowing that your dreamer has heard you, allow your awareness to move from the dreamer back to your mind, from your mind back to your body, and from your body back to your breath. If you're doing this practice during the day, take a moment once again to say thank you to yourself, and then open your eyes if they were closed, and bring yourself back to fully wakeful awareness. So here are your actions for today. Firstly, share with the Tribe the state of your current relationship with your dreamer. Be sure to keep reciting the dream, recall affirmation as you fall asleep, and be sure to write in your dream diaries every morning, even if you don't remember anything. It's totally fine to write that too. On the seventh day of creation, God rested. But He was the creator of time so He could afford to chill. We on the other hand, own on a 30 day quest. So although we won't have a big session tomorrow, we do still have more to explore. It's all fun, though. At the end of the week, we have a quiz. I can see the hyper competitive members of the Tribe lighting up. We have our week one Pep Talk, and we have our weekly bedtime story. See you tomorrow.

LESSON 7 – Summary of Your First Week
--------------------
<v ->Today is about fun, inspiration and relaxation.</v> The fun bit is the quiz. The inspiring bit is the pep talk and the relaxation bit is the bedtime story. So, welcome to the week one quiz. Without checking back in the previous lessons of the quest, I want you to answer the following questions from memory. There'll be no shaming if you don't get them right and this is just for fun, so enjoy. Question number one. What part of the brain is activated when we become lucid? Yeah, that's right. It's the prefrontal cortex or the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex if you want to be a real geek. Question two. How many times should we recite the dream recall affirmation as we are falling sleep? Yeah, 21 times. Question three. What has been shown to increase the narrative complexity of dream content? You've got it. Consuming more complex narratives from reading books or watching movies. Question four. What are the two most important mental qualities required to learn lucid dreaming? Enthusiasm and determination. And our final question just for fun. Which form did my divine feminine take when I met her in the lucid dream? Damn right. Freaking Beyonce. Firstly, well done for completing week one of the quest. You just started out on a journey that may radically reshape 30 years of your life. Big respect to you from me. We worked hard this week. Nailing all the basics like a boss. We've explored the what, why and how of lucid dreaming while also learning our first three techniques, dream recall, dream diaries and dream planning. The main things to remember this week are this. You need to be reciting the dream recall affirmation every time you fall asleep and the dream diaries need to be written in every single morning, even if you don't remember anything. The last thing you see before sleep and the first thing you see when you wake up, needs to be your dream diary. So make sure you've got one that you want to use. If you're still just using scraps of paper, go and get a good dream diary that you really like. Many of you may start getting lucid straight away but for others, the first two weeks of the quest will be mainly preparing the foundations and then week three is when we really start cooking with gas. Remember, your dream plan may well be the most important technique there is because the why is more important than the how. So look back over your dream plan. Does it still make you salivate? If not make a new one. There are two routes to lucidity. The first route was simply to follow the formula. The techniques work and they will bring you to lucidity. The second route, is to have loads of enthusiasm and determination that will also get you there. But I propose a third, if we combine the step-by-step formula of effective techniques with enthusiasm and determination, then we've really got something special. We've had loads of new information this week. So before we move on, let me tell you about the three stage creative process, saturation, incubation, illumination. We've just had a week of saturation. We've saturated our brain with loads of new information. This saturation process will eventually lead to illumination in the form of a lucid dream, but only if we are sure not to miss out the middle stage, incubation. Incubation is essentially doing nothing. Giving the brain a period of rest in which the insight can arise within. Today, your incubation stage is going to be your bedstory. So relax and enjoy. Here are your actions for today. As today is a review and implementation day, it's the perfect time to catch up on any content that you've missed. So let's say you missed day four or you worked too quickly through day three, go back and watch them again. Catch up on anything you've missed, rewatch videos, make sure you're up to date so that when we move into week two, you haven't missed anything. And as always keep reciting the dream recall affirmation as you fall asleep and keep up the dream diary once you wake up. Also, make sure you know your dream plan off by heart or at least your sankalpa off by heart, so that once you're in the lucid dream you don't have to think about it. You can just roll it off the tongue. I'll see you next week when we move into week two of our lucid dreaming quest.

LESSON 7 – Meditation: Bedtime Story: “Be a Salmon”

- Get into bed, get comfy, and allow yourself to drift off to sleep. While I tell you a bedtime story, I want to tell you a story about a salmon. A salmon is a fish that swims upstream, all the other fish swim downstream, and so does the salmon at first, because going with the flow seems so logical and so normal. But one day, something awakens within the salmon, a desire, a yearning, perhaps, to return home. And so one day, one ordinary day, just like today, the salmon makes a choice, a choice to do things differently, a choice to stand out from the crowded shoal. One day the salmon decides to start swimming upstream to find its way home. You know, the thing about salmon is that their journey up river is not random. They've actually got a form of inbuilt GPS that allows them to use the magnetic field of the earth to find the exact bend on the exact part of the exact same river where they were born. As the salmon swims upstream, it passes all the other fish in the river who are all swimming the other way. The other fish laugh at the salmon saying, Hey, you are crazy. Why don't you just go with the flow? Stop swimming upstream. Forget about going home. And for a minute, the salmon questions itself and thinks, why am I doing this? Why don't I just go with the flow like everybody else? And then the salmon remembers, oh yeah, I'm making my way home. And so it ignores the other fish. It is proud of its different path, and it dedicates its energy to coming home. Two and a half thousand years ago, the Buddha described the spiritual path as going against the stream. He said that it was about turning around in the river and observing how the way everyone else is going may be the easy way, but it's not the way to freedom. It's not the way home to enter onto the spiritual path, and definitely onto the path of lucid dreaming, it's to become like a salmon. Don't go with the flow of the masses who work, eat, sleep, and repeat. Be like a salmon. Don't disregard your dreams and see sleep as wasted time. Be like a salmon. Don't ignore 30 years of your life and sleep. Walk non lucidly through the rest of it. Be like a salmon. And when the others question us saying, why do you care about dreams? Just go back to sleep. What good is lucid dreaming? Anyway, shout back at them joyfully. I am a lucid dreamer and I am my way back home. Wake up. Come join me. Come and be like a salmon. And now with the energy of that story in your body, close your eyes if they're still open. Allow yourself to release into the support of your bed and relax deeply into sleep. Allow your breathing to slow and your mind to relax deeply into sleep. Allow any tension in your body to dissolve as you exhale and relax deeply into sleep. Dream lucidly, dream deeply. Relax deeply into sleep.

LESSON 7 – Experience Lucid Dreaming Bonus Live Call #1: Firm Foundations & Celebrating Dream Plans

Hello everyone and welcome to Experience Lucid Dreaming's live bonus calls. We've got five of these over the next five weeks. This is the first one. So welcome everyone to this call. We have Charlie Morley joining us as well. You're going to get to connect with him live. You're going to get to share your experience so far on the quest and get your most important questions answered. So welcome everyone. Tonight we are focusing on the first. week of the quest firm foundations and we're also going to be celebrating your dream plans so thank you everyone who submitted your dream plans i think we got about 50 or 60 dream plans submitted from the tribe and that's fantastic so we're going to be going on over a few of those and charlie is going to teach you and give you some feedback on those green plans they look great the ones that i've read so far and we're really excited to share them with you so without further ado let's introduce charlie he's the author of the quest as you already know he's a best -selling author and he's taught lucid dreaming in over 20 countries in the world welcome to the call charlie it's great to have you from london thank you so much it's great to be here and great to see so many people on the call too you know i love this about zoom i love one of my favorite things about these zoom meetings when everyone puts their countries in and you just see it rolling and you're like yeah i know there's a lot of um there's a lot of problems with globalization But when you see something on Zoom with all the countries going, it makes me think, hey, you know, hurrah for globalization. We can be a global family on this call. So that's really, really brilliant. So thank you so much. And I want to really make this call about you guys. I want to hear questions from you humans. I want to hear how you've been doing, how the first week's been going. But before that, I'm just going to run through the first week. Let's kind of fill in the gaps a little bit here. And the first thing I want to say is week one is not lucid dreaming week. So if you're sitting there with a... you know, a subtle sense of maybe shame or kind of, oh, I haven't had a lucid dream yet. Don't worry. You ain't supposed to be having lucid dreams yet. If you have had a lucid dream in the first week, brilliant, amazing, but no stress, no worry with that. This is about like baking a cake. And like week one is just sorting the ingredients on the tabletop. Week two, we start mixing in the ingredients, start making the cake. It's really only the end of week two into week three, we start the baking. So yeah, week three, week four, okay. We are baking some cakes, baby. But up until then, we're mixing the ingredients. So relax, chill. You know, don't have any sense of lack of achievement if you haven't had a lucid dream yet. And also, if you have had a lucid dream in the first week, that's freaking awesome. So let's totally celebrate that too. So what I want to do is just break down, kind of go through the days and just fill in the gaps about this, some of these things. So the first day. What is lucid dreaming? Of course, this was the basics. I'm sure a lot of you like knew this stuff already for the masterclass. Have you watched that or some of my videos on YouTube? But again, we're just laying the basics here. Day two. I think this is really interesting and really important in neuroscience. And the reason I put that in so early is because, you know, if you're doing this quest already, if you're already a Mindvalley member, I'm probably preaching to the converted because you're probably already sold. on the idea of expanded levels of consciousness but many people aren't so i think it's really important that we cover the neuroscience of lucid dreaming so that if you meet a family member or a friend who says what lucid dreaming is you've got the facts and figures to back this up say no it is not it is absolutely science fact so i think that's really important to cover that stuff early on and of course day two is when we had our first guided meditation the dream recall affirmation meditation i want to make this really clear That 21 affirmation thing, right, that you listen to as you go to sleep, you don't have to listen to that. If you would rather just recite it in your mind at your own pace, in your own language, on your own way, for many people that will be a much better option. So it's just an option. Some people like to just press play and fall asleep and have my voice guiding them. Other people, the speed of my voice is too fast or it's too slow or I'm not speaking their native language. So it's totally fine to do it in your own way or even make your own recording. you know get your phone and record your own affirmation also as far as the speed i'm sure some of you have noticed um that all of the videos on the quest you can watch at different speeds you just maximize the video and then you can like you can watch me at double time so i'm doing the quest along with you guys but i've got to say i'm listening to myself at double speed because i kind of know what i'm going to say but i still want to make sure i'm saying it correctly um with that dream recall affirmation you can speed it up or you can slow it down so if you find that affirmation meditation is too quick just drop down the speed do it at 0 .5 speed and then it'll be really nice and slow and meditative if you prefer um day three keeping a dream diary so important i know that keeping a dream diary may seem like the least sexy part of lucid dreaming. You know, it's four o 'clock in the morning, you just have this amazing dream and you just think, oh, I can't be bothered to write it down. I know it's tough. Maybe just a few notes or just draw a little picture to remind yourself. You don't need to be writing loads in the middle of the night. That might affect your sleep cycle a little bit. Just a few notes in the middle of the night. If you want to write the whole dream, fine. But for others, you know, find your balance. But the dream diary is really, really important. Day four, the why of lucid dreaming. This is probably one of my favorites because, of course, it leads into the dream plan. And I believe that the dream plan is the most important lucid dreaming technique there is. I can't state this enough. I've met people who come to me and they say, I've read every lucid dreaming book. I'm doing hand checks all through the day. I'm writing down five dreams every morning. I'm aware of all my dream signs. I'm doing all the lucid dreaming techniques, but I'm still not getting lucid. What's happening? I always reply with the same question. What's your dream plan? Very often people say, what is a dream plan? And I'm like, okay, so there's the problem. The why is more important than the how. I've met people who've had mind -blowing lucid dreams using no lucid dreaming techniques. They've just come to a talk. They've heard me talk about the why of lucid dreaming. And they've gone to sleep thinking, wow, wouldn't it be amazing if I could heal this childhood trauma? Wouldn't it be amazing if I could do this spiritual practice? And just having the kind of why. They haven't even formally made a dream plan. But in their head, they've got their why sorted. They've got their reason why. And then they have big lucid dreams. So the techniques are great. But the why is more important than the how. So again, I think that day four is really important. And if at any point in the quest, if you feel that you're kind of losing your mojo a little bit, you know, you're losing your enthusiasm for the quest, go back to day four and just remind yourself, what are the benefits? Why am I doing it? What's the point? And hopefully that'll help to re -inspire you. Then of course, day five, creating the dream plan. We're going to do a lot of that today because I have chosen, we had about 60 submissions of dream plans, which is brilliant. It was very difficult actually to choose my top three or four, but I have chosen my top three or four. The dream plans I've chosen to share with you today are not necessarily the best dream plans. It's not about that. It's not that theirs is better than yours. It's simply there's something in that dream plan that I want to share with you. It's some sort of teaching point, and there'll be something in that dream plan that I thought was quite profound or quite beautiful. So I'll be looking at that. Oh, and by the way, you will make multiple dream plans. You know, you aren't going to have one lucid dream in your life. You're going to have dozens of lucid dreams in your life. You know, I've been doing this for 20 years. So I've had, I don't know, have I had thousands yet? I've definitely had hundreds, you know, five, 600, 700. I don't know. many um so you're you're gonna have a lot of dream plans so don't worry you're not limited to just one what i would say though is stick to that one dream plan until it's complete now how do you know if the dream plan is complete you either complete it in the lucid dream you either complete it in a non -lucid dream or it might be completed in the daytime you might find that that question that you asked or that thing that you wanted to heal becomes healed in the daytime and then you realize oh okay i need a new dream plan because you know that i've already kind of completed that um dream planning then day six meeting the inner dreamer okay most almost all in fact of the meditations on this quest the guided meditations are separate from the videos you'll notice but on day six meeting the dreamer we embedded the meditation into the course why because i thought that was such an important meditation i didn't want there to be any chance of somebody missing it So I actually embedded it into the course. It's that important. The dreamer is the intelligence, the director, the choreographer of your dreams. And it is intelligent. You know, Carl Jung, the world -renowned Swiss psychiatrist, said, there is something in the unconscious called the conscious unconscious. It is that conscious unconscious that I'm referring to as the dreamer with a capital D. So meeting your dreamer is a really important practice. And you can do that exercise again and again. You know, you could be doing that meeting the dreamer meditation every night if you want, if it really resonates with you. Then, of course, day seven, review and integration day. OK, I have an apology to make. We have had some complaints about review and integration day specifically concerning my leopard print pajamas. All I can say is we filmed stuff in my leopard print pajamas. Somehow it didn't make it into the edit. So maybe I look too ridiculous or whatever it was, but the leopard print pajamas didn't make it into the final edit. I'm sorry. I'm working on it. I think we should re -edit that day and get me in my leopard print pajamas. But you didn't miss anything. It's literally just a shot of me looking hilarious, getting into bed and like opening a book. So it's fine. Yeah, so review and integration day. I just wanted to have some fun. You know, I wanted to have a quiz. The pep talk's really important. My idea for this quest was I wanted it to be like I'm in your bedroom with you. Like I'm literally like holding your hand. Like I'm your brother. I'm in here like helping you, you know, moving towards lucid dreaming. So the pep talk's quite important. I hope that was helpful. And then, yeah, I know we've done day eight and nine, but we're mainly focusing on week one today. But day eight, obviously recognizing dream signs. And then day nine today, seeing through the illusion. So a bit of a fun day today with those tests. You know, you had to see if you could spot the illusion. I hope you enjoyed them. They're quite difficult. I chose kind of particularly difficult ones. So don't worry if you didn't get a lot right. I chose some really juicy ones there. And just finally from me before I hand back to Ezra. um there are three levels that you might find yourself at at this stage in the quest in fact you can just put a yes or you can write me if this is one of your levels the first level this is the kind of the top level you might find yourself at this point in the quest recalling your dreams every night keeping your dream diary every morning noticing dream signs every night and have even had a lucid dream already that's kind of you know the the top level you might be there recalling dreams every night keeping a dream diary every morning noticing your dream signs and already had a lucid oh okay lots of people calling in me me okay brilliant brilliant brilliant level two you are recalling your dreams most of the time you're writing in your dream diary maybe four or five mornings out of seven and you're aware of some dream signs that's kind of level two if you're there brilliant that's so good and give us a me brilliant all the me's are coming through And then we have level three, which is maybe you only remembered a few dreams so far. You've written a few of your dreams down your dream diaries. And maybe that's where you are. Level three is actually totally, totally fine. In fact, for some of you, level three might be a breakthrough. Because if you spent the last 10 years of your life not remembering a dream. Maybe the last time you remember dreaming was as a kid. And if in just seven days, well, nine days, you have gone from nothing, 0 % dream recall to just 5 % dream recall. Maybe you remembered one or two dreams. That's freaking awesome. In fact, maybe that's even more impressive than level one. Just throwing it out there. So I really want to kind of put that in deep in this first call. It's about working from where you are. If you're already like a seasoned dreamer and you've already had lucid dreamers, you'll know what that means in week two. Whenever I make a mistake, I do this funny thing with my hand. Yeah, then it's brilliant if you're having lucid dreams, if you're already like a lucid dreamer. But maybe it's not such a level up. Whereas if you've gone from nothing to remembering one or two dreams in the last week, that is brilliant. So I want to celebrate all three levels. Level one is no better than three. Level two is no better than one, all that kind of stuff. Everything is welcome. You know, this is inclusive. What you sometimes find is you get some people who get lucid right at the beginning of a course. You know, if it's a weekend course, they get lucid on the first night. It's a quest, they get lucid in the first week. There are other people who maybe won't get lucid till right at the end, week three or week four, or even after the quest is finished. Sometimes you find actually the people who didn't get lucid till later have a more stable lucid dream practice, almost as if they've kind of built up their muscles for longer so that when they finally do get lucid, they kind of just keep on ascending. Whereas sometimes people who just shoot up to the top because they haven't had to work for it so much, they sometimes drop down again. So everything is welcome. Please, no judgment on yourself. Definitely no judgment from me. You know, some people have been messaging me really sweet messages saying, oh, I haven't got lucid yet, but. and i say no but you know it's it's fine don't worry about getting lucid in this first week don't worry about getting lucid in the whole quest if you worry about getting lucid you won't get lucid but enjoy lucidity have an aspiration for lucidity be enthusiastic about lucidity yes okay that's all from me back to ezra awesome charlie thank you so much for that recap uh very helpful for the first week and our students so i think next we will jump into uh dream plans we've chosen three to four dream plans uh charlie's chosen them out of the 50 or 60 that were submitted so we're going to go through there i'm going to see if any of you are actually online and you can come up real quick and tell us a little bit about your dream plan um so let's see uh nadia let's see nadia are you let me see this is Correct, Nadia. Nadia, I'm going to promote you to a panelist. I think you're the one that submitted. So I'm going to promote you to a panelist and you can turn on your camera and your microphone if I can get Zoom to work. Okay, here we go. And I'm going to share your dream plan right now. You should be able to see this too. Ah, yes. So Nadia was the healing her stomach. Well, working with eating. Hi. How are you all doing? Brilliant. Thank you. So Nadia, there's a. a reason why I picked your dream plan um well a couple of reasons first but would you like to just walk through it maybe you don't have to read the whole thing but just give us the gist what was your dream plan about okay so I've been struggling with weight my entire life um the only time I was acceptable with my weight was when I became anorexic so basically one eating disorder to another um and I don't know where this comes from. So I would just like to find out the why. That's my main thing. Thank you so much. So the reason I chose this one is not only because I think it's just a great example of a healing dream plan, but specifically because I know this one works. So I've been writing my new book, Wake Up to Sleep. And in the new book, the case study in the final chapter, a friend of mine called Robert, who had a very similar dream plan. He had, you know, troubled eating habits. Let's put it like that. Just felt that he there was something in him didn't know when to stop eating. He knew it's probably linked to some sort of trauma or stuff. But who knows? He went into the lucid dream with a dream plan so similar to yours, Nadia. And he met the shadow of his overeating. so he that's how i referred to the shadow of his overeating and it appeared and he embraced it with love classic shadow integration again we'll look at this in week three something called shadow integration but he literally embraced with love so he didn't fight it he embraced it and told that he loved it and had this powerful lucid dream but the most important thing was the next day he emailed me and said i've just been out to dinner with my wife and um she said to me i i didn't finish my whole plate and he said i know that might seem a little thing for you but for me that's big i never leave food and my wife said to me like oh are you not hungry and he went no i feel i just feel fine actually i'm just i'm just not going to finish that and he said the look on her face she was so shocked um and he realized well god this is kind of strange and then he remembered the lucid dream from the night before a few days later it happened again he was cooking for himself and just felt wait I don't need to make this much food. So within days of doing the lucid dream, he saw the effects. And that's what really stuck with me. So I know this one works, Nadia. I hope that Robert's story inspires you to really make this happen. And also, this is a great example, Nadia, of a dream plan that might start to affect your waking life even before you have the lucid dream. Because this is a really, the way you've written it. is almost like a letter to your unconscious and I really liked that as I read it I thought you know what this is going to start to have an effect on Nadia even before the lucid dream there was just something about it you know the way you were talking to yourself the way you were kind of just going through yeah how it feels and what you'll do I just had a really good feeling about this one Nadia so yeah I wish you well and I hope that you really manifest this lucid dream thank you I really appreciate that it means a lot Thank you, Nadia. Brilliant. Thanks a lot. Great. Thanks so much, Nadia. All right. Let's see. Next up, Monica Grabber. I tried to message you earlier to see if you were available. I see you're on the call. So I'm going to bring you on right now, surprise you, and bring you on live to share yours. Let me just change. show and screens here okay here we go here's monica's hi monica are you live on the call can you hear us can you see her dream plan charlie i can see her dream plan yes i was waiting to see if monica was going to uh join us but let's go ah there she is hi hello hey monica great to see you how are you i'm good thank you you know this is so cool that i'm seeing the dream plan before i see the face because dream plan is like an insight into someone's unconscious so you're having this really intimate expression of who they are before you know what they look like and then monica comes on the call i'm like oh wow i can really see her now i can kind of see her in a child through the um uh through the zoom and through the dream plan so um just tell us a little bit about your dream plan if you'd like monica okay when i was about four or five years old i was very ill and i was in hospital and my parents weren't allowed to visit me everybody else could come relative sister brother but not my parents and i was so upset because i thought they abandoned me and i didn't feel feel loved so i want to call in my five -year -old me and embrace her and explain her and just tell her that she is loved brilliant thank you monica that's so beautiful i mean here are my reasons for picking this one is that i thought it was a really healing uh dream plan that monica wanted to do number two with just the beautiful artwork that she's done here now you've seen my dream plans in the quest i'm not much of an artist so i'm not sure how much my dreamer is being offered when i draw my pictures but when i saw monica's picture i'm like her dreamer has been offered a piece of artwork a bit like you know before a religious shrine where you make an offering to the gods or an offering to buddha it's as if the fact she's taken so long to create this drawing is like an offering to uh to her dreamer and i think that's going to really create energy um and the third reason was just a personal one because i've also got abandonment stuff from my childhood which i'm working with now through both lucid dreaming and through waking state therapy so this one was really personal to me and um so much of our lives are affected by the first five six years of our experience and it's just lovely to see that monica has has noticed this has focused in on this and also i believe that if monica can engage this dream plan and embrace that little girl and show her love and heal that wound of abandonment it will have very big waking state repercussions because i know in my own life so much of my relationships to my parents to my friends to to jade my ex -wife to to so many people i know has been due to core wounding of abandonment at a young age. And I know that also you can heal those through both waking state therapy and lucid dreaming. So I'm really excited for this dream plan, Monica, and I think it's such a great one. Thank you very much. Thank you, Monica. And I really hope that you get that lucidity soon. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you so much, Monica. Thank you. All right. Next, let's see. We have... there's a couple Dawns on the call. So let me, hopefully I'm bringing the correct Dawn on. Let's see. Dawn, and let me share her dream plan. Yeah, we'll soon find out if it's the right dawn, right? When the dream plan goes up. This guy's juggling. Here we go. All right. Dawn, is this your dream? You on the call? Maybe she's listening in the background or driving. Well, whichever it is, we can still celebrate her. Let's see in the chat. Is it Dawn? Is it Dawn Spindler? Maybe I have the wrong Dawn. Well, that's OK. Well, let's still celebrate Dawn anyway through her dream plan. I like this for a lot of reasons. I liked it because it really looked like a kind of a, from a, from a children's storybook or a cartoon book or something. There's something about the colors, the way they pop. It really stuck with me. And I had like a short list of like 10. and i kept on coming back this one i thought why it's quite simple you know she hasn't you know i can't really see what the clear sankalpa is or where the plan is she hasn't totally stuck to the three -step structure but i just kept on coming back to it there was something about this dream plan that really resonated um i think number one because again i know this one works i think i shared in the quest i'm here now okay brilliant dawn tell us about your dream plan um i just sent the first page too i'm looking for my career path and i said like two was two things because the first um where's my journal i don't even know here um i wrote in yeah this is the second in my next lucid dream i want to come into connection with my inner being or guides or spiritual team i want to know what direction of my career is to go what is my talent and how can i serve myself and others for the highest best And I'm not an artist. I'm not an artist, but I saw myself like Dorothy with the red shoes. And then that's the yellow brick road of what path I'm going to follow. Yeah. Anyway, yes. Yeah, I love that. OK, so there goes my theory. I thought you're gone off piece and hadn't done the three step structure. It turns out you had you're just written on a different piece, but that's still brilliant. The yellow brick road. I thought it was so symbolic. And it made me think about, you know, the thing I've said that when we were children, we all had lucid dreams. So the part of you that remembers how to lucid dream is the inner child. And that's why in the quest, I have so much play. I have so many childlike exercises, not childish, childlike, because by doing childlike things, you connect to the inner child. And I thought, I just thought. your inner child and my inner child is going to love this dream plan the yellow brick road there's dorothy the bright colors it really popped out um and also again this one was personal for me because my grandma when i was a little kid she only had like two two videos two vhs videos um generation z you don't even know what a vh video is probably but it's an old school like before dvds and one was greece you know like greece lightning the musical and the other was um you know wizard of all so i watched this film so many times so i really connected with it um and also i know from my own dream you can do this dream plan You know, I asked what career path should I take? Should I do throw down the, you know, the break dance thing I used to do? Should I be a lucid dream teacher? And it was very direct. So I know this one works. Oh, and just recently, just an updated one, just a few days ago, my friend Millie, who anyone who's read my second book, Lucid Dreaming Made Easy, she is the pole dancer who has the lucid dream where she met her dead dad. And her dad gave her kind of her permission to live her life how she liked. I was hanging out with Millie a few days ago and she had a lucid dream and she did Dawn's dream plan. She called out in the lucid dream, what shall I do with my life? So not career path, what shall I do with my life? And the dream yelled back at her, work with old people. Very specific, work with old people. She has now signed up to do a work placement and degree in caring and working with old people. So she's really, you know, this dream plan works. And within a few days, she's already changing her career path. So Dawn, you've got good providence with this one. I've tried and tested one. And I really think you're going to have a good time with this. All right, great. I'm excited. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you so much, Dawn. All right. We've got one more. Charlie? um cedric's not on the call but uh i will share his dream plan with everyone and here is cedric's okay okay so cedric's was was a really good example of um the detail he's got in his dream plan here it was about removing limited beliefs um but oh and just see i can't quite see his sankalpa because everyone because of the chat box can you read his sankalpa for me please ezra Yeah. I really love the Sankalpa. I thought it was a really good example of even if your dream plan is about, you know, removing limited beliefs, limited perceptions, this kind of stuff. The Sankalpa can be like a code word. You know, your Sankalpa could be blue raspberries. As long as you know that blue raspberries is the code word for heal my inner child or the code word for. show me my career path or meeting my higher self whatever so your sankalpa doesn't have to be literal it's sometimes the non -literal ones the more symbolic ones are even more powerful because think of a friend you have a a private joke with where you know if i say uh you know some certain things to my friend only he knows what that means you know you know blue bananas and that means oh this joke we have from childhood so there's like a shared communication there So sometimes making your sankalpas quite abstract can actually be helpful. So I really like this about limited perceptions. And he has this idea of shedding skin. And I thought the symbolism of that, you know, the dreamer is going to love that stuff. The language of the dreamer is not your mother tongue. The language of the dreamer is way before you were born in the country of your birth. The language of the dreamer is symbols. So working with symbols like this, he has this idea of Cedric was going to go in the dream and his skin's going to fall off like a snake, shedding skin. That's going to have a very powerful effect on the unconscious mind. You know, you could go in the lucid dream and say, I am shedding my skin. I want to shed my skin. That's using words. That's going to work, but maybe not as deeply as actually going to the lucid dream and literally peeling off your skin. Because the symbolic resonance of that. action you know the power of those symbols is going to have a really profound effect on the unconscious mind um so cedric i know you're not on the call now but well done this is a brilliant dream plan and some really nice examples there too thank you fantastic thank you charlie wonderful and thank you drive for submitting all those dream plans you're going to get opportunities over the next couple of weeks to submit more things and we'll we'll do a similar thing throughout his course he's got some other action items and homework for you to do so that'll be exciting for you to submit and bring it and bring you on the call as well next up we're going to ask a couple of you to come on and just share your experience how you've experienced the quest in the last week so if you'd like to share something um and this is just to share either your wins or your challenges for the week uh you can write in the chat i've got something to share and i will bring on one or two of you before we get into questions all right yeah so maybe ezra if we can have like someone sharing uh someone who's had a lucid dream and then also someone who's working with a challenge and we can kind of get a nice balance great great so uh yes i've had a lucid dream okay lisa lisa i'm gonna make you an attendee or a panelist you can turn on your microphone and your camera welcome to the call hi there Hey, it's Lisa from Instagram. Hi, I'm the girl from the Instagram. Charlie, how are you? I'm great. I've had so many new friends through Instagram. Every day I'm getting messages on Instagram. I had a recent dream, this happened, that happened. Yeah, yeah, yeah. That's true. That's true. So should I share it now? Thank you very much. I'm here to inspire all the dreamers. I was in beta test actually last month. with charlie and uh mind valley by following my intuition i took the that that quest so my my full lucid dream happened on the 34th day it's my chart it's charlie's uh charlie's gift to me march tree so i had fully lucid dream it was incredible because after my totem is was like this so it worked but i i had i experienced all the benefits charlie and i had one bonus is uh The last part is to call my cousin who has passed away after my birthday. I'm sorry. I'm a bit emotional because this happened just last March 4. So I think the best thing that the biggest breakaway moments that I had with Charlie is the thing that we can do. What I did in my... Fully lucid dream is I was able to call my path, the career path that I'm heading to. And my dreamer showed me just simply said, Helen Keller. That's me, Helen Keller. I was with my childhood friend and he shouted, Helen Keller. I told her when I see what we're walking, that first lucid dream, I was with my two daughters flying with me. And I said, uh -oh. um let's go fly all together and then when i was like and i said i was like oh wait a minute i'm dreaming i said and i said reality check And then I pulled up my, and when I stressed, I said, hold on, hold on, hold on. I'm being lucid dreaming. Charlie said to cool down, breathe, okay, breathe. And I told to my daughter, I said, oh, okay, mama, in French, because I'm here in France. Mama needs to see her career paths. I go and fly. And then all of a sudden, I meet a European woman. She was standing like. like so so solemn so her face is so cool and um i said that um um are you gonna show me something are you gonna tell me something and i said she just simply said hell in color so so i said to my my um my childhood friend to to to keep that hell in color We mustn't forget that who is Helen Keller. So I wrote it somewhere when I opened my eyes after the several things that I've experienced in my first lucid dream. So I wrote it somewhere. And then the tragic news came from the Philippines. My cousin the following day passed away. So I called all the dreamers, Mindvalley Philippines dreamers, and all in a dream circle that we did to send my cousin. in my dream because i wasn't able to say goodbye to her she's my closest cousin so i think we made it i had it with my during the hypnagogic state so i had her she just simply hold my shoulder on my right arm we didn't say anything we didn't talk but i saw her face very solemn and i took her hand and i just simply kiss it and the following day i feel super super relieved that i was able to say goodbye to her without talk but i know she's very happy wherever she is now And then I will continue with Helen Keller. So I was really so excited to see that I have this newly company put up since I joined Mindvalley. My transformation growth is really good. So while I'm waiting for the niche, what I can do, your lucid dream experience, Charlie, gave me a really great help to go on with my career. anybody who has a google i i was talking to my daughter she was because she tried to say her dream was already at six so it's a it's a morning routine so we talked about what she had dream about and then i said hey hey hey it's i think march five six march six i i google who's helen keller so she's my archetype charlie so i know what to do now with with let's sharpen together that's that's the company that's the enterprise i'm putting up to so the team is excited to go wherever we want to go um i think i'm gonna end up with that i just like to to to say to everybody who's listening all the dreamers all around the world thank you thank you so much but but don't the in 34 days i experienced the nine plus one it's ten but please just when I when I did and when I see it in my email it was just like I felt like what is lucid dreaming you know I accepted it and I said that I was like a baby and excited like what the Charlie's saying determination and enthusiasm is really really important so that's what I just did so on the first day I immediately recall the dream. So I just like to send all my best regards and I send all the wish you all. to experience the lucid dream that that i have experienced with charlie i will see you charlie on the 22 of march i guess with your wife jade with the astral yeah and in april i think i'm gonna really go deep deeper with the ptsd one of the great great i have close three of my ptsd in during non -lucid and lucid dream so i feel better now too The reason why I like is I'm helping two groups with mental illness in the Philippines. And I see the biggest one of the aha moments is the power of our brain blocks, like what Charles is saying, block all those traumatic experiences. But when I see them, those people I'm helping, they really cannot recall what was happening in the past. And what I did with one of the traumatic... experience i had in the past i was able to close it within just 30 days so i think this is going to be a big thing in the future five ten years from now i hope so but so so that i can i'll bring back it to you so i hope that my experience lucid dreaming experience inspires everybody keep on lucid dreaming and all i see you all in my dreams charlie i'll see you soon thank you so much Not only the fact that she got this name. right, in the lucid dream and then Googles it. If you ever get a name like that in a lucid dream or, you know, a specific thing, always Google it. Because you have amazing things and your dreamer, your unconscious mind sees so much more than the conscious mind. So sometimes it has an idea and it knows the certain person or the certain company or the certain country that will help you on your path. And it chooses that and gives it to you. So, so cool that she Googled and Helen Keller exists and is a real person to help on her career path. And of course, that beautiful moment of meeting her loved one who'd recently passed away. You know, that's really beautiful. And people often ask, If you meet a dead loved one in a lucid dream, is it really them or is it just a projection of them? Who can really tell? Who can really tell? But what we can tell is the level of healing. And I believe that we can have just as a profound healing saying what needs to be said to the dead loved one or embracing or showing love to the dead loved one who is a projection of our mind just as much as if we have a profound healing and it's actually them. who've come into our dream so it doesn't really matter what matters is the level of healing and i've seen just as profound level of healing where someone's thought it probably was just a projection of them as when other people have said no i think it was actually them that's brilliant thank you so much awesome thank you charlie i think we'll break into q a now so we can get to the call so i'm gonna bring on sebastian for his most upvoted question. Sebastian, you're coming on the call now. You can turn on your camera and your microphone, and you can ask the call that you put into the Q &A box. Hi, Sebastian. Hi, sorry. I had to reconnect apparently to become a panelist. And now my question is gone as well. Very cool. So I think I am asked multiple questions, but I think the most... voted one was about dream recall so i've been struggling a bit with dream recall and sometimes i don't remember dreaming at all some nights i remember very vivid dreams and sometimes i have sort of fragments of dreams that i can recall and i've tried to connecting with the dreamer as you've said and this was actually very interesting because i've done that in another meditation sort of intuitively one or two days prior and it was a really cool guy to meet and he was also really enthusiastic and we talked about what i want to dream about and so on and i can see that just had an effect because these themes really appear in my dreams but i cannot really touch the memories of that i cannot recall that so my question is is there anything beyond what we've already covered that i can do to promote dream recall I mean, the short answer is if there was, I would have put it in the quest. You know, I put all the tips I have there. However, what I can do is work with you personally to see if there's something we can add here. So the first thing I'd ask you is how long have you been writing down your dreams for? Well, mostly, well, since the beginning of the quest, more or less. Okay, cool. So before the quest, you weren't keeping a dream diary? No. Okay. um since you've begun the quest have you seen um have you been able to write in the dream diary every morning or is it has it been fluctuating so i think like four or five out of seven days oh okay um to be honest dude you're doing pretty well like if you've gone from not keeping a dream diary at all and you're already hitting four or five days i think you're doing pretty well um but as far as you know some tips that we can share here um dreams happen mainly in the second half of the night, and especially in the last two hours of your sleep cycle. So what they've shown is if you increase your sleep time by two extra hours, you increase your chances of not only having a lucid dream, doubled, 50 % increase in having a lucid dream by spending two extra hours in bed. I mean, that's the best reason to have a lie -in I've ever heard. But also a big increase, even higher increase in vividly recalled dreams. So a very simple thing you can do is extend your sleep time. Now, of course, that's easier said than done. You might say, dude, I've got to wake up for work or I've got kids or whatever it is. But they found if you can extend your sleep time by even just half an hour, that extra half an hour you extend will be pure dreaming. You're not going to go into deep sleep. You're not going to be in light sleep because you already had that as long as it's over the seven to eight hour mark. if you if you kind of keep sleeping after that it's just going to be pure dreams so you could try extending your sleep period to get more dreams i mean just this morning actually um again i knew that i i didn't have to wake up for any work today apart from this call so my alarm went whenever it went and um i woke up and i didn't have any dream recall and i thought I'll just give myself an extra half an hour. I know I did a lot of stuff yesterday. I want to process this. I want to know what's going on. So I just hit the snooze button for another half an hour and dropped back into dream, had a really vividly recalled dream and was able to write it down. So sometimes it's as simple as that, just extending the dream time. The other thing you can do is, again, I'm not advising this for everyone, but if you wake yourself from a REM period, most people remember dreaming. So when they do scientific studies on dreaming, the basic methodology they use in the sleep laboratories is they've got the brain scanner on someone. And when they notice that they're dreaming, they let them dream for like five minutes. Then they just wake them up. They just kind of nudge them because they know if you wake someone from a dream, it's really fresh, the memory. Memory is really fresh. So what you can do is later on in the quest, there's something called multiple wake ups technique, which isn't for everyone. But some people really dig it. It's where you wake yourself like four or five times a night at very specific times. So you don't you're not really tired the next day. You do very specific times. And that's a way to kind of maximize dreams. You're basically waking yourself after every dream period as a way to remember. But it sounds, dude, I mean, if you only started keeping a dream diary a week ago, I think you're doing great. I mean, it's also brilliant that you want to know how to recall even more, but it could be just a thing of time. You know, when I run, when I used to run like a seven week course, where I just see people once a week for kind of seven weeks straight, the first week, all we do is dream recall. That's the only technique. Week two, then we just start doing dream signs. Week three is reality checks, stuff like that. It's a similar setup to what we've got in the quest. But of course, the quest, we're here every day. There's something to do every single day. But for the first week, I think you're doing great. And yeah, I think just dream recall will come. Just like building a muscle. You know, the more you lift, the heavier weights, the bigger the muscles get. And then there'll come a time where you can wake up once in the morning. So the alarm clock goes once, you know, eight o 'clock in the morning, the alarm clock goes off. And you can remember not only the last dream you had, but you can remember five different dreams with a sense of time. So you go, oh, this is the dream I just had. Oh, and then I was obviously asleep. Oh, then there was this other dream before that. And then, oh, I must have been in deep sleep. I can't remember anything. Oh, there was another dream before that. You can have perfect dream recall. It is totally possible. Just like... can do 200 press -ups in one go. That's totally possible. I can't do it, but if I train press -ups all the time, maybe I could. The same with Dream Recall. So I think you're doing great. Sounds awesome. I'm really looking forward to that. So thank you very much. Thank you. I love your background too, Sebastian. Very dreamy. Thank you. Hey, Sebastian, you've got the second highest upvoted question too, so you can ask that one as well. yeah so one night i was sort of interrupted in a dream actually and that's i guess why i remembered it quite well and i wanted to go back into the dream and i could sort of get like into a meditative state so sort of like a visualization but not really a dream and i could could continue the dream and also influence it and shape it but it was like looking through through an hourglass so it was not really i wasn't in there i was just controlling that so is there any tip of continuing a dream or dropping back into a dream yeah i mean it's it sounds like kind of what you spoke about if let's say i've been dreaming about you know little waffles who's there with a chew she might pop up later um if i'm dreaming about her and then i wake up, I need to pee or something. I drop back and I think, I was really enjoying that dream about my puppy. I really want to go back and continue that dream. What I could do is enter the hypnagogic and then essentially visualize the last scene of the dream. as if i've kind of if it's a dvd player i've rewound the dvd one scene back and then i'm replaying that scene in my mind and then allow myself to kind of fall into sleep into that scene now if you can get the timing right on that you can sometimes drop in at the point just when the dream kind of that scene ends and then the dream We'll just continue the dream like that, which sounds kind of like what you were doing where you said you dropped to sleep and kind of meditative awareness. It was like you were looking through an hourglass. It led to a witnessing dream. And also it's half of a technique called mild, M -I -L -D, which is a very famous lucid dreaming technique. I actually didn't put it in the quest just because it's so well known. You can find mild technique anywhere, but that's worth checking out. Similar to that, but it drops you back into a lucid dream. Okay, cool. So I'll try the rewinding next time. That sounds really good. Yeah, the rewind technique. We'll call it that. Cool. Thanks. All right. Yep. So our next question is going to be Stella. Let's see. Stella, I'm promoting you to a panelist. You can turn on your camera and your microphone. And your question is about details and diaries. Hi, Stella. Oh, I can see her profile, but can't hear me. Hi, can you hear me? Yes. I'm really sorry, but I can't put my camera on. That's okay. Okay, go ahead. Thanks for taking my question. What it was, was that I'm recalling five or six dreams a night, but they're really lengthy, and I just don't know how much detail I should be recording. Because to be honest, it took me about 40 minutes this morning. So I don't want to shortcut the process, but how much do we need to put in? Great question. I would suggest, think about reviewing a film. So let's say you go to the cinema, let's say lockdown is finished and you're able to go to the cinema and you watch a two hour movie. Then the next day your friend says, so how was that movie last night? now you're not going to tell them every scene from every bit of the two -hour movie but you'll give them the kind of rough outline oh well the movie's about this and the main character is this oh there was this brilliant scene where this happened and although the movie seemed to be about that the kind of subplot of the movie i think was actually about this you know it's kind of that it's about like reviewing a film um so i tried to make it clear in the question you don't need to spend more than five or ten minutes writing down your dreams in the morning you can if you want to spend half an hour writing your dreams don't let me stop you but it sounds at the moment that it's kind of becoming a little bit tiring for you so maybe even set an alarm You know, when I run the sleepover retreats, I have like an alarm set. It's like six minutes maximum people have to write down their dreams in the middle of the night when we're doing the wake ups and stuff. And if they need more time, they can use a head torch and stuff. But I try and get people into the habit of seeing if you can sum up the dream in that five minutes. It's quite a good kind of habit to get into. So, yeah, I think just limit yourself. If it's taking you half an hour to write up the dreams, maybe just give yourself 10 minutes. And maybe that means that you can't write down everything. bit of every dream but at least you can put down the kind of main points of the dreams that'll be enough i think so because there's definitely um reoccurring themes so is the theme more important than the actual minute by or second by second events the most important things really for lucid dreaming are the dream signs um the reason Pretty much the main reason we keep a dream diary for lucid dreaming is to spot our dream signs. In this course, I think on this week actually coming up, you have dream decoding, where I show you a technique to decode meaning from the dream. That's not actually a lucid dreaming technique. I just put it in there because people love it. They love to know the meaning of their dreams. But actually for lucid dreaming, the main reason we're writing down the dreams is spotting our dream signs, seeing those patterns of weird things that could help us indicate when we're dreaming and when we're not dreaming. If you've got limited time, I'd say focus on the dream signs. Focus on the weird aspects of the dreams, any bits that are recurring, any bits which could definitely indicate that you're dreaming. Make them the key focus. Okay, brilliant. Thank you very much. Cool. Thanks, Stella. Thank you, Stella. All right, Charlie, we have time for one more question. Okay. I'm going to bring on Yong. Yongkan Chan. Hopefully I didn't butcher your name. Yongkan, you are now a panelist. Okay. Hello, Yongkan. Hi Charlie. Hey man, how are you? I'm great. Okay, my question is about, okay, what's my question? Okay, my question is about when I realized I'm lucid. Then I get too excited and I woke up from my dream. There was one time even like when I was like, I was conscious of that I'm dreaming, but my body is itching. So I was thinking, should I scratch my body or should I continue in the dream? I have a dilemma. I don't know what to do. Then I woke up and scratch. Then I woke up from the dream. Then I can't stay lucid. So it's there. Any way to stay lucid. Sure. So let me work backwards on this. I'll do the last part of your question first. So if you are having a lucid dream, and especially if you're having an out -of -body experience, as my ex -wife Jade Shaw will teach you in the next quest, if you think about your body, boom, you're back. You're sucked back to the physical world. Astral projection, if you even think about your finger, boom, you're back in the body. Lucid dreaming, it's not quite that strong. But yeah, in that case, if you had an itch in the body, you've just got to try and think, I'm not going to scratch the itch. I'm just going to concentrate on the lucid dream. The main bit of your question about... What do we do if we get so excited in the lucid dream we wake up? Okay, first of all, if you're having a lucid dream, it's totally natural to be excited. And we want to keep that excitement. You know, we don't want to be kind of, oh, yeah, I'm lucid. Wow, I'm lucid. I'm inside my mind. This is an amazing spiritual experience. So we want to stay excited, but we also need to stay calm. So what I always say is however you would keep yourself calm in the daytime, do that in the lucid dream time. So for me, as you can see, I'm a chatterbox. I speak a lot. So I'm very word orientated. So if I get lucid tonight and I'm feeling really excited in the lucid dream, I will talk to myself. OK, calm down, Charlie. Come on. You know this space. Just a lucid dream. Stay cool. Stay calm. Breathe. Other people might go straight into breath. I'm lucid. I'm lucid. Other people find body awareness works with them. So as soon as they're lucid, if they feel that they're kind of getting too excited, they'll sometimes like touch the ground or they'll touch their body. Oh, there's the puppy. You know, they'll touch their body. They'll kind of go, oh, this is where I am in the dream. So you notice they're touching their dream body, not thinking about their waking body. Now, this is a Tibetan Buddhist technique. It says if you feel that you're waking from a recognized dream, which is what the Buddhists call lucid dreaming, from a recognized dream, bring all your focus to the dream body, to your kind of body in the lucid dream. So touch it, rub your hands together, you know, slap your face, stuff like that. Because then rather than your awareness, identifying with the body that's asleep, your real body, your real body, your physical body, you identify with your dream body. And that will keep you in the lucid dream. So yeah, keep yourself calm with breathing, with words, with touching the body, you know, self -soothing. Whatever you'll do to keep yourself calm in the waking state, basically do that in the dream state. I do believe we have a whole day on that in the quest though. Let me just check. Yeah, day 27, lucidity stabilization techniques. We've got a whole day where I probably tell all those techniques I just said. But yeah, so that's coming off on day 27. Okay, thank you very much, Charlie. Thanks, man. Lovely to meet you. Thank you, Elking. All right. So we're going to wrap up here, guys. I know we have 99 questions in the Q &A box. Do not worry. We are going to have four more calls where you can come on live and ask your questions. But I also want to remind you, if you have questions, bring them into the tribe. There's lots of students in the tribe that might have the answers, as well as are very talented and passionate ambassadors for this quest. So if you have any questions, go into the tribe, start a discussion, ask questions. They're creating dream circles as well. So you guys can dream together and join together. It's a lot of great time in the tribe. So before we tune out, Charlie, do you have any closing words that you'd like to share with the tribe for the next week? Just that the fact you've even made this, that you've even made it at the end of week one is brilliant. 99 .9 % of the world's population do not know how to lucid dream. Maybe, God, maybe 60 or 70 % don't even know what lucid dreaming is. So the fact that you are here. doing this quest you've made it to day nine you so many of you already had lucid dreams and even more of you have started remembering more dreams noticing your dream signs is so good joyce the fact you're here i'm so happy please come to the next call enjoy week two so week two again we're still making the cake we're starting to mix the ingredients the end of week two into week three we start cooking We're really fucking week four and the last two days and like week five, we get really far out. So this is a gradual process. So take it slow, stay relaxed. And most importantly, have fun, you know, determination and enthusiasm. I could have easily used the word fun rather than enthusiasm. Those are the two most important parts of your lucid dream journey. So thank you so much. I just put something in the chat. I've got a talk coming up this Sunday. You can go to my website and find out. talks and workshops that are coming up um but yeah i hope to see you all at the next um live webinar and until then i'll see you on the quest i'm doing it along with you i'm doing all the techniques as we go along and it's working for me so i hope it's working for you.

Week 2: Interpreting Your Dreams

====================

LESSON 8 – Recognize Your Dream Signs
--------------------
<v ->Yes, yes dreamers, welcome to day eight,</v> and our second week of the Quest. This week is all about making friends with sleep and dreams. So we'll be learning all the science around how we sleep, the different sleep stages and how we can harness our sleep cycle to help us become lucid. But first of all, let's make friends with one of the most common features of our dreams, dream signs. If I blindfolded you and took you into a bakery, I reckon you'd still be able to tell me where you were, right? Although you couldn't see the bakery, its smells, sounds and atmosphere would be enough to indicate your whereabouts. You smelled the aromas of a bakery and experienced this atmosphere so many times, that you're able to recognize one even through a blindfold. In the same way, we can come to recognize the dream state even when blindfolded by non-lucidity. How, by getting to know its unique sights, sounds and atmosphere. This forms the basis of spotting dream signs. A dream sign is any improbable, impossible or bizarre aspect of the dream experience that can be used to indicate that we are dreaming. One of the most important reasons for keeping a dream diary is to write down, recognize and acknowledge our personal dream signs. Once you know your dream signs, you're one step closer to lucidity. There are three main types of dream sign. The first one is called anomalous. This is kind of the crazy stuff you have in dreams all the time. Talking dogs, Ninja babies, dead grandma's, crazy, anomalous, one-off dream scenarios. The second type is thematic. This is where the dream itself may not be full of Ninja babies and talking animals, but the theme of the dream is what's weird. Maybe you're dreaming you're back at school when you're an adult or you're in your childhood home when you haven't lived there for 20 years. The theme of the dream is what can indicate to you that you are dreaming. And the third type is recurring. A recurring dream sign is any dream sign that's appeared multiple times, maybe even on a weekly basis. If you've got some recurring dream signs, you have a recurring opportunity for becoming lucid. So how to dream signs work? You wake up and you write down your dreams. Then you go back through the dream, checking for dream signs. Then, by acknowledging our particular dream signs in the waking state, you naturally create a lucidity trigger, Ninja babies are my dream signs, So Ninja babies equal I'm dreaming or being back at school is one of my dream signs, so being back at school equals dreaming. Those lucidity triggers will be activated. The next time you see that dream sign in your dreams, thus triggering lucidity. Every time we recognize a dream sign in the waking state, we create a critical reflective habit of mind and it's that habit that leads to lucid dreams. So even if you don't have any recurring dream signs, don't worry because every time you take the time to recognize a dream sign, you engage the habit of critical reflection. And it is that habit that becomes activated within the dream, thus leading to lucidity. Let's do an exercise to help demonstrate how we can spot our dream signs. I want you to see how many anomalous, thematic and recurring dream signs you can spot in the following dream. Let's say I have a dream that I'm walking down the street in London with my dog, Waffles. I wake up, I write down the dream and I look for dream signs, what are they? Well, I do live in London. I do have a dog called Waffles and I do often walk down the street with her. So in this particular dream, there were no dream signs. There was nothing in the dream that could indicate that I was dreaming. Not every single dream has dream signs. Although most do if you look closely enough. Let's say for example, the next night I have another dream. In this dream, I'm walking down the street in London with my dog Waffles, and at the end of the street I see Kanye West standing next to a blue dragon. I wake up, I write down the dream, and I look to see, where are the dream signs, what are they? Well, I do live in London. I do have a dog called Waffles, and I do often walk down the street with her, but I don't know Kanye West yet. So Kanye would be an anomalous dream sign. And of course the blue dragon would be an anomalous dream sign too. Just by recognizing and acknowledging those dream signs, Kanye West and the blue dragon, I have helped to strengthen a critical reflective habit of mind. And it is that habit that flows into your dreams and helps you get lucid. Now, I want you to imagine that Kim Kardashian has that same dream. She dreams that she is walking down the street in London with Waffles the wiener dog. And at the end of the street, she sees Kanye West standing next to a blue dragon. She wakes up, writes down her dream and looks for the dream signs. Let's help Kim out here, what are her dream signs? Yeah, the first one is Waffles. She's never met Waffles, so Waffles is an anomalous dream sign for her. The next one is being in London, a city in which she does not live, so that's a thematic dream sign for her. And finally, Kanye standing next to the blue dragon. Kanye is not a dream sign for her 'cause she sees him every day in her real life. But of course the blue dragon still is an anomalous dream sign, or maybe a recurring dream sign. If she dreams are blue dragons on the regular. So you get it right? Once you pinpointed your dream signs, you make a determined effort to be on the lookout for them in the future. This effort will permeate into your dreams and eventually you'll start recognizing dream signs while you're dreaming, and that's how you become lucid. In fact, it's the most common form of lucid dream to be in a dream, you see a dream sign, go what, that's crazy. I must be dreaming. It's called a dream sign initiated lucid dream. If you've got any recurring dream signs, that's really great because that means it's a recurring opportunity to get lucid, but don't forget, simply by recognizing and acknowledging any dream sign from any dream, we strengthen this critical, reflective habit of mind, and that's the main reason we get lucid. Now you may think, well, I've been having crazy dreams full of dreams signs for years and I haven't been getting lucid. Yeah, naturally, because although your dreams have been full of dream signs, you haven't been recognizing and acknowledging them each morning, right? And so you haven't been strengthening that critical reflective attitude. Once you start doing that, then lucidity's going to start coming. There are no universal dream signs, wherever the books tell you, even the classic being naked in public dream. Well for most of us, it would be a dream sign, right? But for 3.7 million British people who described themselves as practicing nudists, their dream would be the opposite. It would be wearing clothes in public in their dreams. Oh my God, I'm fully clothed, I'm so embarrassed. 3.7 million, who knew? We seem so reserved, the queen must be appalled darling. And now your actions for today, from now on, after you write down your dreams in your dream diary, read through them again and reflect on your dream signs. Each time you recognize one, take note of the dream sign, either simply in your mind or by making a little DS next to it. So you can see dream sign, dream sign, dream sign, dream sign. Once you started doing this, I want you to share your current dream signs with the tribe. Have you got any recurring ones? What's the craziest dream sign you've ever had. Of course, continue falling asleep doing your dream recall affirmation as per usual and keep up the dream diary every morning. Recognizing dream signs is not only an important lucid dreaming practice, but it's also a really fun one because you can start to see how the frequency of your dream signs increase as you progress with your lucid dream training. In fact, some of you may find that tonight, you start having really crazy dreams full of dream signs. That's a really good indicator because it shows that your dreamer really wants you to become lucid. Send in Kanye West riding a blue dragon, that should do it. It's a good sign, so I hope that tonight, you all have dreams full of dream signs, and more importantly, that you recognize those dream signs and become lucid.

LESSON 9 – Seeing Through Illusion in Life & Dreams
--------------------
<v ->Good day dreamers.</v> Did you have any crazy dreams last night? I hope so. As we touched on yesterday, many of us have crazy dreams full of dream signs but still don't become lucid. Why? Because we dream as we live. If we live not looking closely, we will dream not looking closely and thus not spot our dream signs. Many of us have simply not trained our critical reflective habit of mind in the waking state. And so we dream in the same way. Today, we're going to train our dream sign muscles by looking at a series of images that seem upon first glance to be impossible and dreamlike. But if we look closely with a critical reflective eye, we will soon become lucid and go, "Aha, I see through the illusion." And seeing through the illusion is exactly what lucid dreaming is all about. Look at the following images and try and become lucid within them by seeing how the illusion is being created. For example, in this photo, I see the illusion of a male waiter with the legs of an unseen woman. That's the illusion. I look closely, critical, reflective. Ah, I become lucid and I see through the illusion. Ah, it's a mirrored area in front of the bar that is reflecting the legs of an unseen woman. Go through the same process with each of these images and see how many you can get right. We'll add up your score at the end. And you can see how good you were at seeing through the illusion in the waking state. Is that a really long cat? Look closely. See through the illusion. Aha! I'm lucid. There are two cats, one at each end of the tube. What! Does that bag have a pair of legs? See through the illusion. Aha! I'm lucid. The legs belong to the seated woman. Okay, so I see a river through that window. Look closer. See through the illusion. Aha! I'm lucid. That's a concrete wall, not a river. The curious case of Benjamin Button. Look closer. See through the illusion. Aha! I'm lucid. The baby is wearing the hat, but the nose and the chin belonged to it's dad. Hmm, I wonder, does that lady have tiny arms? Look closer and see through the illusion. Aha! I'm lucid. The arms belong to the baby. Oh no! Did that guy pee himself? See through the illusion. Aha! I'm lucid. It's the reflection on the glass of some of the chairs in front of him. Wait a minute. Who is wearing the white pants and the blue shirt? The man or the woman? See through the illusion. Aha! I'm lucid. The woman is wearing the white pants and the man is sitting in the chair. Look at the legs. Which pair of legs belong to which person? See through the illusion. Aha! I'm lucid. The man's shorts are both black and white while the woman's legs seem to be bare. Can you find the cat? Look really closely to see through the illusion. Aha! I'm lucid. Yeah, right there, sleeping near the top of the woodpile. Can you find the iPhone case? Look super closely to see through the illusion. Aha! I'm lucid. Yup, there it is. Just below the right table leg. This woman's legs are shiny. There must be oil or water on them, right? Look closer to see through the illusion. Aha! I'm lucid. The legs are dry. It's just lines of dried white paint that she has painted onto her legs. Do you notice anything strange about this wall? Look closely to see through the illusion. Aha! I'm lucid. There is a cigar sticking out of the wall. How did I miss that? And your actions for today. See how many of the dreamlike illusions you can recognize then share your illusion images score with the Tribe. Of course, keep up the 3 Ds; dream recall, dream diaries and dream signs. In the 1980s film, Karate Kid, Daniel's son wants to learn karate. But his teacher, Mr. Miyagi, keeps on getting him to paint fences and polish wax on the car bonnets. Then when Mr. Miyagi finally agrees to Daniel's requests, he throws a punch and Daniel blocks it with the now infamous wax on, wax off parry. I know that today's lesson might seem a little bit wax on, wax off Mr. Miyagi style, but I promise you that it all strengthens the exact same muscles that we need to become lucid in our dreams.

====================

LESSON 10 – 3 Steps to Manifesting Dream Signs
--------------------
<v ->Today, we will learn a technique</v> to help us manifest our dream signs into our dreams, as well as how lucid dreaming is about making friends with ourselves. Lucid dreaming is not about dream control. As I mentioned before, the central metaphor that I like to use is from my friend, the lucid dream author, Robert Waggoner. He says, "Just as no sailor controls the sea, so too does no lucid dreamer control the dream." Think of it like this, think how arrogant a sailor would be to say, "I'm controlling the sea." No sailor controls the sea. But a good sailor respects the sea so much, has so much knowledge about the sea, is so aware of the position of the coral reef, the sea monsters and how the stars affect the tides that they can sail as if they were in control. That's the attitude we need to have when working with our lucid dreams. We don't want to dominate, force, subjugate, control the dream, we want to make friends with it 'cause if you can make friends with your dreamer, you make a very powerful ally. And for those people who do think lucid dreaming is dream control, they've simply underestimated the power of what they're dealing with. If you think of the conscious and unconscious in that iceberg model where the top 10% above the surface is conscious and the bottom 90% beneath the surface is unconscious, then to think that your itsy bitsy 10% egoic consciousness could in any way control the awesome power of the 90% unconscious mind has completely underestimated the power of what you're dealing with. So you can't control the dream anyway but you can make friends with it. The reason that I push this idea of not controlling the dream so strongly is because I was introduced to this idea very strongly myself. Before I tell you the story, I need to drop in the concept of what I call the 1%. I believe that in a lucid dream, 99% of everything in the dream is you. It's a projection of your own psychology but I also believe there is a crucial 1% made up of archetypes of the collective unconscious, blood and bone ancestors, dead relatives and also perhaps the potential of enlightened beings, dream walkers to enter our dreams. But 99% is you. But there is that crucial 1%. When I first started teaching lucid dreaming, I was 25 and I felt pretty out of my depth. When my Buddhist teacher first authorized me to teach, I came up with this notion that I had to have full control over my dreams in order to be a good Buddhist lucid dreaming teacher. Of course, the more I tried to control my dreams, the more they fought back. In one of these dreams, I'd become lucid and I looked up at the sky and I used to be able to go freeze and I could pause the dream in mid-air like that. Then I could look to the sky and make one side of the dream go black and white and the other side of the dream stay color. It was just an ego trip. It was just trying to prove to myself look at this amazing control I can have over my lucid dreams. I'm playing God here. Just a complete ego trip. Now, one of those times where I'd frozen the dream and changed the color, suddenly, this Tibetan woman walks in. She was not young but not old either. Maybe mid-60s. Long hair down to the floor. She walked up to me and went, "Don't control the dream. We don't like it." I paused and in my arrogant looked at her and said, "What do you mean we don't like it? It's my dream." And then she tapped me on the shoulder, said, "Don't control it. We don't like it." Who the hell was we? The energy that she exuded and the fact that she was the only part of the dream that could still move when I'd frozen everything else makes me believe that she was something from the 1%. Perhaps the archetype of the wise woman come to tell this arrogant 25-year-old not to control his dreams. So ever since then, I made a pact. Anytime I do a course or workshop, I always tell people don't control the dream, make friends with it. In fact, your lucid dreams have been making friends with you ever since you're a kid because children naturally have lucid dreams. Not every child every single night but a Harvard study has shown that the majority of children aged between six and 16 report lucid dreams as part of their evolutionary development. So everybody watching this quest, you probably have had a lucid dream before. In fact, you probably had dozens, you just don't remember them. But something in you does. The archetype of the inner child. And that's why in this quest, we have so many of the techniques, which are quite childlike, quite playful because if we can tap into the power of the inner child, we can tap into our lucid dreaming potential. In fact, I encourage you to talk to your kids or any kids that you might know about lucid dreaming. And you'd be surprised how many know exactly what it is and say, "Yeah, I have those dreams sometimes. Now onto another exercise. Dream sign manifestation. As we've learnt before, once you pinpointed your dream signs, make a determined effort to be on the lookout for them in the future. This effort will then permeate into your dreams and eventually you'll start recognizing dream signs while you're dreaming and become lucid. But here is a way of speeding up that process. Rather than waiting for the dream signs to show up, intentionally manifest your dream signs into your dreams. This technique aims to intentionally manifest a particular dream sign into your dream, thus triggering lucidity. Here are the three steps to do so. Step one, choose the particular dream sign that you want to manifest. If you have a recurring one, use that. If not, just use one that feels particularly strong to you. Kanye West, for example. Step two, the next time you pass through that hypnotic hypnagogic state at night, recite the dream sign manifestation affirmation. For example, tonight I dream of Kanye. When I dream of Kanye, I know I'm dreaming. Tonight I dream of Kanye. When I dream of Kanye, I know I'm dreaming. Step three, repeat step two at least seven times with enthusiasm and determination before moving on to your dream recall affirmation. By doing this, essentially you are asking the dreamer send me the dream sign, let's me dream of my dead grandma, let me dream of being naked in public, let me dream of Kanye West. Knowing that to dream of your dream signs makes is much easier to get lucid and will in many cases set off that trigger and lead to a spontaneous lucid dream. And now your actions for today. Firstly, practice the Dream Sign Manifestation exercise. As you fall asleep through the hypnotic hypnagogic, be asking for your dream signs to come into your dreams. Secondly, if you have kids, or if you know any kids, I want you to talk to them about lucid dreaming and share your findings with the Tribe. Did your kids know what lucid dreaming was? Had they ever had one? Let the Tribe know. And finally, keep up the 3 Ds: dream recall, dream diaries and dream signs as per usual. And also, don't forget to keep sharing your dreams with the tribe in your quest dream circles. That's all for today, dreamers. Join me tomorrow when we explore the science of sleep and learn how to harness each stage of sleep to maximize lucidity. Sleep deeply and dream well.

====================

LESSON 11 – The 4 Stages of Sleep
--------------------
<v ->We sleep for a third of our lives.</v> That's about 30 years that most of us know nothing about. That's crazy, right? How can we leave the school system, in Europe at least, knowing nothing about a huge chunk of human existence? Dreamers, let's go back to school, night school. I want to take a look now at the scientific description of how we sleep. Modern day science breaks down sleep into four main stages. The hypnagogic state, light sleep, deep sleep, and dream. Let us look at each one in detail now. Stage one is called the hypnagogic state. Now this is a state we've looked at already because we've harnessed the hypnotic power of the hypnagogic state for some of our lucid dreaming techniques. But what are the qualities of the hypnagogic? In the hypnagogic you'll feel very drowsy, your eyes will be closed, the brain will go into deep Alpha and Theta, and you might start having the hypnagogic hallucinations. The little mini dreams, flashes, fades, faces, geometric patterns that enter the mind as we're drifting off to sleep. You might also have these things Do you ever get those when you're falling asleep? Myoclonic jerks. So myoclonic jerks are usually associated with a lower level of respiration, which is in turn usually associated with falling asleep quickly. Meaning that you could probably do with an extra couple of hours of sleep if you do have a lot of those jerks. The main thing is, that the hypnagogic state is the doorway into sleep. Every time you fall asleep, you have to pass through the hypnagogic. Stage two of sleep is called simply light sleep. And light sleep makes up the majority of the time we spend sleeping. It seems from the outset that not a lot happens in light sleep, but actually this is not true. In light sleep, you engage procedural memory learning. Whereas dreaming sleep is used for integration of our psychology, psychological learning, integration of trauma, working through our mind therapeutically, light sleep is used for learning procedurally. For example, if you're learning how to drive a car, it's in light sleep that your brain will be going over the steps of how to drive a car. It won't be like dreaming, it'll be more like thinking through a process. And if you wake someone from light sleep and say, what were you dreaming about? They'll often say, I wasn't really dreaming, I was kind of thinking about something. In fact, it is possible to be conscious within light sleep. Have you ever had the experience of listening to yourself snore? If you have, you are conscious listening and unconscious sleeping and snoring at the same time. Now, if that ever happens again and you're by yourself, stay in that state, listening to yourself snore because from a Buddhist point of view, you're engaging sleep meditation. But if there's someone lying next to you in bed, don't be antisocial, wake up and stop snoring. Then we have stage three. Stage three deep sleep is sometimes called Delta wave sleep because the dominant brainwave of deep sleep is Delta. If you look at the brain waves of the waking state and the dream state for that matter, they look like this. There's loads of activity, there's loads of stuff happening. But in deep sleep, your brain waves look like this. Very slow long amplitude brainwaves because your brain is almost entirely inactive. The brain never switches off completely, but sometimes it does go into standby mode. That's what happens in deep sleep. So in deep sleep, you're very unlikely to be dreaming, but the brain is doing a lot in that space. One of the first things that happens in deep sleep, is your blood capillaries start going big, small, big, small, big, small, which creates a flushing motion through the brain, which actually flushes through the cerebral fluid, helping to remove toxins from the brain. This is why if you miss a whole night's sleep, the next day you might have something called brain fog. Brain fog is the psychological manifestation of the physiological phenomenon of toxins not being flushed through the brain. Another thing that happens in deep sleep is that human growth hormone is released. It's in deep sleep that your hair grows, and your nails grow, that your muscles grow even. Let's say you've been pumping iron in the gym all day, if you don't get enough deep sleep that night, the changes to your muscles will be much, much less than if you had, because in deep sleep the human growth hormone is released. The same goes for people who are trying to diet as well. If during the day you've been reducing your calorific intake because you've been dieting, but that night you don't get enough deep sleep, you may lose weight due to the reduction in calories, but the long-term effect on your metabolism will not be engaged. So deep sleep is so important for flushing toxins through the brain, for helping our body grow, and for making changes to our body's metabolism. And then we have REM dreaming sleep, rapid eye movement dreaming sleep, so-called because the eyes start to move rapidly. The body goes into paralysis to stop you acting out your dreams, and the brain becomes highly active as it starts to create the amazing three dimensional hallucinations that are so realistic we believe they're real. Think about that for a minute, you believe your dreams are real until you wake up in the morning and go, oh, I was dreaming. That's how realistic dreams seem to the brain. The reason that we dream is still up for debate, but two things we know for sure, dreaming is about reconsolidation of memory, and about integration of trauma. If you stop somebody dreaming, their short-term memory gets skewed pretty quickly, and their ability to integrate trauma is removed too leading psychosis setting in very quickly. Dreaming is very, very important. And that's why the brain prioritizes it over other sleep stages although all stages of sleep are very important. And finally, we have the hypnopompic state. Whereas the hypnagogic state is the gateway into sleep, the hypnopompic state is the gateway out. If I wake you up during any stage of sleep, you have to pass through the hypnopompic before you wake up. Now, whereas most people are aware of the hypnagogic state, they're aware of that drowsy state as you're nodding off on the bus, or they're aware of that state as you're falling asleep, many people are not aware of the hypnopompic. And for many of them it's simply because they wake up so quickly. If you wake up with an alarm clock, you get boosted out of the dream state into the waking state without experiencing that transitional space, the hypnopompic. But have you ever woken up without an alarm clock? Maybe the bird song's woken you up, or the sound of your partner making breakfast and you stop dreaming, you wouldn't say you're still asleep, your eyes are still closed, you can feel your body in the bed? That space, that's the hypnopompic. From a Buddhist point of view, the hypnopompic state is said to be one of the most refined levels of human consciousness, and a place in which insights from our true spiritual nature can manifest spontaneously. So tomorrow morning don't wake up so quickly. Hit the snooze button, drop back into that hypnopompic space and explore the power of your own mind. When we first fall asleep at night, our journey into sleep might look something like this: we close our eyes and enter the hypnagogic. Maybe we're there for 10, 15 minutes. Then at a certain point, we black out and we enter light sleep. In the hypnagogic, we can hear sounds in the room, we can feel our body in the bed. But in light sleep, we're blacked out. We spend maybe 15, 20 minutes in light sleep. Then we drop down into deep sleep for a big chunk, 30 or 40 minutes of this deep brain cleansing sleep. Then the brain does a full 180, and goes from entirely switched off to fully switched on as we start to dream. That first dream period is short though. Only maybe like five or 10 minutes. Add all that up together and you get roughly a 90 to a 100-minute sleep cycle. That 90-minute cycle continues throughout the night. But what changes is the amount of time you spend in each stage. The first three cycles, so roughly the first four and a half hours of sleep, are mainly deep sleep with short dream periods. Then after that third cycle, after the first four and a half hours, it flips, and we start having much less deep sleep and these long extended periods of dreaming. This is why for lucid dreamers our main focus is on the second half of the night, and especially the last two hours when we go into full on long REM dreaming periods. That sleep cycle, hypnagogic, light sleep, deep sleep, dream, occurs when we first fall asleep at night. But if we were to have an afternoon nap and go to sleep in the middle of the day, we'd go straight from the hypnagogic into dream, direct access. So that means that napping is really good for lucid dreaming. So please, while you're on this quest, nap as much as you can, it might be in your daytime that you have some of your most powerful lucid dreams. While you can have lucid dreams in the first few hours of your sleep cycle, the dream periods will be short and your mind might still be quite groggy 'cause you haven't had much sleep yet. However, in the last few hours, you'll not only have longer dream periods, but you'll also have a fair few hours of sleep under your belt. So your mind will feel fresh and more ready to engage lucidity. Although the majority of people may sleep in the way we just described, you may not be part of that majority. So get to know how you sleep, not how everybody else sleeps. The main thing to remember is this, the first half of the night is mainly deep sleep with short periods of dream, the second half is mainly dreaming without much deep sleep. And now for your actions for today, I want you to see how many sleep stages you can be aware of tonight. For example, can you notice the hypnopompic state as you wake up in the morning or in the middle of the night? Can you listen to yourself snoring while being aware of light sleep? And of course, can you be aware of REM dreaming sleep and become lucid? I'd like you to share with the tribe, how many sleep stages you are able to be aware of? And of course, keep up the 3D's and the dream sign manifestation technique. We're going to have loads more lucid dreaming techniques coming up, but for now we need to keep strengthening the foundation of those habits. Also, don't forget to check in with your tribe dream circles. So I hope that filled the educational gap that school left behind, and that simply by being aware of how sleep works, you're not only better equipped to know when to focus your lucid dream training, but also better equipped to make the most out of every stage of sleep because each one is vital to our health and wellbeing. Talking of health and wellbeing, tomorrow we will be learning another technique that is not only great for lucid dreaming, but also great for our bodies and brains too, the deep relaxation of hypnagogic mindfulness. Enjoy your dreams. See you tomorrow.

====================

LESSON 12 – Meeting the Gatekeeper of the Hypnagogic State
--------------------
<v ->Yesterday, we looked at all the different stages of sleep.</v> Today, we'll be focusing on just one, the hypnagogic state. A state of mind so trippy and hallucinatory that it has been revered for thousands of years as the gatekeeper of the unconscious. The hypnagogic state is the doorway into shamanic journeying, hypnotic trance, yoga nidra, and of course, lucid dreaming. So, let's learn how it works and crucially how to access it. As we discussed earlier, the hypnagogic state is the transitional state of mind that lies between wakefulness and sleep. It's the dozy in-between state often characterized by hypnagogic imagery, the visual or often conceptual displays that flash and fade before our mind's eye as we drift off to sleep. These hypnagogic images are made up of the memories of the day, mental preoccupations and for some people, a whole load of crazy shapes, colors and faces. I imagine these eccentric displays of the mind as a bit like the flashes of color that you see during the final moments of a sunset. And just like those final moments, they offer us a rare glimpse into our own inner light. We're going to learn something called Hypnagogic mindfulness. Mindfulness meditation can be defined as knowing what's happening as it's happening. So, hypnagogic mindfulness techniques are about knowing what is happening as it's happening while we're dozing off to sleep. There are two main benefits of this technique. One, is that it teaches us to be able to stay in the hypnagogic consciously for extended periods of time. As you've seen already with the dream recall technique, and as you'll see later in the quest, so many lucid dreaming techniques require that you have the ability to rest consciously in the hypnagogic state. For long enough to do your 21 affirmations or to set your intention to have a lucid dream. The second is that it's a really good way to learn how to fall asleep because every time you enter the hypnagogic intentionally, but then pull back before you fall into sleep, you strengthen the neural pathway that allows you to find the gateway into sleep. Once you become familiar with that gateway, the possibility of falling asleep at will begins to open up to you. We pass through the hypnagogic state every time we fall asleep, which means that we have a daily opportunity to engage it with awareness and even engage mindfully, the sleep that it leads us into. It's a state of huge potential, but how can we spend more time in it than the usual 10 or so minutes that it usually takes us to fall asleep? We must learn how to harness the power of hypnagogic mindfulness. This technique is about learning to rest on the drowsy boundary of sleep. This practice can be done at night as a precursor to sleep. So I'd like you to listen to the following audio track guided meditation as you fall asleep tonight. But, it can also be practiced in the day as an alternative to the afternoon nap. And you might find that this technique refreshes your mind even more effectively than napping. So, plump up your pillow and enjoy the hypnagogic. And now for your actions for today. Firstly, practice hypnagogic mindfulness either in the daytime or as you fall asleep tonight. Number two, keep up the 3 Ds and the dream sign manifestation technique. Number three, try the dream sign manifestation exercise again, even if you haven't already. In week three, you will very quickly see that a lot of lucid dreaming techniques are based on being able to rest consciously in the hypnagogic state without blacking out. And so the hypnagogic mindfulness technique is the cornerstone of our practice. If you black out, as soon as your head hits the pillow, there are still some techniques that will work for you. But, if you could learn to rest in the hypnagogic without blacking out, you can maximize your use of all the lucid dreaming techniques. See you tomorrow when we will learn a technique to help us decode our own dreams. Until then, sleep well.

====================

LESSON 12 – Meditation: Hypnagogic mindfulness meditation

- This technique is about learning to rest on the drowsy boundary of sleep. This practice can be done at night as a precursor to sleep, or it can be done during the day as an alternative to an afternoon nap. Lie down on your back with a pillow under your head, and one under your knees if you like. Close your eyes and adjust your body so that you are totally comfortable. There's no rush. Become aware of your breathing and then proceed to settle your mind through a light regulation of the breath. Breathing in for a count of three or four, and breathing out for a count of three or four. Breathing in for a count of three or four, and breathing out for a count of three or four. Continue at your own pace for the next couple of minutes. Now ground yourself and your body by scanning your awareness from the tips of your toes to the crown of your head, relaxing deeply as you go, I will guide you through the body scan. Bring your awareness into your feet. See if you can place your mind into your feet. Feel deeply into each one of your toes, into the sole of your foot, the heel, the arch, and the top feel deeply into your feet. With awareness comes relaxation. Allow your feet to relax deeply. And now allow your awareness to flow up through your lower legs, your ankles, calf, muscles, shins, all the way up to the level of your kneecaps. Allow your awareness to flow up through your knees, upper legs, thighs, inner thighs, buttocks, groin area. You're now aware from the tips of your toes to the level of your hips. And with awareness comes relaxation. Allow yourself to release any tension from the tips of your toes to the level of your hips. And now allow your awareness to spread up through your waist, naval area. Kidneys. Allow your awareness to spread up through the sides of your body, your abdominals, your lower back awareness, spreading up through the lower rib cage, middle back, lower chest. Allow your awareness to flow up still all the way up to the level of your armpits. You're now aware from the tips of your toes to the level of your armpits. And with awareness comes relaxation. Relax deeply. And now we move our attention to our hands. Feel in to each one of your fingers and thumbs into the palm of your hand, the back of your hand. Release any tension that you might be holding in your hands. Allow your awareness to spread up through your wrists, forearms, elbows through your biceps, triceps, shoulders, and shoulder blades. Allow your awareness to flow up through the front of your chest, your upper back, meeting, that point of awareness at the level of your armpits and sweeping round to the base of your neck. You are now aware from the tips of your toes to the base of your neck. And with awareness comes relaxation. Relax deeply. And now allow your awareness to continue moving up through your throat, sides of the neck, back of the neck, up into your face, cheekbones, eye sockets, mouth, nose, forehead, your ears, the back of your head, top of your head, forehead, crown of your head. You are now mindfully aware from the tips of your toes to the crown of your head. And with awareness comes relaxation. Your entire body is deeply relaxed. And now allow your awareness to zoom out so that your aware of your entire body as it lies or sits in space, allow yourself to rest in the awareness of your bodily sensations. Rest in this state for the next minute or so. And now I want you to bring your attention to the point between your eyebrows. Allow your attention to gather at this point between your eyebrows, direct any and all of your attention to this point between your eyebrows. If you like, you can imagine a ball of white light at this point between your eyebrows or perhaps just imagine a bright, full white moon. Imagine a bright white full moon at the point between your eyebrows. Allow your awareness to gather into this point between your eyebrows and now prepare to drop any regulation of the breathing, any movement of awareness around your body, and any visualization of the ball of white light. Now, I want you to rest, release your attention and rest nowhere to go, nothing to do resting. Allow yourself to slip into the deep relaxation of the hypnogogic state. Allow yourself to relax deeply into the support of the hypnogogic state. Relax deeply in the hypnogogic for the next couple of minutes. If you feel yourself slipping off into unconscious sleep, bring your awareness back to the feeling of your body, the feeling of your breath, the sounds in the room, or the sound of this track. Relax deeply into the hypnogogic, maintaining fully conscious awareness. Take a moment to ask yourself, how do I feel? What can I see? Take a moment to explore your experience of the hypnagogic state. If you feel yourself slipping into unconscious sleep, bring your awareness back to the feelings of your body, the awareness of your breath, the sounds in the room, and the sound of this track. Relax deeply into the hypnogogic, maintaining fully conscious awareness. And now, wherever you are in the hypnagogic state, bring your attention back to an awareness of your body, an awareness of your breath, and an awareness of my voice. If you are engaging this track as a precursor to sleep, feel free to drift off through the hypnogogic and into deep and restful sleep. If you are engaging this practice as a hypnagogic mindfulness practice, then now's the time to bring your awareness back into your body, stretching gently opening your eyes, and coming back to fully wakeful awareness, feeling refreshed, revitalized, and lucidly aware you are refreshed, revitalized, and lucidly aware.

LESSON 13 – Decode the Meaning of Your Dreams
--------------------
<v ->As we approach the end of our second week</v> and prepare to enter the Full-on-Lucid Dreaming Techniques of week three, you may have noticed that your dreams have started to increase in both vividness and potential meaning. Not all dreams are laid in with mystical meaning, some are just the brain working through daytime experiences and filing away old memory, but some of them absolutely hold deep psychological significance. Whatever you believe the truth is this, our dreams reveal the internal environment of our mind. So if you want to know what's going on in here, look to your dreams. I want to share with you a technique that will help you decode meaning from your dreams. Just as we have learned how to spot our dream signs to help us become lucid, we will now learn how to decode any possible messages from our dreamer. Today's practice isn't strictly a Lucid Dreaming Technique but so many people ask me for a method to help them decode their dreams that I thought I should include this one for you. Just to make sure that we have all the bases covered and that we have definitely created the best Lucid Dreaming Course that has ever been made, because we have, mike drop. When we interpret dreams consciously, we often try to replace the dream's intelligence with our own, but instead I believe we should try to listen to and hear with broad awareness, the tone of the dream, allowing any meaning to be naturally decoded. Our dreams don't conceal their meaning from us. It's just that we often don't understand the language of the dream. To understand a dream, we must offer it our attentive awareness and learn to decode its symbols which will be totally personal to each of us. This technique starts out from the point of view that everything in the dream is you. This is a Gestalt therapy approach to dreams and also the Buddhist approach too. So if I dream of Donald Trump it's not really about Donald Trump. It's about what Donald Trump represents to me, to me he has negative associations of misogyny and racism. So if I dream of him, he might represent my own misogyny and racism. But if my friend David, who's a Trump supporter and loves Donald Trump, if he has the same dream, to him Trump represents power, breaking boundaries and original thought. So you get it, right? And you also get how much of a waste of time dream dictionaries are. For example, let's say I have a dream of a cat, but I was attacked by a cat in childhood. And let's say you have a dream of a cat, but you love cats. And you love watching 'lol' cat videos before bed. For me, a cat decodes the meaning of childhood trauma and for you, a cat decodes the meaning of joy. We need to make our own dream dictionary based on our own personal dream content. That's what dream coding is going to allow us to do. Dream decoding helps us to pinpoint the emotional flavor of individual aspects of our dreams. It's working in a non-linear fashion, looking at the energetic association that we personally hold to each dream aspect rather than any black or white direct interpretations. We ask ourselves, what do I associate with this particular aspect of the dream? So if I have a dream about Waffles, the puppy dying, I would decode the dream as, my joy and innocence is dying. Or if I dream that Waffles is huge, like as big as a skyscraper, I would decode my dream as, my joy and innocence is huge, as big as a skyscraper. So you get it, right? Working by this theory, everything in the dream is you. So in one way, the dream is extremely egotistical, but by decoding it, we can learn deep insights into ourselves which will absolutely help to reduce the power that the ego has over us. August is a friend of mine from America, who I've been working with through one-on-one Skype sessions for a while now. At the end of one of our Skype sessions, he had what I call a door handle moment. This is what my therapist friend says happens at the end of a therapy session. When the client is just walking out the door, has their hand on the handle and says, "Oh, by the way this thing once happened to me as a child." A door handle moment, a moment of deep insight coming right at the end of a session. Now for August, his door handle moment with this say, "Oh by the way, there was another dream. It was totally random and it's probably not worth mentioning but," it was then that he told me the following dream. And when we decode it, you will see what a huge dream it was offering a deep insight into August's life. This is the dream that August told me. "The dreamscape looks like Antwerp and I'm wearing my yellow Rocky Marciano shirt. I see Alfonzo walking towards me and I bump right into him. But I pretend not to see him at first. Alfonzo talks excitedly and praises me. Then he shows me these huge jewels that are about 10 feet tall. And he says, we have to climb up them. Alfonzo asks if I will be okay. And I tell him, 'it's no problem. I've been doing a lot of climbing with Jesse Anderson recently', me and Alfonzo climb to the top of the first jewel and then I wake up." So it seems like a normal but quite crazy dream about August bumping into a couple of friends then climbing up jewel for some reason. But look at the meaning we can get from this dream once we apply dream decoding. When I decoded the dream with August, I asked him what he associated with each aspect of the dream. He started at the beginning and he told me Antwerp was a place he really likes. Then I asked him about Rocky Marciano, who was on his shirt. He said, Rocky made him think of power and masculinity. When I asked him about his friend Alfonzo he said, "He was very smart, well-read, he didn't like school. He had so much potential. I think he might symbolize my untapped potential." When I asked him about jewels he said, "Beauty and preciousness." When I asked him about Jesse Anderson, he said, "Jesse leads a successful, conventional life. Although he's known in his heart forever that it's just a silly game. He's a spiritual guy but he acts like he's not, he's a salmon really. He knows the way home. I guess he might symbolize my spiritual seeker. Maybe he represents my hidden spirituality." So now that we've got the decoded meaning from August, let's read through the dream again, but replace the key aspects with their decoded representations. Now, August's dream reads like this. "The dreamscape is a place I really love and I'm wearing power and masculinity. I see my untapped potential walking towards me and I bump right into it, but I pretend not to see it at first. My untapped potential talks excitedly and praises me, then shows me the beauty and preciousness, that are about 10 feet tall. It says we have to climb up beauty and preciousness. My untapped potential asks me if I'm okay with this. And I tell it, 'it's no problem. I've been doing a lot of climbing training with my hidden spirituality,' me and my untapped potential then climb to the top of beauty and preciousness." So you see how a seemingly random dream that August didn't even think was worth mentioning, was once decoded and reflected upon, revelatory for him and offered a powerful message about his current life path. So that's how dream decoding works. Now I want you to give it a try. Step one, pick a recent dream, which is not too long and not too complex to begin with. Step two, just like we did with August dream just now, decode each major character or aspect in the dream and then re-read the dream, replacing those characters or aspects with what they represent to you. Step three, take time to reflect upon the decoded dream and ask yourself, what is the dreamer trying to highlight for me here? And now Your Actions For Today. Firstly, decode one of your own dreams. Secondly, share that decoded dream with the Tribe. Thirdly, share how your second week is going with the Tribe. Let them know how many dream signs have you been able to spot so far? Have you had any flashes of lucidity yet? Let the Tribe know. And, finally, keep up the 3 Ds and the Dream Sign Manifestation technique. Don't forget to practice your Hypnagogic Mindfulness too. So we're almost at the end of our second week and you guys are smashing it. This is not easy work, but who wants easy when you can have transformative. Be sure to tune in tomorrow for our weekly quiz, our weekly pep talk. and of course everybody's favorite, our bedtime story. Until then. Sweet dreams.

====================

LESSON 14 – Summary of Your Second Week
--------------------
<v ->Today is the implementation and review day.</v> So it's your chance to catch up and review any lesson that you might have missed. For example, maybe day 10, you didn't really get. Go back and watch day 10 again. Maybe day nine, you skipped for whatever reason, be sure to watch day nine. I want to make sure that we're all totally up to date before we enter our next week. Just like last week, today is about fun, inspiration and relaxation. We have the quiz, the pep talk and the bedtime story, which this week is about an old woman and a dog's tooth. Sounds weird and it is weird. We have salmons last week, dog's teeth this week, it's weird, weird is how I roll. But the weirder you are the easier it is to get lucid. Now it's time for the week two quiz. Without checking back in the previous lessons of the quest, I want you to answer the following questions from memory. There'll be no shaming if you don't get it right, remember it's just for fun, so enjoy. Question number one. What are the three types of dream sign? That's right, anomalous, thematic and recurring. Question number two. What is the 1%? And here's a hint, it's not the global elite who dictate the lives of the other 99% of the world. Ya, it's the 1% of dream content that is sourced from outside of our personal mindstream. Question three. What are the four main stages of sleep? That's right. Hypnagogic, light sleep, deep sleep and REM dreaming. Question four. What are the dominant brainwaves of the hypnagogic state? Alpha and Theta. Question number five. What is the metaphor used to describe dream control in relation to lucid dreaming? Yes, it's the sailor and the sea. Just as no sailor controls the sea, so too does no lucid dreamer control the dream. This is your week two pep-talk. Firstly well done for completing week two of the quest. We've covered a crazy amount of content and the warmup is over. Next week, we are getting lucid. We worked hard this week, laying the foundations of our practice. Dream signs, hypnagogic mindfulness, awareness of the sleep cycles, decoding our dreams. Each day has been structured to layer upon the last one before it. And next week, you'll see why we've done it in this order. So for those of you chomping at the bit to get lucid, chill, your time is coming. And for those of you who have already become lucid, congrats for that. And remember, lucidity is a spectrum. So if you've been pre lucid, semi lucid or even if you've just begun remembering more dreams than usual, congratulations to you too. Lucid dream training is cumulative and at 14 days in, don't worry if you haven't been lucid yet, it's still very early days. Just as a benchmark, at this point in our journey, it would be really cool if you were recalling at least two dreams per night and writing them down. It would also be really cool if you'd noticed an increase in your dream signs and it would also be super cool if you were able to be aware of some of the aspects of your sleep stages. But it's also cool if you're still just plugging away at the dream recall, there is no wrong way to do this. And just the fact that you are here doing this lucid dreaming quest, puts you in the top 0.01% of the world's population who actually get lucid dreaming and who want to learn how to do it. So I celebrate whatever level you're on right now. The main things to remember this week are this, be keeping that dream diary, use it to spot your dream signs and have the strong intention to manifest dream signs into your dreams. If you've got that, you got this. And remember it's all about enthusiasm and determination. See you next week when we start cooking with gas. And now your actions for today. Firstly, review and catch up on any content from the last week that you missed. Secondly, keep up your 3 Ds and the dream sign manifestation. And finally go and give yourself a 20 minute hypnagogic nap. You deserve it. And when you fall asleep tonight relax deeply with a bedtime story. I'll see you next week. When we start the real lucid dreaming practice and begin cooking with gas.

LESSON 14 – Meditation: Bedtime Story: “The Dog's Tooth”

Get into bed, get comfy, and allow yourself to drift off to sleep. While I tell you a bedtime story, I want to tell you a story about an old dog's tooth. There was once an old and very devoted Buddhist woman who lived in Tibet with her only son. The son was a silt merchant who often made trips to northern India to trade his wares. Each time he went to India, his mother would plead with him to bring her back a Buddhist relic or holy object, which she could place on her shrine to help inspire her prayers. But each time he refused her request. After decades of pleading, the old woman who was now as stubborn as she was old, told her son that if she didn't get some sort of Buddhist relic or holy object, she would kill herself. The son placated his mother and promised that he would fulfill her wish. But the next time that he traveled to India, he returned to Tibet empty handed. In fact, he had been so busy with selling his silk that he had completely forgotten about his promise, and he only remembered his mother's threat. When he turned down the path that led to their house in a fit of panic, he scanned the path for ideas and saw the rotting corpse of a dog by the side of the road. In a flash of desperate inspiration, he pulled out one of the teeth from the corpse, wrapped it in a piece of his finest silk, and decided to present it to his mother as the tooth of the Buddha himself, one of the holiest Buddhist relics in all of existence. His mother met him at the door with a face that told him she was ready to keep her suicidal promise. So he swiftly presented her with the tooth and an elaborate tale of how he had come across it. The old woman was ecstatic and she rushed over to her small shrine where she carefully placed the deceased dog's tooth, still wrapped in finest silk and began fervently to offer it prayers and prostration of devotion. For hours and hours, days and days, she stayed at her shrine, locked in deep devotional prayer towards what she truly believed was the ancient tooth of Buddha himself. After a while, the son became concerned that his mother was becoming obsessed with what he knew to be nothing more than a poor ruse. So he went into check on her. What he saw amazed him, he found his mother mesmerized in deep meditative absorption, gazing at the silt wrap, which was now glowing and illuminated with rainbow colored light. By the extraordinary power of the woman's faith and devotional prayer. She had been granted the blessing of what she believed she was praying to, and soon she became fully enlightened and her body dissolved into rainbow light upon her death, fully lucid death. So just like the old dog's tooth, it doesn't matter what we believe in, just that we believe for it is the power of belief, the power of the mind, the power of human consciousness that allows us to access our innate power and divinity. So believe. Believe in yourself, believe in your dreams, believe in your ability to become lucid. And now with the energy of that story in your body and the belief in your ability to become lucid, close your eyes if they're still open. Allow yourself to release into the support of your bed And relax deeply into sleep. Allow your breathing to slow and your mind to relax deeply into sleep. Allow any tension in your body to dissolve as you exhale and relax deeply into sleep. Dream lucidly and fruitfully, relax deeply into sleep.

LESSON 14 – Experience Lucid Dreaming Bonus Live Call #2: Sleep Science and Dream Decoding

Hello, everyone, and welcome to Experience Lucid Dreaming's live bonus call number two. We've got five of these over the course of the quest this month. We've got three left after this. And remember, these live experience calls are where you can connect with the author, Charlie Morley. You can share with your tribe, and you can also get your help on the quest, get your questions answered and support to have a successful quest. So welcome. without spending any more time getting into it let's introduce charlie welcome to the call charlie thanks for joining us again hey man thanks so much for having me and it's great to be here again for call number two of our live weekly calls for the lucid dreaming quest um again if you weren't if you weren't able to tune in last week then it's a week later now right so that last one should be uh should be live now you should be able to watch the recording from last week um the recordings are made available a week later But see if you can join the live. It's great to have you guys here and to be with you humans. Because some of you I'm getting to know. Because I do check the chat. You know, every day after all of the sessions, I go through and I press the discuss and I check. Now, I don't comment on a lot because I'm getting so many messages from you guys on email and Instagram asking me questions about the quest. I'm not so engaged in the chat, but I read them all. I read them all. So first of all, amazing congratulations for those who've had so many lucid dreams. It was crazy last week. I saw like every day people were putting in, oh, I had a lucid dream last night, this and that. If you haven't had a lucid dream yet, again, don't worry. This is the big point I wanted to make last week. This is, you know, we're baking a cake. And the first week was about setting all the mixtures out. The second week just gone was about putting the mixture together and putting it in the tin. Tomorrow, well, kind of today and then moving into tomorrow, we start cooking. And tomorrow, tomorrow, some of you may wish you were on a different quest, but tomorrow is when we start doing the real lucid dreaming techniques, which means I'm asking you to wake up in the middle of the night to set an alarm to wake you up and then drop back to sleep doing certain lucid dreaming techniques. So from tomorrow onwards, it does level up a little bit. So I hope you guys are ready for that. But so far, we're doing so, so well. What I would like to say, though, we're at the middle point of the quest. And what I found in my other courses, even on the four -day retreats, which are live, you know, in -person retreats i often find right in the middle of a retreat or a course there can be a dip and i want you to imagine like a plank of wood right on on two foundations what is the weakest point in that plank of wood it's right in the middle because when the woods near the first foundation you've got the support there and when you're near the last foundation you got the support there but right in the middle there's sometimes a dip so if you are feeling a bit of a dip on this day um then actually this is kind of the best day to have a dip because tomorrow suddenly boom We really start cooking with gas when we start doing the nighttime techniques. So in the Tibetan tradition, of which I'm part, a lot of these techniques are split up into what are called daytime techniques and nighttime techniques. That's just the translation from the Tibetan. Basically, the daytime techniques are things you do while you're awake that help to give you lucid dreams. So things like the Colombo method, things like reality checking, things like keeping a dream diary. These are all things you do while you're awake, right? From tomorrow, we move into the nighttime techniques. These are literally things you do as you're falling asleep in the nighttime. And they do often ask you to wake up at certain points in the night. So when we move into the wake ups, and again, I'll discuss this in the call next week, go easy on the wake ups. If you're currently working with anxiety or depression or sleeplessness, probably not best to wake yourself three, four times a night, which by the end of next week. is going to be one of the practices I'm suggesting you do. But for those of you with a kind of regulated sleep cycle, get ready for those wake ups. Because if you fall asleep once, and then wake up once in the morning, you got one chance. If some crazy guy like me ask you to wake up two, three, four times a night, you've just doubled, tripled, quadrupled your chances of lucidity. So yeah, we do level up a little bit from tomorrow. So be ready for that. But whatever stage you're at now, well done. In fact, let's have a look at this. Let's use the chat because I love the kind of, oh, wow, we've suddenly got 400 people. I swear we had like 100 a few minutes ago. Okay. In the chat, if you have had a lucid dream already, I'd like you to write lucid in the chat. So if you had a lucid dream already, write lucid in the chat. Oi. Oh, wow. Okay. That's a lot of lucids coming through. They're still coming through. Okay. That's great. Oh, we got some semi -lucids too. Great. Perfect. Still lucids coming through. What was the next question I was going to ask you guys? Oh, yeah, okay. Still lucids coming through. Who here has seen their hands in their dreams? Maybe you've seen the hand change and you became lucid, or you've just seen your hands in your dreams. If you have, I want you to write hands in the chat. Anyone who's seen their hands change in their dreams, whether you got lucid or not? Okay, a lot of hands coming through. Brilliant. Brilliant. And the final question is, who is aware of more dream signs now? Not just aware, who has seen their dreamer give them more dream signs in the last week? If so, I want you to write signs in the chat. More dream signs in the last week. Okay, lots of signs coming through. Very quick. In fact, signs are the quickest one we've had. Okay, brilliant. So as always, wherever you are on the quest, it is totally, totally fine. Just like I said last week, sometimes people who have a lot of lucid dreams at the beginning of the quest, because they didn't have to work for it so hard, they sometimes find it hard to maintain it towards the end. Whereas other people who've had a little bit more struggle, and maybe they only get lucid right at the end of the quest, or even more kind of frustratingly after the quest is finished, often actually their lucid dream stability is much stronger. because they had to work for it so much. So it's horses for courses, you know, wherever you are, you're good. Just doing this quest puts you in like whatever I said last week, the 0 .1 top percent of the world population, because most people don't know what lucid dreaming is. If they do know what it is, most people don't know the full capacity of it, the full potential. And really, if you look relatively in the world's population, very, very few people practice lucid dreaming. So the fact you're even doing this quest. let alone the fact so many of you had lucid dreams already, is a real, real achievement. So I honor you just being here with me today. So just a few things to run through. Yes, I want to go through each day from last time. So day eight, we had recognizing dream signs. So again, this is one of the four Ds, right? So this is the central pillar of lucid dreaming. Main thing to say here is your dream signs will change. They won't stay static. You know, when I read my first book, Dreams of Awakening, I'm saying, oh, I always dream of my dead grandmother. I always dream of surfing. Yeah, those are my dream signs like seven years ago. They're not anymore. They change, right? They evolve. They change definitely year by year for many people, month by month. So being aware of our dream signs is a constant process we need to be in. Oh, day nine, seeing through illusion. I hope you guys enjoyed that. That was a little bit, as I described it in the quest, is Mr. Miyagi style. you know, because it wasn't kind of directly linked to lucid dreaming, but actually it totally was. It was a wax on wax off exercise. Because if you can train yourself to be really good at seeing through illusion in the waking state, that same kind of muscle memory, that same habit of critical reflective awareness flows into the dream state. And, you know, go back and try that again or go on the internet and find some of your own imagery to train the mind with that. Then we had day 10, dream sign manifestation. That was really... of our first nighttime techniques actually to be fair that was one of our first nighttime techniques because in that I'm asking you to find a dream sign and then intentionally manifest that so if my dream sign was you know my dead grandma I'd fall asleep saying tonight I dream of my dead grandma when I see my dead grandma I know I'm dreaming um day 11 how sleep works for a lot of you in the chat that seemed to be one of your favorite days and isn't it crazy that we leave the education system in the country where I am, England at least, with no awareness of how we spend a third of our lives. It's crazy. If there was any video that I would ask you to share with your friends and family, you know, just on your phone to show them a video from the Quest, it's probably that one, Day 11, How Sleep Works, because I think that can benefit people at such a profound level. And it's shocking how few people really know about sleep, you know, about each of the stages, how they work. And the more you know about sleep, the more we can depathologize these myths about sleep, about how much we're supposed to have, what sleep does, all this kind of stuff. Really important to know about that. Day 12, meeting the gatekeeper. What's that? That was, oh, that was the hypnagogic state, of course. The gatekeeper into the dream, the hypnagogic state. Really nice meditation there. I used it myself. I feel like a complete narcissist while I'm on the floor listening to my own voice guiding me into meditation. But it's a really good track. So I was like, I'm going to use this myself. It really works. And then dream decoding. This is what we're going to look at today. Dream decoding. So a way of decoding meaning from your dreams. Again, not classically lucid dreaming. You know, it's not that dream decoding will necessarily give you lucid dreams. But dream decoding brings you into a very close relationship with your dreamer. And of course, the closer you are with your dreamer, the more loving you are to your dreamer, the more appreciative you are to your dreamer, the more likely your dreamer is to help you get lucid. It really is a bi -directional relationship here. You can't push down the door into a lucid dream. You can only knock on the door. And sometimes people are knocking on the door. They're doing all the techniques, knock, knock every night, knock, knock. The door is not opening. Why? Because either they haven't got a solid dream plan or they're not on friendly terms with their dreamer. Whereas other people, they just do one tiny knock, just one little technique, one thought of lucid dreaming, and the dreamer opens the door. Why? Probably because they have got a really good relationship with the dreamer. You know, we don't answer the door. This is a nice metaphor. First time I've used it. We don't answer the door to strangers, do we? We answer the door to our friends. So if there's a knock on our door and we... kind of have a look who it is. Oh, it's our friend. We're going to open it. Whereas if we knock on the door and it's a stranger or it's someone who we think doesn't come in peace, we ain't going to open the door. So I think it's a bit like that, right? So Dream Decoding makes us, you know, a friendly visitor to the dream world. Then, of course, our review and integration day. Again, I apologize. You didn't get to see the leopard print pajamas. That will definitely be in my edits when this course next runs. Put that shot of me in my leopard print pajamas. And then. We've had reality checks, obviously, and the Columbo method. So reality checks, I think we're going to have questions on that. So I'm going to take questions on reality checks later and the Columbo method. Those are moving into week three now. And our main focus is on week two right now. So I think, Ezra, we are ready to look at some of those decoded dreams. So what we asked was for tribe members to send me a dream. and their decoding of that dream. And to actually go through the step -by -step, you know, representation and symbol work that we learned in that day on dream decoding. We had quite a few and they were all really good. Some of the best ones, actually, I'm not sharing today because they were just a bit too long to share. So the ones I've chosen today are brilliant, just as brilliant as the ones we aren't sharing too. And I did read them all. So thank you for that. And they were all brilliant. Okay, who have we got for our first decoded dream? So we'll start with Alexandra Singer. Let's see. I'm sharing hers now. And she is on the call, so I'm going to bring her on. Actually, yeah, let's go through this first. So here you've got her decoding. So she's got stranger equals unconscious fear. Car for her is freedom. To ride, to be in motion is about development, creativity. To break, standstill, stagnation. Speed is vitality and liveliness. Now, as I'm reading this, I'm thinking, oh, no, not for me. Stranger for me would mean this. Car for me would mean this. It is completely subjective. That is why anyone who says they can interpret your dreams for you or those kind of, you know, dream dictionaries you find online, alarm bells should be ringing. Anyone who, someone can help you decode their dreams. You know, like a Jungian analyst, or maybe me who's worked with dreams for a while, simply because we know the language of dreams so well, we can help, but really only you can decode your own dreams. So I really love this. Winding Mountain Roads, Adventure and Fun, Alexandra, The Void, Pure Being, Suspension of Duality. I mean, that's brilliant. Death, Transformation. And then can we go to the next one too, Ezra? Yeah, the second part of hers? Yeah, please. Yeah, just a second. The second one is actually where she's inserted it into the dream. Okay, this is great. So what Alexandra has done here is she's got the dream that she wrote down, but as you can see, she has bracketed the certain symbols, the representations, and then put in a different color what they are. So a stranger, unconscious fear, a ride to develop. My fear, sorry, stranger fear. You know, we've got this here. So if we just have a read through this, it works really, really well. So I offer my unconscious fear to develop towards freedom. My fear accepts and wants to get on the side and start together. But I'm already developing and my attempt to stop my creativity does not work. I mean, God, just in one sentence, I'm like, that dream has completely opened up. Eventually, my fear manages to join me. Together, we are creating along the way and enjoying it. We experience more and more adventures, and I feel alive and enjoy it a lot. However, I try to slow down, stop my development and creativity to make my unconscious fear next to me feel good as well. That's so cool. She tries to stop the development of her creativity to make her unconscious fear kind of feel comfortable. That was a really beautiful piece for me. In fact, you know, you can read the rest. But I was really impressed with this. It really kind of showed that Alexandra totally got the technique. She's employed the technique. And it was a really insightful dream too. Alexandra, can you tell us, how was the process for you of decoding this dream? It was quite fun to get the message because this was a reoccurring dream in different settings and scenes. I had for three or four times. I always was wondering about, I mean, I'm going to die or something, but I always feel good with the speed and going to die. And there was no fear at all. And I was always wondering, but I don't know, shouldn't you be panicking or something? So with this decoding, that really turns everything around. And so, yeah. It was just enlightened. And what I want to share quickly is after that, two days after I got the message and I was really happy about that. I dreamt the same dream. No, not the same. I dreamt it again. I was on the road again. The stranger was replaced by my father this time sitting next to me. We were getting really fast on a tiny road. It was rainy and dark and I had fun again driving so fast. And then it came to my mind, okay, I need to maybe slow down. And then I looked at my father and then I thought, no, my father loves driving fast as I do very much. So we just keep on going. And that was it. That's cool. I'm thinking about that. I don't know. Is that the integration of my fear already? This was not a lucid dream. It was just like I accepted I don't have to stop and I just keep on developing. So without fear. Brilliant. Brilliant. It could be, Alexandria, there are things called resolution dreams and resolution dreams are actually used in the, when they do the scientific studies on trauma integration through dreaming and lucid dreaming and dream work practices. Resolution dreams are as indicative of integrated trauma as the nightmares stopping. So often if someone's having a recurring nightmare or recurring trauma, I know yours wasn't, but if it was an anxiety, you're more a nightmare. The kind of proof. that whatever dream work technique this person has been doing has worked is that either the nightmares and anxiety dreams stop or they have a resolution dream which is exactly as you described the dream will play out in a very similar format but certain key points will be different as a way to indicate to the dreamer that a shift has occurred so it could well be only you know whether it's a resolution dream because we'd have to then which we don't have time for now we'd have to then decode that dream and see what your father represents and what, you know, all the things you said about my father loves speed and stuff like that. But if you did a decode on that, I think you could find a resolution there. That's brilliant. Yeah, I already did. It's authoritarian independence. My father stands for egoism, like selfishness, independent and authority. That's interesting. Yes. Cool. Brilliant. Thank you so much, Alexandra. Thank you. thank you alexandra thank you so much thank you okay who have we got next ezra uh we've got tracy singer or not no that was uh alexandra we've got tracy let me uh share hers and she's on the call as well so i'll bring her on right oh yeah okay so this was this great dream um about jesus jesus christ booking a table at the restaurant that Tracy owns, I believe. And how she's kind of, you know, having to organize this event for this big celebrity, Jesus, coming into the restaurant. And so it was kind of a funny dream. And big archetypes, you know, Jesus Christ, pretty much one of the most powerful archetypes there is, right? um and the fact he was coming into the restaurant that she owns about her work and jesus had a manager now isn't that cool to think if there was a second coming of jesus which may well happen who knows if the predictions are true jesus would have to have a manager right like jesus would be on on social media jesus would have to have like a manager booking his gigs of where he gives his teachings and talks so i thought it was really cool that the dreamer gave this manager and actually the manager um kind of role in this dream was quite important as well So, Tracy, are you there? I can see Tracy on screen, but we can't hear her yet. Hi. Hey. Hi, I'm here. Oh, should I put on the video? I wasn't really expecting to be here. Yes, please. There you are. Oh, and you're on the topics. Yeah, it's a little bit late, so sorry. I'm halfway in bed. Hi. I'm so happy to be here. Cool. So thank you for your dream. Why don't you take us through this? So you've got your dream decoding. that Jesus, one of the greatest teachers of kindness, the cow, your restaurant, the event booking and the manager. So I like that there that you picked the four main things. So there could have been other things that Tracy, you know, went into more detail of, but she picked the four major kind of archetypes or representations in the dream and chose to work with them. So if you look at what Tracy's done here, which is slightly different to Alexandra, she's done less decoding. So she's only chosen four things, Jesus. the cow restaurant, event bookings, and manager, but she's gone into more detail of what they represent. So there's another way that you can do dream decoding. Less symbols, but more detail of those. So just take us through this, Tracy. How was this for you? When you woke up from the dream, what did you first think before you decoded it? I was actually, like, when I woke up, I was literally, like, crying laughing. I mean, I'm just like, oh, my God, that is the most awesome dream ever. Like, it felt... amazing and so good and usually all my dreams about the restaurant are like people are trying to kill me over buffet not being right or something so it's to me it was like the perfect bringing this my bringing the dreams into my stress level by recognizing them i've always dreamed recognize that i'm having these dreams but making friends with them finally you know that instead of like fighting with the dream so much to allow like that like instead of like people trying trying to kill me over the restaurant to like have jesus show up and just say it's all good man we got your back you know like everything is gonna be great you can do that like i felt like it was like like the most perfect thing saying you can do this like you like all these good things are coming if you'll just let them be there and it was Jesus's manager was you know as I was I it was just like hysterical because I deal with a lot of like band managers and things like that yeah to have Jesus's manager just say like you know Jesus brings his own space you know it's just like like so like off the top of the head oh don't worry about that you know it'll be fine jesus brings his own space you don't have to worry the universe has this you know that line is so brilliant when you take jesus as love spirituality and kindness or infinite power one of those that you listed there you know just that line that love spirituality and power brings its own space It's like, yeah, I love going to become a space. It's always there. It was so short, but it was just like, I just felt like the most great sort of love and relief from that dream was just so, it was like exactly what everybody needs. Just let the universal love in. So yeah, everybody, like if you can just focus on that universal energy and get that in your dream, it's just so amazing. That's it, right? Brilliant. I'm trying to read a few bits of a few of the sentences. So one of our greatest teachers of kindness booked an amazing experience with amazing guests, but stressful and panic inducing. at the thing that's taken up all my time in the center of huge stress but i'm worried about not having enough space to be uh not having enough space to hold this capable in charge person oh i've just got the chat i can't actually see the bottom bit because the chat's going so fast um but then we've got this bit about um you know jesus wanting this capable uh oh sorry i can't see that bit i'm trying to freestyle ezra is any way i can hide the chat or you can move the page up a little bit So I can see the bottom paragraph. Like that? Oh, no, it hasn't changed. Well, why don't you read it, Trey? Ah, there we go. Great. A person with no worries or doubt that we're super excited to have. That we're super excited to have Jesus come and talk. Sorry, this symbol of kindness come and talk at my place of stress. But our place is quite small. And I'm concerned how to fit people in and it'll be a popular event. Our greatest teacher of infinite power. Oh, the chat's come up again. I can't see that bit. Tracy, would you mind reading it for me, your last paragraph? Let's see. Or maybe you can't see it either. I could read it. Teacher of our own infinite powers, person in charge, who will take care of everything, says very casually, oh, don't worry about that. Our greatest teacher of our own infinite power brings his own space. That's it. That's that punchline. And it often, Carl Jung believed this, the last line of a dream or the last scene of a dream is often like the punchline. And it's kind of what the dreamer wants to leave you with, that resonance. I know sometimes a dream wakes you up. If a dream wakes you up and you've kind of woken up because of the dream, there's often something there the dreamer wants you to look at. You know, again, that kind of punchline. So yeah, brilliant. Thank you so much, Tracy. Thank you so much, Charlie. It's awesome. All right. Thank you. I think we've got time for one more and then we'll get on to questions. Yes. So next up is Bridget. She's on the call as well. I think it's her. Here's Bridget. And Bridget, I'm going to bring you on the call. You can turn on your camera and your microphone. I think I know who this is. And I think it might be a German Buddhist lady called Brigitte, if I'm not mistaken. But let's see. So again, the dream. I'm in a formal conversation with my English teacher. She's accusing me of having cheated in the last English test. I'm a bit astonished because I don't think I did that. She insists. And I have a vague feeling of guilt and an image in my mind that I somehow looked up words during the test. But I'm still not sure whether it's happened or not, whether it's happened or not or when it happened. I don't admit that I cheated. So you could wake up from that and think, oh, this is just a classic anxiety dream about being back at school and missing a test. You know, if I had that dream, I might have not bothered to decode it. Oh, it's a different Bridget. Okay, no problem. She didn't put her last name, so I was hoping it might be you. But thanks, Bridget. Is the other Bridget there? No, there's only one Bridget on the call tonight. Okay, no problem. Hello to that other Bridget, though. Thank you for coming on. So the way she decoded this was really cool. Hang on, sorry. Waffles, no. No, be a good doggy. So English. to Brigitte, I believe is her name, is a language she received her Buddhist teachings in. And she looks at teacher here as higher self. The English test then becomes a test about her spiritual path. So suddenly this dream that I might have just thought, oh, it's just an anxiety dream about being back at school, those dreams everyone has, is suddenly quite a deep dream here about her spiritual path and her interaction with Buddhist Dharma. So I thought, again, lovely one, such a short dream. So easy to think, oh, nothing really happened in that dream. But then when you look at it closely and just that core image to her, she's like, what is English to me? Ah, English is the language in which I received most of my Buddhist teachings. Something as simple as that, boom, the dream opens up. So yeah, I really liked that one. And the decoded dream is my higher self says that I'm cheating myself on my spiritual path by not doing the practice that I really should be doing. And I feel somehow guilty, but I was definitely not aware of doing that. Now, what I wanted to ask Brigitte, and maybe I will if I can email her later, is what does teacher mean to her? Because she's but higher self. And who am I to say it's not? I just wanted to ask her live, what is your relationship with teacher? Because, yeah, I just worried. That was the only one that held up. I was like, oh, okay. You've got to have a pretty good relationship with school for English teacher to mean higher self. But then, of course, if English means spiritual, then perhaps English teacher is your inner guru, your inner spiritual teacher. So that one I wanted to look at. Is it something bigger than higher self, like actually inner guru? Or is it something less than higher self? and actually maybe some sort of insecurity around school. So that I wanted to discuss with her. She is here. Brita, turn on your camera and your microphone. Oh, we can find out live. Hello. Hello. Can you hear me? Ah, yes. Okay. Yes, it's Brigitte. I just can't change my name on the call on this kind of Zoom call because usually I change my name. So this is why the confusion happened. No problem. I'm glad we've had you on. So let's look at this question I had. For you, for teacher, how did you come from teacher to higher self for you? Well, I came to it by just by association. But what I met with higher self is inner guru. It's not that that's not different. Yeah. It was only like my higher self as opposed to my outer teacher, you know, my outer guru. Got it. Brilliant. Well, then that that opens up an even more profound dream for you. You know, my inner guru. says that i'm cheating myself in my spiritual path by not doing the practice that i should really be doing what a teaching there what a teaching now i have no idea what specific buddhist teachings you're doing or what spiritual practices you're doing but were you able to after that dream were you able to action it like was there any change you were able to make in the waking state to kind of pay homage to that dream yes i did a little bit i changed my practice already a little bit not not fully but a little bit and i did some work on some obstacles doing the practice i think i should be doing and I worked with other methods on that but I started working on it and yeah so for me the surprising thing about this dream decoding was how clear the message was because when I awoke from that dream I was really puzzled about that. what happened and did it happen in which reality or in which kind of dream and I was really thinking about it but I would not have at the first on the dream i would not have seen the message yeah me too but then i just i because i was so confused i tried the dream decoding and um i was surprised about the results myself great that's so good to hear um two things are great there one is what you just said there about the fact you were surprised by the results of the dream decoding how clear it was when you did it um and the second thing is you you You made a waking state changed based on the dream. You said it was subtle. You changed a certain aspect of your spiritual practice. But that is a surefire way for that dream never to occur again. You know, when people have recurring dreams, it's because they're not actioning in their waking state what the dream is asking them to look at. But the fact that you made an action, even if it's a little thing, just something to let the dreamer know, OK, yeah, I hear you. I get the message. It's a really important thing. And again, further strengthens that friendship with the dreamer. It's a bit like if you've got a friend who you always give advice to, but they never listen to your advice. You kind of stop giving them advice in the end. But we've got other friends, right, who whenever we give advice, they say, yeah, you know what? Thank you for that. I'm going to act upon that. Then we keep giving them advice. You know, again, it's that closeness, that friendship. Brilliant. Thank you so much. And I'm glad we had you on. Thank you. Thank you. Okay. What's next on the call sheet, Ezra? Do we go to questions or we got something else? Yeah, let's go to Q &A. We've got about 20, 25 minutes left. So let's jump into the Q &A. Thanks so much, Britta. Glad you're on the call. All right. So I'm going to bring, let's see, stop sharing. And let's bring Nicole on. She's got a great question. Nicole, you are promoted to panelists. You can turn on your microphone and camera and go ahead and ask Charlie your question. Thank you so much for allowing me to be here. Hey, Charlie. Is this a dream? Brilliant reality check there. You've got a parrot or some sort of tropical bird on your shoulder. A cockatiel. Oh, he's getting camera shy. So tell me, what was your question? So, like I told you on Instagram a couple days ago, my mom passed away this summer and my whole... of idea for this course is to get in touch with her because I have been able to get in touch with her um through different signs that she sends me um and my grandma and the universe um they've been everywhere and so I'm hoping that in my dreams this can be another form of communication with her um but since it's so like fresh still and I am still grieving like when I find myself in the dreams with her like I find myself so comforted and maybe in my psychology like the fact that I'm still accepting her death could that be a way that like I don't want to accept it so it still feels like a dream because I don't want her to actually be dead like do you know what I'm trying to say like should I choose a different dream sign um I'm kind of not really sure what to do does that make sense on my question Yeah, great question. Thank you for the chat we had on Instagram, too. OK, so the first thing I'd say is allow the dreamer to do what it wants. You know, the dreamer is a higher intelligence and it's grieving. So, you know, we want to allow ourselves to grieve, whether it's crying in the waking state or dreaming about those we miss in the dream state. So really, I'd say allow that to happen. It's totally natural. It's totally normal. And, you know, the last thing we want to do is pathologize a very natural thing that's happening that you're dreaming about your mom because, you know, she died. So this is this is part of the process. So, no, I think that's totally natural and totally OK. In fact, you might even look at, you know, making a dream plan where you could meet your mom in the lucid dream. That's what I was trying to do. Yeah. yeah so there are two things to say on that i mean it's it's a subtle one if we are choosing to meet dead relatives in the lucid dream because we can't bear to let them go so it's actually a formal kind of a grasping then it might not be so good Because in that way, it's kind of hindering the mourning process rather than allowing the non -lucid dreams just to play out. And eventually they'll start to fade and then they'll come back and then they'll fade. If we were to use the lucid dream as a form of grasping, that might not be so good. And in fact, probably if that was our motivation, the dream plan probably wouldn't work. I imagine if your motivation was kind of grasping and not being able to let go, you might be lucid and calling out, mom, come to me, mom, come to me. Just nothing's going to happen. Because the dreamer knows it's kind of, especially in the lucid dream, you know, seven times the power of mind. I don't think we said that yet. I don't think you've got to that on that day. But in the Buddhist teachings, there is, you have seven times the power of consciousness in a lucid dream. So once you're lucid, you can, you know, it's quite a trustworthy place or for me anyway. However, if you wanted to use your dream plan to meet a dead loved one as a way of saying what needs to be said and embracing them, telling that you love them. and telling them that you're okay and that they can move on. That would be really beneficial and could be really great for you. And if you believe in it, this is a belief system thing, but I tend to actually allow your mom to let go too, her energy or her spirit, whatever you want to call it. So I think that could be a really powerful dream plan. It would just be about you and only you know this, checking in with your motivation. Do I want to meet her in my lucid dream so I can let her go with love and compassion for myself and for her? Or am I meeting, or do I want to meet her in the lucid dream because I can't bear to let her go? Either way, I mean, what a fascinating meditation for you to be able to do and to use the lucid dream to help with that. Yeah, I think my motivation is more. for them to give me some kind of message right now because I'm going through so many changes in my life and a really difficult moment. So I kind of feel like my motivation was for them to give me some kind of message to help me move on and for me to kind of keep on going to reach my dreams. I think that'll definitely be possible because, you know, in the lucid dream, how can we... I sometimes think, how can we tell when we're meeting dead relatives? But actually, that's a bit disingenuous because I think we can tell. You know, I've had maybe 10, 11, 12 lucid dreams where I met my dead grandma because she used to be my dream sign. So I'd often see her and then become lucid. And to be honest, those first 11, I thought it was really her until dream 12 when it was really her. And I realized in that moment. oh, okay, the bad news is those 11 other lucid dreams about her, it wasn't her at all. But the good news is this 12th lucid dream, wow, it is really her. And I can't explain how I knew it was really her other than I didn't need to ask my teacher. I didn't need to check books. I didn't need to check with myself. It was like that was her energy and you will know it. But even if it's not your mom's energy, in the lucid dream, even if it's just your internal projection of the dead loved one or your mom or whoever it might be, still so much of our relationship is based on projection in the waking state that actually we can still do deep healing by healing the inner mother or the inner dead relative or the inner whatever they represent to us in a kind of a dream decoding way. So either way, it's a win -win situation. It's the same when we send healing for people. You know, if I get lucid now and send healing to my mom, who's a... she has alzheimer's then at least i'm healing my inner mother when i send healing to my mom in the dream and at most i'm healing the outer mother so either way it's a win -win situation so i think it's a beautiful dream plan for you and i think your your motivation seems really good and i i hope you have the dream and i hope you can share it with us on another call do i still keep her as my dream sign though because she's going to keep like popping up Yeah, you don't have a choice. I mean, your dream signs are going to come anyway. You can encourage dream signs by letting the dreamer know, hey, give me more. But you can't stop dream signs. You don't really have a choice. You just have a choice of kind of amplifying them. So she's probably going to be a dream sign anyway. Okay. Thank you so much. I really appreciate it. Thank you, Nicole. And next up is Vivian. You are now a panelist. Welcome to the call, Vivian. It's been a while. Zoom is being a little slow. No problem. Vivian, welcome to the call. You there? All right. Well, she is coming. Hi, Ezra. I'm here. Sorry, my internet's blowing up. Good to see you, Ezra, again, and lovely to meet you, Charlie. This is such an amazing and wonderful together quest. I have to appreciate everyone involved in putting it together. So Charlie, I remember you saying to us that often one's spirit guides or angels or guardians or a higher self might come into your dream, and that's possible. My question is, can people from our current lives, alive people, meet us in our dreams, or is that something else that we're talking about and not really dreaming? It seems like it's possible. I've experimented with this. It seems like the most important things are intention and not availability, intention and kind of allowing the person to get in. So the first time I did this, it was when I was running the dream circles when I first started. So I only had about 10 people, all of whom I knew, so I trusted. And I said to them formally in the waking state, I said, from now. until the next dream circle in one month's time, I give you permission that if you become lucid, you have permission to enter into my dream and to try and communicate with me. So I did it formally. So I think that's the important thing that is required permission. And the second thing is obviously a very strong intention for the person to enter another person's dream. So basically, people can only get in if you let them in. I think a side effect of very high levels of awakening is the ability to enter people's dreams, whether they like it or not. So if you have a very high level of awakening, you do have the ability to be a dreamwalker. I really think that's a thing. And I've seen that. I know that is true. But because it takes such a high level of waking to do it, kind of like only the good guys can do it kind of thing. You know, the bad guys don't just don't have the psychic energy required. So for people who are worried about evil entities entering their dreams and stuff like that, I say something that's quite shocking. I say you want to be worried about kind of evil entities and people, you know, hacking your mind and stuff. Be worried about the waking state, not the dream state and definitely not the lucid dream state. The lucid dream state, you have seven times the power of mind. The lucid dream state, you've got access to your golden shadow, to your higher self, to your Buddha nature, to your inner guru. The lucid dream state, no one is messing with you. But the waking state, oh my God, we are bombarded by messages and theories and advertising and all this kind of stuff. So if you want to be worried about people hacking your mind, I say be worried about the waking state, not the dream state. So I'm rambling a little bit, but to answer your question, yes, I think it's possible. And I'm so fascinated by this all. And I kind of thought about it tongue in cheek when you talk about sex with a celebrity. I was wondering if it was actually possible. Yeah. Oh, definitely possible for you to have sex with a celebrity. I think you need to find the celebrity, teach them lucid dreaming, get their permission to enter their dream, and then you can come back and tell us about it on the next call. Okay, so it's quite complicated, but I'll work on it. It does seem possible, though. Just to finish the little story I started, when I did let people, those 10 people, and I said, you can formally come into my dream, on the day before the next dream circle, so like 29 days later, I'm in a non -lucid dream. I am not lucid. And I'm in a non -lucid dream, very specific. I was on this kind of like a desert island, and they had a cocktail bar that they'd built. out into the sea. So I was standing in the sea with water about up to my knees, wearing this kind of summer hat, kind of straw hat, drinking a cocktail. And I wake up, I write down that dream. Then about 10 a .m., maybe two hours after I've been awake, a friend of mine who is part of the dream circle messages me on Facebook Messenger saying, Charlie, Charlie, what did you dream about last night? And I was like, oh, nothing, man. And he's like, no, no, what? And I was like, oh, I checked my phone. Oh, I was like at this cocktail thing. It was in the sea. And he went, no freaking way. Then suddenly ping. And he sends me a screenshot image of his dream. So I know he didn't have time to type it or to put the things. He had this experience. He became lucid. Once he was lucid, he called out, Charlie Morley's dream now. Charlie Morley's dream now. Suddenly he was on a beach. And in front of him on the beach was a perspex screen. He said it wasn't glass, it was like it was plastic. And behind the plastic screen, he could see me wearing a sun hat, holding a cocktail, standing next to a bar in, he said ankle -deep water. It was knee -deep, but you know, whatever. Those are three specific hits. Knee -deep, ankle -deep water, a bar out in the water, me having a cocktail, and he even had the hat. And then I said, what did he do? He said, I was banging on the Perspex going, Charlie, it's me. It's Matt. It's Matt. I'm doing it. I'm doing it. It's Matt from the Dream Forum. And he said, when I looked at him, I was like, it was like I was drunk. But he said, it wasn't drunk from the cocktail I was drinking. It was drunk as if my level of awareness was so low. Because, of course, he was lucid. I was non -lucid. So that I feel was a direct hit. So for me, I totally believe that's possible. But yeah, it requires permission. That was the word I was called, permission and intention. Great. Thank you. Cool. Thanks for asking. See, I like these juicy questions, guys. Let's go esoteric. You know, the quest kind of kept quite a lot of the esoteric stuff out to make it available for everyone. But, you know, I lived in a Buddhist center for almost eight years, so we can get as magical and crazy as you like. Great. Thank you so much, Vivian. Thank you, Vivian. Great to see you again. All right. Next up is Giva. I'm making you a panelist now. You can turn on your phone or your microphone and your camera. Hi, Giva. Hey, can you see me? Yeah. Hey, man. Hey, man. How are you? Great. Thank you. How are you? Good. I have to say I'm a little afraid of lucid dreaming. Oh, OK. And I know you've addressed this on some of the questions before and you've debunked the myths, too. I feel like a lot of us because it's not mainstream. science now there's this fear even if we have been lucid as kids i'm 22 now i feel like it's dangerous like we're interfering with the hypnagogic state and you know waking up the prefrontal cortex while we're sleeping so it's weird it's almost like this anxiety about lucid dreaming what do you think sure um what are you scared might happen Like worst case scenario, what are your fears? You know, top three fears. One of them, the most obvious is any kind of health damage, right? Damaging the brain, messing up something with the way, the function of the sleep. So maybe it's not as effective. And I know you talked about this, like we actually get deeper sleep, not during lucid, but in other stages. And so that's one, I would say health risk, like sleep. Number two, I would say. things that are out of your control like you get stuck in it got it yeah which which i think you also debunked but the the fear is still there i don't know if there is a third one i would say those are kind of the main two health risk and then kind of the experience Let's look at those. And yeah, I explored those in a video. But I think sometimes, you know, personal stories make it easier because you can remember the personal story when that fear comes up. So as far as the kind of messing with the brain and stuff like that, I'd probably use the veterans as an example. You know, I do a lot of work with military veterans. You know, I do retreat with military veterans, maybe they're 20 on the retreat, 80 % of them are card carrying PTSD. post -traumatic stress disorder with high PTSD scores. There's basically a kind of a chart for PTSD. Some of them are very, very high PTSD. So my point is these are highly vulnerable, highly traumatized populations. If there was any risk that lucid dreaming could be bad for your brain or could mess with your unconscious or doing something like that, there is no way I'd be allowed to work with those highly traumatized, highly vulnerable people. In fact, The opposite has happened, though. What they found is that lucid dreaming is one of the most powerful ways to actually reintegrate and to rebalance those dysregulated neural systems and dysregulated nervous system functions, too. So I think that, you know, remind yourself of that. It's like there's no way the UK government would let me let me work with veterans if there was if there was a danger to this. The second thing is to remind yourself of something you said before, the kid thing. that lucid dreaming is a natural arising of the human mind. It's actually something we forget how to do. So from a Buddhist point of view, and the Dalai Lama said this, so this is a nice one to remember. Dalai Lama said, from a Buddhist point of view, the strange thing is not lucid dreaming. It is non -lucid dreaming. He says, you know, the capacity of the mind is cognizant awareness. So the fact that we have these hours each day where we completely black out, we start hallucinating and we believe the hallucinations to be real. That's madness. You know, non -lucid dreaming is madness. Lucid dreaming is sanity because we go, oh, what I thought to be real is actually an internally generated hallucination. So there's a burgeoning theory that actually every time you have a lucid dream, you are helping your mental health because lucid dreamers, their entire practice is based on knowing the difference between internally generated hallucination and reality. So if you're worried about going mad, Madness, or one of the definitions of psychosis, would be believing internally generated delusions or hallucinations to be real. Lucid dreaming trains the brain to know better than anybody else the difference between the waking state reality and internally generated hallucinations and delusions. So actually, this is benefiting our mental health. It in no way negates it or is dangerous for people. The other thing I'd say is for most people, it's just difficult to do it enough for it to have any damage. You know, someone said, Oh, but what if I managed to get lucid every single night, you know, five lucid dreams a night, every night of the week, then I might be doing damage. And I'd be like, if you do that, you're fully enlightened. Like if you are, you know, if you're lucid in every single dream period, you never have non lucid dreams, dude, you've made it to the mountain top. So, you know, you can chill. I'm being, you know, I don't mean to be facetious. I'm just trying to be playful here. So even if you're getting lucid like once a week, which is great, once or twice a week, still about 90 to 95 % of your dream experience is non -lucid. So we're not kind of messing with the unconscious here. In fact, the unconscious loves lucidity. It's so happy to have us in there. And that thing I said before about knocking on the door, you can't force your way into a lucid dream. Well, you can actually. There's something called electro -stimulation for lucid dreaming, which I am not a fan of. where they put people in a lab and they found that if you electrically stimulated the prefrontal cortex while the person was in REM, it kind of zapped them into lucidity. Now that is like barging down the door, not knocking politely. So there is a way to force yourself into lucidity, but don't do it. The natural way, yeah, sorry, you can hear waffles people are saying, but the natural way is just like knocking on the door. So you can knock all you like. The dream will open it when it likes. So it's really kind of not up to us. We aren't forcing anything. And just a final little point you had about we messing with the sleep cycle and stuff like that. This week, you are going to find practices where I'm asking you to wake up at certain times and then drop back to sleep. That does start to mess with our sleep cycle a little bit. But if we do it just once a night at a very specific time, it won't. At the end of the next week, you're going to see a practice called multiple wake -ups technique. That's where you wake up multiple times a night. And I make it very clear not to do that every night. That's just something you maybe do once a week or twice a week or something like that. I could say more, but I hope that's helped. And I think it's really important that you said that because it's very natural to feel fear. The Buddhist view on it would be, if this was a full -on Buddhist teaching, would say, what feels fear? The answer would probably be my ego. And then the answer to that would be where the ego feels fear, spiritual awakening or spiritual reality lies. So actually where we feel our ego a little bit like, oh God, should I be doing this? Often on the other side of that fear is a breakthrough. Because if there wasn't a breakthrough there, our ego mind, our limited sense of self wouldn't be so shook. So there's that too, just to throw into the mix. But thank you so much for asking the question. But yeah, know this, you are safe. You are safe. Lucid dreaming is a safe practice. You're doing brilliant work. Yeah, I wouldn't teach you any techniques that would put you in harm's way. Very nice. Thank you. Appreciate it. Thank you. Thanks a lot, Eva. All right, everyone. That's going to wrap it up for the questions today. We've got to finish on time. But thank you all for adding your questions in the Q &A. Remember, we've got three more calls with Charlie, so we'll have plenty of time. Also, look to your support in the tribes, your co -students, and also ambassadors. Probably a lot of the questions you guys can answer among each other as well. Before we end this call, Charlie, do you have any closing words for this week? Just get ready for tomorrow because tomorrow it does kind of level up quite hard. So yeah, get ready for this week coming because we're going to start cooking with gas. Oh, just an invite. I've got my free lucid dream drop -in this Sunday. It's like an online, like this basically, but with a Q &A and dream circles. So you're put into dream circles with like four or five other people. And that happens every month. So even if you're watching this on record, just go onto my website and look for the free lucid dream drop -in. Great, and I look forward to seeing you next week. Keep going. keep doing your practice know this is a gradual process it's a gradual process and then suddenly it just levels up into breakthrough so The Buddhist view on this is like drops in a bucket. That drops in a bucket, eventually they reach a critical mass, boom, and the bucket overflows. So every day you're doing a practice is another drop in the bucket. And who knows when that's going to overflow. Could be tonight. So see you next week. Thank you so much, Charlie. And thank you so much, Tribe, for tuning in. We will see you next week. All the call links for the calls are in the Tribe, as well as the link for the recordings. So check there, and we'll see you next week. See ya. See you. Bye. Bye waffles.

Week 3: First Steps to Lucid Dreams

====================

LESSON 15 – Reality Checks & The Weird Technique for Lucid Dreaming
--------------------
<v ->Welcome to week three.</v> Buckle up, because we are about to lift off. We open this week with one of the most powerful lucid dreaming techniques there is. Welcome to the weird world of reality checks. One of the most common entries into a lucid dream is by simply spotting a dream sign and becoming lucid. You're in the dream, you see your dead grandma you go my dead grandma, I must be dreaming and you're lucid. But sometimes even though you spotted the dream sign and assure you must be dreaming, is my dead grandma i must be dreaming. You look around at the rest of the dream and it's so realistic. You simply can't accept that you are in a dream. This is when you need something called reality checks. Dr. Stephen LaBerge and the researchers at the Lucidity Institute in California, working out of Stanford university have scientifically verified that there are certain things that are virtually impossible for the human mind to replicate consistently within the pre-lucid dream state. Remember that's a state where you're in the dream. You spotted a dream sign and you're asking yourself, could I be dreaming? And so these things can be used to confirm reliably whether or no you're in a dream. There are loads of different reality checks but I'll take you through three of my favorites. I know these are going to sound weird but when you first hear it, but bear with me. Number one. Looking at your outstretched hand twice in quick succession without it changing in some way. Number two. Reading text coherently twice without it changing in some way. Using digital or electrical devices without them changing, glitching or malfunctioning in some way. Okay. But how can these things be used to check to see if we're dreaming or not? It's like this during a dream the brain is working flat out to maintain the projection of our elaborately detailed dream scape in real time. And although it's amazingly good at this once pre-lucid it often struggles to replicate the detail of an intricate image, such as a piece of text or an outstretched hand twice in quick succession. So if we try to make it engage in such replication it provides a close but imperfect rendering. It's the acknowledgement of this imperfect rendering that makes us lucidly aware. So let's break it down. If you think you might be dreaming but you're not 100% sure. Look at your outstretched hand within the dream then quickly look away and look back again. Alternatively watch your hand as you flip it over and flip it back again. Or you can look at your hand, make a fist and then bring it back to normal. Either way you're asking the brain to replicate the same image twice. That's how it works. Your brain will usually struggle to reproduce an identical projection of your hand. Essentially, the dreaming brain tries its best to reproduce the image but it doesn't quite have the processing speed to do so perfectly. The variations of multiple but the result is singular and it's about expectation. You have to really expect that the hand's going to change. And of course in a dream expectation creates reality. I know this hand checking thing can sometimes be a bit hard to imagine but once you first see your hand change in a dream, it's an amazing experience. And I get a lot of emails written at four o'clock in the morning from people saying, "Oh I read your book about the thing with the hand changing. I thought it was bullshit, but Oh my God I just saw my hand change in a dream It's amazing". So I await your 4:00 AM email. Let's break it down even further but it's really important that we nail this. You're in a dream, something weird happens and you think I might be dreaming but I'm not 100% sure and before you fly off that cliff or you embrace that monster you'd better be 100% sure you're dreaming. So what do you do? You do a reality check. You look at your hand you flip it over and you look at it again. If you're dreaming, when you flip it back it will probably have changed in some way. The dreaming mind is really creative. It's definitely right brain dominant. So it will give a creative expression to your hand. I've seen my hand turn into a baby elephant. I've seen it grow three new fingers. The brain's creative in the dream. It's simply not good at replicating precise detail. Hands are pretty detailed. So really struggles to replicate them to order. In fact, it's not just hands. If you think you might be dreaming you could look at any detailed pattern look away and look back at the detail pattern and it would change in some way. The shirt I'm wearing for example, if you think you might be dreaming now look at my shirt, look away and look back. If you're dreaming the shirt will probably glitch or change in some way. The same theory applies to reading text and the use of digital equipment. What is text, but a detailed pattern that we decode into meaning. And digital equipment look at the screen of your iPhone. It's way too detailed for the brains replicate so it kind of glitches. The same goes for digital watches. In fact often if you see someone wearing an old school Casio digital watch, it might be a sign they're lucid dreamer. Lucid dreamers often use these watches to do reality checks during the day something we'll come to in a bit. Remember none of these reality checks are foolproof. None of them work 100% of the time. Reading text twice in a row has been shown to be the most effective. That is effective 95% of the time the hand reality check however is only effective 90% of the time. So that means there's a crucial 10% where you'll be in a dream full of dream signs, a blue dragon, Kanye West walking my puppy Waffles and you'll be doing reality checks but the hand won't be changing. That's when you need to fall back on the 10% of your broad mindful awareness and go okay my hand's not changing, but how do I explain the blue dragon and Kanye West with Charlie's puppy? I must be dreaming. So if you thought reality checks were weird we haven't even warmed up yet. This next technique will really stretch your imagination. This technique is called the weird technique. It's called the weird technique because you do it anytime you experience something weird. And because you look weird when you do it it works like this, although opportunities for reality checks will often crop up in your dreams naturally. They usually only engaged once you spot a dream sign and you need to confirm whether you're dreaming or not. There is a way however that you can actively hasten this process. How? By doing reality checks in the daytime. Doing reality checks in the daytime forms the basis of the weird technique. A deceptively simple method through which I have the majority of my lucid dreams. Here's how to do it. As you go about your daily life fully awake whenever something weird happens or dreamlike or synchronistic, or you experienced déjà vu or something unexpected happens, you don't ignore it. You go. Oh, could I be dreaming? And then you answer that question by doing a reality check. By doing reality checks during the daytime, whenever something weird happens this new habit will soon reappear in your dreams. But when you check the hand in the dream it'll change and you'll become lucid. So let's say right now as I'm filming this quest, something weird happens. Like I hear a police siren or something rather than ignoring it I'm going to acknowledge that and go Oh, that's weird. I didn't expect to hear a police siren. Could I be dreaming? Well, how would I tell? I would look at my hand. I'd look away. I'd look back again. Now, of course I'm not psychotic. I know I'm not dreaming right now but we often dream about what we do in the daytime. So if I can spend enough of my daytime experience going could this be a dream? could I be dreaming? could I be dreaming? Eventually I will dream about doing that but in the dream the hand will change and I will become lucid. Think of it like this. If you spend your whole day packing boxes what do you dream about that night? Packing boxes. In fact last night, I dreamt about filming the quest because the day before, what did I spend my whole day doing? Filming this quest. So if you spend your whole day asking yourself am I dreaming? Am I dreaming? Am I dreaming? And each time doing a reality check. You're very likely to dream about doing that at night. And when you dream about it, you can become lucid. So here's the rub. You need to be doing at least 10 reality checks during the day for them to start coming into your dreams. The thing with reality checks and the weird technique is that sometimes when we hear about it, we get so excited. We forget to do the technique properly. If during the day when something weird happens you go Oh, that's weird. Oh. That's not going to lead to lucid dreams. All it's going to lead to is you dreaming about your hand being in your face the whole night. So there is a three step process for doing the weird technique properly. Number one. The weird thing happens. There's a synchronicity. Something strange happens. Something falls from the sky. You see someone wearing fancy dress in the middle of the street. You think that's weird. Step two. You ask yourself the question. Am I dreaming? And you've got to really consider that question. Really suspend disbelief for a moment and ask yourself could I be dreaming? While I've had lucid dreams that look as realistic as this so you can tell. And then step three is to do the hand check. Look at the outstretch hand. Four fingers and a thumb. Flip it over, flip it back four fingers and a thumb. If there's any change in detail, you need to be aware of it. If it's the first time you've heard about reality checks and the weird technique, okay? Maybe just a couple of checks in the day and it'll start coming into your dreams. But over time you need to build them up. You need to make this a new thing that you do. This is like the secret handshake of the lucid dreamer. Every time something weird happens, you don't ignore it. You go ah, could I be dreaming? The weird technique is a great one for those of you who blackout as soon as your head hits the pillow. Because it's a daytime technique that doesn't require any hypnagogic awareness or waking up at certain times as some of the other lucid dreaming techniques do. In fact, you can get lucid from this technique alone tonight. But it requires something from this moment until you got to sleep tonight you need to be 100% aware and every time something strange, unexpected or dreamlike happens you don't ignore it. You go, Oh, that's weird. And then you do a reality check. If you can stay switched on between now and when you go to sleep tonight and rack up at least 10 reality checks before you black out. There is a very high chance that you have a lucid dream tonight. My Buddhist teacher really loves this technique because he says every time you do a reality check in the day it's like a mindfulness bell. Bong. Present state awareness. Am I awake? Am I asleep? Bong. Present state awareness. Am I asleep? Am I awake? He believes. That's the reason that leads the lucid dreams not to do with the brain processes. He says, "if you get people to step into mindful awareness enough during the day and realize that actually sometimes when we think we're awake, we're sleepwalking through life. Eventually that will permeate our dreams. And that's what makes us lose it". For those of you who've seen the Hollywood movie inception this whole reality check thing might be ringing some bells. In that movie, the lead character has so many lucid dreams that sometimes when he wakes up in the morning he can't tell, am I still in a lucid dream or am I awake? So he uses his totem to tell. He has a spinning top. He spins the spinning top. And if it falls over, that means as gravity. So he must be in the waking state. If it continues spinning, that means there's no gravity. So he's still dreaming. He uses his totem to tell whether or not he's dreaming. This is your totem. From now on if ever you want to know am I dreaming or not, look at your hand twice in a row. If you want to extend it, you can do a finger pull. Now I can be pulling my finger. All I like in the waking state, it is not going to extend but in the pre-lucid dream state if I pull my finger, it goes whoop. And I go okay. I'm clearly dreaming. So this is like a grounding exercise too. It lets you know am I awake? Am I asleep? It's a really powerful exercise. And it's one which you can use to get lucid tonight. And now here are your actions for today. Aim to do 10 weird technique reality checks by the time you fall asleep tonight. And then share that experience with the tribe. How was it? How many weird things were you aware of? Did you notice that life started presenting you with more weirdness once you on the lookout for it? And secondly, keep up the three D's dream recall, dream diaries and checking your dream signs. Also don't forget the practice, the dream sign manifestation exercise we learned last week too. The weird technique really is the golden ticket to lucidity for many people. It is how I have the majority of my lucid dreams. So I know how well it works. See you tomorrow. When we find out what to do when reality checks don't work we put a cigar between our teeth. We remind ourselves of the 1970's and we learn how to get lucid with Lieutenant Columbo.

====================

LESSON 16 – The Columbo Method for Noticing Reality
--------------------
<v ->Today, we learn how to be like Columbo.</v> Yup, I am talking about that same Columbo. Think back, if you can, to the 1970s TV homicide detective named Lieutenant Columbo. For those of you who didn't see the show, Columbo didn't have flashy forensics. I don't think he even had a gun, he just possessed a sharp mind that took in every detail of the environment while checking the facts and looking closely. Even the way they filmed Columbo helped to highlight this. So Lieutenant Columbo would walk into a room and then suddenly they'd cut the camera to POV, point of view, and the camera would scan around the room and then focus, as he realized, oh, there's something suspicious about this person that Columbo is recognizing. Then the camera would continue, and focus and you'd realize, ah, Columbo just spotted a clue. So even the way they filmed it highlighted this idea of looking closely, of searching for clues. And of course, that's just how we need to be if we want to solve the mystery of the lucid dream. We need to look closely for the clues, in our case, dream signs and dream anomalies. As I said yesterday, no reality check works 100% of the time and not every dream is full of obvious dream signs. So what can you do if your hand doesn't change but you're still sure that you must be dreaming. How can you spot a dream sign if the dreamscape is seemingly devoid of them? Well, you can bring out your notepad, scrunch up one eye and say, and one more thing. The Columbo method is fundamentally based upon creating a habit of looking closely in the waking state so that eventually we start to look closely in our dreams and thus, see more dream signs and dream anomalies and become lucid. It really works. First of all, let's see how to practice the Columbo method in a dream. If you think you might be dreaming, so you become pre-lucid, scan the areas for clues and touch things, really explore things. Remember, the lucid dream state looks amazingly realistic but if you look close enough, you'll often be able to see slight inconsistencies and realize that you're dreaming. It's a bit like watching a puppet show. If you've been watching the puppet show for long enough you stop seeing the strings and you just see the puppets, that's what we're like in our non-lucid dreams. What we need to do is to start looking closely and eventually if we look closely enough, we'll start to see the strings these little inconsistencies that the dreaming mind has forgotten to include. That's how we'll become lucid. Step two, in the dream, be mindful and ask yourself, how did I get here? What was I doing before? What's the last thing I can remember? This is a direct reference to the film "Inception". You might remember in that film, the first time one of our protagonists is taken into a lucid dream, they're sitting outside at a French cafe and the agent says to the lady, isn't it funny how in dreams, you don't travel places, you just seem to arrive? The lady replies, yeah, I guess so. He then says, how did we get to this cafe? And the woman goes, well, we... Ah, and she becomes lucid. When practicing the Columbo method in the daytime, every time your investigation leads to a new discovery, wow, I wasn't expecting to see that. Or, wow, the bark on that tree looks really weird. You know what to do? You do a reality check. So you see how the Columbo method combines with the weird technique. If you do this enough during the day, you will end up dreaming about doing it. And when you dream about it, you'll become lucid. By bringing more mindful awareness into everyday life, we become more mindfully aware in our dreams too. So anything we can do to boost our awareness while we live will help to boost our awareness while we dream. I want to offer you the opportunity to be guided through the process of doing the Columbo method during the daytime. So, we've created an audio track that you can listen to while you're practicing the Columbo method. The aim of this exercise is not only to look closely as a way of fostering a habit, which will flow into your dreams, but also it's the opportunity to see how many reality checks you can do within a short period of time. All you need is to find an area containing some interesting things within it. It might be outside in a park you haven't visited before, or it might be up in your attic, a place you haven't looked closely before. Find a space, listen to the audio and enjoy being detective Columbo. and now here are your actions for today. I want you to spend the day looking closely, just like Columbo, and then share your experience with the tribe. Try and do the Columbo method guided meditation at least once before you go to sleep tonight. Secondly, be on the lookout for more awareness of details within your dream tonight. It's very common that the first night after you practice the Columbo method, you dream full of details. And finally, keep up the three Ds and reality checks. The Columbo method is as much a lucid living technique as it is a lucid dreaming one. Ideally, we want our practice of the Colombo method to become a way of life, we want to become a person who looks deeply, who touches things, who notices details, who isn't duped by illusion, or fooled by reality. If we can learn to live lucidly, then we will soon start dreaming that way too. See you tomorrow. And until then, lucid dreams and a lucid life.

====================

LESSON 16 – Meditation: The Columbo Method

The aim of this exercise is not only to look closely as a way of fostering a habit, which will flow into our dreams, but also it's the opportunity to see how many reality checks you can do in a short period of time. Find an area with some interesting things in it, maybe outside in a park, maybe a place you haven't visited before, maybe in your attic, anywhere that you haven't really explored closely before. I want you to walk around this area and become aware of your surroundings. Feel the ground beneath you. Become aware of your body as it moves through space. I want you to look closely at things, touch things, look behind things. Feel the texture of objects, and look closely at the detail. Notice colors, notice patterns, smell things, touch things. Look closely. And whenever you come across something that is unexpected, strange, or dreamlike, I want you to pause and to ask yourself, am I dreaming? And then answer that question by doing your chosen reality. Check. When your mind drifts off into chattering thoughts, or you feel yourself become distracted, bring your attention back to the task at hand. Looking closely. This is a six senses movement, meditation. Feel deeply look closely, become lucid in the dream. Every time you see something unexpected or weird, don't ignore it, acknowledge it, and ask yourself, could I be dreaming And answer the question with your chosen reality Check. Feel the level of your focus increasing. Feel how your senses become attuned to your increased level of attention. Can you notice how the colors are becoming brighter? Can you notice how you can hear more than you heard before? Allow your senses to open up to the Colombo method. Bring your awareness into your body too. How does your body feel when it looks closely? How does your body feel when it touches deeply? Continue exploring your environment, looking closely with deep attention. Anytime you notice something weird or dreamlike, don't forget. Ask yourself, am I dreaming? And then do your chosen reality check. And now, if you have time, continue this full body, six sense meditation for as long as you like. But if not, feel free to bring your awareness back to normal consciousness. Keeping the flavor of the Columbo method within your body, but returning to fully conscious awareness.

====================

LESSON 17 – The 4 Steps of Hypnagogic Affirmation
--------------------
<v ->Remember all that focus</v> that we put on the hypnagogic state last week? This is one of the techniques that we were prepping for. If ever there was a lucid dreaming technique that I had to choose above all others. It would be this one. This is the core lucid dreaming technique found in all the major lucid dream traditions. So it's got really good provenance. It's based on the hypnotic power of the hypnagogic state, plus the brain chemistry of our sleep cycle. It's called the Hypnagogic Affirmation Technique. Now I'm pretty sure you can imagine how this technique works. As you fall through the hypnagogic state you mentally recite a positive affirmation of your intent to gain lucidity. As we learned before, the hypnagogic state is very similar to the hypnotic state. So if we apply a suggestion or affirmation within it we may find it has the potential to work with hypnotic effect. Combine that with a direct entry, into dreaming that the hypnagogic state offers in the early hours and we have a very strong technique. Today, we'll learn the basic one. Tomorrow, we'll learn the Buddhist one, that's been refined over 1000 years of practice. The next day we'll learn the Mexican Toltec one which has been used by nagual and shamans in their lucid dreaming practice. And on the final day, we'll learn one that uses our dream plan Sankalpa to add power to the practice. The first thing to know is that this technique should best be practiced after at least four and a half to five hours sleep. You can do this technique as you first fall asleep at night. Nothing bad will happen, but I advise that when you first fall asleep tonight you continue the dream recall affirmation, and that you do this, the hypnagogic affirmation after awakening after at least four and a half to five hours of sleep. Why do we have to do this practice after waking up in the middle of the night? Remember, the first four and a half hours sleep is when you have most of your deep sleep periods. So we don't want to mess with that, otherwise we might be grumpy the next day. but the second four to five hours of sleep are when you have hypnagogic state that goes straight into long dream states. That's why we do the practice then. It gives us direct access from the hypnagogic into the dream. So yes, this practice may require you to set an alarm in the early hours of the morning. Or you can just use your bladder alarm if you usually wake up to pee, at least once a night. Anyone out there who's currently working with depression or anxiety though, just be aware that sometimes if we do a middle of the night wake up and our mind starts racing, it can be difficult to fall asleep again. So if you are currently working with depression or anxiety, maybe keep this particular technique on the back burner or at least take it easy for the time being. It might well be that it's perfectly fine and you fall asleep great, but just be aware that is a possibility. The important thing with this practice, is that you saturate your sleepy consciousness with the strong aspiration to have a lucid dream. When I was writing my first book, "Dreams of Awakening," I interviewed a female Tibetan Buddhist Lama named Lama Zangmo. In fact, she's the woman who runs the Buddhist center where I lived for seven years. In the interview, I asked her, "Lama, you've got over 11 years meditation retreat experience. If there was one tip that you could give people who are trying to learn to lucid dream, what would it be?" Now, I thought she was going to give me some esoteric Tibetan mantra or some hidden secret teaching, but actually, she said, "The one thing I'd say is you've got to be really fired up for it. If you're fired up for it, then lucidity will come." So again, it's all about enthusiasm and determination. So let's look at exactly how to practice the hypnagogic affirmation technique. Step one, after setting an alarm in the early hours, at least four and a half to five hours after you went to sleep, wake up and write down your dreams. Step two, put your dream diary away, turn off the light if it was on and enter back into the hypnagogic state. Step three, as you pass through the hypnagogic state, continuously recite in your own mind, the following affirmation, the next time I'm dreaming, I know that I'm dreaming, the next time I'm dreaming, I know that I'm dreaming, over and over in your mind as you pass through the hypnagogic. Recite the affirmation 21 times if you can. As we learned before, you can count 21 on your fingers, you can count 21 in your mind, or if the whole counting thing just seemed too neurotic, just recite the affirmation over and over for at least three or four minutes as you fall asleep. Try to recite the affirmation with real feeling and gusto. This is vital because without determination and enthusiasm, this technique simply won't work. Step four, once you've done your 21 recitations or recited the affirmation for at least a few minutes, allow yourself to fall asleep. So this technique shouldn't keep you awake for hours. You wake up, you write down your dreams. You enter back into the hypnagogic, reciting the affirmation, a few minutes later, you allow yourself to black out. The whole process is like 10 minutes max. The most important thing is not so much that you repeat the affirmation right up to the point where you enter the dream, although that would be great, but more that you saturate the last few minutes of your conscious awareness with that strong intention to gain lucidity aim for the affirmation, to be the last thing to pass through your mind before you black out. If you like, you can fall asleep tonight, guiding yourself through the hypnagogic affirmation technique. But if you prefer, I've recorded a guided audio meditation that you can listen to as you fall asleep, where I help you progress through the hypnagogic state, reciting the affirmation. So your actions for today, practice the hypnagogic affirmation technique tonight, after at least four and a half to five hours sleep. When you first fall asleep tonight, keep up the dream recall affirmation though, as well as the dream diaries, the Columbo mindset, the reality checks, all that good stuff. Tomorrow, we'll be learning about the Tibetan Buddhist tradition and the affirmation that they use. But for tonight, give this one a shot. Enjoy your lucid dreams.

====================

LESSON 17 - Meditation: The Hypnagogic Affirmation

Close your eyes and take a moment to bring your awareness into your body. Become aware of the movement of your breath. Notice how the body expands when you breathe in, and how the body relaxes. When you breathe out. Allow yourself to relax deeply into the hypnogogic state. And now we begin reciting our affirmation to have a lucid dream. The next time I'm dreaming, I know that I'm dreaming. The next time I'm dreaming, I know that I'm dreaming. The next time I'm dreaming, I know that I'm dreaming. The next time I'm dreaming, I know that I'm dreaming. The next time I'm dreaming, I know that I'm dreaming. The next time I'm dreaming, I know that I'm dreaming. The next time I'm dreaming, I know that I'm dreaming. The next time I'm dreaming, I know that I'm dreaming. The next time I'm dreaming, I know that I'm dreaming. The next time I'm dreaming, I know that I'm dreaming. The next time I'm dreaming, I know that I'm dreaming. The next time I'm dreaming, I know that I'm dreaming. The next time I'm dreaming, I know that I'm dreaming. The next time I'm dreaming, I know that I'm dreaming. The next time I'm dreaming, I know that I'm dreaming. The next time I'm dreaming, I know that I'm dreaming. The next time I'm dreaming, I know that I'm dreaming. The next time I'm dreaming, I know that I'm dreaming. The next time I'm dreaming, I know that I'm dreaming. The next time I'm dreaming, I know that I'm dreaming. The next time I'm dreaming, I know that I'm dreaming.

LESSON 18 – The 4 Steps of Bodhichitta Hypnagogic Affirmation
--------------------
<v ->I formally became a Buddhist at the age of 19</v> and I lived in a Tibetan Buddhist center for over seven years. So I know something of the tradition and practices and I can safely say that one of the most powerful and most complete lucid dreaming traditions in the world is found in Tibet. Where the best of both Indian Buddhist techniques and those from indigenous Bon Shamanism combined to create a very powerful practice called Dream Yoga. In week four, we'll explore the four stages of the Buddhist lucid dream tradition called Dream Yoga or Milam Naljor, as it's known in Tibet. Milam means dream and Naljor is translated as yoga, but actually it means like the natural state. But for now, let me share some of the basics of this ancient dream tradition. The Dream Yoga teachings were first brought into Tibet in the eight century by Guru Padmasambhava a historical figure who pioneered Buddhism in Tibet. In fact, Guru Padmasambhava was also the guy who wrote the famous 'Tibetan book of the dead.' And the link between lucid dreaming and conscious dying is very strong, as we'll look at in depth later on in the Quest. When I first started hanging out at Buddhist centers, I used to hear the monks and nuns talk about this term Dream Yoga and I wasn't really sure what it was. One day I heard a monk saying, "Oh, it's our word for a series of practices used within Tibetan Buddhism that have lucid dream training at their core." When I heard this, I piped up and I said to the monk, "Oh, I can lucid dream." And the monk said, "Really, you can lucid dream? What do you do in your lucid dreams?" Now, at this point, I was just using lucid dreaming for sex and skateboarding, so I was a bit embarrassed, and I went "Just like skateboarding mainly." And he went, "Skateboarding?" I said, "Well, yeah, why do amongst use lucid dreaming anyway?" And he said "Oh, we use lucid dreaming to explore the nature of reality. We use lucid dreaming to prepare for the moment of our death. We use lucid dreaming to do our spiritual practice while we sleep." So let's break down those three main reasons to practice lucid dreaming within Tibetan Buddhism. The first reason is as a spiritual practice. Lucid dreaming itself is seen as a spiritual practice. Because every time you train the mind to see through illusion, as you do in a lucid dream, that same habit of mind will flow into the waking state allowing you to penetrate illusion in both your nighttime and your daytime experiences. But we can also use the lucid dream state to do our spiritual practice by going into the lucid dream. "Oh, wow, I'm dreaming", and then doing your spiritual practice in the lucid dream. So literally meditating within the lucid dream, or doing your Buddhist chanting within the lucid dream, or doing a certain tantric practice within the lucid dream. The second main reason for lucid dreaming within the Tibetan Buddhist tradition is preparation for death and dying. Now, we're going to look at this in depth later on in the Quest, but know this, it's believed that if you can train the mind to be lucid and aware in your dreams, then that same habit can have flow into the death and dying experience. So that when the dreamlike hallucinatory experiences of death and dying occur, we might be able to recognize them lucidly and go not "Aha, I'm dreaming", but "Aha, I'm dying." I know it sounds crazy, but it's believed that if you can die consciously, this is the highest achievement of the spiritual practitioner. And the third main reason for practicing lucid dreaming within the Tibetan Buddhist tradition is exploration of the nature of reality. Anyone who's had a lucid dream will know how amazingly realistic it seems. So the lucid dream proves to us how brilliant the human mind is at creating and sustaining illusion. So it's believed that if the human mind can do that in our dreams, maybe it's doing it in the waking state too. And maybe what we think is an objectively existing, dualistic separate reality, is, in fact, more like a dreamlike shared illusion that we are co-creating into existence. This isn't a Dallas moment where Buddhism says, "Oh, you're going to wake up and it's all been a dream", but it says what we think to be reality is far more dreamlike and co-created than we might believe it to be. Within the Tibetan Buddhist tradition it's believed that once you become lucid you have seven times the power of mind. So, in the lucid dream state, whatever you're doing in the lucid dream, your consciousness is 700% more powerful than it is in the waking state. Which means any healing you do, any prayers you say, any meditation you engage in a lucid dream is seven times more powerful than doing those things in the waking state. Now, isn't that interesting? Maybe that in one statement explains things like placebo healing in the lucid dream, explain things like trauma integration in the lucid dream, explain things like getting great insights about our career path or how we should live our lives. Perhaps, it's nothing so mystical than the brain removed from its limits that it has in the waking state and engaging its full 700% capacity. Until he died a few years ago, the greatest living dream Yogi was a man named Namkhai Norbu Rinpoche. And there's a famous quote from him where he says, "One moment of meditation within a lucid dream is equal to a one week meditation retreat in the waking state." Now, whenever I say that quote, I always think, how do we do the maths on that? You know, how many days in the week are we talking about, how many hours a day are we meditating? Who knows? But the point is, he's saying it's a very powerful place to do your spiritual practice. So whether you're a Buddhist, Christian, atheist or none of the above, doing a spiritual practice within the lucid dream is said to be a very beneficial thing to do. And if you're thinking, "I don't have a spiritual practice." Practice kindness. Kindness is the universal spiritual practice. Go into the lucid dream and send love to someone who needs it, or send love to yourself, that might be the person who needs it most. Nowadays, there's loads of technology available to help you have lucid dreams. There's apps that you can download onto your phone. There's Quests like this that you can do. There's even sleep masks that you wear as you fall asleep that flash red light through your eyelids bright enough to penetrate the dream, indicating to you that you're dreaming and giving you a lucid dream. Some of these work, some of them don't but it's interesting to know that the use of technology for lucid dreaming goes all the way back to medieval Tibet. There was a technique where two monks would buddy up. One of the monks would lie on the floor and fall asleep. The other monk would sit meditating, looking at the sleeping monk's face. And when the meditating monk saw the eyes of the sleeping monk flicking, rapid eye movement, they knew it meant that they were dreaming. So they would either whisper into the ear or through a bamboo stick, whisper down the end of it with the other end in the ear of the sleeping monk saying something like, "Know that you're dreaming, recognize the dream state, have a lucid dream." So maybe that's something you can practice tonight with your partner or whoever you're lucky enough to share the bed with. However, do make sure you have their consent before you start whispering in their ear. Especially, if you're going to stick a bamboo stick down there. The technique that we're about to learn for our hypnagogic affirmation is based on a concept called Bodhichitta. So we need to look at Bodhichitta before we begin. Bodhichitta is a Sanskrit word. Actually, it's made up of two words, Bodhi, which means the awakened mind and Chitta, which means heart, but not literally the heart, but more like the heart of the matter, like the essence of something. So we could roughly translate Bodhichitta as heart of the awakened mind or the essence of awakening. And Bodhichitta affirmation would be an affirmation to do something, not just for our own selfish reasons, but for the benefit of others. The entire Buddhist path is based upon Bodhichitta aspiration, doing something not just for ourselves, but for the benefit of others. Moving away from selfishness, connecting to others and knowing that the most important spiritual practice of all is kindness. The following technique should be practiced after at least four and a half to five hours sleep. As we discussed yesterday, after four and a half to five hours your hypnagogic starts to lead straight into REM dreaming. So it's best to it then. Even the medieval yogis knew this and they used the power of their intention to wake themselves up automatically after four or five hours. So you could try that too, if you like. Let's learn how to practice the Tibetan Buddhist Bodhichitta hypnagogic affirmation technique. Step one, just like yesterday's technique, after setting an alarm after at least four and a half to five hours sleep, wake up and write down your dreams. Step two, put your dream diary away, turn off the light if it was on and drop back into the hypnagogic state. Step three, once you're in the hypnagogic state, continuously recite the Bodhichitta affirmation over and over in your mind. The affirmation is, I lucid dream for the benefit of all beings. I lucid dream for the benefit of all beings. Recite that over and over in your mind as you fall asleep. Again, 21 times if you can or at least for a few minutes. Step four, fall asleep with that deep intention to lucid dream for the benefit of all beings. Remember Bodhichitta is about moving out of selfishness and doing stuff based on kindness for others. Again, just like the previous technique you could choose to guide yourself through the Bodhichitta affirmation by yourself tonight, alone. But if you prefer, I've recorded a guided audio meditation that you can listen to as you fall asleep that will help guide you through the hypnagogic, reciting this Bodhichitta affirmation. And now your actions for today. Firstly, practice the Bodhichitta affirmation technique tonight after at least four and a half to five hours sleep. Remember, when you first fall asleep, good to do the dream recall affirmation, then practice this one after at least four and a half to five hours. And as always, keep up the dream diary, keep up the reality checks, keep up the Columbo mindset. So far we've got the basic lucid dream affirmation, that's good for everyone. We've got the Buddhist one, that might be better for the spiritual types and tomorrow we're going to learn the Mexican Toltec affirmation, which is great for the shamanic warriors among you. But until then, I wish you Bodhichitta dreams.

LESSON 19 – The 4 Steps of Toltec Hypnagogic Affirmation
--------------------
<v ->In 2014, I met a guy named Sergio Magana,</v> at a dream conference that we were both speaking at. He was described to me as the new Carlos Castaneda. So naturally, I gravitated towards him, we became friends, and in fact, we soon began teaching together, running joint workshops, exploring the similarities between my tradition, Tibetan Buddhism, and his tradition Toltec Mexihca shamanism. Other than Buddhism this is the tradition in which I've received the most training and the lucid dream practices within the Toltec tradition are as powerful as they are ancient. Let's learn one together and step onto the path of the dream warrior. Before we learn this technique, it's important to know something about the history of the tradition. So first of all, let's look at Toltec. The Toltec were a group of shamanic practitioners that existed hundreds of years ago in ancient Mexico. Toll means measure and the Toltec were the people of the measure. They use astrological measures applied to breathe practices as a way to change consciousness. Mexihca means people of the navel of the moon. And in fact, a Mexi-can is not somebody who necessarily lives in Mexico. It was a practitioner of the shamanic practices of the Mexihca. Because interestingly when the Spanish invaded Mexico was one place name they didn't change. So Mexihca are people of the navel of the moon. Within the Toltec Mexihca there are five core practices. One of them is breathwork. It's like a former Mexican pranayama breathing through certain nostrils at certain rates to have an effect on consciousness. The second is the use of masks and mirrors to disidentify our sense of self. The third one is dance using certain movements of the body and musical rhythms to have an effect on consciousness. The fourth is plant medicine that has a psychophysical effect on the body and the mind. And the fifth practice is lucid dreaming. When I first met Sergio I started doing some of his practices. Some of them include masks and mirrors, where you stand in front of a mirror wearing the mask of certain animals. Not only as a way to help you disidentify with your sense of self, but also as a way to bring these animal archetypes into your lucid dreams. The first time I knew this had really worked was when I was in a lucid dream and I suddenly realized my body felt different, I'd transformed. I looked up and I saw a horn. I looked down and I saw these little trotters and I realized I transformed into a unicorn. I mean, when I was doing the mask and mirror work I wasn't using a unicorn mask. But I can only assume that my dreaming mind had gone, "Look, I'm going to transform you into an animal, Charlie and the most fabulous animal I can think of is a fricking unicorn." The following affirmation technique makes use of the term dream warrior. Just like yesterday's technique used the term bodhicitta. We need to make sure we know what we mean by dream warrior before we begin. Some of you might be triggered by this thinking dream warrior, isn't that about violence and fighting? No, within the Toltec Mexihca tradition, lucid dreaming is said to be the path of the warrior. Not because the lucid dream encourages us to fight aspects of our shadow or unconscious, but because it takes the discipline and courage of a warrior to have a lucid dream. Think about it. Think about the discipline I'm asking you to have. To wake up at five o'clock in the morning to write down your dreams. To go around all day, checking your hands, being aware of reality. To write down your dreams. This is a disciplined practice. You want to have a lucid dream. You need to have the discipline of a warrior. And secondly, this is a courageous practice. It said it takes the courage of a warrior to know that whatever you see in the lucid dream is you. When we start meeting angels and spiritual figures in your lucid dreams, it's very easy for us to go, these are my inner angels, these are my inner spiritual figures. But when we start meeting our inner monsters, our inner demons, it takes great courage to say, "Yes, that's me too." And not to slip into a dualistic view of, "Oh, it's something from the collective unconscious," or, "Oh, it's a dark Shaman entering my mind." So this is why we are dream warriors. It takes the discipline of a warrior to have a lucid dream and the courage to accept that whatever we meet in the lucid dream is us. And that's okay. So again, the following technique should be practiced after at least four and a half to five hours sleep. Now the Mexicans, rather than using an alarm clock they used to use something else to wake them up after four hours sleep. They would use fig wine. Now fig wine is a diuretic. So if you drink some before bed you'll going to need to pee a few hours later. So what they used to do is before a lucid dreaming session, they'd pour fig wine into a kind of a small shot glass. And they'd offer one to the moon that offer one to the earth and then you could take one shot yourself. You could take a second, but if you took three shots that were disrespectful. And then after one or two shots of fig wine, you'd fall asleep and naturally about four or five hours later your bladder would wake you up. So if you don't fancy an alarm clock tonight and you can get your hands on some Mexican fig wine you could always try that. So here's how to practice the Toltec Mexihca dream warrior affirmation technique. Step one, just like yesterday's technique after setting an alarm or using your fig wine, wake up after at least four and a half to five hours sleep and write down your dreams. Step two, put your dream diary away, turn off the light if it was on and enter the hypnagogic. Step three, once in the hypnagogic state continuously recite the dream warrior affirmation over and over again in your mind. The affirmation is this. I am a warrior of the dream state. I stay lucid and conscious while dreaming. I am a warrior of the dream state. I stay lucid and conscious while dreaming. Again recite the affirmation 21 times if you can, with real feeling and gusto like a warrior. This is vital because without that warrior mindset, again the technique simply won't work. And step four, fall asleep, ready to get lucid. Again, just like the last two versions of this technique. If you like, you can fall asleep, reciting the affirmations by yourself. But if you'll prefer, I've recorded a guided audio meditation that you can listen to as you fall asleep. Where I'm helping you, guiding you through the affirmation and through the hypnagogic. And now your actions for today. Firstly, practice the Toltec warrior affirmation tonight, after at least four and a half to five hours sleep. Of course, when you first fall asleep good idea to be doing the dream recall affirmation and don't forget dream diary, Columbo mindset, reality checks, all that good stuff. Also it'll be really cool, if you could check in with the tribe and tell them about your progress and lucid dreaming. Remember those tribe quest dream circles don't forget. Tomorrow we're going to learn the final variation of this technique. One in which you combine the power of your own dream plan Sankalpa with the power of the hypnagogic state. Until then dream well dream warriors.

LESSON 20 – The Multiple Wake-Ups Technique for Lucid Dreaming
--------------------
<v ->Both the Buddhist</v> and the shamanic traditions hold a lot of power. And so using their affirmations, helps us to tap in the power of those lineages. However, the power of your own intention and the power of our of why we want to have a lucid dream can be just as effective as any ancient lineage. In this technique, we use the essence of our dream plan as the affirmation itself. So it's not only a great way to embed the dream plan into our unconscious memory, but it also encourages the dream plan to manifest quicker too. As with the previous techniques, this one should be practiced after at least four and a half to five hours sleep. The Buddhists use the power of the human mind. The Mexicans use the power of fig wine and we, as modern humans, can use the power of the alarm clock. So however you want to wake up, just make sure you wake up in the second half of the night. So let's look at how to practice the dream plan affirmation technique. Step one, just like yesterday's technique, after setting an alarm and the early hours, wake up and write down your dreams. Step two, dream diary away, light off if it was on, enter hypnagogic again. Step three, once in the hypnagogic state, continuously recite an affirmation that combines the first one we learnt, the next time I'm dreaming, I know that I'm dreaming, with the essence of your dream plan or San kalpa. For example, the next time I'm dreaming, I know that I'm dreaming when I know that I'm dreaming I, and then insert the essence of your dream plan or San kalpa, such as, meet my inner child or the next time I'm dreaming, I know that I'm dreaming. When I know that I'm dreaming I heal my elbow or the next time I'm dreaming, I know that I'm dreaming. When I know that I'm dreaming, I ask for spiritual advice. Whatever your dream plan is, you add in the essence of that dream plan, or perhaps the San kalpa itself, to the affirmation. As always, you recite at 21 times if you can, or at least for a few minutes, as you fall off to sleep. Step four, fall asleep mindfully, with a deep intention to have a lucid dream and to engage your dream plan. As with the previous three versions of this technique, if you want, you can go into the hypnagogic by yourself tonight, but if you'd prefer, I've recorded a guided audio meditation to help guide you through the process and into the hypnogogic. Now that we've learnt four different variations of the hypnagogic affirmation technique, I want to share with you another technique that will give you four different chances to practice them. It's called multiple wake-ups. Within both the Tibetan Buddhist and Mexican dream traditions, the yogis and Sharman soon discovered that if you only go to bed once and wake up once in the morning, you only have one chance to get lucid, but you wake multiple times, then you have multiple opportunities. Remember how our sleep cycle works. The first three cycles, so the first four and a half hours, are mainly deep sleep with short bits of dreaming but after four and a half hours, it flips. And we start to have long dream periods and our entry into the dream periods is much quicker. So, the multiple wake-ups technique harnesses this power of the dream cycle. Essentially, you allow yourself to sleep for at least four and a half to five hours, and then you wake up, fall asleep for a 90 minute cycle, before waking up again and falling asleep for another 90 minute cycle, however many times you want. On the lucid dreaming immersive retreats that I run, this multiple wake-ups technique is one that really separates the group. Some people love it. They see it gives them multiple chances to have lucid dreams. Other people hate it 'cause they don't want to be woken up in the middle of the night by me. On the lucid dreaming retreats, people spend the first half of the night sleeping alone in their rooms. Let's say from 10:30 to 3:30, they're just sleeping. However, at 3:30, they wake up and they move into the sacred sleeping area where they have bed number two set up, and then they hand themselves over to me as their human alarm clock. I guide them through the hypnagogic state, back in the dream. And then 90 minutes later, I wake them up again with the sound of Tibetan bells. Then, they spend five minutes writing down their dreams and then I guide them back into the hypnagogic, back into sleep. Then 90 minutes later, again I wake them. They write down their dreams, back asleep. 90 minutes later, I wake them again and then it's breakfast time. This gives us not one session of lucid dreaming but four sessions a night, quadrupling your chances of engaging the practice and having a lucid dream. Now of course, we're not on one of my lucid dreaming retreats, but if you want, you can still try this technique yourself. Give yourself at least four and a half to five hours sleep. Then wake up, write down your dreams reset your alarm for 90 minutes later and fall back asleep during the lucid dreaming technique. Then 90 minutes later, the alarm goes off. You wake up, you write down your dreams. You reset the alarm for another 90 minute session and you fall asleep during the lucid dreaming technique. You can do this once a night, twice a night, or even have the full four sessions that we have on our lucid dreaming retreat. See what works for you. The timing of your schedule is totally up to you. On the retreats, we usually do the first session, 10:30 PM to 3:30 AM. The second session, 3:30 AM to 5:00 AM. The third session, 5:00 AM to 6:30 AM and then the final session, 6:30 to 8:00 AM. Of course, you can work out your own schedule. It's totally up to you. Now I'm not you practice this technique every night of the week. That's going to mess with your sleep cycle, so don't do it. But maybe once a week, twice a week, you can think of it like a lucid dreaming date night, a night where you really spend time with you and your dreamer. Remember though, if you're currently working with depression, anxiety or racing thoughts, this technique might not be the one for you. Feel free to give it a go, but take it easy. And now our actions for today. First of all, practice the dream plan affirmation technique at least once tonight, after at least four and a half to five hours sleep, you get it. Secondly, practice if you like, 'cause it's totally optional, the multiple wake-ups technique. Maybe you could do two wake-ups, three, whatever you like but however many you do, every time you fall asleep, be sure to try out your favorite hypnagogic affirmation technique, any of the four we've learnt. Be sure to keep up the three D's, dream diaries, dream recall, dream signs, be doing your reality checks during the day and keep up that Colombo mindset. Also, I'd like you to check in with the tribe and share, how is your third week going? Have you had any lucid dreams yet? Have you seen your hand change in your dreams? Have you had any interesting Colombo moments? Let the tribe know. Okay, so we've now got four variations of the hypnagogic affirmation technique down. You can either practice all of them or you can just choose your favorite and focus on that one, it's totally up to you. Some of you might find you really resonate with the warrior affirmation. Others of you might not and you think, nah, I like the dream plan one. Whichever one's your favorite, feel free to focus on that. The main thing is that you do the hypnagogic affirmation technique regularly, every night if you can, or at least three times a week from now on. And finally, well done, you completed week three, you are truly a warrior of the dream state and like all good warriors, you need your rest. So tomorrow is our day off. Well kind of, apart from the weekly quiz, the pep talk and of course everybody's favorite, the bedtime story, until then, sweet dreams.

====================

LESSON 20 – Meditation: Dream Plan Affirmation Meditation

Close your eyes and take a moment to bring your awareness into your body. Become aware of the movement of your breath. Notice how the body expands when you breathe in, and how the body relaxes when you breathe out. Allow yourself to relax deeply into the hypnogogic state. And now it's time to recite our affirmation to have a lucid dream. The next time I'm dreaming, I know that I'm dreaming. When I know that I'm dreaming I, and then insert the essence of your dream plan. The next time I'm dreaming, I know that I'm dreaming. When I know that I'm dreaming I, and then insert the essence of your dream plan. The next time I'm dreaming, I know that I'm dreaming. When I know that I'm dreaming I, and then insert the essence of your dream plan. Continue your own pace for the next few minutes. Or do 21 recitations. The next time I'm dreaming. I know that I'm dreaming. When I know that I'm dreaming I, and then insert the essence of your dream plan.

====================

LESSON 21 – Summary of Your Third Week
--------------------
<v ->So you made it to the end of week three.</v> Well done, reality check. Okay, we're in the same dream together, at least. So today is a implementation and review day. It's your chance to catch up and review any lesson that you've missed. So if there was a day that you didn't quite get or a day you had to skip for whatever reason, please do go back now and re-watch those days. So that before we move on, we're all at the same level. And again, today is about fun, inspiration and relaxation. And relaxation is really important here, because it's often at the end of week three that people become a little bit neurotic about whether they're doing it right. And so the bedtime story tonight is all about keeping a sense of humor and worrying less about doing it right and more about doing it from your heart. So now it's time for the week three quiz. Without checking back on the previous lessons of the quest, I want you to answer the following questions from memory. Fingers on the buzzers. Question one. How many reality checks should we be aiming to do each day? Yep, 10 if you can. Question number two, apart from looking at your hands, what else can you use as a visual reality check? Yeah, I'll accept anything made up of a detailed pattern, such as digital displays, written text or even the pattern on someone's shirt. Question number three. In the Tibetan Buddhist tradition, how many times more powerful is the mind said to be once we become lucid? Yep, seven times more powerful. Question four. Why do we sleep for at least four and a half hours before we start the wake-ups? Yeah, because the first four and a half hours are mainly deep sleep with only a little bit of dream and we don't want to disturb our deep sleep. And finally, question number five. Lucid dreaming is a warrior's practice because it requires two mental qualities, what are they? Yep, courage and discipline. And this really was the week when we started to get to the heart of the practice, with reality checks, the weird technique, hypnagogic affirmation technique. These are three of the central methods in any lucid dreamers toolbox. Now that our toolbox is filling up, you might be thinking, what techniques am I supposed to be doing and when? So let's do a lowdown on the technique so far. Dream recall. The dream recall affirmation can be done every single night and writing in the dream diary can be done every single morning. That's standard. As for spotting dream signs, eventually being aware of your dream signs will form part of the process of writing down your dreams. As each time you write into your dream diary, you start to notice the dream signs as you write them. As for reality checks, your use of the weird technique needs to become so frequent that your friends or family need to start asking you, "Dude, what's wrong with your hands?" If they haven't started asking you what's wrong with your hands, you probably haven't been doing it enough. So make sure you're constantly doing the weird technique. And finally, the hypnagogic affirmation technique, whichever of the four variations you choose, this can be practiced as much as you like after at least four and a half hours of sleep and at least three times a week, if possible. If you're currently managing to do all this, then you are hitting the ball out the park and if not, that's cool too. Take your time and celebrate whatever progress you are making. Now I know that some of you have already been having lucid dreams. So needless to say, once you've completed your current dream plan, just go back and write another. And for those of you who are yet to become lucid, no worries at all, this is a cumulative process and it can take quite a while. It's a deep process and it's often those with the deepest minds who take the longest time to get lucid. Maybe you haven't had any lucidity yet, but maybe you've been able to decode a really powerful dream. Maybe you haven't seen your hand change in your dream yet, but you have had a deep lucid living moment while practicing the Colombo method. All of this is great. Celebrate whatever successes you've been having. And remember, even if you manage to have a lucid dream every night of your life, 80% of your dream experience will still be non-lucid. If you ask me my top five dream experiences of all time. Okay, number one is a lucid dream, is that one where I visited Dewachen in the Varnek realm, but number two, three and four are actually non-lucid dreams. They were dreams where the message the dream was giving me was so powerful, so deep, so profound. It almost didn't want me to become lucid. It was as if the dream was like, now Charlie, just sit over that, don't fly. Don't call out Sankalpa, just witness what we're showing you. So it's not only about lucid dreams. It's about connecting to the dreamer with lucid awareness. So now your actions for today. Firstly, catch up on any content that you've missed. Secondly, keep up the three D's and reality checks as per normal, but tonight maybe give yourself a night off from lucid dreaming and fall asleep with the relaxation of my bedtime story. Until then, sweet dreams.

LESSON 21 – Meditation: Bedtime Story: “Vajra Killaya, Vajra Killoya”

Get into bed, get comfy, and allow yourself to drift off to sleep. While I tell you a bedtime story, I want to tell you a story about a man, a mountain, and a mantra. There was once a meditating yogi living in a cave up a mountain on an island in the middle of a lake. This meditating yogi had become famous throughout the whole of Tibet, and one day a young monk decided to go and visit him. The young monk got into a boat and rode across the lake to the island. He walked up the mountain on the island and up to the cave, and in the cave he found the meditating yogi reciting over and over again, the mantra of his chosen deity. Vara Kalay. The monk appeared into the cave and saw the yogi practicing. After a few minutes, the monk realized something. The famous yogi was mispronouncing the mantra of vara. He heard the yogi reciting it, saying On vara hung, on vara hung. But the actual mantra should be said on vara hung. The young monk couldn't just stand there and watch this happening. He had to say something so quietly he entered the cave and tapped the meditating yogi on the shoulder. The yogi turned round and looked at the monk with Surprise, yes, my son, how can I help you? The yogi said, to which the young monk replied, master, with all due respect, I think you've been making a mistake. The mantra of vara is pronounced on vara. Hung not on. Vara lawyer hung, really, the meditating yogi replied, I've been saying it wrong my whole life. For 30 years I've been sitting here meditating on this deity. Are you telling me this whole time I've been saying the mantra incorrectly? Well, yes, I'm sorry, master, but that does seem to be the case. And with that, the young monk left the cave, walked down the mountain onto the island, got into his boat, and rode across the lake. When he was about halfway across the lake, he heard something. It was the voice of the meditating yogi. The young monks spun round, and as he did so there was the yogi walking across the surface of the water, walking up to his boat. The yogi said to him, excuse me, my son, but how do you pronounce the mantra again? With that, the young monk was amazed and realized that the power of the mantra was found. Not in the pronunciation, but in the devotion of its recitation. Just as the story of the monk, the yogi, and the vaai mantra shows us the power of this practice is found in the devotion of intention, not in whether we pronounce it the right way. So however you are doing your lucid dreaming practice, that's fine as long as you're doing it from your heart. Don't get too caught up in the ifs or buts of each technique. Just make sure you are practicing from your heart. That's how you'll have lucid dreams by acting from the energy of your heart. And now with the energy of that story in your body, close your eyes if they're still open. Allow yourself to release into the support of your bed and relax deeply into sleep. Allow your breathing to slow and your mind to relax deeply into sleep. Allow any tension in your body to dissolve as you exhale and relax deeply into sleep. Dream lucidly and fruitfully. Relax deeply into sleep.

LESSON 21 – Experience Lucid Dreaming Bonus Live Call #3: Sleep Weirdness & Reality Checks

Hello, everyone, and welcome to Experience Lucid Dreaming's live bonus call number three. We've got five of these over the four weeks of this quest. We are now in the beginning of our fourth week. We've completed three weeks. And this week, we are talking about weird things and reality checks. So you submitted some of your reality checks or your weird things this week in the tribe. So thank you so much. We're going to have Charlie come on and talk about and teach a little bit about that. So welcome to the call, Charlie. Thanks for joining us again. Coming live from London, here's Charlie Morley. Thank you for having me. It's brilliant to be here for another live call with all you dreamers, questers, and tribe members. So week three was the week that I was predicting. we'd have the most kind of entry into lucid dreaming. And so far, as far as my Instagram inbox goes, that has been true. So we're going to be absolutely celebrating people's lucidity. But also week three can sometimes be a time where we're like, dude, where's my lucid dream? I've been doing this for three weeks. I'm still struggling here. So we're going to look at that too. Remember, all is welcome. this is not about kind of who has the lucid dream quickest this is about learning something that will decondition us out of a sense of believing illusion in both our daytime and our dream time and move us into a sense of insight and wisdom in both our daytime and our dream time so that takes a while that may take more than 30 days but we are absolutely planting the seeds of co -creation and manifestation within these 30 days that will lead to lucidity um so what i want to do as always is just run through the week we've just had add a little bit uh little kind of insights tips techniques and then we are going to have a sharing of some of the weird things you guys have seen and then we'll get to the q a because i think the questions are most important with the kind of live interaction with you all okay so this was the week where we looked at reality checks the weird technique colombo method okay let's look at these first right so um reality checks in the dream time obviously doing the check whatever it is the hand check for example and doing them in the daytime as the weird technique as a way to get into the habit of them flowing into our dreams now the thing with um reality checks is i think i do make this joke in the quest if your friends or family haven't asked you what's up with your hands you probably aren't doing it enough now when you first get into reality checks it almost needs to be a kind of Almost obsessive. I'm not saying be obsessive with it, but almost obsessive. Like unless you're hitting 10 valid reality checks a day, like seeing something weird. Oh, weird. Could I be dreaming? Then the third step, checking the hand, doing the finger pull, whatever you like. Unless you're hitting like 10 or more a day, it's unlikely they're going to flow into your dreams. So when you first start, you need to be like really passionate about this. You cannot do reality checks too much. but you can do them wrong. So a story I don't think I told in the quest was the first time I taught in South Africa. So I've got two main teachers, La Mieshe Rinpoche, my Buddhist teacher, and a brilliant man called Rob Nairn, who is a meditation teacher and Jungian psychologist. And he was based in Zimbabwe. So a lot of my early international gigs were in South Africa. And the first time I was teaching there... I was teaching about reality checks and the weird technique. And I was saying how you've got to do them kind of every time something weird happens, every time there's synchronicity. And then this guy puts his hand up in the front row, young guy. And he says, can we do reality checks? Oh, should we do a reality check every time we hear a new piece of information? You know, a piece of information we weren't expecting to hear. And I was like, yeah, man, good idea, good idea. For the rest of the retreat, I mean, every two minutes, this dude was in the front row. doing a reality check I mean it was kind of distracting right he was doing them all the time but I'll tell you what that guy became really good at lucid dreaming really quickly and now god probably 10 years later that guy is a professional lucid dreaming teacher you can look him up he's called Dave Tyfield if you want to learn lucid dreaming in South Africa I think he's the only professional lucid dreaming teacher I know in South Africa and that was the kid on the front row who got really passionate about doing reality checks so you You can't do too many of them, but you can get them wrong. So really go into that. And again, as I always say, you can get lucid tonight using just this technique. If the wake -ups are getting you down, if you're like, dude, I don't want to keep on writing my dream diary, I don't want to keep waking up three, four times a night, don't do that. Just focus on reality checks. You can get lucid from this technique alone, but it requires something of you. From now until you go to sleep tonight or whatever time zone you're in, the next time you go to sleep, you need to be switched on and every time something strange happens every time something synchronistic happens anytime there's a glitch on this call or i miss a word or someone's camera doesn't work we should all be doing at the same time collectively hitting that reality check whatever it is so i really you know can't stress that enough reality checks are the golden ticket to lucid dreaming but i'm always surprised how many people don't do them When we do the live retreats, I come down in the morning with a fake moustache on. I come down in the morning with my t -shirt on backwards. I check and I sit in front of 50 people and maybe two of them are like, and do the check. While 48 of them just sit there. And I'm like, guys, come on. I'm trying to help you here. Where have I grown this moustache from? Or whatever it is. I used to be clean shaven. So reality checks, really go for it. You cannot do it too much. Next thing. Oh, Columbo method. Okay. So the way I presented the Colombo method in the quest was like as an exercise. So I think you have that kind of 10 minute audio that you play through your headphones, then walk around a park or a new place in your house and really explore deeply, touch things, smell things. Really, the Colombo method is about engaging a new attitude towards life. Essentially, it's about learning how to be a child again. Okay, let's look at my background, full of all crazy Buddhist -y stuff, right, okay? If there was a child in here right now, like a five -year -old child, they would be straight over there, picking up the crystals, hitting the singing bowl, you know, putting the Buddha on their head. They'd be touching, they'd be smelling, they'd be feeling, they'd be experiencing. That's kind of the attitude we want to have for life. Now, if you're British, like me, this is something that does not come easy. You know, British people are, you know, very reserved like this. You want to be the opposite. Don't be British. You know, when it comes to Colombo, touch things, explore things. I mean, obviously not other people, give them their space. But when you're out, be someone who smells the flowers. Be someone who runs their hand across the wall as you walk past it to feel the texture. It's about a new attitude towards life where you look closely and where you really experience how dreamlike this reality can be. Out of all the techniques. you come across in the quest the one you may think is least buddhist is probably the colombo method you'll think well come on they didn't have 1970s tv in tibet actually colombo method okay i've given it a silly name but colombo method is very similar to an ancient 1000 year old tibetan buddhist practice where you you kind of basically do the same as i've explained in colombo but you do it for extended periods of time like days and weeks imagine like two weeks of doing colombo method constantly so it becomes a absolutely five or six cents meditation ah the hypnagogic affirmations okay so this was another big thing of this week um obviously i've explained how they work feel free to write your own one Maybe there was something about the warrior affirmation you really liked, but also you're really into the bodhicitta, the Buddhist aspect. Combine them. Make your own one. Write your own affirmations. You know, who am I to write an affirmation for you? If you've got a better one that works with you in your own language or a combination of several languages you speak, you go for it. You know, there are no rules to this. The only rules are kindness, compassion, wisdom, insight. As long as you're sticking within those parameters, you go for it. Make up your own affirmations. Oh, and not way back to bed. What did we have this week? We had multiple wake ups. OK, we need to discuss this. Multiple wake ups are not for everyone. They are a way of maximizing the night. So if you fall asleep once and you wake up once in the morning, you've got one chance. If some crazy guy like me encourage you to wake up four times a night, you've just quadrupled your chances of having a lucid dream. You find the technique in the Mexican shamanic traditions. You find it in the Tibetan Buddhist traditions. So this isn't something I've kind of made up. This is a really old technique and it does maximize your chances. When we do the lucid dream retreats in real life, you do that four nights in a row, waking up three or four times. However, we don't do it all the time. The reason my retreats aren't like a week. in length is because after four nights of doing multiple wake -ups people are done they're done but they've had a lot of lucid dreams so please balance it like that multiple wake -ups maybe just do once a week or once every two weeks in a kind of a lucid dreaming date night if you're currently working with depression or anxiety or heartbreak or grief multiple wake -ups is not a good idea because you know as soon as you wake up in the night the minds start chatting, the demons come out. And of course, we want to embrace our demons with love, absolutely. But in this case, we also need to be getting some sleep. So if you do find that the wake -ups, whether it's the multiple wake -ups technique, or even just a single wake -up that you're doing for the hypnagogic affirmation, if that is causing you anxiety, if it is affecting your sleep, if you cannot get back to sleep afterwards, drop the technique. Don't worry about it. There are techniques coming this next week, which... Yeah, they require wake ups, but things like falling asleep consciously technique you can do in the kind of late hours of the morning after like six or seven hours sleep. So that one might be better to try. Couple more things on this week. OK, yeah. So as I was saying, a lot of people this week had lucid dreams, which is brilliant. I've seen people writing them in the. um you know discussion chats seeing people messaging me emailing me so that is brilliant and we celebrate that but also had a few people this week messaging me and someone i spoke to yesterday actually at the lucid dream drop -in who felt that actually they've been kind of having less progress than they had before a couple of people who felt that they started with some pretty good dream recall but since they've started the quest they feel they've actually declined that is pretty common for people who are already have a dream uh have kind of a dream practice why would that be surely if you've already got a dream practice it should progress you the way i think of it is sometimes like i don't know my pin number for all my cards sometimes if i think about it i don't know the pin number but if i relax my body knows the pin number When I do my kickboxing practice, right? Sometimes the big strike sequences, if I think about them, I can't do them. If I relax and step back into flow state, I can flow and I can do it. It's a bit like that with a dream work. So if you have found that actually the more you've been concentrating on it, the less dream recall you have, your homework is this. Tonight, don't keep a dream diary. Don't do any practice. Just relax for a night. Maybe tomorrow night as well. It's a bit like a relationship. let the dreamer come to you not you're neglecting your dream you're just saying okay over to you you know you come to me now just step back a little bit for many people that will work because sometimes i think we focus so much on it there's a kind of a performance anxiety that can happen to some of us especially if we've already got a dream practice whereas if we're new to this we just keep on progressing progressing so yeah I think that's all I wanted to say. But before we move on to the sharing, let's do another thing in the chat. So if you got lucid this last week, I want you to write lucid in the chat. So if you can write lucid in the chat, let's see. Okay, lots of lucids coming through. I can't count, but over probably 20, we're probably on 30 now. Oh, my husband did, I saw that one. You know, this is quite common. very common um people like let's say that if it's a petronormative relationship let's say the wife is uh doing the quest or doing a course with me um and their the husband might get lucid before the wife because the wife's telling the husband all this stuff she's learning on the quest but the husband uh isn't kind of attached to it about having a lucid dream like oh right cool so you look at your hand and you fall asleep you do that you do that um so often the husband will get lucid before the wife and vice versa and whatever kind of relationship you're in whoa super lucid semi lucid still lucid lucids coming through brilliant uh my next thing who here has seen their hand change in lucid dream maybe it led to lucidity maybe not but who has seen their hand change if so write hands in the chat hands hands hands hands hands it's so weird watching the chat kind of me did one hand hands change great great great and the third one our third kind of category of celebration And by the way, that's brilliant. If you saw your hands change, that is amazing. Whether you got lucid or not, absolutely brilliant. The next category is, oh, who here has had an insight through a dream in the last week? Lucid, non -lucid, whatever. Who here has had an insight from one of their dreams in the last week? If so, write insight in the chat. Already coming through lots. Oh, that might be our biggest and quickest category, I think. from the speed those are coming through amazing and you know me i support this i'm the lucid dreaming teacher who's not obsessed with lucid dreams which is weird i'm obsessed with people having insights people gaining knowledge people becoming more kind more wise through the practice of lucid dreaming and sometimes that means not having lucid dreams it means having dreams of insight so i absolutely celebrate that Okay, that is enough from me. You guys have to listen to me chat every single day through your phones or your laptops. So I'm sure you're done with me. Let's move over to Ezra and we will have the sharing of this week. All right. So would you like to bring someone on that has a lucid dream and or had an insight? We want to do that first. Yes, Ezra. Let's do that. So I mean, about a gazillion people wrote lucid. So I'll let you choose. But let's have someone on. Let's just hear what they did in their lucid dream anyway. Yeah, so if you've had a lucid dream and that triggered some insight, let us know in the chat right now, insight. And if you're willing to share. All right, let's see. Okay, Shara, I'll bring on Shara. Shara, I'm promoting you to a panelist. You can turn on your microphone and your camera and you can share your lucid dream and insight with us. Just remember to keep it short and concise so that we can get to plenty of Q &A as well. Welcome to the call, Shara. Hi, I'm trying to unmute. Can I unmute? yes yes we can hear you hi My heart's pounding. I'm so excited. Hi, Charlie. Hi, Ezra. Hi, everybody. So I'll be straight to the point. So I made my dream sign animals because I seem like I have a lot of animals in my dreams. So a few nights ago or early morning, I am dreaming and first there's a dead cat and my own cat is lying on top of it. I'm like, that's weird. And then suddenly appears a little black puppy, really cute puppy. I'm like, oh, he's so cute. And I'm in some apartment that's not my own apartment with my son. I have an 11 year old son. And then like, oh, that's it. And then suddenly appears a little French bulldog. I'm like, oh, another cute dog. And then I'm like going, this is suspicious. So then I hear a clop clop clop clop clop clop. And I look up and a giant black stallion is walking down the hall of my apartment. And I went. animals animals i'm dreaming like and i'm i'm so excited and i'm like what am i supposed to do next and i start yelling sankalpa sankalpa i'm like no i'm actually supposed to yell what it is not the thing but i was like so like excited so then i yelled heal my uh relationship trauma and everything went black the whole scene disappeared went black and lights started flashing colorful lights and like this beautiful just flashing all over i was gone my son was gone the apartment was gone it was just this giant black backdrop and it was flashing lights and i'm like just sitting like all colorful it was beautiful and i'm like what what is this and then and then it's and then up in the middle of the center of the the pattern it looked like i'm i'm in the medical field so so you know we use what symbols to us so it popped up an mri of like a slice of a brain i'm like oh that's my brain which to me like again similarly brain mind you know so i was like oh these lights and this thing this experience is healing my brain and mine And I didn't know if it sounded like so trippy and I've not really tripped in light. Like I'm not someone, I just haven't done that yet. So I didn't know if that's what tripping was like or, or if it was normal or not. I don't know either, but so I've heard, so I've heard. But I didn't know if it was just, I didn't know. And then I had dreams the rest of the night. I don't know if they happened before or after I've got to go check my, my dream diary of things about me. destroying the attachment with my ex and having a group of people helping me with like these cars with these like weapons on them and and with the the funny part with the insight is i had pete davison who's that actor on snl Saturday Night Live and he's going no no you can't destroy it no you've got to stay attached to it don't destroy it And they wrapped him up, they tied him up so he couldn't stop the destruction. And I'm like, why Pete Davidson? And I'm like, because he's a self -proclaimed addict. He's like attached. He's like a marijuana addict. Great decoding. So I'm like, the addict in me, whatever's addicted to the drama or the trauma or the chaos, didn't want to let go. And the rest of the group and the rest of me and the dream was like, no, you got to destroy this thing and move on. So I don't know if that's what you meant, but that was my experience. Okay, I'm so glad we got you on. I'm so glad this is like on a recorded webinar because you just hit like so many techniques within there. You had reality checks going on. Actually, you got the whole question there. You located a dream sign. You then set the intention. You had the dream sign manifestation method. Set the intention. I want to have animals in my dream because they always get me to lucidity. The animals appeared. You got lucid. Did you do a reality check to get lucid or just spontaneous? Well, I know I just looked at the horse and I'm like, there's no way there's a horse walking down my apartment. Perfect. So Colombo method, you look at the evidence. The evidence is there's a horse in my apartment. I'm definitely dreaming. So you've used your third technique there. Then the lovely thing you were so concerned with saying you were Sankalpa, right? You just yelled Sankalpa, which is brilliant and so sweet. And then you came back with, oh, no, what is my Sankalpa? And what was it? Heal relationship trauma. Oh, dude, I mean, what a brilliant Sankalpa. And yeah, we all need that one. I think that'll make that my next dream plan as well. So brilliant Sankalpa. And the fact the response you got from the dream, complete blackout. Then you go into these lights. Now, this is very interesting. This is another thing to go into. There's a Buddhist thing called the dazzling darkness, which is where it's kind of like the space beyond the dream. where all manifestations all projections end and it's just these kind of lights appearing like this and that's basically like supposed to be your kind of wisdom mind so who knows maybe you blank down to dazzling darkness um and then that image again your dreamer will use the language that it is best for your own uh reciprocity best best for you to receive so you're in the medical world so use fmri it uses brain scan there this kind of slice of the brain so good showing you this kind of healing going on amazing and then not only that you also had what a class is integration dreams it's just as important to look at what follows the lucid dream i had because if a big healing has occurred not only will i feel different the next day and in the coming days perhaps but also my dreams straight after will be changed because i've just done something at a deep neurological level so really cool you noticed those dreams and not only you notice them you then start decoding them have decode meaning from them that's like textbook you are you are smashing this so 100 well well done brilliantly thank you i'm loving the course charlie thank you thank you that's really great so good i'm so glad we had you on and great idea ezra for bringing on shara great thank you thank you so much era awesome so we're gonna dive now into the submitted uh submissions for weird things um Let's see who we have here. I actually made a submission this week and Charlie picked it. So that was, that was nice. I'm going to share my picture with you right now. So I have this, can everyone see? Can you see it? Yeah. So I've got this fan in my room. I'm kind of on the outskirts of a jungle. And so I'm able to not use my AC most of the time. And so I sleep with the window open and this fan that kind of opens as a flower fan. So when it's closed, it's when it stopped, it's closed and then it opens. So I turn this fan on. in the evening before I go to sleep. And then when I wake up, I usually leave the fan on because it's just nice to have the air circulating in the house. Well, I went into the bathroom this week and I came out and it was off for some reason. And it really confused me. So I had to do like a double check. And then I checked, you know, I checked my hand. I did this weirdness check just to make sure because I haven't been lucid yet, but I have been having a lot of vivid dreams every night. Haven't gotten lucid yet, but so I did this check that was mine personally. And I will. The next picture where we see the fan. Yeah, I'll share that one. So when I came back out, this is this is what it looked like. So you can tell you can very tell if it's on. off because it's closed actually what's that i'm not seeing the second image oh you aren't okay let me see okay can you see it now oh no it's just black well really well we can we can audio describe it so the fan that you saw ezra's fan is obviously like that but it kind of goes into this lotus shape it becomes like a bud like that so it's weird it's weird anyway as soon as i saw what the hell is that and then it kind of opens up into a fan shape like this oh no it's black again um so again something that's usual in his house something that we see but we see a change in it so we go in and the fans usually like this suddenly the fans up like that it's about not ignoring these things it's about noticing weird that that fans in a different position now of course there's an explanation for okay i must have turned her on forgotten about it it's not about that that's what we do in dreams we rationalize our way out we confabulate we explain away the situation and that's why we don't become lucid So reality checking is doing the opposite. It's about going, whoa, the fan's in a complete different position than it usually is. Before you start rationalizing, could I be dreaming? Do the check. Then you can rationalize. Okay, I must have switched it on and forgot about it. But so look at that. Even if it's in your bedroom, something you see the whole time, a big change like that, going from that to that, that's where we need to be doing reality checks. Brilliant. Thanks, Ezra. Sure thing. Next up. I'm going to bring Chamalee on to tell you about her photo. I'll share her photo now. Can you see it? No, it's black again. Maybe we've got some technicalities on this one. This is weird. Let's see. If you need to try and sort that out, Ezra, I've got the ones that I wanted to share in the meantime. Okay. Can you still see it? Is it still black? Yeah, it's still black. Sorry. Okay. Interesting. And I can just do share screen, right? Yeah. Okie dokie. So. Those of you who've done any of the live workshops with me will know this guy, Flo, Florian. And Flo does my tech stuff when I do the live workshops, but also he's a dream teacher himself based in Austria. So for any German speakers, check him out. Now he's got this Instagram account, which is just photos of reality checks. So for example, okay, let's look at this tree one right here. So he's walking down the street. He sees a tree that clearly looks like it's got eyes and a mouth. So he doesn't ignore it. He does a reality check. Then he takes a photo of his hand as he's doing the reality check. Again, he's walking down the street and he sees this guy. Wait, one second. One second. Looks like Waffles has spoken. Sorry, guys, this is live television, so anything can happen. I think someone just knocked on my door, probably an Amazon person. So we see here again. Flo is walking down the street. He goes past a fence which has an eye on it. He doesn't just walk past. He does a reality check. He takes a photo of it. I mean, there are so many. I always think like, dude, has this guy just got the weirdest life? Or is he going looking for weirdness? When I've asked him, he says it's both. You want to get into a mindset where you're looking for strange things happening. And once you start looking for strange things, you see them all the time. I mean, who see? What is that? That's like a Homer Simpson. like cuddly toy or something in a cage. Who sees that? He sees that. He does a reality check. He takes a photo of it. So this is what I mean. You can really have fun with these. It makes life interesting. It makes life fun. And follow him on Instagram too. What's his thing? Let's see. Florian Divi reality checks. Okay, cool. Sorry about waffles too. Okay, we've got Chamali. Yeah, let me see if I can share it. Let me see if I can share it if it'll show up this time. No worries. Oh yeah, there you are. This was from this morning. So firstly, Charlie, hi. So lovely to be on with you. And obviously I know Ezra from way back and lovely to see you as well, Ezra. This is from this morning. I have to admit, I am totally busted because I haven't got into a good rhythm with doing my weird checks, but I do notice things that are unusual and maybe I just need to... them as weird checks from now on and this was this morning um driving to i was going to a temple for a buddhist ceremony and the it was the super moon the photo doesn't do it justice it was absolutely huge it was amazing um so yeah so that's my weird check from this morning oh that's so cool okay so this is a great example the reason i chose this wasn't to do with the moon It was to do with the intersection of the lines. And the reason I liked it was because it was an example of how subtly you can do reality checks. That you just look out the window and for some reason today, you've got the pylons in this line. They make a cross in the sky. And we can think, okay, that's weird that they're lined up in that way. That's enough to do a reality check. I actually now find out it's because it was a super moon. Even more reason to do a reality check, but still a great example. You know, if you only do reality checks when, like, you're walking down the street and someone walks past you in a massive crazy hat or something, then you're only going to get lucid in dreams where people in crazy hats appear. You know, really big dream signs. Whereas if you can do it so subtly that even when there's a change of temperature in the room and you go, oh. change of temperature and do a reality check. Then you're going to get lucid in a heck of a lot more dreams. So do them with really subtle things. Brilliant. Thank you, Chamali. Thank you, Charlie. Thanks, Ezra. Yeah. Thank you so much, Chamali. And so Chamali, along with Monica, Sana, Despina, you may have seen them all in the tribe. They are our tribe ambassadors for Experienced Lucid Dreaming. So if you guys ever have any questions or need any support. Between these calls, definitely join the tribe and see these amazing people are supporting not just experience lucid dreaming, but many of the quests that you are taking. Thank you. And they've been really helpful. I've seen in the discussion groups where people have been, oh, how do I learn about stabilizing the lucid dream? They've just been jumping. Don't worry, that's coming on day 25, whenever it is. So that's been really helpful. So thank you so much. And then we have next up, we've got. John's submission. Let me pull it up here. Oh, that was his lucid dream. Yeah. I loved reading John's. It's funny. Can you guys see it? Yeah, perfect. So this wasn't actually a reality check he saw in the daytime and took a photo of. But I like the fact that he was talking about his reality checks and there were some funny ones and he got lucid. So I thought, let's celebrate this one. Is he on the call? Let me see. Is it John Pruitt? I'm not sure. Is that his name? Anyway, let's look at this. So the reality he had was, you know, naked people walking out of a building. So not only is that a big reality check to do, but also it's a funny one. And it shows that his dreamer really wanted him to get lucid. Like if you're having some really big, oh yeah, it's Tony Lee. Sorry. Oh, Tony Lee. That's right. Tony Lee, if he's on. If your dreamer is giving you really big. dream signs like naked people walking out of a building or dead horses no not dead horse what was the last caller a horse walking through your apartment these are really good signs because they show that your dream is trying to get you lucid um i'm not sure i've shared this this story but i once had a lucid dream where it was full of of dream signs i mean there was i know there was president obama there was a dead relative and there were like several other crazy dream signs and i just was not getting lucid and then eventually a dream character walked up to me and gave me a birthday card with my name written on it charlie i take the birthday card i open it and on the inside doesn't say happy birthday it says you are dreaming And I looked at the person, they went like that. I was like, no way. And then suddenly, once I was lucid, then I noticed President Obama, dead relative, all the crazy things. It was as if the dreamer was like, send in President Obama. Oh, he's still not lucid. Send in his dead grandma. Oh, he's still not lucid. You know what, Dave, just go in and tell him. And then Dave or whatever the dream character came and gave me that card. So this is really what we want. We want to be such good friends with the dreamer that the dreamer sends us dream signs. The dreamer wants us to become lucid. Yeah. So I thought that was a really nice example here with kind of naked people coming out of the building. And also had talking cows and all this kind of stuff. Oh, there he is, Tony. Hey. Hey, Charlie. Cool, man. So talk us through your lucid dream. How was it? And it was your first lucid dream ever. How did that feel? Yeah, it was amazing. Yeah, so I did exactly the same thing. taught us um you know it happened exactly the same way so i did the um i saw the the naked people coming out and i was like am i dreaming this could be weird and i did the um the reality check and so my hands the um the middle finger and the little fingers were missing the top half so it's like this right That's when I become lucid. And I kind of have to kind of put it myself because I feel I was falling off to a waking state. So I kind of had to balance it. Yeah. And then I was so excited that I forgot my original Sankopa, which is to meet a Buddha or Jesus to receive teaching. But because I saw the naked people coming out, it kind of gets me excited. So I decided to have sex instead. So I kind of wasted the opportunity to have sex instead. Yeah. Wait, this is even better. Tony, your original dream plan was to meet the son of God, Jesus Christ, but you saw the naked people and thought, ah, you know what? Jesus can wait. I'm going to have some sex. Tony, that's brilliant. I love your honesty. I love your authenticity. No judgment from me. Maybe we can meet Jesus through the act of sexual union. Everything is allowed. Tony, that's so cool. And I'm so glad you had your first lucid dream and you had some fun as well. Yeah, thanks, Charlie. Brilliant. Thanks, man. Thank you so much, Tony. Great share. All right. So now we can break into questions and answers for the rest of the call. So go ahead and use the Q &A box down below if you haven't already. Upvote the questions you really like and we'll bring you on live to ask Charlie your questions. And we're going to start with Sebastian. Sebastian, you are now a panelist. You can turn on your microphone and your camera. Welcome to the call. Hey, Sebastian. All right. Sorry for the delay. Welcome back. You're a popular man. You get upvoted every time. Yeah. So today I want to ask about different types of dreams. So I saw a lot of progress with doing the quest and I'm really happy with that. And I see that I start to get pretty lucid in the dreams and sometimes even get lucid. But this only works as long as I am in the dream. And I have frequently, frequently I have dreams in which I'm not really existent. So it's sort of like. I'm just watching, but without not even being there. And the question I have is, can I get lucid in those two? Because I cannot do any reality checks or anything because I don't have hands, obviously. And if yes, how to do so? Sure. Okay. So these are witnessing dreams where we're kind of observing a bit like we're kind of watching a movie or something like that. We're not kind of in the dream in the first person. Can we get lucid from those? Yes. This is going to sound flippant, but the reality check you do with that is, Why haven't I got any hands? You know, so it's like, I can't do a reality check because I don't have a body. If I don't have a body, I must be dreaming. So the reality check there is still body -based, but rather than doing a hand check, it's, oh, I can't do a hand check because I've got no body. So you can get lucid in them. However, often if you become lucid and they become a full witnessing dream with lucidity, you're still not embodied. So you're still just watching. So it can be hard to kind of, you know, do your dream plan because you're still in the third person. So there is a technique you can do. This is, I wouldn't say advanced, but it's just, well, try it. Okay, so you're lucid in a witnessing state and you're observing your lucid dream. Pick a point in the lucid dream, like a person or a place. So if I was doing it now, I would choose that brilliant, colorful painting behind you. And I would put, I haven't got any eyes, but I would put my awareness, my observation on that painting and try and see if through my intention, I can kind of, bring myself to that painting. It's hard to describe this, but focus everything you can on one point while you have the intention to enter the dream at that point. And if you do that, then suddenly, boom, you're embodied or boom, you're in the painting and then the dream might change or something like that. So there is a way in. However, it's probably best if you're having lots of those dreams to change it in the waking state. So how can I move from if I'm having a lot of witnessing dreams, how do I become embodied in my dream? It's a bit like reality checking, but it's essentially every time you do a reality check now, rather than just doing your hand, I want you to look down at your body. So something weird happens and then just feel your body. Just put your feet on the floor and kind of look down and observe what clothes you're wearing. So kind of look at your clothes, look at the shape of your body. Just be aware. If you bring that into reality checks, because we don't do that a lot, we don't spend a lot of time like this, right? So if we can do this, we're bringing our awareness into our body and we're more likely to dream in that way, kind of dream in an embodied way. I know in the Mexican Toltec tradition, they have certain practices with masks and mirrors. And one of these practices, you intentionally use a mask with a long nose because the reality check in the Mexican tradition is not to look at your hand, it's to see if you have a nose. Because in a dream, you don't usually have a nose because you're not looking through your face. You're seeing through your mind. So the dreamer often forgets to put a nose on. So if me and Sergio Magana, you've heard me mention the quest when we do courses together. If someone asked a crazy question in the audience, I will do my reality check like this. Sergio will do this. He will look at the tip of his nose because if he can see his nose, he knows that he's awake. Eventually, if you do that enough, the nose starts to come into the dreaming and help you become embodied and lucid. So you could do some work with masks. That's a whole nother course. Or you could just start looking down at the body and becoming more embodied in the waking state. Yeah. Great question. Yeah. Brilliant. Thank you. I will try that. Thank you. Thanks a lot, Sebastian. And so next up, we've got Shamanth. You are now a panelist. Welcome to the call. You can turn on your camera and microphone. Hey, Shamath. Hello. Can you hear me? Hi, man. Yeah. Oh, hi, Charlie. I'm so excited to meet you. Great. Thank you for this quest and for hosting this program as well. Thank you, Ezra, for choosing me. And yeah, my question, sorry, I forgot for a second. I'm so excited. Yeah, my question was, was more, oh my God, where is my question? I forgot. Sorry. Yeah, it was like, how do we stay focused? and calm in a dream. I had a lucid dream two days back. And the moment I realized it, after I did the hand reality check technique, my body started floating. I was like wobbling. And I somehow managed to take a deep breath, few breaths. I don't know how I did it. It happened on its own. And I was able to proceed with the lucid dream. So that's my question. How do we kind of stay calm? Okay. And another thing, if you don't mind me asking is I had a single part to ask for career guidance and meet my dreamer. I called out the dreamer, but no one came, but I asked for career guidance. I got some papers and they were in some in the language I could not recognize at all. I don't know in which language it was and I could not read it. So I called it multiple times, but I did not receive any guidance. Okay. Let's look at that one. that one quickly um yeah first of all it can take a couple of lucid dreams to complete a dream plan so in that particular one i would say do the dream plan again you know when i was doing my eyes and stuff like that it took three or four lucid dreams of me trying to do the healing and not quite getting it right and then the third or fourth lucid dream the voice saying there's a conflict in your eyes and i realized this wasn't a time to do hands -on healing this was a time to say my eyes are free of conflict so it can take a couple of lucid dreams for you to kind of um really get the insight so in that case i'd say do the loop do the dream plan again because you did get a response you got papers they were written in a different language now i remember asking a lama yeshe once when i was in a dream and i got these uh teachings in tibetan given to me in a box and i was oh my god i'm receiving teachings in a dream and they were written not just in tibetan but they were written in something called dakini script which is um well where do we go with this dakini script is like a language written by enlightened Dakinis, which is like a very strange script. And when I told him about that, he just very off the cuff said, just ask for it to be translated. You're in a lucid dream. And I was like, oh, it was as simple as that. So basically I should have gone, translate the Dakinis script now, English, now, whatever it is. You could try that, you know, just ask for a translation. Yeah. Now your core question. I love the fact you actually answered your core question yourself. How do you stay calm in the lucid dream? You did it spontaneously. You felt yourself kind of leaving your body. You came back to the breath. We've got a full day on this. I think it's like day 25 or something, but a whole day on stabilizing lucidity. But essentially, however you would keep yourself calm in the waking state. do the same in the dream state so for me i'm a chatterbox right so if i'm in a lucid dream and i feel myself getting too excited wobbly i say okay chill out charlie come on it's just a lucid dream you've been here hundreds of times before let's do our dream plan i speak to myself other people in your case it was breath for other people it's it's touch they want to kind of rub their bodies ground themselves put their feet on the floor um for other people it might be um uh Oh, kind of techniques where people actually touch the ground. People kind of put their hands on the ground, like feel the surface of the dream. But essentially, it's however you would keep yourself calm in the waking state, your kind of favorite method, do that in the lucid dream state. And you did it perfectly. So well done. Yes. Thank you. Thank you so much. Brilliant. Thank you. Great question. Thank you, Charlie. Thank you, Ezra. Thanks a lot, Shamath. Thank you. See you later. See you. All right. So next up, we have Jomei. Jomei has actually got two questions in the chat that are voted pretty high up. So welcome to the call, Jomei. You are now a panelist. There we go. Hey, Jomei, you there? Zoom is a little bit slow today. Okay, well, I'm going to bring, if she is not there, I'm going to bring on Harsh. Oh, there you are. Oh, hello. Hello Charlie, I'm sorry there was a technical difficulty but yeah I have two questions but the most upvoted one is something about crystals. You see I've been recently interested with crystals and I'm actually wearing one, three actually here and do certain crystals emit energy that could make it easier for us to have lucid dreams you know? Yeah, apparently they do. The reason I don't teach the crystal stuff is probably the same reason I don't teach the body position stuff. There's actually quite a lot of stuff in Tibetan Buddhism about what body position you should be in to lucid dream. Sometimes when I teach the body position stuff and when I teach the crystal stuff, people get so obsessed that they can only have a lucid dream if they're lying in this... particular position or if they've got this certain crystal around their neck or something. So I kind of avoid it. But what I would say is, if you find there is a certain crystal you connect with, or if you know about crystal healing, crystal research, you know there are certain crystals which is opposed to help evoke dreams, then yeah, use them. I remember one time a guy on a retreat came to me with this crystal. I had no idea what it was and I didn't really want to use it because I didn't know what the crystal was, but he was so sweet and his heart was so open. He said, I really think this crystal is going to give you a lucid dream. So that night I slept on the retreat with a crystal in my throat chakra. So the throat chakra is associated with lucid dreaming. I put the crystal there and fell asleep. And maybe it was because I had to keep my awareness in my body to stop the crystal from falling off. Or maybe it was the crystal itself. But I've got to say I had like four or five lucid dreams that night. So was it the crystal? Was it not? I would say if there is a crystal that you resonate with. If the act of using crystals, the kind of ritualized aspect of it, brings you peace and calm and a kind of excitement that, yeah, with this crystal I'm going to be able to boost into lucidity, then use it. I think it's a personal thing. The reason I don't teach a lot of the props is because people get a little bit obsessed with them and think that they can only get lucid if they're in this position with this crystal blocking this nostril, all this kind of stuff. But for you personally, if you've got a crystal that you work with or if there's a crystal that you know is supposed to be good for sleep or dreams, absolutely use it. Yeah. What crystal are you actually wearing right now? I mean, does it depend on our... preference or are there certain crystals that are really helpful for dreams? Sorry. Okay. So this one's Amazonite. So the throat chakra is the chakra associated with lucid dreaming in Tibetan Buddhism. So there are certain practices where you fall asleep visualizing. balls of light in the i'm actually pointing that that's wrong it should actually be there you know we think of the chakras down the front of the body they're actually down the back they're kind of along the spine so if anything we should be thinking about a couple of inches back like kind of there right which is interesting because that's where the brain stem is and science tells us that it's the activation of the brain stem that leads to dreaming so could it have been that thousands of years ago the tibetans knew that if you stimulated this area by focusing on it light it would lead to more dreams who knows um so what you could look at is is um crystals associated with throat chakra activation that would be what you want to look at because throat chakra activated will lead to more vivid dreaming there's then crystals like um i think it's like shunga uh uncle shunga or sh uh it's from from an asteroid it's very rare um oh i got it right yeah shunga it's people are writing in the chat um that one's very strong and it's very activating like when you buy a piece of shungai often the crystal dealer will actually give you like a little card of warning saying this is a very powerful crystal and often it will say don't put it near you when you're sleeping because it's so activating but of course with lucid dreaming we want to be activated while we sleep so sometimes those very strong crystals can be good to work with in the second half of the night because our body is asleep and we can activate our mind through the crystal so yeah i've ended up giving a whole teaching on crystals which i wasn't going to do so the main thing to remember is you don't need crystals to have lucid dreams they are not obligatory at all but Yeah, if you want to have some fun and you think they could help, then absolutely use them. Thank you, Charlie. Thank you. Jomei, why don't you go ahead and ask your second question? I think it's really interesting. I could not actually find that question here. But yeah, I usually have premonitions like in my dreams. Recently, I have this high school teacher that recently, unfortunately, passed away. But before that happened, I actually dreamt about her. And to be honest, this usually happens to me. Like when a family member passes away, I usually dream of my tooth falling out. I usually have these meaningful dreams. So is having meaningful dreams just as powerful as having lucid dreams? Yes, definitely. Yes. And the most common form of precognitive dream are dead relatives. or loved ones passing on the most common form of precog dream that people report is like the night that a loved one was dying on the other side of the world and they had this dream about them saying goodbye or the night that a loved one was dying in the hospital down the road and they had a dream about them leaving or something like that very very not very common but within the precognitive dream world it's the most common form of precog dream so yes Be aware of your dreams if someone close to you is is is approaching the Bardo because the dream state can be a really good place to receive communications. And it said in the after death state within Tibetan Buddhism, you have nine times the power of consciousness. And in the lucid dream state, you have seven times the power of consciousness, which means logically, if you wanted to communicate with someone in the Bardo who's recently died, the best place to do it. out of all states of consciousness, would be the lucid dream state. Because you're on seven times consciousness, they're on nine times consciousness. It's like broadband connection. So lucid dreaming itself can be a very good place to connect with loved ones. Oh, the bardo, people are asking. You're about to find out what the bardo is. I think in a couple of days' time, I do a piece on death and dreaming. Bardo is the Tibetan word for the place in between the end of this life and the beginning of the next. Oh, and I realized I made a mistake. I believe the crystal I was talking about this from the comet is Moldavite. I think someone just wrote that in the chat. So sorry if I got that wrong. I wasn't prepared to be teaching crystals today. So that's my bad. Thank you so much, Charlie. Thank you. Brilliant questions. Thank you, Jomei. See you later. Bye. All right, everyone, that's going to wrap it up for our question Q &A session. Wish we had more time with Charlie, but we just have an hour. But please, if you have questions, a lot of these might be already covered in the quest. And all of the ambassadors have already been through the quest before. So they might be ahead of you as far as questions that you might be asking that they know the answers to. So if you don't have a chance to ask your questions here, you can always ask them in the tribe. thousands upon thousands of students there helping each other begin to get more lucid. So make sure you go check out the tribe as well. Charlie, before we tune out today, you have any closing words for this week? Once again, I love these sessions. They're brilliant. And we always seem to get to crazy esoteric stuff that I didn't put in the quest intentionally. So these are even better because it's the quest plus all the esoteric stuff that I wasn't confident enough to put in because I was new to Mindvalley. So this is great. You're getting the extra stuff too. We are about to move into our final week of the quest. It does get pretty weird. We're going to be looking at shadow integration. We're looking at death. We're looking at the nature of reality. So it seems like you guys have been pretty kind of... for the esoteric stuff so be prepared this week it's coming and for those who aren't for those who prefer the kind of uh secular scientific view on lucid dreaming then just keep on doing those techniques we've got some really strong techniques coming especially tomorrow you get the weight back to bed technique which increases lucidity up to two thousand percent so stay tuned i'll see you at the next call i've enjoyed these sorry about the a few technical difficulties today and waffles barking at the postman and stuff like that we apologize but this is live tv baby Thank you so much, Charlie. And thank you so much, Tribe, for tuning in wherever you are in the world. I know you've got to make the time. It doesn't always fit in your schedule. So we really appreciate you making these calls. We had over 400 people on this call tonight. So thank you, everyone. Don't forget to rate this call on the Connections app and give us your feedback so we can always improve these every time we have a call. And we will see you next week. All the call times and Zoom links are listed in the Tribe. as well as all the recordings. This recording will be available one week later, next week, but you'll get all those links in the tribe. So don't miss the tribe and we will see you next week. See you waffles. Thank you. See ya. Bye. See ya.

Week 4: Advanced Techniques for Lucid Dreaming

====================

LESSON 22 – Overcoming Lucid Nightmares
--------------------
<v ->Welcome to week four</v> where we learn how to harness the power of our shadow, explore the more advanced practices of Tibetan Dream Yoga and learn a lucid dreaming technique that boosts your chances of lucidity by up to 2000%. This week, we'll take you to the edge of your comfort zone with lessons on lucid dying, embracing your demons in the lucid dream, and even a group psychic experiment, in which I invite you guys to dive deep inside my mind through lucid dreaming. Any course on dreaming would be incomplete without a session on nightmares, but especially a course about lucid dreaming. Why? Because for lucid dreamers nightmares are opportunities. They can be embraced, transformed, and used as techniques for becoming lucid. Studies have shown that over a third of all spontaneous lucid dreams begin as nightmares. So nightmares can be really good news for lucid dreamers, but how does this actually work? Have you ever been in a nightmare and thought to yourself, "I've got to wake up, I've got to wake up." If so that nightmare was a lucid dream because the moment you acknowledged there was a place to wake up to, you had indirectly acknowledged that you were dreaming. Every time you wake up from a nightmare, however, the psychological trauma or psychological energy that led to the creation of the nightmare remains unintegrated. This is why our nightmares recur so much more than our seemingly happy dreams. That dream while you're having a dinner date, with your favorite celebrity, why did you only have it once? Because you love the dream as you were having it. And it was fully integrated in the moment. But that nightmare, that bad dream, that scary dream about the thing that happened to you or the thing you'd rather not think of, why does that dream come back week after week or month after month? Because the energy of the nightmare remains unintegrated due to us pushing it away and waking up from it. But why should nightmare so often lead to lucidity? Well, imagine this, if I somehow managed to travel through the screen right now and jump into your lap, you'll probably be so scared that your eyes would widen, your sense will become more alert, and you'll definitely become more aware of the situation, right? And also I hope you'll do a reality check, just to be sure. So research has shown us that the boost of awareness that fear brings is an evolutionary trait that helps us deal with potential threat. That same process happens when we feel scared or threatened in our dreams. Our awareness is boosted and boost our awareness in a dream and that can often lead to fully conscious lucidity. For some people, chronic nightmares are a serious complaint that not only affects the quality of their sleep, but also the quality of their lives. The good news though, is that if you can experience a nightmare with full lucidity, you have a powerful opportunity for trauma resolution and shadow integration. More about that tomorrow. I've taught lucid dreaming to loads of people suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder, including ex-soldiers, victims of terrorist attacks, and even people who've experienced abuse during childhood. And I've seen firsthand just how powerful lucid dream training can be. Not only in curing nightmares, but possibly more importantly in opening people up to a new perspective on sleep and dreams, in which they see their nightmares as a call for help, rather than an attack from the unconscious. Tomorrow, we'll learn exactly what to do if you ever get lucid within a nightmare. But for now, I want to share with you a beautiful guided meditation that I created inspired from a Tibetan shamanic technique for people who are currently having nightmares like the veterans with PTSD, but not yet having lucid dreams. Having said that, this is one of my most popular meditations among lucid dreamers too. And it's a great practice for anyone who wants to fall asleep with more confidence and peace. This is a visualization practice in which we imagine a gathering of protectors around us fearlessly supporting our shadow work, standing over us while we sleep. This practice is inspired by the Tibetan Bon Dream Yoga teachings, in which it said that if you're feeling anxious before sleep you should try to turn your sleeping area into a sacred, protected space by imagining that you're surrounded by enlightened beings and Dakinis. Dakini is a Sanskrit word that means sky dancer, and it usually refers to female embodiments of enlightenment. It said that as you fall asleep, imagine that these Dakinis remain like mothers watching over a child or guardian surrounding a king or queen. It's such a lovely way to fall asleep, surrounded by power, protection, and enlightened energy. So you might be thinking, who do I imagine as my allies and protectors around the bed? Anyone or anything who offers you a personal feeling of love, safety, allegiance, and protection. Your protectors can be living or dead, real or unreal, known or unknown, but make sure that they hold a personal place in your heart and give you a feeling of protection and power. The Circle of Protectors exercise is best done as you're first falling asleep at night. So I've created a guided audio meditation that you can listen to as you're falling asleep tonight. It takes you step-by-step through the exercise and is a great practice for anyone, who wants to fall asleep with a sense of peace and protection. and now it's time for your actions for today. Number one, practice the Circle of Protectors meditation as you fall asleep. Secondly, practice one of the Hypnagogic Affirmation techniques tonight after at least four and a half hours of sleep. And of course keep up the Dream Recall affirmation when you first fall asleep, the Dream Diaries all the time, Reality Checks all the time, and keep up that Columbo mindset. The Circle of Protectors is one of the most powerful practices for reducing nightmare frequency. As it allows us to fall asleep, feeling empowered, and trauma of course, is a disempowering experience. Tomorrow, we'll learn something just as empowering, how to increase our chances of becoming lucid by up to 2000%? As well as my flagship technique, Lucid Dream Shadow Work. Until then, sweet dreams and sweet nightmares.

====================

LESSON 22 – Meditation: Circle Of Protectors

Take a moment to make yourself totally comfortable lying down on the floor or on your bed if you like. And now take a moment to consider the protectors that you are going to be working with today. Your protectors can be alive or dead, known or unknown, real or unreal, but whoever or whatever they are needs to create a feeling of love and protection within you. Close your eyes and relax into the support of the bed with the ground beneath you. Come into an awareness of your breathing, noticing how your body expands a little with the inbreath and how your body releases and relaxes on the outbreath. I want you to imagine something. Imagine that your first protector is standing or sitting near your head. Feel the energy of their love and protection as they look down upon you lovingly. It doesn't matter if you can't see them clearly. Just know that they're there and keeping that visualization of your first protector by your head. Now, I want you to imagine your second protector sitting or standing by your feet. Your second protector is sitting or standing by your feet. Feel the energy of their love and protection. Connect to their power. It doesn't matter if you can't see them clearly. Just know that they're there. And now to your left hand side, I want you to imagine your third protector. Your third protector is sitting or standing by your left hand side. Feel their energy. Connect to the power of their love. Again, it doesn't matter if you can't see them clearly. Just know that they're there, feel that they're there. And now I want you to imagine that your fourth protector is sitting or standing on your right hand side. Connect with the energy of your fourth protector. If you can't see them clearly, just know that they're there. Connect deeply to the power of love and protection coming from your fourth protector on your right hand side. And now that your primary four protectors are positioned in all the four cardinal directions, north, south, east, and west. And now I invite you to fill in the gaps between your four primary protectors. Fill in the gaps with anything else that brings you a sense of love and protection. This could be people, places, animals, energies, star constellations, planets, gods, or deities. Whatever brings you a sense of love and protection, use them to fill in the gaps between your four primary protectors. You are now encircled by protection. You are now encircled by love. Take a moment to feel deeply into the love and protection that surround you. You are surrounded by love. You are surrounded by protection. And with this feeling of love and protection encircling, you either move on to your chosen, lucid dreaming technique, or allow yourself to slip off into sleep with this energy of love, power, and protection, permeating your entire night's sleep.

LESSON 23 – Shadow Work in Lucid Dreaming
--------------------
<v ->Today we learn about one of the most powerful sources</v> of energy in the psychophysical system, the energy that fuels the fire of awakening, this energy is called the shadow. In 2017, I wrote a book about the shadow called dreaming through darkness which shows people how to transform the power of their shadow side through a series of powerful meditations, esoteric exercises and of course dreamwork. Shadow work gives us more energy, more authenticity and a greater capacity for spiritual growth as we transform that which we hide from others into the power of awakening. One of the most effective ways to transform the shadow is to meet, befriend and embrace it within our lucid dreams but before that, let's make sure we know exactly what we're working with. So what is the shadow? There is a source of energy within us that contains the seed of awakening. We may hide it from others though we know that it's there, like fire, if ignored or misused it may burn us but if harnessed, it can warm us, protect us and revolutionize our life. We call this energy the shadow. The concept of the shadow is found within almost every culture and spiritual tradition the world over but it was first popularized in the West by the legendary Swiss psychiatrist, Carl Jung. He used the term to describe the part of the unconscious mind made up of all the seemingly undesirable aspects of the psyche. The shadow is our dark side but not dark meaning negative or malign, rather dark meaning yet to be illuminated. The shadow is comprised of everything within us that we don't want to face, that is everything both seemingly harmful and potentially enlightening. All that we have rejected, denied, disowned or repressed forms the shadow. So the shadow is not evil or bad, it's simply the parts of ourselves that seem incompatible with who we think we are. These might include our shame, our fears, our emotional wounds but also and crucially, our awakened essence, our unexpressed talents, our highest potential. Psychologists might define the shadow as all that we deem unacceptable and deny within ourselves. I've heard Shamans say the shadow resides anywhere that your fear becomes greater than your current capacity for love and I've heard Buddhists say that all of the aspects of ourselves that we don't want to face, that's the shadow. Personally, I define the shadow as anything within us that we are currently unwilling to accept or extend our love to. Many people when they first hear about the shadow, they immediately think about the potentially harmful traits like anger, prejudice, hatred, sexual taboos, what might be considered unacceptable. Interestingly though, the shadow contains just as many if not more overtly beneficial traits such as inner strength, blinding beauty and talents that we have kept hidden. So the shadow has two sides, dark and golden. The dark shadow contains the rejected traits that we deemed to be negative or harmful such as anger, fear, shame. It contains the answers to questions like what am I most afraid of? What am I most ashamed of? What parts of myself do I hide from myself and others? Never forget though, the dark shadow is neither bad nor harmful, it is simply unintegrated energy and until we learn how to tap into that energy and transmute its power, we will never become a fully integrated or fully awakened human being. The poet Rainer Maria Rilke once said, perhaps everything terrible is in its deepest essence something helpless that wants our love and so it is even with the darkest depths of our shadow. Becoming a shadow worker as you will see is all about love. Now to the golden shadow, the golden shadow often called the positive shadow is made up of our hidden talents, our blinding beauty, our unfulfilled potential, it's still made up of aspects of ourself that we deny, reject or disown but the more overtly beneficial aspects than found in the dark shadow. The golden shadow contains our intuition, our creativity, our childlike vitality and our spiritual power. Just as the dark shadow is made up of all the parts of ourselves that we fear may lead to rejection. the golden shadow is made up of all the bright, brilliant and magnificent parts of ourselves that we fear maybe too great, too awesome and too challenging to reveal to ourselves and others. For many people, it's their spiritual side that forms the core of their golden shadow so I ask you, anyone watching this quest, do any of you hide your esoteric or spiritual side from your friends or family for fear of being labeled too woo-woo, yeah? That's your golden shadow, it's your spiritual side, your esoteric side, what could be more powerful and beneficial and yet we hide it? Why? Same reason we hide a dark shadow. We're scared that if we reveal ourselves fully, we'll be rejected and the fear of rejection is a powerful fear. So the golden shadow is our unactivated potential, our unused talents and just as it takes conscious effort to reclaim and transform the energy stored in our dark shadow, so too must we make an effort to reclaim the golden shadow's energy if we want to be complete, balanced and authentically whole. It is possible to meet the actual personification of your shadow within your lucid dreams. In fact anyone who's ever had a lucid nightmare will probably already have done this, because nightmares are the realm of the dark shadow. However, we can if we feel ready actually call forth the shadow into our lucid dreams whether they're nightmarish or not. If we can do that and crucially if we can embrace whatever appears with love, then we engage one of the most transformative lucid dreaming techniques there is, lucid dream shadow work. So let's look at exactly how to practice this technique. Step one, if you're lucky enough to become a lucidly aware within a nightmare, try to stay in the nightmare for as long as you can, reminding yourself that it's all just a projection of your own mind and that nothing in the nightmare can do you harm. As Krishna Mercy once said, the great Indian philosopher, the seeing is the doing. Simply by witnessing the nightmare with lucid awareness, the trauma that led to the creation of the nightmare will often be spontaneously integrated. Many people find that by shifting their perspective like this, they can actually create a total transformation of attitude that tells the nightmare, I see you, I witness you, I understand that you are an expression of my own mind that just wants to be seen and once the nightmare has received this message of acceptance, it often dissolve spontaneously and never return, why? Because as we learned earlier, if we can look at the nightmare without judgment and knowing that it's just an unintegrated expression of our own shadow rather than some sort of externalized demon, it's energy will be naturally and fully integrated. Step two, this step requires the courage of the dream warrior. Essentially, once you become lucid in any dream nightmarish or not, proactively seek out and embrace your shadow, yup, literally hug it. Now let me explain all this hugging things in your lucid dream. As I mentioned before if you want to fly through the sky in a lucid dream, you might put your hand up like Superman and fly through the sky. You've given the dream the symbol of flight so what could be more symbolic of love, acceptance and integration than the hug? In fact, I often say if you're in a lucid dream and you can't remember your dream plan and you think what should I spend the lucid dream doing, just run around and hug everything. Hug the people, hug the trees, definitely hug the monsters and the demons because everything in the lucid dream is you and if there's something particularly scary, something that's monstrous, something you don't want to go near, that's most likely simply a part of your shadow that has become split off and the way to integrate it, embrace it with love. You might be thinking, how will know what's my shadow and what's not my shadow? Basically, anything in the dream that makes you feel scared all in all, that's your shadow. Your dark shadow might appear as a scary dream character whereas your golden shadow might appear as an awesome ball of light, an angel that blinds the eyes to look at it. Whether it's dark or golden, as soon as you see a shadow aspect in your lucid dream go forth and hug it, show it your love and integrate into the wholeness of your own psychology. Step three, there is a third option and this one is only for those who are really ready for radical change. Essentially, rather than waiting for the nightmarish shadow aspects to come to you, you become lucid and intentionally call forth the shadow. How does this work? You become lucid oh right, I'm dreaming and then within the lucid dream you call out something like shadow, come to me. Now I should say, if you are going to go into a lucid dream and call out shadow come to me, you better put your seatbelt on because you've just asked for the sum total of all your hidden traumas, shame, fear and divine power to appear in personified form. Once you call out for your shadow, whatever appears might have a very powerful effect on your psychophysical system so whatever it is you know the score, meet it, greet it and embrace it with love, fearlessly knowing that whatever it is, it's part of you and that to embrace it with love is the most powerful integration there is. If you can do that just once in a lucid dream, then it could be that as one jungian psychotherapist on one of my retreats once told me, you can integrate as much shadow material in one lucid dream as in six years of therapy, his words not mine. Meeting and embracing your shadow in a lucid dream is undoubtedly one of the most powerful forms of shadow integration but we needn't wait until we get lucid to start making friends with our shadow. The power of imagination is a great way to begin so I've created a guided audio meditation that you can listen to day or night, that asks you to imagine meeting, befriending and transforming your shadow, enjoy. And now your actions for today. Firstly, practice the meeting your shadow guided meditation that I just mentioned, secondly try and meet your shadow in your next lucid dream if you can or at least in the one after the lucid dream in which you complete your current dream plan. Of course practice one of the hypnagogic affirmation techniques tonight after at least four and a half hours sleep and be sure to keep up the dream diaries, spotting your dream signs, reality checks, the weird technique and Colombo mindset. As can see our toolbox is really filling up now and don't forget to check in with your tribe, keep up those dream circles, share your experience with the other people on the quest. Lucid dream shadow work is one of my all time favorite practices and I've been encouraging people to try it ever since my 2011 TED Talk on the subject, so please do try it. I know it can seem a bit scary though so just at some point whenever you're ready and don't forget, you could always get lucid and call out to meet your golden shadow rather than your dark shadow. However, I found meeting my inner light can be just as mind blowing and sometimes just as scary as meeting my inner darkness. Tomorrow, we'll learn about the four stages of Tibetan dream yoga and see how embracing the shadow and facing your fears in a lucid dream is actually an ancient practice that predates Carl Jung by about 900 years. Until then sweet dreams, sweet nightmares and enjoy your shadow.

LESSON 23 – Meditation: Meeting Your Shadow

Just sitting with your eyes open or closed, either is fine. Breathing through your nose or mouth either is fine. Breathe deeply. Show your body that you love it enough to give it what it needs. Breath. Know that you are totally safe. You are held lovingly by the beneficial motivation of this meditation. So relax deeply, deeply enough to look into your shadow. Take a moment to think about the unloved parts of yourself that you find unacceptable to show to others. Think about the parts of your mind that you struggle to love. Your anger, your fear, your past traumas, aspects of your sexuality that you fear may be frowned upon. Perhaps take a moment to consider and to encounter the dark shadow parts of yourself. If shame, guilt, or discomfort come up, don't turn away from them as you have done before. Turn towards them lovingly. Can you locate these dark shadow aspects somewhere in your body? Take a moment to locate the dark shadow aspects at a certain location in your body. And now imagine that the energy of your dark shadow flows out of your body from this location and manifests in physicalized form by your left hand side. Your dark shadow in physicalized form is sitting next to you on your left hand side. What does it look like? Does it have a gender? Is it human animal, or maybe energetic? Take a moment to really see your dark shadow manifest in physicalized form by your left hand side. Feel into the energy of your dark shadow. And now knowing that the shadow is part of you and nothing to be feared, find a way to connect with the physical manifestation of your dark shadow. If it has a hand, then hold it. If it has form, connect with it. If it's energetic, connect with it through the power of your intention. But in some way, make contact with your dark shadow. Now, feel the energy of your dark shadow. Feel its power, feel its potential. And now take a moment to think about all the magnificent parts of yourself that you find unacceptable to show to others. Is there a part of yourself that you find too bright to show to others your potential, your intuition, your divine light, your sexuality? Take a moment to encounter these golden shadow parts of yourself. If power, joy, or strong energy come up, don't turn away from them as you have done before. Turn towards them and greet them like old friends. The golden shadow is part of you. Can you locate the energy of the golden shadow somewhere in your body? Locate the energy of the golden shadow at a specific place in your body now and now. Imagine the energy of your golden shadow moves outta your body from that specific location and manifests into form on your right hand side. Your golden shadow has manifest in physicalized form on your right hand side. What does your golden shadow look like? Does it have a gender? Does it have form? Is it simply made of energy? Take a moment to see your golden shadow clearly manifest on your right hand side. Feel the energy of your golden shadow. And now find a way to connect with the golden shadow. If it has a hand, hold it. If it has form, connect to it. If it's made of energy, connect with it through your intuition. But in some way, connect with your golden shadow now. And as you sit there holding the hand of your dark shadow and holding the hand of your golden shadow, take a moment to feel what effect that has on you. Feel the energy of both the dark and golden shadows. And now unexpectedly the dark and the golden shadows stand. They move away from you. Then turn back and face you. Your dark and your golden shadows are looking at you. And now they turn to face each other. They take a step towards each other for a minute. You think they're gonna embrace, and then you see them dissolve into each other. You dark and your golden shadow merge into each other, and now their energy flows back into you. The energy of the dark and the golden shadow now unified in friendship flow back into your body. The space on your left hand side is empty. The space on your right hand side is empty. The space in front of you is empty. The shadow is within you.

LESSON 24 – The Four Stages of Dream Yoga
--------------------
<v ->Remember back in week three,</v> when we touched on Tibetan and dream yoga. In today's lesson, we're going to go deep into the four stages of dream yoga, and discover the dream plans of the yogis of ancient Tibet. The Buddhist dream yoga tradition is without doubt, the most comprehensive in the world, and has been so for hundreds of years. So their techniques can be counted on. Now, let's explore the four stages of dream yoga. The four stages are, recognition, transformation, multiplication and unification. Don't worry, we're going to break down each one right now. The first stage, recognition. Essentially, this stage is about recognizing the fact that you're dreaming. It's about learning to lucid dream basically. When I spoke to my Buddhist master, Lama Meshi Rimbushje about this, he said recognition stage is about training the mind to know that you're dreaming as you're dreaming, use any techniques that work best for you to do so. As in use the Buddhist techniques, use the Mexican techniques, use the Western techniques. It doesn't matter so much what techniques you use just learn to lucid dream, that's stage one recognition. The second stage of dream yoga is called transformation. Now you might think they're talking about transforming the dreamscape there but actually, they're talking about transforming fear. So straight off the bat, you see that even in ancient Tibet, they believe most beneficial thing to do once you become lucid, is to work with your shadow to transform your fear. If we look at the translations of the Tibetan teachings, they say things like, once you have recognized the dream, walk into fire, knowing that you cannot be burnt, jump from a high place, knowing that you cannot fall. And my favorite, call forth a tiger into the dream. Once the tiger appears you've got options, it says like, you can transform the tiger into a Buddah. You can befriend the tiger or my favorite, you can ride the tiger like a friendly horse. These examples though, were based on the fears of medieval Tibetans, things like high places, 'cause Tibet's really high up, things like fire, a universal fear and things like tigers because Tibet was full of snow leopards. So nowadays, I believe we can absolutely update these teachings and still stay true to their essence. So I ask you, what is your tiger, what is your high place? What is your fire that you can walk into? Working with phobias, working with fears, working with aspects of our shadow absolutely ticks the box of transformation stays dream yoga and is a powerful way to integrate our fears. The reason that integration of fear in the transformation stage comes so early within the teachings, is because the Buddhists believe that fear is one of the greatest blocks to our spiritual growth. It's said that if you can integrate a fear, you'll not only gain back the energy that that fear is made of, but you also remove the block in your psychophysical system that the fear may have created. Before we move on to stages three or four of dream yoga, it's believed that the energy required to do so, is found within the integration of our fear. Stage three of dream yoga is called multiplication. That's a bit of a funny word here, but it's a translation from the original Tibetan. Multiplication stage essentially asks you to do impossible things within the lucid dream. Again, the translation of the Tibetan texts say things like, make one thing many, make many things one. Make small things great, make great things small. Essentially, do impossible stuff in the lucid dream, explore possibility. See what seems to be difficult to do and see what seems to be easy to do. Do things like fly through the sky. Walk through walls, appear in two places at once. Multiply things, change things, transform the actual dreamscape itself. If I were to give you one practice to do, to best sum up stage three dream yoga, it would be walking through a wall. Now walking through a wall in a lucid dream is a very interesting thing. You might think it sounds easy, but give it a shot. Many people find that when they first try to walk through a wall, the wall is actually solid. Let me tell you a story of when I first tried this. Akon Talku Rimbushje is a Tibetan Buddhist Lama, who is the brother of Lama Meshi Rimbushje. A few years ago, Akon Rimbushje died, but before his death, one of the last teachings he gave to me was about multiplication stage in lucid dreaming. A few months earlier, Akon Rimbushje had given me an instruction based on out of body experiences through lucid dreaming. I completed the instruction and went back to him, expecting and hoping for a similarly esoteric instruction. But this time when I said, Rimbushje, what should I do in my next lucid dream? He gave me three words, which for Akon Rimbushje I was actually quite a lot. He said, walk through wall, walk through wall, what does he mean by that? Just walk through a wall. That's like child's play, I want the advanced stuff, I thought. Of course, externally I went, oh yes, Thank you, thank you, thank you, as you do. A week or so later I became lucid and I remember the Lama's instruction. And even though I wasn't that up for it, I thought well, I'd better try it. This is what he told me to do. So I'm in the dream, I see a wall and I thought, okay, I'll walk through the wall. I walk up to the wall, boom, bang, straight in the nose. The pain wakes me up, thinking what? I was fully lucid, I totally knew I was dreaming but how come that wall was solid? A week or so later I became lucid again. And this time, I remembered the dream plan, walk through a wall. So I found a wall in the lucid dream and I went up to it and I knocked on it and it was solid. I thought, I know I'm dreaming right now. Did a reality check, yep, I'm still dreaming. So I know my body's asleep in bed. I know that everything is made in my mind but this wall still seems solid. However, once I started to contemplate it and remind myself that although the wall seemed to be solid, in fact, it was empty of inherent existence. It was the stuff that dreams are made of, suddenly it became less solid and I was able to put my hand through the wall but it wasn't completely non-solid. It had some texture, it felt like kind of wet concrete and as I pushed my hand through, my forearm, all the way up to the shoulder, I had a moment of panic as I thought, wait, what if the wet concrete goes in my mouth? Just as I thought that, just as I had my moment of doubt, the wall re-solidified and suddenly I was stuck halfway in, halfway out the wall and I wake up in panic. Now, isn't that interesting? That first of all, the wall was solid. Then when I minded myself that it was a dreamlike illusion, it became less solid, but when I doubted myself, it re-solidified, what an interesting teaching on the nature of mind. Then, a week or so after that, I get lucid again. Third time lucky, I get lucid, I see the wall. I remind myself, that wall does not exist. Everything is made of mind, nothing has inherent existence. And I ran through the wall to the other and woke up joyfully. I think the best thing about that story, is the teaching that Akon Rimbushje was giving me. I don't think it was just a teaching about multiplication stage dream yoga. I think it's a teaching on how the mind creates solidity. I think that every time you walk through a wall in a lucid dream, you're creating a new habit of mind that allows you to walk through the walls of your own bullshit. Walk through the walls of your own limitation. Walk through the walls of your own fear in the waking state. And that's where the real power lies. I don't think it was a dream yoga technique. I think it was a lucid living technique. The fourth stage of dream yoga is called unification. Unification with what? With our Buddha nature. Buddha nature describes our inherent goodness, our inner divinity, our natural, enlightened essence. And it's said that through the lucid dreaming practices, you can actually tap into and unify with that fully enlightened essence. Within the dream yoga teachings the unification stage practice usually asks that you go into the lucid dream, do a certain Buddhist meditation practice and then unify with your Buddha nature. However, when I show you how to do this practice step by step, I'm going to offer you a totally secular approach that is open to everyone. So what is the unification stage practice look like? You'd become lucid and then in the lucid dream, you would start reciting the mantra associated with a certain Buddha. Now mantra is a term you hear a lot about but what does it mean? Mantra's made up of two syllables, man, which means mind and tra, which means protection. So a mantra means that which protects the mind, a series of sounds, syllables or words, some translatable, some untranslatable that have a protective effect on the mind. So we become lucid and we start reciting the mantra associated with a certain Buddha. Now mantra that a lot of people know, is that of one of the most famous Buddhas within Tibetan Buddism, Chen Rezi or Avalokiteshvara, as he's known in Sanskrit or Quan Ying, as she is known in Chinese Buddhism. Mom mani padme hum, Mom mani padme hum, is the mantra associated with this Buddha. So you'd become lucid and in the lucid dream, you'd start saying, Mom mani padme hum, Mom mani padme hum, Mom mani padme hum, then you would visualize in the sky of the lucid dream, that certain Buddha, the Buddha Chen Rezi. You'd visualize the Buddha up in the sky, in front of you. And in the third stage, you would imagine that your own body in the dream, transforms into the body of the Buddha. So you actually unify with the Buddha, unlocking your own Buddha nature. How does that look? It literally looks like transforming into the Buddha. So when you look down, your human form would have changed and you would be transformed into the form of the Buddha. Everyone on this quest can engage the four stages of dream yoga, for those still working on getting lucid, practice stage one of dream yoga. For those already having lucid dreams, practice stage two of dream yoga. For those with a stabilized practice, move on to stage three. And for those who are ready to wake up to their limitless power, try stage four. I'm going to explore now, exactly how to practice stage four, by offering you a completely secular approach to unification dream yoga. In one way, this is quite an advanced technique, which I usually don't teach publicly, but I feel that to open you up to at least the potential of this, is to plant the seed of possibility. And it's not just a Buddhist thing, unification stage dream yoga can be applied in any tradition. I even tested this myself. I wasn't brought up Christian. I wasn't even christened, but growing up in England, I guess did at least expose me to the tradition of Christianity. The important thing to know, is that this isn't just a Buddhist thing. I've worked with loads of people who've practiced unification practice when they have not been Buddhists. I want to share a case study from a friend of mine who is a full-on Christian. He is a born again Christian, practicing law in America. He emailed me asking, could he use the Tibetan Buddhist dream yoga techniques for his Christian practice. He ended up engaging the three-step unification process but within the Christian tradition. He became lucid, and once lucid, rather than calling out the mantra of the deity or the Buddha, he started singing a hymn to Jesus. The next step, rather than visualizing the Buddha in the sky, he started to call forth Jesus into the dream and the third step, rather than transforming himself into the Buddha, he said, Charlie, I don't know if step three worked. I said well, what happened? And he went well, I was calling Jesus into the dream. And then suddenly my heart opened up, my chest cavity revealed and suddenly, this huge light beamed out of my chest, filling the entire dream with white light and I woke up and bliss, did it work? I said, yeah man, I think that worked. I'm pretty sure you just unified with your divine nature. So let's break down the three-step process of unification. Step one, after you become lucid, recite a prayer, mantra or affirmation associated with the enlightened energy or deity that you wish to unify with. Step two, visualize that enlightened energy or deity within the dream in front of you. Step three, engage self manifestation as the deity, either drawing the energy of that visualized form into you, or trying to transform your own form in the dream into that of the deity. Essentially you want to to unify fully with the enlightened energy of that form, so that you literally become one with them, merging fully into their energy. I know this technique seems super esoteric and in many ways it is, but I really want to plant the seed in your consciousness, just so you see how far these practices can go, to put them in context of the tradition in which they come from and to allow you to see that you can move beyond the limits of what you think is possible in your lucid dreams. As you can see, the dream yoga teachings form part of a powerful tradition. So now it's time for a powerful technique, and one that actually you find within the ancient dream yoga traditions too. Is day 24 of 30 and now is the perfect time to drop this bombshell onto your bed. A technique that can increase your chances of getting lucid by a whopping 2000%, and more than two thirds of research participants recorded lucid dreams when they first engaged this practice. It does require quite a big ask of you but it is definitely worth it. How do we practice this supercharged technique? It's actually simple. You wake up at least two hours earlier than you intend to wake up. You stay awake for about an hour and then you go back to sleep for another hour or two. Here are the five steps to wake back to bed. Step one, set your alarm for at least two hours earlier than your usual wake up time. Step two, when the alarm sounds, wake up, write down your dreams and get out of bed. Step three, stay awake for about an hour, engaging in any fully wakeful activity. Things like meditating or reading about lucid dreaming would be ideal. But I found that just about any mindful activity works well. Stay awake for an hour. Step four, you want to be awake but not wired, so don't overstimulate yourself or you might find step five a bit tricky, try to keep sleep within arms reach. Step five, after about an hour, reset your alarm for an hour or two later, or whenever you intend to wake up, return to bed and fall asleep again with the strong intention to gain lucidity. Of course, you can use one of the hypnagogic affirmation techniques too, that'd work brilliantly. So that's it, but how does the technique work? Where does it get its power? Well, as we've learned, the last two hours of our sleep cycle, are when we do most of our dreaming. So if we starve ourselves of this dream time, when we do go back to sleep eventually, we'll course smoothly and deeply into vivid lucid dreaming. I want you to imagine that your sleep cycle is like a river. It meanders through like this. What we're doing is we're putting a dam in that river. So where's the river usually courses through about to enter dreaming, we put a dam there and the river starts to backup and backup and backup, every minute of every hour that we're awake the brain is going, where are my dreams? Where are my dreams, where are my dreams? Where are my dreams? So when we go back to sleep an hour later and we remove the dam, the block, boom, we get a big flood of dreaming. And as dreaming sleep is the playing field for lucidity, we can see how the power of this technique works. So simply wake up a couple of hours earlier than usual. Stay awake for an hour and then go back to sleep with a strong intention to be lucid. Only use this technique two or three times max a week, otherwise your sleep cycle will just readjust, just like the river will find a new path and the power will decrease. The wake back to bed technique is the golden ticket to lucidity for many people, but sometimes it takes a little bit of tweaking. So for example, if I set my alarm for just two hours early than I intend to wake up, by the time I've stayed awake for an hour, I'm actually too awake and I can't get back to sleep. So when I do wake back to bed, I set my alarm for three hours earlier than I intend to wake up. Then by the time I've done the hour, I could still really do with that extra two hours of sleep. So feel free to adjust your timings. Some people find that a full hour of wakefulness is too much. So make it less, do 45 minutes. Make sure it's at least half an hour though and at most, 90 minutes. Why, because those 90 minute sleep cycles actually continue while we're awake. So by staying awake for an hour and then dropping back the sleep, we're dropping back at a time when we're about to start dreaming. Again, this technique is not based on faith, it's not based on a certain Buddhist mantra. It's based on the power of your sleep cycle and the power of your intent. I really advise you to try wake back to bed technique tonight. Don't do any multiple wake ups when doing this technique, just one wake up is enough. And now it's time for your actions for today. Number one, practice the wake back to bed technique tonight. As you fall asleep, in the wake back to bed technique, feel free to apply one of the hypnagogic affirmation techniques that we learnt before. Secondly, if you become lucid tonight, why not practice one of the stages of dream yoga? It could be transformation of fear. It could be multiplication of the dreamscape. It could even be unification, but give one of those a shot tonight. And as always, keep up the three D's, reality checks and the Colombo mindset. As you can see, we are really taking the safety off this week, as we dive deep into the mystic. Tomorrow, we find out as Neo did in the Matrix, that there is no spoon. Until then, dream deeply and sleep sound.

====================

LESSON 25 – There Is No Spoon: Falling Asleep Consciously
--------------------
<v ->Today, we're going to learn about bendy spoons,</v> impossibility, and how to fall asleep and enter the lucid dream without even blacking out. Hold tight, because today we are going in. You might remember a scene, in the 1999 film, The Matrix, in which Neo is waiting to go in to visit the Oracle. In the waiting room, outside the Oracle's office, Neo watches a weird looking kid who kind of looks a bit like a Shaolin monk, and has a strange English accent, bending a spoon with his mind. Neo watches the kid and says to him, "How are you doing that? "How do you bend the spoon?" To which the kid replies, "Don't try to bend the spoon. "That's impossible. "Instead, only try to realize the truth. "There is no spoon." This idea of there is no spoon is what I use to explore the concept of impossibility in a lucid dream. Although some things in a lucid dream seem to be more difficult than others, such as walking through a wall, compared to walking through a room. In fact, in a lucid dream, the wall and the space in the room are made of the same stuff, nothingness. In a lucid dream, there is no spoon, there is no wall, there is no room. Once you learn about this idea of, there is no spoon, and once you introduce it to your dreamer simply by being aware of it, this is a phrase that you can use in your lucid dream, anytime you're stuck or blocked by your own limitation. For example, let's say you're in a lucid dream and you're trynna fly, but you don't seem to have enough power to take off. Remind yourself, there is no spoon. As in, there is no gravity. There is no body with any weight that would prevent me from flying. There is no spoon means, anything is possible. Or perhaps you're in a lucid dream, you've called forth your shadow and a huge monster has appeared, and you're too scared to hug it. In that case, remind yourself, there is no spoon. As in, there is no shadow. There is no body. There is no monster. Everything is pure possibility. And then of course go and hug it. You can even do the same in your waking life. Anytime in your waking life, you come face to face with your own self limitation, with your own fear, with your own sense of impossibility, you could say to yourself, there is no spoon, and notice the sense of tightness and limitation dissolve. I've used this technique loads of times in the waking state. One of the first times when I was about to go into the ring for a kickboxing competition, I was really scared. It all just seemed too real. My opponent was in front of me. I just found out his name was Tyson Mitchell. That was enough to scare me. In my fear, I thought I can't do this. I can't go into the ring. And then I reminded myself, "Charlie, there is no spoon. "These limits you're putting on yourself are fear created. "You're acting from a place of fear." As soon as I said, it was like something released, something dropped away, and I started to enjoy myself. And I walked into that ring knowing that I was going to have fun. There was no spoon. These limits I put on myself were self-imposed. They had no existing reality. More recently, I use this idea of there is no spoon when I was about to go on stage at the Ministry of Defense to give a talk to 300 MOD staff about the power of lucid dreaming. If you would have told me 10 years ago that I'd be talking about lucid dreaming in the Ministry of Defense I would have told you, "You're dreaming." So before I went on stage, I did have quite a lot of anxiety, and I reminded myself, "Okay, the anxiety is dreamlike. "It's self-imposed, it's a losery. "Charlie, there is no spoon." And once I said it, there is no spoon, something within me released, relaxed. And I realized these limits are self-created, mind-created. They're empty of inherent existence, just like a dream. There is no spoon. When you first hear about this next technique, you might need to have a, there is no spoon moment, because it can seem impossible, but actually it is totally possible to transition from the waking state through the hypnagogic, into dream with no blackout. Let's learn how in falling asleep consciously. For many people, this next technique is the holy grail of lucid dreaming practice. But let's not make such a big deal about it because if we do, we sometimes set up an expectation that can limit us. Although it can take quite a long time to master I've taught hundreds of people this technique and I've seen them apply it successfully within a few weeks, even many on the first night of practice. This technique is called falling asleep consciously. And the aim is to pass through the hypnagogic state into REM dreaming sleep, without blacking out or losing consciousness at all. Falling asleep consciously is both incredibly simple and often incredibly elusive. It involves letting your body and brain fall asleep, while part of your mind stays aware. I absolutely advise you to only practice this technique after awakening in the last few hours of your sleep cycle, when of course you'll enter REM dreaming straight from the hypnagogic state. As we learned before, when you first fall asleep it might take at least 80 minutes before you enter your first dream period. But if you wake yourself in the early hours and then fall back asleep, you can enter dreaming within about 15 minutes. For this technique, the more direct your entry into the dream state and the quicker you can enter it, the better, and the easier it will be to do. To enter the dream state lucidly, you need to be like a surfer. You need to paddle through the hypnogogic imagery and then drop into the wave of lucidity. If you have a good sense of mental balance and awareness then this is the technique for you. Let's look at five steps to falling asleep consciously. Step number one. After at least four and a half hours of sleep wake yourself up and write down your dreams. Then reset your intention to gain lucidity, close your eyes and allow yourself to drift back to sleep through the hypnagogic. Step two. As you enter the hypnagogic state, rather than reciting and affirmation as we've done before, I want you to gently focus your mental awareness on the hypnagogic imagery and simply float through it, be aware of it. Allow the hypnagogic imagery to build, layer upon layer upon layer. The key here is to maintain a delicate vigilance without blacking out and being sucked into the dream state unconsciously. Step three. Don't engage the hypnagogic imagery, but don't reject it either. Just lie there watching the hypnogogic imagery build until the dreamscape has been formed sufficiently for you to drop into it consciously. If you feel yourself blacking out just keep bringing your focus back to the hypnagogic imagery. It will continue to layer upon layer upon layer, until it starts to coalesce into an actual dreamscape. This is a wonderful thing to witness. Step four. As the dreamscape solidifies, you might feel a slight pool or sensation of being sucked forwards. This is an indication that the wave of the dream is now fully formed. In surfing terms, you're on point break. Step five. If you can just stay conscious for a few more moments and are ready to take the plunge, you'll soon find yourself dropping into the wave, with full lucidity. Falling asleep consciously can take quite some practice. But even when it doesn't work, it's still highly beneficial to do, because essentially, it's asking you to meditate into your dreams. So when you practice it, you're meditating into sleep which can affect your entire sleep cycle in a really powerful way. And when it does work it is such a cool experience to go from the waking state into a fully lucid dream without blacking out, that you will never forget it. In the early hours of the morning your hypnagogic state will lead you straight into REM dreaming, but the only way to access dreaming from the hypnagogic state, is to maintain mindful awareness without blacking out. Let's say it's five o'clock in the morning. You've woken up, you've written down your dreams, you go back into the hypnagogic state. At that time in the morning, the hypnogogic imagery will probably start arising quite quickly. So you see the imagery, the faces, the many dreams, the colors, the shapes, and you're just aware of them. You don't grab hold of them 'cause if you do you'll be grabbing hold of dream content and you'll be sucked into a non lucid dream. But if you ignore them or reject them you'll just stay in the waking state. So there's a balance here. To be aware of the hypnagogic, not pushing it away, but also not fully engaging it either. If you can manage to stay in that hypnagogic state consciously, after a few minutes, you'll notice that the quality of the hypnagogic begins to get thicker. It's almost like it's layering, and it is layering. Eventually the hypnagogic imagery will layer and layer and layer until it reaches a critical mass. When that critical mass is met, boom, suddenly a dream appears. And if you can manage to be lucid at that moment without blacking out, you enter the dream state with full lucidity, no need to reality check, no need to find a dream sign because you've gone from the hypnagogic state into the dream with no lack of consciousness. It's well worth trying. It's a really powerful experience. I advise everyone to try this technique. I know it can seem quite testing, but it's got a lot of beginners luck, and some people find they can nail it on their first night of practice. And even if you do think it's too hard, remember nothing's more difficult than anything else, because there is no spoon. And now, your actions for today. Firstly, practice the falling asleep consciously technique, either by itself or combined with the weight back to bed technique that we learned yesterday. Secondly, I want you to share a, there is no spoon moment in your life with the tribe. Perhaps a moment where you broke through a barrier, perhaps a moment where you faced the fear, or you moved beyond the limitation, anything like that, share that with the tribe. Also be sure to practice one of the stages of dream yoga if you become lucid tonight and as always keep up the three Ds, reality checks, and the Columbo mindset. Tomorrow, we continue to dive deep as we look at how lucid dream training has been used by several cultures around the world to train for the moment of death. Until then, enjoy your dreams.

====================

LESSON 26 – Preparing for Death Through Lucid Dreaming
--------------------
<v ->Lucid dreaming is one of the most</v> life affirming practices there is. But today we're going to explore how lucid dreaming can prepare us for death. Now by looking at death, this isn't designed to bum us out. It's actually designed to shake us up and wake us up to the limitations of our own mortality. And to learn how lucid dreaming can help prepare us for the most important moments of our lives, the end of it. Death is a shared commonality of human experience, and yet one that most people never even talk about. Thanatophobia, which is the fear of one's own mortality, is unsurprisingly said to be the most prevalent fear among humans. But as I'm sure you've learned already, this Quest is about facing our fear. A more what better way to do so, than a practice that prepares us to meet that fear head on. Lucid dreaming is said to be one of the most powerful practices to conscious dying. So now let's learn one of the most powerful sleep practices for lucid dreaming. When I was 17, I had a near-death experience. I'd like to say it was one of those special ones where people meet angels and stuff, but actually it was a little bit more raw. I had a drugs overdose that led my heart to stop. I did have the full tunnel of light and the life review, but it was pretty scary. And when I came out surviving the near death experience, I experienced panic attacks and nightmares. In fact, it was those panic attacks that led me to explore meditation because I thought, unless I worked my own mind, I'm going to get sent to a psych ward. And when the nightmares continued, it was that that led me to lucid dreaming. As we learned before, I had been lucid dreaming from the age of 16, 17, but only using it for sex and skateboarding. But once I started to have those nightmares, I realized, maybe lucid dreaming could help me cure them and it did. Four months of post-traumatic stress disorder nightmares ended up being cured in one lucid dream. So it's at 17 that I first discovered the full power of lucid dreaming. And also at 17 that I made the connection between death and dreams. Within the Tibetan Buddhist tradition, lucid dreaming isn't seen as a left field, New Agey practice as it is in the West. Lucid dreaming is seen as one of the most high practices within the whole tradition. This is because it prepares us for the most important moments of our life, our death. If you talk to some Tibetan Lamas about your non lucid dreams, you'll see they tend to glaze over as every Westerner seems to want to tell them about the same dream where they were having tea with the Dalai Lama. But if you start talking to Tibetan lamas about your lucid dreams, you might see that they perk up. Because within the Buddhist tradition, lucid dreaming is seen as a profound practice. And the reason it's seen as such a profound practice is this direct connection to conscious dying. As you might know already, Buddhists believe in rebirth. But it's not as simple as, when you die you're instantly reborn. Within the Tibetan Buddhist tradition, it's believed that when you die, but before you are reborn or reincarnate into your next life, there's a place in between. And this place in between is called the bardo. And although our entire experience of existence is made up of a series of bardos, usually when you hear that term it's referring to the after death bardo. It's believed that when we die, but before we're reborn to our next life, we enter a after death bardo state. That bardo state is said to be dreamlike and hallucinatory. Because as the mind separates from the physical body at the point of death, it flips inwardly and experiences the totality of its own projection, a bit like when we dream. So it's believed that if by the time of death, you have mastered the art of lucid dreaming, the ability to go into your dreams and go, "Aha, I'm dreaming." Then at the point of death, when the dreamlike hallucinations arise you might be able to recognize them as well and go, "Aha, I'm dying." Lucid death. Conscious dying is said to be the highest achievement of the spiritual practitioner. And although the New Age crew like to think otherwise, most people do not die consciously. Why? Because we die as we dream. As my teacher, Lamia Shirimpashe once told me, "Charlie, you want to know "what your mind will be like at death? "Look at how your mind is "during dreams. "If you can reliably train the mind "to recognize your dreams as dreams, "then death means nothing to you. "because at the point of death, "you can recognize the bardo "like a dream "and then you can be with Buddha." So he is directly saying, as all the Tibetan lamas have said in the past, that lucid dreams training is training for the moment of death, the ultimate dream. So let's look at this connection in some more depth. Essentially it's said that dying process mirrors the process of falling asleep. So every time when we fall asleep we're getting a trial run for death and dying. And if we can master the art of falling asleep consciously, maintaining full awareness as we pass through the hypnagogic state into sleep, then we might be able to die consciously too, which is said to be the highest achievement on the spiritual path. Out of all the techniques we've looked at so far, it's said that falling asleep consciously is the most direct training for conscious dying. Because in the same way, as we go from the waking state through the hypnagogic into dream with no blackout, it trains us to go from life, through the dying state, into the bardo, with no blackout. I'm aware that most people watching this Quest are not going to be Buddhists. So please don't think that I'm telling you this to try and push a belief system on you. The reason I'm telling you this is to give you some sort of context as to where lucid dreaming sits within the tradition. So you know that lucid dreaming isn't some New Agey practice that's done just for fun. In this tradition, lucid dreaming has been practiced for hundreds of years, for training for the most important moment of our lives, our deaths. And even if you don't believe in any of this, there will be part of your mind that can't unknow what's just been said. And so hopefully every time you practice lucid dreaming there'll be parts of you that knows you're training for your death and dying states. And perhaps thanatophobia, the fear of our own mortality, will start to be reduced, lucid dream by lucid dream. And now it's time for your actions for today. The first thing I want you to do is to share your relationship with your own mortality, with Tribe. Let the other members of the Quest know, are you prepared for death? Can you see the connection between death and dreaming? How do you feel when we talk about death? Also, I want you to practice either the Falling Asleep Consciously technique, the Wake, Back To Bed technique or one of the four variations of the Hypnagogic Affirmation. As always keep up the 3 Ds: Dream Recall, Dream Diaries and Dream Signs. Be doing reality checks all the time and keep up the Columbo mindset. The Tibetans teachings tell us that we can not only transform our fear of death into a dynamic source of energy that can help us wake up to life, but also that we can use lucid dreaming to help prepare for death itself. Tomorrow we're going to ground ourselves back in waking life though, with some straight up lucid dreaming techniques that will help us learn to maintain lucidity. Brilliant advice for anyone who's having lucid dreams, but are finding they wake up before the good bit. So until then, sweet dreams. Enjoy your lucidity.

====================

LESSON 27 – Lucidity Stabilisation Techniques
--------------------
<v ->As we approach the end of week four</v> many of you may have started already having lucid dreams, which is great. And for those of you who haven't, don't worry. The lucidity is coming soon. So now the next thing we need to do is learn how to stay in the lucid dream once we're in it. Welcome to maintaining lucidity techniques. Have you ever been to the circus and looked up at a tightrope walker balancing on the high wire? Maintaining lucidity is exactly the same. It's just like balancing on a tightrope. On one side of a lucidity tightrope is non-lucid dreaming, and on the other side of the lucidity tightrope is the waking state. What we need to do is keep our balance in the middle. When we first step on to a tightrope we might only be able to walk a few steps. Naturally, we've only just stepped on there. We're going to fall off the wire in a few seconds. It's exactly the same when we first start lucid dreaming. As many of you will have found out already, your first few lucid dreams go something like this. "I'm dreaming, I'm dreaming, this is so cool", boom and then we wake up in bed. Yeah, like that. So how do we stop that? How do we make sure that the aha moments of lucid awareness doesn't make us so excited we wake up? But also, the after the aha moments of lucid awareness we don't get so distracted, we become non-lucid. For many beginners the difficulty is not so much getting onto the lucidity spectrum, it's staying there. The aha moments of lucid awareness is often so strong that we lose our balance and fall off the tightrope into the waking state. Or, on the other hand, we can fall the other way into non-lucid dreaming. This is caused by becoming distracted and forgetting that we're dreaming once we're lucid. Here are three techniques to help us learn to stay on the tightrope of lucidity. Technique number one, keep calm and carry on. Keep calm and carry on is pretty good advice for lucid dreamers too, if you're in the lucid dream and you feel that the excitement is waking you up. We need to keep calm and carry on dreaming in order to avoid the panic of waking up too quickly. Essentially, the first part is about doing whatever you would do in the waking state to keep calm, but you do it in the lucid dream. So, as you've seen by now, I'm pretty verbal, pretty vocal, so if I'm in a lucid dream and I feel myself waking up I'll go, "Okay, stay calm Charlie, stay calm, "it's just a lucid dream, stay calm". Other people might like to regulate their breathing as a way to stay calm. Others might like to try self soothing in some way, calming themselves down, stroking themselves gently. However you'd do it in the waking state, do it in the dream state. It'll work in exactly the same way. The second part of the technique is really important, too. Carry on, because the lucid dream likes movement and if we stay too still or prevaricate about what we want to do, we may find that the lucidity begins to slip. Think about it. How many dreams have you had when you're totally still? Most dreams tend to have a sense of movement. You're searching for something. You're being chased by someone. You're looking for something. You're moving. So, if you become lucid and you stand totally still, the dream almost doesn't know what to do with it. It kind of freaks the dream out and you might find you wake up. So, stay calm, but also carry on. The second technique is about engaging your dream plan. This technique seems self explanatory, but actually I was teaching the exact opposite for the first five years of my career. I used to tell people, like most other lucid dreaming teachers still do, that when you first get lucid don't do much. Just stay calm, ground yourself, look around. Actually, what I now realize though is that this wastes precious time and that the lucid dream is like a fire that needs fuel to keep burning. So, if you do too little the fire evaporates. So I say the best way to keep your balance on the lucidity tightrope and the best way of feeding the dream the fuel it needs is to call our your Sankalpa as soon as you become lucid. So as soon as you're lucid do your dream plan. The first time I experienced this I'd become lucid in a dream that was really shaky, really low level lucidity, but my dream plan was really important to me. It was to send healing to my mom who was sick. So, I became lucid and I called out my Sankalpa. "May my mom be happy and well. "May my mom be free from disease." As soon as I called out the Sankalpa it's as if the dreamer responded and voom, suddenly the dream became incredibly solid, incredibly high definition, incredibly vivid. I like to think it was the dreamer going, "Oh wait, this one's really important to Charlie. "This is a really important dream plan for him. "Let's give him a nice, stable, lucid dream." Try it out, see if it works for you. The third technique is my absolute favorite. It's called "Lucidity Boost". Essentially, you're in a lucid dream and you feel the lucidity start to fade or you feel yourself start to wake up and you call out within the lucid dream, "Lucidity Boost!", or "Amplify Lucidity!". And exactly the same way the dreamer responds and gives you what you asked for. I know this can seem weird, but actually think about it. When you get lucid and you call out, inner child come to me, the dreamer responds by presenting you with a 3-D personification of your own inner child. So actually, it doesn't ask much to go, "Hey dreamer, give me some more lucidity". Knock and the door will open. Once we call out lucidity boost, or increase lucidity or something like that, we might see a sudden increase in lucid awareness and a sharpening of the detail in the dreamscape as the dreamer manifests our request. It's really quite powerful the first time you do it, to see how there's like a bio feedback mechanism working. You call out for it. The dreamer responds. You call out for it. The dreamer responds. This technique is so cool that I sometimes like to try it out in the waking state when I'm feeling dull or sleepy. So, in the same way, as we learned before, that we can use the, there is no spoon affirmation in the waking state, if we're feeling scared, nervous or limited. If you're feeling dull or sleepy in the waking state, call out "Lucidity boost!". See if it works. It really does for me. And now, your actions for today. Number one, practice one of the lucidity maintenance techniques once you become lucid. So, even if your dreamer's super stable why not try out something like Lucidity Boost just to see if you can get it even more lucid? Of course, tonight practice one of the chosen techniques, either Falling Asleep Consciously, Wake, Back to Bed, or one of the four Hypnogogic Affirmation techniques. As always, keep up the 3 Ds, the reality checks and the Columbo mindset. And also, don't forget to check in with your Tribe dream circles. Keep that going. Check in, share your dreams, share your experiences, ghee each other up, move towards lucidity together. Tomorrow as per usual, we will be having our weekly pep talk and our weekly quiz. But, we won't be having our bedtime story. Booo. But, don't worry, we're going to have something even more fun. We are going to conduct a lucid dream psychic communication experiment. You're going to love it. Until then, sweet dreams.

====================

LESSON 28 – Summary of Your Fourth Week
--------------------
<v ->Okay dreamers.</v> I told you that we were going to go deep in this last week together. And today is no exception, although this is our implementation and review day, and it's about fun, inspiration, and relaxation, we're still going to go just as deep. We are going to take part in a psychic lucid dream experiment. But hold your horses. Before that let's gear ourselves up with our weekly pep talk. So you did it. You completed week four of the quest and we are almost the end of our journey together. But here's the big reveal. Your quest doesn't end in two days time. In fact, in many ways, it really begins in earnest. This quest has been great at creating a dynamic group energy as you all journey together day by day. But we have to acknowledge something too. Lucid dreaming is by definition, a solo activity. It happens inside our own minds, and involves ourselves meeting our self. So the real journey begins on day 31. When you don't have your daily video or your weekly pep talk or your tribe members to share with. You do however have yourself, your sleep, and your growing capacity to lucid dream, always with you. Remember, you've been lucid dreaming as a child. Lucid dreaming is your birthright. It is something which we all have the capacity to do. At this stage of the quest, I know loads of you who have already started having lucid dreams, but for those of you who haven't, don't sweat it and definitely don't give up now. It can take months for some people to have their first lucid dream. But as I'm sure you've seen already, within just a few days, your dreamer will start to respond and you can start to see change occurring. Maybe you're remembering more dreams. Maybe you're becoming more conscious in the hypnagogic. Maybe you're becoming pre-lucid in your dreams. So there is proof that your mind and your dreamer are responding to the techniques. So keep going with these and soon you will become lucid. Every body can lucid dream if they keep up regular practice of effective techniques, combined with the two ingredients. Enthusiasm and determination. As for what techniques to do when, we're going to have a whole session on this. How to create a weekly schedule. That will be on day 30, the last day of our quest. But for now I would suggest as always, dream recall affirmation every night as you're falling asleep. Dream diary every single morning. Reality checks every day. As I said, if your friends or family haven't asked you, dude, what's wrong with your hands? You're probably not doing it enough. And then each night, you can be practicing one of our three main lucidity techniques. Hypnagogic Affirmation for variants, Falling Asleep Consciously, or Wake, Back to Bed technique. Oh, and if you've noticed that your dreams have started to contain more shadow aspects than usual, that is a really good sign. Because it shows that your shadow is ready to meet you. And now it's time for our weekly quiz. Again, without checking back in the previous lessons of the quest, I want you to answer the following questions from memory. Fingers on the buzzers. Question number one, what fraction of spontaneous lucid dreams begin as nightmares? That's right. One third. Question number two. What is the most important thing to do when you meet your shadow in a lucid dream, dark or golden? Hug it. Of course you can dialogue with your shadow aspects but I say hug first, talk later. Question number three. What are the four stages of Dream Yoga? Yes. Recognition, transformation multiplication and unification. Question number four. What is the Tibetan word for the intermediate space between the end of this life and rebirth into the next? Yes. Bardo. And finally, what should you call out in a lucid dream if you feel the clarity of your consciousness begins to fade? Altogether now. Lucidity boost. And now it's time for our lucid dreams psychic experiment. Okay. Essentially, it's like this. The aim is for you guys, through your dreams tonight, lucid or not, to tune in to my mind, and correctly specify the target image that I will be transmitting from my lucid dream. When I go to sleep tonight, on the night of day 28 of this quest, I will be meditating on a photo of a specific target image. It might be an animal, or a building or an object for example, but it will be clear and definable. Then, for the whole night, as soon as I enter the liminal space or the hypnagogic or the hypnopompic. As soon as I enter any lucid dream state, I will broadcast the target image from my mind, with the firm intention, that any and all lucid dreaming quest tribe members, recognize and remember the target image. Basically, my job is to spend the entire night broadcasting this one specific image into the collective consciousness. Even when I wake up to pee, I will immediately start meditating on the photo of the target image, so that the strength of the broadcast is never lost. Your job is to tune in to that broadcast and recognize the target image. Then tomorrow, I will ask you guys to share with the tribe, what you thought the target image was. Once we've got all your answers in, I will then share what the target image actually was. And we can see how many of you were able to get a clean hit on the target. And for those of you who are taking this quest after the light live event, don't worry. You can still participate, because the target image will still be out there in the collective consciousness, waiting to be seen on every 28th night of the quest. Remember, my intention is for any and all lucid dreaming tribe quest members, to recognize and remember the target image, regardless of time or location. So don't worry about the time zones either. In fact, I decided on the target image while I was scripting this quest. So the image is actually already out there waiting to be seen. And it will be out there forever. In fact, if you went to Professor Rupert Sheldrake's Morphic Resonance theory, then this psychic experiment should actually get easier for those partaking in it after the live event. Why? No, not because you've asked the other tribe members what the target image was, but because the target image will be strengthened and stamped deeper and deeper into the morphic resonance field, every time someone gets it right. Okay. So, what do we have to do exactly? Before bed tonight, set a strong intention to recognize and remember the target image from Charlie Morley's lucid dream, psychic communication experiment. If you're lucid tonight, be sure to call out in the dream, target image now. Target image now. So that your dreamer can present you with what the target image is. And if you're not lucid tonight, still be sure to write down your dreams in detail and be on the lookout for any and all big bold aspects of the dream, that you think might be the target image. Remember, your dreamer will be trying to help you with this. So lucid or non lucid, you can still play along. Don't forget, this is all about psychic intuition, so trust your gut, and be sure to use the hypnagogic and hypnopompic states too. How? Either use them to recite an affirmation, to recognize the target image, or use them as a way to tune into the target image itself. So, you can tune into the target image through the lucid dream state, through the non-lucid dream state, through the hypnagogic, through the hypnopompic. And even just through your own waking state intuition. Have fun with this. Don't take it too seriously and don't think too hard about how it works. I don't even know how it works, actually. I mean, we could theorize about quantum entanglement of consciousness, the nonlinear nature of time, and the oneness of consciousness within the morphic field. Or we could just have some fun, and see if you can tune into the target image. So enjoy it and tune tonight. And now, your actions for today. This is still the review and implementation day. So don't forget to catch up on any content that you've missed. If you skip the day or one of the days wasn't clear, be sure to go back and watch the video so that you're all caught up. And of course, participate in the psychic lucid dream experiment. Then tomorrow, share what you think the target image was with the tribe. Then once all the answers are in, I'll share what the target image actually was. Please don't feel like you have to participate in the psychic experiment. If it in any way makes you feel uneasy, or conflicts with your religious or spiritual beliefs, then simply ignore it, and have another night of lucid dreaming practice. But for those of you who do want to participate, I look forward to communicating with you tonight and for those who don't, sweet dreams, and I'll see you tomorrow.

LESSON 28 – Experience Lucid Dreaming Bonus Live Call #4: Your Stage of Dream Yoga

Hello, everyone, and welcome to Experience Lucid Dreaming's live call. This is our fourth one out of five. So we've got our last one, our celebration call next week. Today, we are focusing on your stage of dream yoga. A lot of you submitted your lucid dreams. We're going to bring some of you onto the call. And remember, these live experience calls are where you can connect with the author, share with your tribe, and get the support on your quest. So let's dive right into it. I'm Marley from London. How you doing, man? Hey man, I am very good and very happy to be here as always, but especially today because for those who are in the first cohort, today was the day we finished the quest. Now, I know that next week is our celebratory call and that's when we're going to party and be like, yeah, we did it. But come on, let's have a little bit now. Yeah, we did it. So brilliant. So, so happy that we're here. And remember, I was doing the course along with you. So I was going day by day and I was a little bit like a moche. you know, a little bit emotional today when it came to the last day. And I was like, oh, I feel sad I won't be seeing my own face on my phone every day. What a complete narcissist. But yeah, I was because I was kind of saddened that maybe I won't be so up to date with all of your progress and all the stories, all the messages I'm getting on Instagram and stuff. Having said that, please don't stop doing that. It is a little bit of a... Well, not an annoying thing, but just something that often happens, which frustrates some people, is that when the retreat finishes, when the workshop finishes, when, in this case, the quest finishes, that next week... people start having lucid dreams and there's no one to tell. Oh, I haven't got my dream circle anymore. I can't tell Charlie. Yes, you can. You can still connect with the tribe. You can still connect with your dream circle. You can still message me. So don't feel that everything just kind of hits off now. Everything just falls off the ledge because the quest is finished. Please do carry this on because 30 days, no, it isn't very long at all. So for many of you, you'll just be kind of starting out. on your journey it can take a few a few weeks and months to stabilize lucid dreaming so please don't stop here no this is the beginning not the end um okay so what i want to do as always is i'm going to bring up the last week go through it fill in some gaps i mean because last week the subjects were so big were so juicy i was looking at my notes going like how do i fill this stuff in um so i think it's better actually to go to q a uh have a slightly longer q a at the end and then allow you to ask the questions that need to be filled in um but let me get this up on screen so week four okay we start off with lucid nightmare so straight off the bat week four we're like shadow stuff nightmare stuff scary stuff so Well done for completing week four because a lot of people won't want to go to that space, but you did. I hope the nightmare day was helpful. A lot of people find it is. Simply to find someone talking in a way that depathologizes nightmares. Because so often we believe that nightmares are a sign of a broken mind. They're a sign that something's gone wrong. They're a sign of our lack of spirituality or something. And that is complete bullshit. Nightmares are a completely natural part of the healing process. And thank goodness we have them. Without nightmares, literally without nightmares, we would all be going psychotic every time we had a minor trauma. Because nightmares are designed to integrate our trauma. So really, really important there. The cave you fear to enter, so the shadow stuff. Of course, that was a quote from the brilliant mythologist Joseph Campbell. The cave you fear to enter holds the treasure that you seek. Ah, it's even written in that iambic pentameter, I think, with Shakespeare. Yeah, you know, the dude's just a poet. It just flows out of him. Brilliant mythology. So check out his stuff and also go back to that day again. You know, check out the shadow stuff. It can take a while for that, for the shadow work to kind of land. But I hope you enjoyed that day. Then, of course, we have the four stages of dream yoga. Recognition, transformation of fear. multiplication of the dreamscape doing impossible things and unification. Unification with what? With your Buddha nature, with the higher source. Day 25, there is no spoon. I've got a lucid dream that I want to share with you about that. So there is no spoon is a great concept for both our waking life and our dream life. So I want to ask you whether you had any there is no spoon moments in this last week. Day 26, preparation for death. I mean, when I look at week four, I'm like, why didn't I spread it out more? It's like I just saved all the massive juiciest stuff of week four. But I realized why I did it. You know, we needed to keep this step by step. I needed to kind of introduce this stuff and wait till we had a really firm foundation by the end of week three. And that's like, boom, week four. Now we can bring in the esoteric stuff. Now we can, you know, really start cooking with gas. 27 lucidity stabilization techniques a lot of questions about that come up before so again go back to there how to stabilize the dream once you're in it our review and integration day of course was not the bedtime story but the psychic experiment i'm sure you are all well aware of what the hit was but the target image was i had loads of amazing ideas of what it could be coming through all my messages and emails and instagram and stuff like that now what we need to be aware of is that the target image your ideas for what the target image is are going to be in the chat so we need to find try and try and find a way for people who are doing the experiment later not to see what your target images came through however what i will say about the psychic experiment is i put the image up there way before last week so actually when we did the beta test which was like a month ago i went into the lucid dream i became lucid and i was calling out and not only that i then stayed in the lucid stream and went and the target image of will stay in the collective unconscious forever every time anyone ever does this quest the target image is there because i thought well what if i can't get lucid every single month when there's a new cohort and i miss it so i thought i'll just put it up there forever so it was actually in there before you did uh the uh the quest because some people were saying oh but when charlie goes to sleep i might have completed the lesson before so is the target image up yeah the target image was put up like a month ago and in fact i guess it was kind of put up when we were filming the quest because that deep intention was there um but yes i did get lucid and call out into the sky the target images i tried to visualize that i couldn't quite get it i tried to do a full unification practice of you know visualized saying the mantra couldn't quite do it but um yeah so the target image is definitely there so i hope you had some fun with that um And then, of course, these last couple of days, greeting gremlins and onwards into the dream. So some pretty big things in week four. I just want to share a couple of my own lucid dreams before we go on. I've kept quiet about my own practice for this month because it's not about me. It's about you guys. But I think, you know, it's interesting to share some of the stuff and it will help elucidate one of these. So these were both last week, I think. Yeah. And there is no spoon warmers. Really great. So I had become lucid from a false awakening. So in the dream, I had had a dream that Waffles was out in her little bed outside my bedroom, but she was kind of crying and moaning. And I woke up thinking, oh no, something's wrong with Waffles. And I picked her up in my arms like that to comfort her. And I looked to the wall and I started Columboing. I was like, hang on, why does my corridor look weird? And I looked down at Waffles and I was like... There's nothing wrong with her. Why is she crying? And then it dawned on me and I was like, boom, into lucidity. Again, not again, but I know I often say you don't have to have the hand check. The hand check is a way to double check. So if you can Colombo your way to lucidity, you do it. I looked at the evidence of the situation. I realized that the hallway looked different before I became lucid. And because the hallway looked different and because I had completed my dream plan for that week, I was kind of dream planless, which I know is an amateur mistake, but I didn't have time to make a new one by the time this lucid dream came. So because kind of hallway was in my mind, I thought, oh, I'll try some wall walking, you know, walking through walls because I haven't done that for ages. So I pushed my hand through the wall that goes through to the bathroom, my hallway, and it was solid. I was like, oh, hang on. Wait, I'm fully lucid, dude. and i reminded myself i'm fully lucid this wall does not exist and then my hand went through and the texture was so cool like my it felt like um like the plasterboard you know i could tell that the plasterboard was there and then i was running my finger like that through the wall like imagine running your finger through the icing the frosting on the top of a uh a birthday cake it was like that and i was oh this is so cool then i turned around to face that wall coming into this room I got right through the wall and I just went there's no wall boom and walked through it as I walked through the wall it blacked out now that often happens it's almost as if the mind kind of doesn't quite know how to make going through a wall look so it just kind of blacks you out but then it blacked out boom and then it reformed and I was in this room here in my living room um and then I oh yeah so then I turn around to the uh window here and I think oh I'm gonna fly out And when I tried to go through the glass, it was actually pretty solid. The glass was more solid than the wall. And I've had that before. Again, almost if the brain doesn't know quite what to make of glass because it's kind of reflective. And I guess a glass is actually a super cool liquid. It's not actually a solid. So maybe there's something to do with that. Anyway, I went through the glass and I got stuck and I actually had to use there is no spoon. So my head was stuck through and I was like, oh, I went, dude, there is no spoon. There is no spoon. And I've so programmed myself just as you can that there is no spoon means all limitations dissolve. All kind of limits are removed. So just as I said, there is no spoon. Boom. And I popped through it and then kind of flew down the street. So it was cool because I was kind of using the techniques week by week as you guys are, which is really nice to kind of check that they work and check that the progression of the techniques work. Yeah, and just one other. I'll share another lucid dream last week, too, because it's a fun healing one. I got plantar fasciitis. I started running in lockdown. I do a lot of martial arts, but don't really run. But in lockdown, I started running and got this thing, plantar fasciitis. It's where your heels really, really hurt due to a tightness in the calf muscle, actually, from incorrect running, basically. And I had this plan to heal my heels. Very nice Sankalpa. Heal my heels. Heal my heels. So I became lucid. And I rubbed my hands together and I went, I heal my heels, I heal my heels. And I put my dream hands on my heels and started doing the healing practice. Then I thought, oh, I want to make energy come out of my hands. When I started making the energy come out of my hands, it's like it activated my energy body. And suddenly I went and started vibrating. And I knew that meant I was about to have an out -of -body experience. So suddenly I was in the lucid dream and I'm like, oh, she, I'm about to go out of body. And then an out -of -body experience from a lucid dream. It's like how people can get confused with it. I don't know. It's such a different feeling. It felt like I was getting sucked out of the dream and turning from like solid to liquid. and i became liquid and then i was like being pulled back through the ether and out of the top of the dream and i was like oh i'm not in kansas anymore and it's been a long time since i've done any out of body experience work like a couple of years so i was had a little bit of fear and then i remembered if ever you're an out of body experience or a lucid dream you feel fear drop into love you know you are you are in a mind created environment or when you're in an ob a little bit mind a little bit reality but still make your reality love so i just started thinking loving things saying loving things thinking about kindness and then all the fear dissolved and it was sucked into this quite epic ob which i won't go into um anyway so i just wanted to share a couple of those just so you know i have been doing the practice along with you the techniques work for me too um and yeah it's been so great hearing about all your lucid dreams and all your experiences so what i want to do uh before we move on to the sharing is what did i want to oh yeah yeah sure There is no spoon, lucidity and the shadow. Okay. I want to know if you've had a lucid dream in the last week, I want you to write lucid into the chat. Let's see who's had a lucid dream in the last. Oh, here they come. Lucid, lucid, lucid, lucid, lucid, lucid, lucid. Lucid, I think. Lucid, lucid, lucid. Lucid every week. Great. Great, great. First lucid dream yesterday. Brilliant. Semi -lucid, lucid, lucid, lucid, pre -lucid, momentarily lucid. Loads of lucid dreams. Brilliant. Okay. Who has, in the last week, or maybe since they learned about all the shadow stuff, who has had an encounter with their shadow in their dream, lucid or non -lucid? I want you to write shadow. If you have met an element of your shadow or anything kind of nightmarish. Okay, here we go. Lots of shadows coming through. Lucid shadow, lucid, I think. Shadow, shadow, shadow. Very common. that once you kind of learn about what the shadow is once you give the dreamer that vocabulary that the shadow is anything we repress denial disown both gold and dark it's like the dreamer knows that you know and then we'll start presenting you with that and then finally uh has anyone had a there is no spoon moment in the last week In the dream state, in the waking state, lucid, non -lucid, any there is no spoon. I want you to write spoon in the chat. Has anyone had a there is no spoon moment? Oh, loads of there is no spoon moments. Okay, cool. Brilliant, brilliant, brilliant. Okay, that's cool. This is great to see. So what I want to do now is hand over to Ezra. And we've got some people who have had lucid dreams. I think most of them have been the last week or anyway, they've had lucid dreams. And these particular ones I wanted to share because they can be used to either illustrate an element of the four stages of dream yoga, an element of there is no spoon or an element of shadow work. So we can get those up now, please, Ezra. Sure thing. First up, we're going to bring on to the call, Virginie. Let me share her. Can you guys see it? Yes. Okay. So Virginia, your dream was long and we don't have time to read through all of it, but I'd like you to just take us from the moment where you become lucid. In fact, you don't even need to read. You don't need to read it. It's your dream, but take us from the moment you became lucid and then just give us some, some of the important features of your lucid dream. And well done, by the way, for having it. You know, I was kind of desperate because I had, I don't had any lucid dream till the Friday. So I was overexcited when it happened. Right. So, yeah, I was trying to become lucid during, but consciously, you know. And so I was feeling with these colors and with that we can feel when we are in this hypnagogic state. And suddenly I see this white wooden door in front of me. And I say, wow, that's, yeah, cool. So I fly to this door. But I'm not flying like Superman. Like I said, it's like I'm above the ground and just come closer to the door. And when I'm close to the door, well, first I notice that there is this bright light around the door. And when I come closer to this door, very, very close to the door, I'm looking for, a handle but nothing so it seems that i cannot open the door so i was still thinking no spoon no spoon and and finally i realized well i feel that that's not the right time for opening this door so i totally accept the fact that this door is closed that's perfectly fine for me. And then I saw this black cat, very, very cute black cat. And that's, I'll keep, I'm confused talking about it right now, I'm sorry. Yeah, I'm super excited when I talk about it because at the time I was very excited to overexcited. That's why I kept saying the nose. And actually what I wanted to share, that's what you wanted me to tell you about. So it was the cat. This is interesting. So because we're seeing your processes. So it was the cat that hit you off. The cat was your dream sign. I think you saw the cat and then you checked your hands. Yes, that's right. I shake my hands and it was man hands. And so that was rude. And there was only three fingers and my thumb was just going like this. That's very strange. So, yeah, I'm dreaming. So I became overexcited. And at that point, I thought, what's my Sankalpa? I couldn't remember. And I said first, inner child. And then I realized, no, that's not inner child. That's inner healer. So inner healer. And that's when the weirdest thing happened. And that's when I felt my eyes moving, the movement of my eyes. I just, yeah, I was feeling hit so strongly. It was so powerful. And yeah, I'm just in awe of that. I'm just so grateful that I felt that. And this was you being in the lucid dream. But while you're in the lucid dream, you could feel the rapid eye movement. You could feel your eye. And that's called dual body awareness. Very, very interesting. You can be 100 % in the lucid dream, you know, moving around like this or whatever. But you can also simultaneously feel your body asleep in bed still, except for the movement of your chest and the movement of your eyes. And you're thinking, how can my brain do that? How can I be aware of that at the same time? So it's very cool awareness that you had there. Yeah, and I didn't expect that at all. I don't think you ever talked about it. No, we haven't. The quest. So I was just, what's happening? Is it an out -of -body experience? And I thought, no, that's not, I don't think so. No, it was lucid dreaming. Yeah, it was just, yeah, it was amazing. And it was, yeah, I'm so thankful for this quest. And then afterwards, I felt something was more peaceful, really peaceful. And I just, you know, felt that I was about to wake up. But it was just, I was perfectly fine with that. And when I woke up afterwards, it was like, you know, I had, I was on fire, really. I was, you know, it was like adrenaline shot. I don't know. It was, I've never been so awake in my entire life. It was amazing. And all day long, I was like, boom, boom, you know. And at the same time, I was very grounded, you know. You know, we talked about in the quest, the gamma brainwaves, that the brain goes into gamma. So when we wake from a lucid dream, our brain is flooded in gamma. So it's very common to have this feeling of just like real wakefulness, but not kind of buzzing, but just like, boom, I am aware, I'm awake. And it really seemed like you had that. Just let me know, Virginie, what techniques did you use to get lucid? What was your journey into lucidity? You mean for that dream? Yeah, for that one. Well, it was, you know, very early in the morning. So I was, I thought I should try getting it consciously, going to consciously. And it took a while, I think, but afterwards it was, you know. I think you did that because again, one of the reasons I wanted to share your dream was because you had been asleep for a long period and then knew that you, you know, so maybe you'd had six, seven hours sleep already. came up and you drop back in with a classic falling asleep consciously you talk about how you saw the the hypnagogic emerge and then it becomes thicker and then you saw these things suddenly you're in a dream that's it that's falling asleep consciously which is one of the most difficult techniques to do um so that's really really good that you found that and a really good example of how if you're not into all the wake -ups you know because i was not so tired because exactly so do what version he does which is get good amount of sleep on your belt you know six seven hours then just have a brief awakening and then it's almost like a hypnopompic drop in you're almost just kind of where the hypnagogic and hypnopompic kind of meets because it becomes quite circular at that time in the morning very easy to drop back into dreams you chose the perfect technique for the perfect time you remembered your dream plan uh you engaged it you had this great feeling afterwards yeah textbook And, you know, I feel so healed since that dream that I know I have to do a new dream plan. Even if it was not, you know, I know I have to do another dream plan. And so, yeah, thank you so much, Charlie. I'm so happy to share this with you and the tribe. Thank you. Brilliant. Thank you so much. Thank you, Virginia. You're welcome. All right. Next up is Tony. Tony Lee, last week he brought us, I'm not going to meet the son of God, I'm going to have sex. This week brings us... Yeah, to go step up this time. It's good to have you back, man. Again, fascinating lucid dream that you had this time. I know there's a lot of detail there, but kind of drop us in from the point of lucidity and let us know how it was for you. First of all, just to get it down. So Tony, we're using wait back to bed method. So we want to know the methods that he used, the moment he triggered into lucidity and then the dream plan that he engaged. Yeah, sure. So I used the wait back to bed method. I woke up about four o 'clock in the morning and then I listened to your hypnagogical affirmations. And then actually I stayed up for about 30 minutes to do my breathing exercise that I usually do. And now I use your hypnagogical affirmations too. fall back to sleep. I stay in the hypnagogic state for a while. I kind of just start seeing images like visually it starts from by some lights and in terms to like Mandela's kaleidoscope and then so it went from this random images to a more time -linear image just so I was I see myself walking up the stairs to the top of the building and then so once I'm at the top of the building I remember my Sankopa. I think that when I used the falling sleep consciously technique it didn't feel like I was blacking out so I was in this kind of time linear image in my head for the time and I can kind of feel my bodies in my bed but at the same time I can feel all the images all the time linear images start popping up and I was part of the story so part of the dream yeah so at the top of the building I call out my Sankopa which is to be my shadows so I remember your Sankopa which is shadow come to me So I caught a shadow come to me and the dog appears like a Jack Russell, just like what I had in the picture. So it's kind of, he's quite aggressive, very scared. So I kind of just kneeled down to his level and then I just waited for him to come down. And then once he came down, I just kind of patted his head and then stroke his head and just massage his head like I did to my dog. And then after that, I did... another center which is another shadow come to me um and then i could go we'll stop you there for a sec tony because it's really nice progression you brought here so the first time tony calls out for his shadow was this the first time you ever called out for a shadow in a lucid dream So I love the presentation of what the dreamer gives you. Again, anyone who's scared of shadow work, Carl Jung, the inventor, well, pioneer of the term, the shadow, clearly said, the shadow will only give you what you're ready for. Shadow integration is about moving towards wholeness, not about moving towards separation. So the shadow will not give you something that will make you split, that will make you separate, that will give you trauma. So really nice that Tony's first experience with the shadow was kind of a pretty classic shadow image, you know, of a kind of a ferocious dog. But it was little. It was a Jack Russell. You know, the shadow didn't give him too much. It was like, OK, this is his first step of the shadow. Let's see how he is with the kind of slightly aggressive little dog. And he nailed it. He went straight and he patted it. He showed it love. He didn't kind of fight it or push it away. And then, because he's in a long lucid dream, Tony, he calls out the Sankalpa a second time. I don't think I've mentioned that. You can totally do that. You know, you can actually have multiple dream plans in one single lucid dream or do the same dream plan, the same Sankalpa, multiple times in one lucid dream. So Tony goes for it a second time. Back to you, Tony. So the second time I call Sankalpa, a golden statue, like an Oscar award statue, appeared. It's kind of really big as well. So it walked towards me and I walked towards it. I remember you said, I know it's good to embrace your shadow in your dream. So I just walked towards it and I embraced it. That was quite easy as well. It's kind of nice feeling, you know, embracing a golden statue. Yeah. And of course, it sounds like in that one, Tony, that was your golden shadow. People often say, you know, how do I know what shadow material I'm going to get? Now, for most of us, well, for most of us, for many people in the West, and I guess that's most of the people I end up teaching, I would say the majority of people have more unintegrated dark shadow than they do golden. So because of that, when they call out shadow come to me, often it's the dark shadow that comes first or the dark shadow that will come up more predominantly. In Tony's case, the first time he calls it, the dark shadow comes. The second time he calls it, what an image of the golden shadow, the Oscar, which for living in a culture that kind of, you know, has such things, has such great things to say about, you know, Hollywood and movies and celebrity, this kind of image that he's being given an Oscar, you know, he's being given this kind of. for his performance as the dreamer, perhaps, and this big gold statue. And again, he knows what to do. He goes and he embraces it. Brilliant work. Sorry, back to you again, Tony. After that, I call this Sankopa again because I think just keep going. And then the third shadow came out. It looks like a really obese. kind of repulsive person. I got a picture of a type master from the Austin movie. It looks pretty much like that, yes. But I think he's very affectionate. So I think he'd come towards me in kind of an affectionate way. But because that kind of image is kind of repulsive, so this part of me died. kind of want to push in the way. But I remember your information, there is no spoon. So I know because I know it's part of my shadow because I called the shadow forward as well. So I know I have to hug and embrace it. So I just repeat, there's no spoon in my head. And then I walk towards and I give him a hug. Perfect. Great. So again, using there is no spoon. Also aware there that some people ask, how will I know the shadow in a dream? Non -lucid, lucid. How do I know if it's a shadow? You will be repulsed. You will be repulsed, just like a magnet is repulsed. You won't want to go towards it. So if you meet something in the dream that is either sexually repulsive, repulsive because it's so powerful, repulsive because it's so scary, repulsive because it's so against one of your morals or something, that's the shadow. It will repel you because I'm not saying it's disgusting, but it will repel you just like a magnet. you know two different magnets repel um so really good that he noticed that tony saw that he went in gave it a hug knowing that like it's just the big uh you know he talked about him being fat and unhygienic and stuff like that well yeah what part of ourselves do we deny disown and reject i deny my you know uh unhygienic parts i deny my body shame you know all these kind of things that might have been manifest in that for tony so really nice example there carry on i mean After that, I was still elusive. So I called Shadow come to me one last time. And then like, you know, the sentinode killer robots from X -Men movie, it appears. It's like a killer robots from the X -Men movie. And he has this sword arms. You know, his arm can turn into a sword. Yeah, I was quite scared as well. But I remember your, there's no spoon affirmation. And I know because I called the Shadow 4, I have to go and embrace it. So, yeah, so I... repeated there's no shadow then walk towards and then it walked towards me as well then when I walk towards it it thrusts his sore hand into my chest so I can feel the sore going through my body but there's no pain so I just keep walking and give him an embrace and then he actually opened his face and threw flames into my face as well but I can feel the warmth but there's no pain as well and I just keep embracing it and eventually he fell asleep and he lied down and now when he fell asleep yeah and then um after he fell asleep um i kiss his forehead and then that's when the dream is oh dude wow okay so there's so much going there i love the way tony shadow kind of maxed him out it was like okay let's start with a little dog now let's give him some gold now let's look at kind of you know body image stuff hygiene stuff okay he dealt with that well okay let's bring in the let's bring in the real stuff because the shadow is made of violence. Well, it depends what you suppress, deny, disown. But for many people, because we suppress, deny, disown elements of our violence, elements of our prejudice, elements of our fear, elements of our aggression, the shadow is made of that stuff. So don't expect the shadow to be friendly. Like it's the opposite of that, you know? So in Tony's case, like it manifests is like violence, this aggression, the kind of stabbing sword, but he still went through it. and it actually stabbed him through the chest and he kept on going using there is no spoon affirmation to get there i mean how many people would have done that i think even me when the sword came i might have patted it away or like oh god you know ran or something but he didn't he went through went with the embrace kissed the forehead i mean dude like the amount of shadow work you did in that one lucid dream could have taken years of therapy I had a Jungian therapist tell me that one shadow integration lucid dream could be the same as years of therapy. You did like four shadows in one, especially that last one, moving through the pain, moving through the ultimate fear of death. You know, is the thing going to kill me going through my chest? It was just such a good example, man. And like, yeah, just really, really great shadow work. Yeah. Just things like my dream was helping me to go to the last stage as well, because I don't think I'll be able to. to get killed straight in my first shadow. So I kind of prepare me step by step. Exactly, man. The shadow will only give you what ready for. So good. Thanks so much, Tony. Thank you. Yeah, thanks, Charlie. Great. Awesome. Thank you, Tony. All right. Next up is Stella. Welcome to the call, Stella. Stella. Can we get Stella's dream up, Ezra, just so I can remind myself what it was? Yes. Let me find it. Where are you, Stella? You can go ahead, Stella. Let me find it. Disappeared. Basically, my dream was to, it was a healing dream, and my Sankalpa was to heal. heal my body um the the dream just to put a bit of background was to it is i'm a rtt therapist and we have a therapy where we have a healing vortex which is energy that comes through the top of your head and goes all the way through your body like a cyclone so i called out um once i realized i did the wake to bed technique yeah And then I woke up a couple of times afterwards, so it wasn't straight away. But about the third time I woke up after that, I suddenly realized I was lucid. Did the reality check, which I've done a few times, but each time I'd woken up. But this time, I suddenly realized I was lucid. So I shouted out Sankalpa. And I think I just said, healing energy, come to me now, because I couldn't remember exactly. Perfect. If you forget your Sankalpa in the lucid dream, just go for what you can remember. You know, it doesn't have to be word for word. The great thing, because you had already done your dream plan, Stella, your dreamer knew exactly what you wanted. So even when you get into lucid dream, if you forget your Sankalpa, the dreamer's like, well, I remember it because you told me what it was. last week when you made the dream plan or whatever so again that was a that's a really good reason why we do the dream plan so if we do forget in the lucid dream it can still work so sorry carry on yeah so i literally just felt it was just the most incredible feeling i just felt because um the healing vortex has a tip and then it's it's um cone shaped so i literally felt the tip come in through my body and my whole body just vibrated it I mean, it's really hard to explain. And I felt it go right through my body and out through my feet. And as I say, it's just like nothing I've ever experienced. And then afterwards, I sort of remembered the rest or tell me what I need to learn from this issue that I've been suffering from. I'm not sure afterwards whether it was my conscious mind or not to be interested in what you think, but I just got this vision of calm and this cool, this sort of icy blue water and a pebble dropping into it and the ripples. But I'd been working on the issue consciously and I had decided that it was that I needed to find calm within myself. So I don't know whether I created that consciously or whether it was still lucidity. Yeah. But then I woke up and I woke up, but I felt when I woke up, I felt I know all I need to know. Brilliant. Brilliant. An amazing experience. And there's something else you wrote in the, when you actually wrote the lucid dream seller, I remember where you said, now that I felt the healing vortex enter my body, I can be a better teacher of that because you know that experience, right? Exactly. Because, you know, it's something you just imagine, but now. when I'm healing others, I have such a vivid visceral feeling of it in my body. I know that I can do it for others in a much more effective way. precisely okay so that's where when we look at dream yoga at the fourth stage of unification where we transform ourselves like deity self -manifestation you transform yourself into the buddha or the power animal whatever it is one of the reasons we do that is so that when you next do the practice in the waking state where you imagine yourself turning to buddha you kind of know what it looks like You've had the experience in the lucid dream in a very visceral way. So when you next go to do the practice in the waking state, it transforms your waking state experience of that too. And it really struck me. That's what you'd had with the vortex. And that's the point. The lucid dream is like a laboratory of enlightened wisdom. I mean, something I haven't mentioned before is like stage three of dream yoga, the multiplication stuff, like walking through walls. The end aim of that is to be able to do it in the waking state. now i know this is like super super far out harry potter stuff but if you look at the kind of stuff that these miraculous saints can do let's use jesus for an example jesus could take a loaf of bread in his hand and turn it into a thousand loaves of bread sounds like multiplication stage to me jesus could walk on water jesus could touch people in the dream and they would be healed it's like These great saints are using the lucid dream to practice for what eventually they'll be able to manifest in the waking state. So you had a great example of that. And no wonder it's affected your vortex healing in the waking state too. Yeah, that's amazing. Thank you so much for this experience. It's been brilliant. Oh, thank you. Brilliant. Thanks for all your hard work. Great. Thank you, Stella. Also, I forgot to mention, I'm supposed to be doing the dream yoga stuff. I'm so excited by these. I'm forgetting what the stage is. Of course, Tony's was a great example of stage two transformation. You know, he was transforming fear. All the shadow work stuff fits within stage two. All the stuff kind of walking through walls, multiplication, flying, all that stuff is stage three. And then anytime you're doing kind of spiritual practice or like the energy work, that will kind of fit into stage four. It's not that stage four is better. These aren't linear. these are just kind of delineations here yeah and so the last one is alexandra okay alexandra welcome to the call hello come for choosing me hello charlie hello yes brilliant dream um so i like this for many reasons but in particular the crazy sleepless night night 29 so um we don't want anyone to have crazy sleepless nights but it's worth noting that sometimes we do kind of accidental wake back to beds and stuff like that because sometimes we might do a wake up and then we're not able to get back to sleep with oh i've laid here for an hour what a waste it's not a waste because by lying there for an hour you might have accidentally done a wake back to bed and they can drop in and get lucid and stuff like that so the technique someone's kind of meld into each other here um so um i i like the drop in um the fact that you're able to kind of harness this crazy sleepless night but over to you Alexandra tell us give us your kind of your way in your moment of lucidity and then what you did once you were lucid Yeah, it's interesting that you mentioned the wake to bed technique, because for me, actually, at the moment, I have so many things going on that I put the exercises a little bit on hold. And the only intention I had when I go to bed was like, okay, doing the dream recall, because I was failing at that for the whole week. And I just did your meditation, your hypnagogic meditation, and just wanted to remember my dreams. So that was my intention. And what I experienced also within the last week when I go in this meditation, going to this hypnagogic state or whatever, I get so creative. It's like it's connecting me to my creativity. And so it's exactly the opposite what happens. And I constantly like switched on the light because I have so many ideas about my project. And thinking, oh, my God, really? I need to sleep. I need to go to work. And switching off the light and an hour again. So this was the whole four hours when I was awake. I remember putting some music calming me down. And I really just want to sleep. And even on the 10th time, I switched on my light and the light bulb burst. and i was bursting out to laugh and i said okay i i know i need to sleep i know but what can i do you know so that was my i don't know my trying to get asleep so and then at one point like four hours later at six in the morning or something i just um obviously i felt i felt asleep and i fall asleep i didn't even know and i was in a room and having something like a coach telling me I need to practice flying now so he gave me some some ideas do some movements on a trampoline and jumping a little bit trying to get get a little bit higher and I was not aware of being lucid at that time and I did all that stuff then I was getting off the ground doing movements like swimming so I did this as a child I remember that and then I started to fly around And the feeling at this moment, I did no hand check or anything, reality checks, I'm really bad at that so far. So I was flying around and the feeling was more like I was relieved that I can do it again, but not like excited, I'm lucid, I'm lucid or something. It was being relieved, a little bit proud and then... at one stage i thought ah this might might be lucidity and i drifted away and then my coach remembered me okay start from the beginning just go down to the ground jump again and i did the same again and then it was the moment okay that's so great i can do it so let's try more and that's when i decided that was the moment so i decided okay i was flying to a window because there were some people passing outside and i just want to see if i can fly there if they can see me so interact with me so i was waking a woman like goodbye and i i thought oh let's give her a kiss for saying goodbye and move towards the window and she comes to me and when we want to kiss i could feel the the window i really could feel the window and before i was also exploring all the materials the cold stone the all the stuff and so it was all about sensation it feels You're like, how can I feel the coldness of the window and the rot? But you know it's not real. You know that you're asleep in bed. You know it's all a projection. How is it so real? Yeah, but I got really excited when I had this feeling that this flying around was, I don't know, something like, I knew somehow I did it before, so it was not that. exciting or I cannot say but this okay engaging with people and then I thought oh this is so cool what I want to do next is my boyfriend is coming from outdoor and I just want to meet him at the door and just want to hug him and kiss him so I go outside I mean I don't have a boyfriend but in this dream there was one so I was just waiting for him at the door and then we start kissing and this man I mean this just felt so real you know you could i could feel anything the the teeth the lips the tongues playing around and i i don't know i've never i've never experienced something like that the dream kiss the dream kiss yeah that's true so this was really exciting right yeah and then i was drifting away and then i was like so even if i stopped the exercises for the week but still i had all these um Yeah, what I heard so far. So, okay, you need to move. You don't, you cannot stand still and do nothing. So I was thinking, okay, then I did this, how is it called? Lucidity boost. I cried lucidity boost for three times, but then I tried to change some sizes of a sofa or of a chandelier or something. But at that point, I don't know. I could see that the sizes were changing. But then I thought, no, you're imagining that that's a visualization or something. So there was doubt. I don't know. Was it semi -lucid? Or maybe I was nearly awake then. But still. Your dream was totally lucid. But I think at that point, basically, you moved in the multiplication stage. You started making the sofa big, the sofa small, that kind of stuff. I think it's when doubt came in. You know, if we can allow doubt to creep into our mind, like, wait, am I really lucid? Am I dreaming? Oh, that just switches it all off. So it seems like when doubt came in and then suddenly, am I visualizing my dreaming? Boom. And then we're awake. It's a bit like when we do astral projection practice. If you think about your physical body, boom, you're back in it straight away. With lucid dreaming, if you start to doubt. Whether you're, if you kind of doubt the power of your lucidity, it's like, it switches it off. It's a very interesting kind of confidence practice when you're in there. But it was great. So many examples there, really cool. Lovely. It was on day 29, you know, you held out for it. And interesting too, you would stop doing some of the practices. That's interesting too. You're kind of relaxed because sometimes we put on so much pressure, it doesn't happen. And we pull out and go, okay, I'm not going to do all these practices. Then it can, you know, it can help to manifest. I have one question, though. Is it like when you go to the hypnagogic state or in this alpha state or something, is it quite normal that like you get then all your creativity? I mean, I could get creative the whole day, but like I'm sitting in front of my computer and thinking and thinking about ideas. And in the night when I want to sleep, boom. It just flows. Yes. In fact, there's even in my first book, Dreams of Awakening, there's a practice in there called hypnagogic creativity, where you go into hypnagogic and start working with ideas, which you've done spontaneously, so you don't need the exercise. But yes, it is an actual practice. It is an exercise. And you found it. Yeah. Basically, you have a nap during the day with a pen and paper. Yeah, that's what I want to say. I can do it during the day, the meditation, instead of not sleeping. Yeah, Dali used to do it a lot. Edison did it. He said he invented the light bulb in there. There's a whole section in that book on that. Yeah. Okay. Thank you. Great. Thank you. Thank you, Alexandra. Thank you, Ezra. All right. So it looks like we don't have time for Q &A today. Charlie wants to share a little bit about his book and the next steps after this quest. So we'll give him some space for that. And we'd also like to talk about how you can share your stories as we prepare for our celebration call next week. Okay. I was just checking the top question. Did Charlie have any experience with psychedelics? You're getting me off the hook there, Ezra. Thank you very much. I will actually mention that if we have a couple of minutes. Yeah, people have been asking about books. You know, the quest has come to an end for most of the people on the call today. Where now? What are the books? All this kind of stuff. Dreams of Awakening. This is the first book I wrote. I wrote this in my 20s. This book has really got my soul in it. This is the most thorough lucid dreaming book I've got. This is lucid dreaming. with all the spiritual stuff all the esoteric stuff it's got a chapter on out of body experiences got a chapter on quantum dreaming how we can affect quantum entanglement through lucid dreaming this is thorough uh one thing is when you write a book in your 20s your imposter syndrome is so strong that you write very thoroughly because i was so worried that the older people are going to tell me i've got this wrong or that wrong this is very very well researched and very kind of really thorough really kind of uh complete books that was my first one um because that one went well i then did a follow -up of this one um lucid dreaming made easy This one's kind of like, you know, the dummy's guide, a dummy's guide to mindfulness, a dummy's guide to meditation. This is like a dummy's guide to lucid dreaming. So it's got all the techniques you need, all the techniques you've done on the quest. But rather than my lucid dreams, rather than the Buddhist stuff and the spiritual stuff, this has got case studies. So it's kind of real people I know who've changed their lives through lucid dreaming. So it's great. It just hasn't got the kind of Buddhist and spiritually stuff. So because you've done this quest, if you were looking to extend your lucid dreaming practice, Probably that one is better because this one you will have covered all this stuff in it already. And the third book I've got, okay, this is my, this is Dreaming Through Darkness. This is not about lucid dreaming. This is about shadow integration. So remember that day, whatever it was, day 20 something last week, the cave you fear to enter. Actually, week four is basically in this dream. It's got a big chapter on death. It's got massive, a whole two chapters on... golden shadow work it's got a chapter on the sexual shadow integrating our sexual shame it's got a shadow on the familial chapter on the familial shadow working with our ancestral shadows um i got my royalty statement recently and i can tell you this is my book that sells the least copies sells quite well but it does not sell as many copies and yet it is my most popular book as in the people who read it are like dude that book to change my life but not a lot of people read it why because it's about shadow work and shadow work is scary for most people however if you were like on a desert island and because you've already done this quest you know how to lucid dream i'd say dreaming through darkness i mean this will deal with your deal with your stuff with your parents deal with yourself with your ancestors deal with your stuff with your sexuality deal with yourself with your death like this one yeah this book was very difficult for me to write because it was like Yeah. You read that, you're going to know me very well. You can know all of my secrets. So there's some stuff on the books. Just to hit on that question, because I know we've got to finish in a couple of minutes now. What was it? What are my views on psychedelics or something like that? Any experience of psychedelics? Yes, lots. Remember when I was 17, I did so many psychedelics, I had a massive overdose and a near -death experience. So I've seen the worst of psychedelics, and I've also seen the best of psychedelics. Just recently, this last year, because about a year ago, I had these things where my mum had a terminal illness. My marriage broke down. I was heartbroken. It was really kind of the worst year, like about a year and a half ago now when all this was happening. And then I did do psilocybin therapy. which is a full six -hour protocol with a guided psychotherapist. And you take a dose of psilocybin and you're guided. So you're not in a nightclub. You're lying down in the therapy room. And it was very, very powerful. So as far as psychedelics for psychotherapy, wow. I think they're very, very powerful implications for that. Not for everybody. not for people who are working with psychosis, not for people who have derealisation, not for people who are feeling currently, you know, very mentally unstable. But for some people, I think psychedelic therapy is a very, very powerful field. and there's work with i know the uk is doing a lot of these studies on ketamine therapy um mdma therapy for veterans and psychedelic therapy specifically psilocybin which is magic mushrooms basically psilocybin or the active ingredient for uh for depression and i know when i was really in the depths of my despair grieving my the loss of my mom and the loss of my marriage and all this kind of stuff That six hour psychotherapy session was the most powerful thing I've, one of the most powerful things I've done in my life. So that's my view. Therapeutically, they can be very powerful, used wrongly for partying and nightclubs and stuff. They can be dangerous. You're grown adults, you make up your own mind. As far as for lucid dreaming, I can't say there's any psychedelics that like give you lucid dreams, no. And in the lucid dream state, you can do stuff that is very similar to psychedelic therapy. As in, if you're doing ayahuasca, if you're doing peyote, some of the kind of, you know, more powerful psychedelics, you are going to meet elements of your shadow. You are going to meet your inner child. They're all going to come to you in the visions, in the hallucinations. In the lucid dream, you get to do that, but it's safe. In the lucid dream, there's an off switch. Boom, wake up. in the lucid dream it's like your higher self is deciding who to send in who not to send in with a heavy psychedelic experience like ayahuasca i'm not sure who's in control there um so i would say lucid dreaming is by far the safest psychedelic experience you can ever have but therapeutically i think there's a lot to be said for the burgeoning new field of psychedelic therapy okay that's me Awesome, Charlie. So as we prepare for next week for the celebration call, we would love for you guys to share your stories, your testimonials of this quest. And this goes beyond just you being able to lucid dream, but how did this quest change your life? How did you gain new insight or integrate your shadow or heal trauma? We definitely want to know because these stories, they actually help. more students get into this amazing quest and take it. And so your story will actually help change people's lives because they will see your story. They will resonate with it and they will decide they will want to take this quest as well and experience, hopefully experience what you did as well. So we are going to prepare for the celebration call next week. And so we would love to ask you, I'm going to. put a little link in the bottom here. This is for a link to the stories platform on Mindvalley, where you can share your stories on lucid dreaming and tell us all about how lucid dreaming changed your life, how you transform from it. And we are going to be choosing some of our favorite ones and bringing you on the call next week to share those beyond your lucid dreams, but how much this powerful quest has impacted your life. Brilliant. And of course, people are asking, will Charlie be on the call? Yes, definitely. Celebration call. I'm there. You show me the party, you'll see me there. Awesome. So thank you so much, everyone, for joining tonight, playing full out, sharing your lucid dreams, submitting those. And we can't wait to see you next week for the celebration call. Even if you're not finishing, join us. It's going to be such a fun time next week with Charlie. It'll be a last call. And last call with Waffles. So we will see you guys then. Bye, Waffles. Thanks so much. See you. Waffles. Say hello. Say hello. Bye. See you next week, everyone. Sweet and sour dreams.

Week 5: Going Further

====================

LESSON 29 – Overcoming 5 Common Obstacles to Lucid Dreaming
--------------------
<v ->Before we get to our main lesson today,</v> we, of course, need to put your minds to rest by telling you what the target image was from last night's psychic experiment. So now that all the answers are in, I can tell you the target image was a hummingbird. This particular hummingbird, in fact. This is the exact image that I used. So obviously, if your answer was hummingbird, then well done, you absolutely smashed the ball out of the park on this psychic communication exercise. But for those of you who didn't get it, maybe you came close. Our psychic sixth sense is, for most modern humans anyway, the most underused of our senses and thus, it can be a bit rusty. So give yourself a break. Like if you got the answer as a bird, for example, but not hummingbird, that's still amazingly good. Or if you tune into the dominant color of green, then that'd be pretty good too. Or maybe it was more abstract, like maybe you thought the target image was sequined pink hot pants. Now, that could actually be a pretty close hit because look at one of the most striking parts of this image is the bright pink area of the hummingbird's throat feathers. Sometimes our mind interprets it in slightly more abstract ways. For other people, it's slightly more literal. Anyway, that was just for a bit of fun as we approach the end of our Quest together. So don't sweat it too much. We are here primarily to learn how to lucid dream, not to prove the interconnected quantum entanglement of all reality. But if you did manage to do so by getting the answer as hummingbird, then I absolutely salute you. So now onto our lesson for today. And we begin with a quote. A Buddhist master once told me, "Obstacles are not things that block the path, "obstacles are the path." And never was this truer than on the path of lucid dreaming. Today we are going to troubleshoot some of the most common gremlins that you are likely to encounter on your lucid dreaming path. And how do we deal with gremlins? In exactly the same way as we deal with our shadow. We love them and we hug them. One of the most common gremlins for lucid dreamers to encounter is that as soon as they become lucid in their dream, they wake up. That's really common and remember, we've now got our three practices to help maintain our lucidity and to stay calm without falling off the tightrope. Even with those techniques though, you can find this gremlin popping up again and again but know this, eventually it gets easier. Every time you step onto that tightrope, your balance gets better and better and better. I actually have fewer lucid dreams nowadays than I used to have 10 years ago. But 10 years ago, my lucid dreams were really short 'cause my balance wasn't that good. Nowadays, I might have fewer lucid dreams but when I'm in the lucid dream, I'm in there for a long period of time because my balances got better. You'll find the same thing happens with you, although I hope your frequency stays high too. Another gremlin that some people find is that when they wake up to do one of the lucid dreaming techniques in the middle of the night, they can't get back to sleep. We mentioned before that if you're working with anxiety and depression, this might be a gremlin you encounter but just for the record, anyone who finds they can't get back to sleep after awakening for a lucid dreaming technique, just feel free to concentrate on the daytime practices, like reality checks, Columbo method, looking for dream signs, rather than nighttime wake-up practices. "I've lost my motivation." That's a big gremlin. As soon as we finish this Quest, after you feel the support of the Tribe members reduce slightly, you might start to encounter this. You might be asking yourself, "Why am I lucid dreaming? "What am I doing this for? "Why am I waking up at four o'clock in the morning?" When that happens, remind yourself of your reason why. Go back to your dream plan and check your dream plan is still turning you on psychologically and still making you salivate. And if it isn't, write a new dream plan. Remember, your dream plan should make you so excited that you want to go to bed early because you can't wait to engage the dream plan. Some people find that they don't know what technique to choose. This is because there are so many different lucid dreaming techniques to choose from but actually, within this Quest, I have intentionally limited our techniques. You'll soon find out there are dozens more we haven't even mentioned. But the reason I've limited our techniques are because I've chosen the ones that really work well for the most amount of people. So you've got effective techniques. You just need to decide on which technique to use, and stick to that. In fact, you only need to learn one lucid dreaming technique if one lucid dreaming technique works for you. But you might need to explore half a dozen or so until you find that one that really works. And the final gremlin is pure fantasy, I promise you. "I just can't do it." The inability to have lucid dreams is as much of an illusion as the dreams themselves. Remember, you were lucid dreaming as a child. In fact, you don't need to learn how to lucid dream, you just need to remember how. Think about a language that you used to speak as a child but no longer speak. How much easier it would be to remember that language from childhood than to learn a new language from scratch. It's the same with lucid dreaming. Something in you remembers how to lucid dream. So you don't need to learn lucid dreaming, you just need to remember how. And of course, don't forget, even if you manage to get lucid every night of your life, still 80% of your lucid dream experience will be non-lucid. So for those of us who are hitting a pretty good average of maybe one lucid dream a week, then 97% of your dream experience will be non-lucid. So if we only focus on the lucid dreams, we are rejecting 97% of our experience. Don't do that. We want to open ourselves up to the entire experience of dreaming to that whole third of our life that we spend sleeping. Lucid dreaming is great. It's like a peak experience but don't focus so much on that peak experience that you lose the focus on the rest of your dream life. I think one of the major problems with lucid dreaming is the fact that it's called lucid dreaming. The aim is in the name, which leads some people to think that if they are not having lucid dreams, they're outright failures because they're not achieving this aim. Let me clarify. In the game of baseball, the aim is to score home runs. But the name of baseball isn't home run ball, it's baseball, why? Because baseball is about proceeding through the bases, not just about hitting home runs. It's the same with lucid dreaming. Just as you can be a great baseball player without having hit many home runs, you can also be a great lucid dreaming practitioner without actually having had many lucid dreams. How can that be? Well, you might be a great hypnagogic mindfulness meditator or you might have amazing ability to recall your dreams or you might be brilliant at decoding meaning from your dreams. All of these are great attributes to have on the playing field of lucidity and yet none of them are determined by having a single lucid dream. A lady on my first course once told me, "I haven't even had a lucid dream yet. "But I can say for sure that the act "of sleeping will never be the same again "and in that way, it changed my life. "I can't unknow what I've learnt "about the sleep stages, about the process of dreaming, "about the hypnagogic states. "Falling asleep will never be the same again." For me, the experience of that student was actually more important than the experience of the others who had loads of lucid dreams because it showed me that the process of learning how to bring awareness into the dream and sleep states had profoundly changed a lifetime of habitual tendency, something which is far more beneficial than having a one-off lucid dream. The most important thing to remember is this. Don't just fall asleep. Try and do something, however small, each an every night. If you're struggling with lucidity, then train in the daytime with your reality checks. If you're struggling with dream recall, then work on the Columbo method. If you're too tired to stay awake at night, then take a nap and do your hypnagogic mindfulness during the day. There are so many ways in which you can engage this practice, so don't put it off. Do something today. Make a change, however small. Make your next sleep the first sleep of the rest of your life. And now your actions for today. Firstly, practice either the falling asleep consciously technique, the Wake, Back to Bed technique, or one of the four hypnagogic affirmation techniques. Secondly, keep up the 3 Ds, the reality checks, and the Columbo mindset as per usual. And finally, share one of your personal gremlins with the Tribe. If you can be vulnerable enough to share one of your gremlins, you might allow another Tribe member to open up about something that's been on their mind too. Our lucid dreaming gremlins should be dealt with in exactly the same way as we deal with our lucid dreaming shadow, with love and hugs. Embrace your fears and you set them free. So be sure to embrace your gremlins. I look forward to seeing you tomorrow for day 30, the final day of our Quest. Until then, sweet dreams.

====================

LESSON 30 – Continuing Your Lucid Dreaming Journey
--------------------
<v ->Today, we're going to review</v> and recap the entire 30 day course. But before we do that, congratulations on completing the Quest. Whether you're already having loads of lucid dreams or whether you are still yet to have a lucid dream on day 30, the fact is, you've done what most people never do. You have allowed yourself to wake up to the potential of waking up in your dreams. You have opened yourself up to 30 years of experience that most people never experience, that in itself is worth congratulating. So from my dream and to yours, I salute you. So in week one, we covered the basics, what lucid dreaming is and how it works. We looked at all the brain studies into lucid dreaming, how it can be used to work with trauma, how athletes use it to prepare for their athletic disciplines and also the top five why's of lucid dreaming. It could be a really good idea now that you're at the end of the Quest to go back and revisit week one. Remind yourself, how is it that the brain can change in response to a lucid dream. If you're stuck for a dream plan, go back and watch the 10 top why's of lucid dreaming. Now, I only gave you 10 but I could have given you 50 and I'm sure that you could go back there and think of 40 more amazing reasons why to have a lucid dream so don't feel limited by that top 10 but allow them to re-inspire you anytime you need to write a new dream plan. Week one was also when we did the guided meditation, Meeting Your Dreamer. Now that you completed the Quest, it could be a really good idea to go back and do that meditation again because your relationship with your dreamer will have changed so drastically from day one to day 30. Week two was all about making friends with our dreams. The main thing there was dream signs, dream decoding and looking at the sleep cycles. Now if there's anything around the science of sleep that you're still unsure about, go back and re-watch that video. We also looked at dream decoding, which although we pushed quite hard and we two, we didn't actually revisit that much so if you like go back and remind yourself how you can decode meaning from your dreams, lucid or non. Now week three was when we really started cooking. This is when we looked at reality checks, the weird technique and hypnagogic affirmation. Those are like the core techniques within all the lucid dream traditions. Basically checking awareness during the day leading to boosted awareness at night and falling asleep with a strong intention to gain lucidity. If there's anything in week three that you're still unsure about, make sure you go back and watch those videos again, but week three forms the center of our entire practice. The title of week four comes from a quote by the famous mythologist Joseph Campbell, the cave you fear to enter holds the treasure that you see. And in week four, we really did start to enter that cave, as we looked at the shadow, nightmares, how we can become lucid within them, we explored the idea of the golden shadow which for many people might have been a new concept so make sure you go back and really get to grips with that and if you haven't already, make a dream plan to meet your golden shadow in your lucid dream. Week four was about building upon the firm foundation that were created in week one, two and three. It was when we really started to learn how to lucid dream and open ourselves up to the full potential of lucid dreaming and Dream Yoga, not only as a psychophysical practice, but also as a spiritual one. Week four also contained the guided meditation, Circle of Protectors. I know at the time it was presented mainly as a practice to do if you're currently working with nightmares, but it's actually a really good practice to do day or night and a really good way to rejuvenate your lucid dream practice if you feel it's getting a bit dull, so don't forget about the Circle of Protectors guided meditation. And finally, in week four we had the lucidity stabilization techniques, things you can do in the lucid dream to make the lucid dream last longer, you're going to need to keep returning to those when you start to have a lot of lucid dreams because when we first step onto that tightrope it can be a bit wobbly but remember with practice it gets easier and easier. And now week five, where we've looked at greeting gremlins, and how to move forward on the path. Remember, this lucid dreaming Quest does not end today at day 30, today is when it begins. It begins when you go back to your bed without the support of the Tribe Quest members. When you go back to your bed without the support of the daily videos, when you go back to your bed just you and your dreamer and the strong intention to change your life for your dreams. Just because the Quest has come to an end, it doesn't mean you have to end your dream circles with the Tribe, keep it up. Keep sharing your dreams, keep sharing your experiences and share them with me too. If you want even send me a 4 am email when you have your first lucid dream. Now I want to explore how to continue your journey by breaking this down into daily tasks, weekly tasks, monthly tasks and lifetime tasks. Let's begin with our daily tasks. Dream diaries need to become your new normal, something you do every single morning. It needs to become as habitual as brushing your teeth. You wake up, you reach for the dream diary, whether it's in your phone or in a notepad but whatever it is, you write something down every single morning. And remember, even if you can't remember your dreams, write that too. It's still totally fine to write, "I know I was dreaming but I can't remember what about". It's authentic, it's mindful, and it keeps up that daily connection with your inner dreamer. Reality checks and the weird technique. I've said it before and I'll say it again, if your friends or loved ones have not been asking what's wrong with your hands, you have not been doing it enough. Now the hand checks that we looked at were things like this. But if you want to change that, feel free to do so, adding a finger pull, adding a gravity check, see if you can fly. You can even pinch your nose to see if you can breathe through it. You'll find loads of different variations of reality checks online, we only looked at a few. It doesn't matter which one you use, it just matters that you use it and it works for you. The handshake however, does become like the secret handshake of the lucid dreamer. I have a fantasy that when lucid dreaming has become so mainstream everyone practices it, there'll be some times perhaps around Halloween, where you'll be on a bus and someone will get on dressed as a monster and the whole bus will go, reality check. Whether that happens or not, I want that to happen to you every time you see something weird. Don't let life pass you by, when something dreamlike happens, come into the present moment and ask yourself, "Am I awake or am I dreaming?" As your weekly schedule, add say maybe three times a week, you could be formally practicing either the hypnagogic affirmation one of the three variations, Falling Asleep Consciously or Wake, Back to Bed. Remember, with Wake, Back to Bed, don't practice it more than two or three times a week. Wake, Back to Bed is based upon creating a change in the normal flow of your sleep cycle so if you were to do it every night, the flow would just adjust and the technique would stop working. Of course, if you want to formally practice lucid dreaming more than three times a week, great. I'm just saying minimum to have a solid practice three nights a week, you need to be doing a formal lucid dreaming technique. As far as your dream plans go, you're not only going to have one lucid dream in your life, you're going to have loads of lucid dreams, you've probably already started having loads of lucid dreams so you already have had multiple dream plans. Whenever you've completed your dream plan, or perhaps you just feel it's not turning you on psychologically anymore, be sure to create a new dream plan. But anytime you have a lucid dream, you need to know this is the dream plan I'm focusing on, what you don't want to happen is that you get into the lucid dream and you're thinking, what's my dream plan? Which one should I do? You'll probably wake up before you've decided so make sure you know what your dream plan is and when you're going to practice it. The multiple wake ups technique is a totally optional practice but if you are into it then maybe once a week, you could schedule in a lucid dreaming date night, making sure you don't have to wake up too early the next day, you could go to bed early, you could set three or four alarms during the night and really go for it so that once a week you're sure you're getting into that lucid dream state to have a fully lucid dream. As far as the dream decoding goes, I know it's not a formal lucid dreaming practice but it's a pretty good idea to try and decode at least one dream a week just to keep the sword sharp and to keep your awareness and connection with the dreamer type. Remember, every time you decode a dream, it may not lead to more lucid dreams but it does lead to more friendship with a dreamer and that will lead to more lucidity. As for your monthly tasks, what I suggest is that once a month you check in with the other Tribe members from the lucid dreaming Quest for a monthly dream circle. This can be done informally or formally. You could choose a few other members and decide to meet on Zoom on a certain evening or a certain day and discuss how is my last month been in relation to dreaming and lucid dreaming. This is a great way to reconnect and to keep the practice fresh. And then personally at the end of every month, I like to flick through my dream diary and just see how this last month been, how many lucid dreams have I managed to have? Have I seen any increases in dream signs or decreases in dream signs? And crucially, how connected have been to my dream practice this month? Sometimes I look at my month and go, that was great, I had loads of lucid dreams, I feel really connected to my dreamer. Other times I look at it and go, God, how could this month happen? I've hardly written down any dreams, I've had no lucidity, what am I doing? When that happens, be kind to yourself, know that life happens regardless of your dream yoga practice. So if you have a bad month, come back to the practice and know that the next month is the first month of the rest of your life. And lifetime tasks, the lifetime task of the lucid dreamer is to continue to connect to the third of your life that you spend sleeping, and to embrace that 30 years with lucidity and enthusiasm. Like all lifetime relationships, it'll move, it'll flash, it'll fade but you can always come back to the fact that you're dreaming every single night and that your dream is always with you from the day that you're born to the day that you die, connection to the dreamer is your birthright. In the first week of the Quest, we did a guided meditation practice called Meeting the Dreamer. Now that we're at the end of our Quest, we're going to do a similar guided meditation but this one's called Thanking the Dreamer. Over the past 30 days, our dream has shown us patience, friendship and lucidity. So this guided meditation is about saying thank you to the dreamer, and continuing our path in gratitude and mutual respect. There's a Buddhist meditation practice called Dedication. Within the Buddhist tradition, it's believed that whenever we do something for the benefit of others, like learning the lucid dream, we create beneficial energy. And any time we create beneficial energy, it's a really good idea to dedicate it which is like sealing the pot, it's sealing in all the power of the energy, allowing us to dedicate the energy to our own spiritual growth and for the spiritual growth of others. Whether you're Buddhist or not, it's a really good idea to dedicate energy so I'd like to guide us in a final dedication now. Just sitting, eyes open or closed, either is fine. Breathing through the nose or the mouth, either is fine. Feeling support of the ground beneath you and noticing your breath flowing in and out of your body. And now I want you to bring your attention to your feet and your legs. Take a moment to really feel into your feet and your legs. Take a moment to say thank you to your feet and your legs. And now shifting our focus to our hands and our arms. We take a moment to say thank you to our hands and our arms. Allowing our awareness to spread through the core of our body, our digestive system, our respiratory system, our ever beating heart. Take a moment to say thank you to the core of your body. And allowing our awareness to flow upwards so that we're now aware from the tips of our toes to the crown of our head. Take a moment to consider your body and take a moment to say thank you. Over the past 30 days, our body has stayed alive. Over the past 30 days, we didn't die. Your body is amazing. We say thank you to our body for staying alive while we engage this Quest. From our bodies to our minds, take a moment to consider your mind. Over the past 30 days of this Quest, We didn't lose it, it's still here. We say key to our mind. From our bodies to our minds, to the dreamer that resides within. Over the past 30 days, our dreamer has engaged deeply with these practices so we take a moment to say thank you to our dreamer now. Thank you to our body, thank you to our mind, thank you to our dreamer for engaging this Quest. in gratitude we ask that our dreamer stays open and aware, ready to guide us deeper into the depths of lucid dreaming. We say thank you for the nightmares that offer such guidance. Thank you for the dreams of insight. Thank you for the lucid dreams that we've had, and for the lucid dreams that we are yet to have. Thank you to our dreamer. Showing gratitude to our body, gratitude to our mind, and gratitude to our dreamer. Finally, we show gratitude to the great dream. The shared dream of waking life, to the other dream characters To the other aspects of this dream that we share this life with. We show gratitude. We show thanks. May we all wake up from the dream together and learn to be more awake, more aware and more kind. To live lucidly, to die lucidly, to dream lucidly. I want you to take a moment to think about the last 30 days that we've spent together, the things that we've learned, the subjects we've explored, the meditation that we've shared. Without doubt you have generated beneficial energy so we take a moment now to dedicate that beneficial energy, not only to ourselves but to all beings, may we all wake up from the dream together, using lucid dreaming to be more awake, more aware, and more kind for the benefit of all living beings. So now there's only one thing left for me to say, good night. I wish you lucid dreams and a lucid life.

LESSON 30 – Experience Lucid Dreaming Bonus Live Call #5: Celebration Call

hello hello hello welcome to the call welcome to the celebration call of experience lucid dreaming take you off into the elusive the lucid abyss Welcome everyone to the call. I guess I thought I was alive, but I'll break you all. This is the mantra that we spoke about in week four. If you just started lucid dreaming, do not worry. We've got a treat in store for you. But we're going to be celebrating with all of our students tonight. Welcome to the call, Charlie. Hey, man, it's great to be here. And yeah, so this was a last minute thing. Ezra had a decision today, had an idea today to open the call with one of my old hip hop tracks from a group I was in called Zen Mystery. We did like kind of like Buddhist hip hop and mixed mantras in and stuff. Wasn't very successful, obviously. I think we were before our time, but I like it. And I listened to it today for the first time in years. And I was like, I still agree with all of those lyrics. Everything I was saying at the age of 19, 20, I still agree with now. Except there's a bit in that verse called, the song's called Confessions. And there's a bit where I say, I apologize to my mother for never telling her I love her. I apologize to my brother for the way I made him suffer. I never told my father that it's him I idolized. I never told my nan that I loved her before she died. And all of those I now do. i tell my mom that i love her i've had that discussion with my dad about what he means to me i've apologized my brother for the way i was growing up so i agree with all the lyrics and yet i was glad that i'm in a state now where i don't have to sing those anymore so that was really lovely to play and also we found out when we were looking at the hip -hop stuff that ezra used to be a break dancer too and um so we had a lovely chat about that so maybe we can get ezra doing some break dance at the end who knows um so this is the celebration cool um essentially yes to celebrate you guys completed the quest Remember, you do have access to the quest forever. So even though this particular 30 days is over, you will still have lifetime access. So go back to certain days, all this kind of stuff. In fact, what I'm going to do in a minute is run through the whole quest and just pick out certain days that I advise people to go back to and just check again, like really kind of vital days in the quest. But yeah, before we begin, well done. Like I said before, I've said a couple of times, just the fact that you've done this quest, been on this quest and now completed this. quest puts you in the like top 0 .1 percentile of the world's population you know maybe people kind of know what lucid dreaming is now as far as how many people actually practice lucid dreaming in the world population easily less than one percent easily less than one percent how many people have actually practiced lucid dreaming and had success like started having lucid dreams way less than that So, you know, I say this not to impress upon your egos, but to impress upon you what an achievement this is, that you have engaged this practice and that so many of you had lucid dreams. So I really mean it with this congratulations. You know, I bow to you. And for those of you who haven't completed, I know some people are saying, oh, we haven't completed the quest yet. Then great. Welcome anyway. Everyone is welcome to this call. And our aim is to celebrate. So, oh, let's do what we do every week. If you have had a lucid dream in the last week, I want you to write lucid in the chat now. Let's see. Lucid dream in the last week. Lucid, lucid, lucid, lucid, lucid. Here they come. Lucid, lucid, lucid. Lucid, lucid, lucid. Okay, so again, actually the speed of the lucids coming through is pretty much how it's been every week. So even though, you know, the quest is over now, people are still getting lucid, which I thought would happen. Remember I said that very often it's the kind of day after the quest is finished or like two or three days after the quest and then you get lucid because of course, that kind of performance anxiety might be gone um that sense of pressure might be gone and then you kind of released into it and people saying here you know still not lucid nothing here yet again don't worry about that it's a 30 -day course like you know you've got the tools but sometimes they can take a while And something I said on one of the earlier calls, sometimes it's the people who've taken longest to get lucid who end up with the greatest, with the more stability in their practice. Because if you get lucid really quick and you kind of haven't had to work for it so much, it's brilliant that you got lucid. But sometimes the longevity of the practice isn't quite as strong. Whereas people who've taken like weeks or months to get lucid, maybe they get lucid in like two months or three months, often. Their practice of lucid dreaming is slightly more stable because they spent such a long time kind of creating that that kind of firm foundation. So whatever way it is, it's good. And also remember, you only really need one lucid dream to change your life. I think I shared this in one of the earlier calls. Or no, I share it in the quest. The woman who had that amazing lucid dream where she called out to meet her seven year old self and the dream blocked it and presented her with a door. that said caution on it and she went through and there's symbolic representations of her trauma um what i don't think i mentioned she only had that one lucid dream i mean she might have had more now but at the time i spoke to her i was like how's your practice and she went oh i don't i i just had that one and i was like whoa your your first and only lucid dream you integrated childhood trauma you know didn't you want to carry on your practice and she was like no You know, I got into lucid dreaming because I wanted to integrate childhood trauma. I did it through the lucid dream. So I stopped doing the practice. So, you know, there's that view, too. If you've just got a dream plan you particularly want to do, maybe you just need one lucid dream to change your life. So all is welcome. What I want to do is just go through and get the week up on my screen and just go through things which might be worth rechecking. So in week one, OK, day four. The why of lucid dreaming. It's a really good one to go back to. If it's four o 'clock in the morning, you haven't got your, maybe you've left your dream tribe circles, whatever, your tribe dream circles, and you're thinking, why am I doing this practice? You know, it's four o 'clock in the morning. Why am I just asleep? Go back to day four. Check the why of lucid dreaming. You know, those top 10 dream plans, I think I do. So remind yourself of that. Also, day five, creating a dream plan. That's a day you're going to need to go back to again and again because you're not only going to have one lucid dream in your life, you're going to have dozens of lucid dreams in your life probably. So you are going to need to make dozens of dream plans. So keep going back to that day five, how to create a dream plan. And I would say go through that process every time. Don't just kind of think, oh yeah, my next lucid dream, I would like to do this. Take the time to get a piece of paper. Take the time to kind of draw out your dream plan. Really go for it because we're hardwired for ritual as human beings. So if you go through the ritual process of creating your dream plan, that's really beneficial. It will really help. Okay, and then in week two, I would say... Oh, dream decoding is a good one. A lot of people have had a lot of success with that. Day 13. Now, originally, I didn't include dream decoding in the quest because I told Mindvalley it's not a lucid dreaming technique. But when I kind of broke down the technique, how it was, how it worked, the Mindvalley team were like, no, they're going to love that, man. It's going to be so cool if you can help people find meaning in their dream. And I'm so glad I included, that we included day 13 dream decoding because that's a really... um it's a strong practice and it's very simplified steps so you know feel free to go back to there to uh start working with decoding your dreams oh week three there's so much here in week three i mean week three was really the kind of core of the practice that's really the kind of meat of the sandwich is found in week three so i'd go back and look at look at everything in week three really um Week four, you know, there's certain big things there, like the preparation for death day. There is no spoon day. Those are really big concepts. So it might, you know, those could really do with an extra watch, you know, an extra view of those days to go back and just remind yourself of those, especially the shadow work stuff. I'll talk about that later about moving forward. If you are interested in the shadow work stuff, then I've got a shadow retreat, a live Zoom retreat coming up in May. Oh, on day 29, greeting gremlins, you know, reminding yourself if you encounter these obstacles on the path, as one Buddhist teacher said to me, obstacles aren't things on the path, obstacles are the path. You know, they are the path. This is it. We're parkouring through life. We're free running through life. Without obstacles, there's nothing there. It's just it's just a space. So we need these obstacles. We can embrace these obstacles. Yeah, I don't think I've got anything more to say now. um i know some people have been saying some guy in the chat but um i don't want to press complete on day 30 because then the quest's over the quest isn't over guys you can keep you know your dream circles keep those open keep the telegram dream circle open do the quest again you know give yourself a few weeks off and then restart it day one you know you can do that go go through again like do the quest again um Do the practice again. Keep in touch. Keep in contact. Let me know how you're doing. Join my monthly free dream circles. You know, the Lucid Dream Drop -In. They'll be running every month now forever. So come and join that. Share your dreams. Share your experiences with others. Share it with your partner, your loved ones, your kids. You know, teach what you know. So if there's a practice that you know has worked for you, feel free to share that with others. Yeah. OK, let's hand it over to you humans because we're here to celebrate. So let's get some of you humans on to celebrate your lucidity or not even your lucidity, just to celebrate what you gain from the quest. Like, let's have someone on who's like, I haven't had a lucid dream in this quest, but wow, my experience of waking reality has changed or I haven't had a lucid dream on this quest yet, but sleep will never be the same as well as lucid dreams. So don't feel that you're you're limited as to whether you've had a lucid dream. Yeah, I think that's fantastic, Charlie. If you haven't had a lucid dream in the chat, but this quest has changed your life, let us know. We'll bring you on too. Right now we've got Stella. Welcome to the call, Stella. Oh, you're muted. Hi, thanks. Thanks for bringing me on. So let us know how this quest transformed your life. Well, it's funny because I have only had the one lucid dream, but it was so incredible that I think I put on the story that I genuinely feel it's changed the way I think about so many things forever and actually changing the way I'm thinking about my career as well. Because I'm an RTT therapist, which involves working on the subconscious, but I just think this lucid dreaming and... possibilities it opens up it's just incredible so um just really really pleased that we've had this opportunity so thank you charlie very much thank you you know this is the the great thing when i hear people um talk about the success on the course is i can take literally no credit because i'm never in your mind with you you know it's like you learn the techniques and then you go into your mind You do the practice. You do the sankalpa. So I'm completely clean of it, which is great. I'm clean of any projections that can give it all back to you. So well done, Stella. This is about changing your life from the inside out. And it sounds like you're doing that. So that's so, so cool to hear. Thank you so much. The one thing I have noticed, although I haven't been lucid, I've been doing my dream. plans and it's almost as though my dream plans are being answered in my dreams that I'm recalling rather than actually becoming lucid which is interesting they're quite difficult to decipher but when I get there and I look at them I think oh my god that was what I wanted to become lucid about so completely yeah and remember that is one of the dream plan can manifest in one of three ways lucid dream non -lucid dream as you've described and then the weirdest one is waking life where you'll make a dream plan and then your waking life changes even before you've had the lucid dream. And you think, how does that work? Well, the power of manifestation, the power of visualization, the power of intent, that's how it works. Great work, Stella. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you so much, Stella. All right. Next up to the call is Chamali. Chamali is one of our lucid dreaming ambassadors. Hi, everyone. I was very lucky because I got lucid for the first time. I was one of the beta testers. I got lucid into the maybe the fourth week. And it was one of those dreams that was just wow. And then I'd like to tell you a bit about getting lucid on Saturday morning. I've already shared it with the Telegram group. It started off kind of like unintentionally doing the wake up. like go back to bed technique and um initially the dream started like i was kind of like um you know recording this like dance track and it was like this kind of really heavy beat and then it morphed into sweet dreams and made by i've made like this about like i was like looking back and i was like that's like absolutely crazy and then it became this like sea in the daytime and I was on this like galley and it was like painted white and purple and it started sinking and I can't swim and I just thought oh god and I was so scared and like it was a proper nightmare I thought no Charlie said like feel into it go with it so I kind of like hugged onto the galley and we sank together and that fear just transmuted into something absolutely beautiful so it just goes to show you know I haven't touched the quest content for maybe maybe a month but just from what you remember and hearing people talk you know it's the little things that stay with you so i definitely wholeheartedly recommend anyone redoing the quest again we'll be here to support you guys like um you'll find me around in the telegram group and on um connections and um the community platform so so yeah so um give it a go. It's like, like exactly what Charlie said, it's yours for life. You can just redo bits that you wanted to freshen up when you don't have to do the whole thing. And we're here to support you. Brilliant. Thank you so much. That's great. And well done for sinking with the ship, you know, which is the opposite. We think like don't sink, but actually if we can move beyond the duality of right and wrong, we go, yes, sink with the ship, you know, go into that worst fear that the ego doesn't want to do. Because if we move to the places where the ego doesn't want to be, we transcend the ego and that's. kind of the point of the spiritual path. Yeah. Brilliant work. Thank you. It's been the most fun quest ever. You absolutely rock. And it's just been absolutely amazing. So thank you. Thank you so much. Thank you so much, Chamalee. Appreciate it. Sandy. So Sandy hasn't lucid dreamed yet, but she's had quite a bit of changes in her waking life and her connection. Sandy, are you there? Yes, I am. Hi. Hey. Hi, Charlie, this has been so wonderful. Both my wife and I, Shirley and I have been doing this together. And I knew I dreamt before, but I didn't remember them often. It would have to be something really big. And now I dream. And now that we've been about a week or two without doing it every night and stuff, listening to you and stuff. I'm still dreaming. And when I go, when I get up and write my dream diary, sometimes I don't remember details, but I write what I remember. And sometimes I have had some fabulous ones. I'm out in nature. My mom has been there. Sometimes I can see my dream signs, sometimes not, but I feel them. like in uh how you some of the stuff that you've done it's like you've given us this big huge plate that it's not like oh we have to be right here because so many times we think we have to be so narrow instead of open and now i'm starting to talk to my dreamer most nights and saying okay i'm ready you let me know what i'm supposed to do tonight and i feel more connected to nature and to spirit because of what we're doing And so grateful. So thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Brilliant. Thank you. And thank you for highlighting that. You know, I used to call what I do. I've kind of changed the terminology now, but I used to call what I do mindfulness of dream and sleep. That's now actually the term I'm using for the work with stress and trauma affected sleep. But I used to use that term to describe the lucid dreaming work because I had such a problem with people thinking that if they didn't have a lucid dream, they weren't. They weren't good practitioners. And in fact, just like the baseball analogy, right? It's like you can be a great baseball player without hitting a home run. You might be a great pitcher. You might be a great fielder. You know, it's not all about that home run of the lucid dream. And exactly the same with this work. You know, it might be that the real transformation comes through dream decoding or hanging out in the hypnopompic state, or like you said, connecting with the dreamer and seeing how it changes your connection to nature and the world around you. Like these are profound shifts that don't require lucidity. So I'm really glad that that came across in the quest and that you connected to that. Yeah. Brilliant. Thank you so much. Thank you, Shirley. Thank you, Sandy. Thanks, Sandy. Thank you. And next up is Joshua. Welcome to the call. Oh my gosh, it's me. Hello. Hi. Sorry, I wasn't expecting to be called up here. Hi. Hi. So I just wanted to take this moment to say thank you so much because before this quest, I was actually looking to really improve my spirituality because I've been, you know, sort of... what other things I could do to sort of find happiness or sort of connection again and one of the key takeaways I got from this quest is really when when you said that kindness was a spiritual act of spirituality and with the day the daytime experiences with columbus method and and uh weird techniques i just i just enjoy life so much more now i haven't had the lucid dream yet but i've been living so much more happy thanks to you um so thank you so much oh thank you man that's you know that's lucid living and the the aim of lucid dreaming is actually the end goal of lucid dreaming is lucid living because we're asleep for a third of our lives but we're awake for two -thirds of it So if that process of lucid dream practice in the one third of our life that we're asleep doesn't profoundly configure the two thirds of our life that we're awake, maybe it's not such a big deal. But this is the point that we do these practices that, yeah, can manifest in the nighttime, but really the shift comes in the daytime. You know, is this making me a kind of person? Am I more aware of my projections? Am I looking more deeply? Am I engaging life with more childlike enthusiasm? That's the point here. And that sounds like what you're talking about, which is so, so cool. I'm so glad you've had that. Exactly. Thank you so much for being our teacher. This is actually my... as a mind value member and i'm so happy that you get to be my first teacher oh brilliant thank you and check out the other ones you know i was doing um yeah i've been doing a couple of the um quests at the same time too the marissa peer one uh really great the um oh the conscious uncoupling one of course i did was very important for me and my wife's breakup um and really allowed us thank you so much thank you um yeah so many great other quests there man thank you joshua thank you thank you thank you Thanks a lot, Joshua. All right. Tess, welcome to the call. Are you there? Andrzejewski? Is this Tess Andrzejewski? Yeah, she is. Andrzejewski. Hi. Oh, my God. Yeah, I'm here. Hey. Hi. So, yeah, I did manage to get lucid after the... quest had finished but it was really super short and i do have a question because it seems like i sometimes naturally do an out of body like clean my body and that night i did that and then it turned into a lucid dream but i didn't realize it at the time before i woke up and then Again, I fell asleep. And in my dream, I told my husband about my OBE. And then it was really weird. And then finally, I was like, oh, my God, this is really weird. Am I dreaming? And then I immediately became lucid. And then I didn't remember my sankalpa because I'd been like binge watching your YouTube about. excuse me my children um this shadow integration and stuff like that so i sort of like just shouted out shadow come to me or something like that but no i didn't shadow just something else but then it all shifted and then i woke up so i didn't really re i mean experience anything i mean i yeah i just woke up i do understand that i do realize what you talk about that balance you know when you are between the waking state and the dream and then the lucid dream and for me also astral projection because it seems like oh you just froze for me i'm sorry no you're back yeah thank you oh i think it's easier for me to like leave my body but how can i i know that there are methods to when you're lucid and then you want to do the opposite but i want to do the opposite i want to go from an astral projection to a lucid dream how do i do that well is there like a yeah if you're astral projecting because of course astral projection doesn't require sleep You know, you can astral project in the waking state and the meditation state and the hypnagogic state. But one of the ways you can astral project is through the dream state. So it sounds like that's your your particular entry point for this. So often if you've astral projected from the dream state, the kind of barrier between lucid dream and astral projection is like really wavy, really thin, because think how think how different. the experience of the waking state is like where everything's solid and seemingly real and the astral state where you're an energy body um yeah but it's much easier to go from the astral state to the lucid dream state or the lucid dream state than it is from the waking state to astral state because it's such a big shift in in the kind of uh material nature so it is possible i mean what i'd say is for that is um join the next quest that you know jade my ex -wife's doing yeah i will i think that must go live soon because they're filming in a couple of weeks so it'll definitely be like maybe after the summer or this year um she's the one who'll be able to teach you kind of how to move between those states um I know tricks from going lucid dream to astral, but as far as going astral to lucid dream, I don't actually know. Because when I woke up, you know, it was exactly like that, like the body was asleep. And I've had that before, like when I've done like breath work or something like that. But my mind, I was totally awake. So I was thinking. I've only ever had an OBE I mean like naturally so I think oh god I'm gonna have an OBE now but I want to go lucid and then nothing really I felt like I was gonna shoot out of my head but nothing really happened and then I sort of like tensed my stomach but obviously I didn't test my stomach probably just my like energy body and then I flew out so yeah I will definitely take your ex -wife's quest for sure because i really do want to experience lucid dreaming more brilliant oh and you've just reminded me something before i forget um i don't think it's even live on the mind valley platform but i can tell you myself and this will be a first we just confirmed it with vision yesterday on um 4 p .m uk time so whatever that's 4 p .m uk time on thursday the 15th so in a few days uh we'll be doing a mind valley live webinar with myself jade shaw the astral projection teacher my ex -wife and a guy from the monroe institute uh out of body because a few days ago something called page 25 was revealed now there has been a secret cia document about how the cia used astral projection training in the 70s and 80s for their spies that was declassified in 2003 by the abar um I think it was the Obama rule. Anyway, in 2003, it was declassified, right? Massive, huge thing because suddenly it proved that the CIA did use actual projection. But in that report, there was one page missing. It had been redacted, right? One page, 25. And there were all these conspiracy theories. Oh, did page 25 exist? Did page 25 give the existence of God away? Is page 25 hidden and you're supposed to remote view to find it? Anyway, all these conspiracy theories for the last 20 years. Three days ago, page 25 was revealed. We've now got page 25. It's freaking huge as far as consciousness goes. So I instantly was like, Vishen, we need to do a live call on this soon because this is like the scoop of the century. So we're getting the guy from the Monroe Institute who are the people who trained the CIA to come and talk about that. So Tess, you're into out -of -body experience. Tune in 4 p .m. Thursday to Mindvalley platform. It's going to be a really, really exciting talk. And everyone else. Thank you. Thank you so much for the question. I love it. Thank you so much, Tess. Thank you. Someone's saying, please do not train the CIA. Yes, if you want to find out about the event, you can go to mindvalley .com forward slash calendar. We just put up that event today, so it should be there. But you can always find our live events on the Mindvalley calendar, mindvalley .com forward slash calendar. Sure. All right. Trixie, you there? Welcome to the call. Hi, Ezra. Hi, Charlie. I'd like to take this opportunity to thank you for this wonderful quest. And I think I'm going to repeat the program so that I can refresh the teachings that you taught us. Brilliant. That's a great idea. Thank you so much. Yeah. Actually, during the quest, most of my dreams, I felt like I was... and then during the last week that was my very first lucid dream but actually you said it in your lectures that when you get so excited and then you immediately wake up and then I tried to sleep again but I was not able to lucid dream again but I remember that dream. Brilliant. What did you do in your lucid dream? Do you remember? Or was it just as soon as you were lucid you woke up? Actually, it felt like a curtain was opening. And then in my assignment, I'm lucid dreaming. And then it was gone. I woke up. That is such a common first lucid dream. I think, you know, 90 % of people, their first lucid dream is, I'm lucid. No way. Boom. And then they wake up. Because it's just, it's so shocking. It's so shocking because you think it's going to be dreamy. And it's not. It's like this. There is sunlight. There's sunshine. Things feel solid. If you pinch yourself, you'll feel the pinch. It's almost like it's just too much for the mind to take or for the ego to take. So very, very common for that to happen. But the great thing is you've tasted it. It's not very real. Yeah. Yeah. So there'll be more in the wings. Wonderful experience. Yeah. Brilliant. Thank you, Trixie. I'm so excited. Yeah. Thank you. Great. Thank you so much, Trixie. You're welcome. All right. And next up, Monica. Are you there, Monica? Welcome to the call. Let's see if she's there, if she's not. Monica, are you there? We will bring on Marcella then. Marcella, you are now a panelist. You can turn on your microphone and camera and let us know the story you shared with us on the platform. Hi. Hi, everyone. Wow, I totally love this course. I mean, it's amazing. I am normally very shy. I don't even participate in anything. And it has really changed me. I am so grateful. I had a lot of trauma and it was always in the dreams. And taking this class has changed everything for me. I went and I reviewed a lot of trauma. And everything has changed. I mean, it's amazing. And it's in my waking life. I got lucid twice, but it was that I got so scared. And then I just like poof. But the memories that trigger the dreams, it's been like healing and healing and healing. And I don't know, it's crazy. Like I feel that. Like my perception is just changing so much. So I'm very grateful. Like, thank you. Thank you. That's very interesting you say that, Marcela. Sometimes I think that because lucid dreaming is like the ultimate invitation to the unconscious mind to say, I want to know you. I want to be your friend. That if we have a lot of underlying trauma, even the fact of just learning to lucid dream. Not necessarily having lucid dreams where we confront trauma, even though you said you've had a couple of lucid dreams, but just the act of telling the unconscious, I want to come into your world. I want, I'm ready to meet you. Already does something to the trauma that lies within the unconscious. It says like, kind of like you're safe now. You know, I'm here to befriend you. So that's very interesting. That's, yeah, I've heard that not a lot, but a couple of times people have said that. their actual trauma response in the waking state has decreased, even though they haven't had a lucid dream trauma integration. They've just been learning lucid dreaming. And it took me a while to go like, why is that? Why would that be an epiphenomena? And I think it's this idea of friendship. You know, there's no greater gift you can give to your unconscious than lucid dreaming. It's like, you know, it's like a love letter saying, I really want to know you. And I think that in itself can help integrate trauma. That's so great to hear. Yeah, thank you. It was that I was very scared of my own dreams. Yes. Because the dreams were the memories of the trauma. But when I did the meditation, the meeting, the dreamer, I was like so totally scared. Like I got like a panic attack. And then I said, no, you know, I have to deal with this. And yeah, so thank you. Thank you all. I did it. Thank you. Brilliant. And thank you so much for sharing, especially you said, you know, you're not one to share all the time. So that's even, you know, this is your shadow integration work. It's coming on the call and speaking in front of, you know, 300 people. So thank you so much. Thank you. Thank you, guys. Thank you, Marcella. Monica, are you there? Let's see. Hey, Monica. So Monica is also one of our lucid dreaming ambassadors. She's been with Mindvalley for... probably about two years now. She's fantastic. If you haven't had a chance to connect with her, Chamalee or Vivian or any of the ambassadors, definitely do. They are amazing, wonderful people here to support you. Hi, Monica. You're muted. You're muted. Okay, now I'm on. Okay. Thank you, Ezra. Thank you so, so much for inviting me. I was not sure it's about me because we didn't talk about me joining live today. But really, thank you so much. I really appreciate it. You and I really appreciate this quest. Oh, Charlie, this, you know, I shared my story on Mindvalley StorySide that it's like a toy. I discovered a new toy and I can't have enough of it. And Vishen shared this in the call with the students when they joined. this quest and it was just amazing for me this quest has been really really amazing and yeah for trauma integration I really felt a difference I had only one lucid dream and it was very quickly but so many things shifted for me and my life is right now different and I don't know if But many students know this. I'm running a dream circle every week, every Thursday from, I don't know, 20 to 50 people. We join every week and we share our dreams. And this helped me a lot just by talking about dreams and talking about our experiences with this quest. So totally grateful to you, Charlie and Mindvalley for this quest. It was amazing. Brilliant. Thank you so much. And thank you for keeping that dream circle going. That's really important. And again, the dream circle is not just to share lucid dreams, to share that connection to the nighttime, that connection to our dreamer. So yeah, thank you so much for that. And I'm so glad you gained so much from it. Totally. Thank you. I'm still here. I'm still doing the support for the students and in the Telegram group on the platform. I'm here. Thank you so much. Thank you. Thank you, Monica. Great to see you again. Lisa? Hello. How are you? Can you hear me well? Yes. All right. Hi, Charlie. Hi, Ezra. Hi, everybody. So I wanted to say to your point about enjoying the process of the class, that was to me the big win of the whole quest. And right after taking your master class, which I don't know if it was a lucid dream or what, I had a couple of dreams that were very revealing and I'm very grateful for. One, I said, show me my insecurities now. And I even saw myself dying on it and I was happy. So that was pretty cool. The other dream that I had was show me my pattern with men and a lot of learning on that one too. And the third one was your class about the Columbus, the Columbus method, which actually validated a lot of things. I was already, I think, on that path of being more present and enjoying life and seeing everything with childlike mindset, curiosity driven. And that was a great reminder and validation. So thank you so much. And it was, I really enjoyed it. I never have been more excited about going to sleep than taking your question. Brilliant. That's it, right? Let's be excited about going to sleep. That's so cool. Lisa, have we spoken on Instagram? Yes, yes. Oh, you told me about the dream, the patterns with men dream. Yeah. And I want to do that same one, but patterns with women. Amazing. Very revealing. I saw the learning. I'm good. Thank you so much. That's great work. Yes, yes, yes. Thank you, Lisa. And next up is Shamath. Hello. Can you hear me? Yes. Loud and clear. Yeah. Hi, Charlie. Hi, Ezra. I'm good. I hope you remember we had an interaction a few weeks back. Yeah. On this live call, right? Yeah. yeah so first of all it's been a great quest and i want to share the benefit like i have been more aware throughout my days now my awareness has increased and my intuition has increased as well so there's after i finished this quest uh my intuition has gone up quite a bit so i had two questions which i wanted to ask one one is after how many days should we change our dream plan like yeah i i waited for a dream plan i had a dream plan in sankalpa already but I did not happen like even in non -lucid or a lucid dream. I do not have that at all. So after how many days should I wait and want an extreme plan? That's the first one. Second one is you mentioned in the quest that you are somewhere. You mentioned that you use the lucid dream to heal some other people. How can I do that? Because I want to heal my mother as well. I saw like, can I just have a lucid dream to send healing energy to some person? Can I do like that? OK, so let's let's look at that question first. Yeah, I think I shared the fact I've tried that, but I haven't succeeded. So mine was with my mother, too, who has Alzheimer's and several lucid dreams. I'd become lucid and I'd say healing energy to my mom now, healing energy to my mom now. In fact, even in my second book in Lucid Dreaming Made Easy, in one of the dream plan examples, I write, imagine if you got lucid in a dream and cooled out. I send healing energy. To Diana now, I send healing energy to Diana. That's my mom's name. Because I had a thought that if millions of people read my book, they would all read that line. And maybe they would send some energy to my mom and heal her. It hasn't worked. My mom still has Alzheimer's. But I think if I do a healing for my mom in the dream, at least, like if I get loose and I say, may my mom be free from disease. May my mom be happy and well. Healing energy to my mom. At least I'm healing my internal mother. I'm healing the energetic archetype. I'm healing my relationship with the external mother. At least that's happening, which of course is very powerful and will deeply affect the relationship you have with your real mother in the waking state. And at most, because of this seven times power of mind, because of all the gamma waves, all this kind of stuff, at most it could work. Now, just because I haven't had success in the particular person I've been sending healing to doesn't mean it doesn't work. I'm sure there'll be other people who who have, you know, I mean, the power of prayer. This is what we're talking about. So it's basically the power of prayer amplified by lucid dreaming. So I would say try it. Nothing bad can happen. You know, in some shamanic traditions, they say, oh, no, never send healing to someone without asking. And people often at the end of talks, sometimes in the middle of talks, people put their hand up. Charlie, you shouldn't be encouraging people to send healing unless they ask them. And my reply is always like, how dualistic is that? Number one, there is no other. There is no other. So sending love to your mom is sending love to yourself. At a highest level, there is no other. And at a relative level, I'd say, do we have to ask someone before we love them? Or do we just love them? So I know in shamanic tradition, it says you should ask before you send healing. The Buddhist view is you don't need to ask. You just send love. And if the love or healing would in any way cause that person harm. like maybe they're learning from their illness maybe they're purifying karma from their illness maybe there's a reason they have the illness then your healing will just bounce back at you so no harm can come from sending healing to another at least it will heal you and at most it will heal them so i would say try it um what was your first question again just remind me uh after how many days should we change our dream plan okay well if you're trying to if you're like dead set on doing the dream plan in a lucid dream you might have a dream plan for weeks or months until you have that lucid dream. So if I've had a drought, like, I'm God, this year, last year passed, I had terrible droughts, like two months sometimes without lucid dreams. So yeah, I would have that same dream plan for two months because I hadn't had a lucid dream in so long. If I had, in that two month period, had a really strong lucid living experience or non -lucid dream experience, it would have to be pretty strong. for me to go okay i've completed that dream plan um i usually hold out for lucid dreaming because of course that's my kind of specialty right so yeah you can have the same dream plan for for weeks and months um it could be though if after a few weeks you feel like your enthusiasm for the dream plan has declined like you're just not that bothered anymore about it it's not turning you on anymore then write a new dream plan but if the dream plan is still really important to you then i'd say you know stick with that yeah Sure. And regarding meditation, can you share some steps of how we can meditate just like we do? I meditate in my real life. In lucid dreaming, can you share some tips, some how we can meditate? Yeah, sure. The first thing I'd say is don't close your eyes. Now, I often forget to say this because in 99 % of the Tibetan Buddhist meditations, we meditate with our eyes open. when you're learning you can meditate with your eyes closed but the aim is eventually to meditate with your eyes open because we live with our eyes open So we don't want to only be able to meditate with our eyes closed because then we can't meditate when we're walking around. We can't meditate when we're eating. We can't meditate when we're having sex. Whereas if you, well, whatever. If you learn to meditate with your eyes open, you can meditate in all states. So because of that, I often forget to tell people this. If you're going to meditate in your lucid dream, don't close your eyes. Because by closing your dream eyes, of course, your real eyes are already closed, right? You're asleep. But by closing your dream eyes, it sometimes blanks out the dream. and you'll be in this blackness and then the dream fades so i'd say keep your eyes open and just go you know let's say i'm lucid i'm lucid i'm lucid um right i wanted to do my meditation and just just go straight into simple breathing or if it's mantra recitation oh i'm lucid i'm lucid shamanic practice go straight into your shamanism or christian christian chant whatever it is just do the practice in the dream but crucially i would keep the eyes open yeah oh and you don't need to sit down i had this wonderful this happened four or five times people have at retreats where they've emailed me to say oh i finally got lucid i wanted to do my meditation but i couldn't find a cushion my meditation cushion i was like you're in a lucid dream you don't need a cushion like your butt's not gonna hurt you're in a dream or you know fly in the sky and meditate do it as you're walking so yeah you don't need to close your eyes and you don't need a cushion that's what i'd say okay Thank you so much, dude. Great questions. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you, Ezra, for choosing me. It's really great. You're welcome, Shamath. Thank you. See you later. You made my day. Awesome. Awesome. All right. Thank you, everyone, for sharing your stories. We invite you to share more of your stories, whether it's this week, next week, when you get lucid or when you have another transformation through this quest. I put it in the chat here. It is the stories platform, stories .mindvalley .com. And you can share all about your stories, whether it's this quest or another quest. So, Charlie, tell us what the next steps are. How do we continue our lucid dreaming journey with you or without you? Sure. So, again, I know I've said this again. I don't want to sound like a broken record, but the journey begins now. 30 days is like right at the beginning of the journey. Also, what I would say is. Full beginner lucid dreamers. If you're having one lucid dream a month, that's brilliant. For the first year, if you can be, well, first like six months to a year, if you can be having one lucid dream a month, that's brilliant. I mean, imagine if at the end of the year, you go to your dream diary and you can lay out on the floor, and it's a good thing to do all of your dream plans. Oh, you know, 12 lucid dreams. Think how much you can do. And so in one year, if you have a lucid dream month, I healed my inner child. I met my golden shadow. I worked with my trauma. I did my spiritual practice. I manifested waffles in a dream and played with her. That's just five. So 12 lucid dreams a year, if you're doing full intentional lucid dreams, as I've been teaching you, is amazing. Think of the work you can do on one lucid dream. So if you're averaging a lucid dream a month, you're doing brilliantly for your first year. So because this quest has taken a month, that means if any of you have had just one lucid dream, you are way on chart. perfect and if some of you have not yet had a lucid dream that's fine too but if you've had one lucid dream or more in the last month that's perfect The first six months to a year, if you can be averaging a lucid dream a month, you're doing really, really well. Lucid dreams are peak experiences. I'm not lucid every night. I might be lucid like once a week. Like I probably have 50, 60, like 70 max lucid dreams a year. So like fully lucid dreams, as in doing a dream plan and actualizing the dream plan. I might have, you know, quite a few just natural ones. So, you know, that's not loads. I'm not lucid every night, like, you know, twice a week, something like that. But I think I've said before, I think I said in the quest, actually, I used to have more lucid dreams when I was younger, had a lot of lucid dreams, but they just weren't, I wasn't really doing anything in them. Nowadays, I have fewer lucid dreams, but one of the lucid dreams I have today is worth 10 that I used to have 10 years ago because I'm dream planning now. You know, I wasn't even teaching dream planning when I first started. It's so important. If you've had an intentional lucid dream, manifested a dream plan. Those are worth like 10 spontaneous lucid dreams, I think. So just keep that in mind. These are peak experiences. Very, very few people are lucid every night. Not even Lama Yeshe. You know, I asked Lama Yeshe once. I didn't mean to ask him. I was actually asking what he did in his last lucid dream. But he thought, because his English isn't so perfect, he thought I was saying, do you lucid dream every night? And he went, no, no, no, no. Sometimes just sleep. And I was like, oh, amazing. This is like a fully awakened being saying sometimes he just wants to hang out and sleep. So not even he gets lucid every night. Really, it's not about how many lucid dreams you have. It's about the quality of lucidity. But yeah, if you can be having a lucid dream a month or a few lucid dreams in the first year and then just kind of bringing the average up, that's really, really good. Or maybe you just have one lucid dream. Like that's totally fine as well. Remember the girl who I mentioned, the lady from the quest. So yeah, just be aware of that. Be aware that lucid dreaming is not just about the home run of a lucid dream. It's about all the other qualities we discussed. As far as moving forward now, okay, so the lucid dream drop -in is a new thing. I've been running it for the last five months now. It's free. It's every month. All of these things you'll find listed on my website, charlimorley .com, or you'll find listed on my Instagram. If you go onto my link in the bio, that has all these things listed. So we've got the lucid dream drop -in. That's a monthly. So anyone who's watching, after the live call those will still be running we usually have something over 100 people maybe 100 to 150 people last time we had 21 countries present and we do dream sharing circles and a q a with me so that's my kind of free offering a month um as far as what's coming up now in the in the um short term next week or this weekend coming up is the wake up to sleep workshop this is not a lucid dreaming workshop this is a workshop for people with stress or trauma affected sleep So if you have stressed out sleep, if you have insomnia, if you have trauma and nightmares, check out the workshop this weekend. It's on Zoom. Again, all the details are on my website or on the Instagram page. The next thing in May, my big event in May, is the Embracing the Shadow weekend. So if you were into that stuff in week four, when we looked at the shadow, shadow work, death, fear, shame, come and do that workshop. That's going to be really good. Again, all the details are up there. It's called Embracing the Shadow. I know quite a few people. have started already i think there's actually a book group that's come out of this quest um looking at my book dreaming through darkness in many ways the shadow work you know people think like oh they need to do the lucid dreaming before the shadow work many ways it's the other way you know we should really do the shadow work before the lucid dreaming because then we're preparing the ground we're getting to meet our shadow we're getting to meet our shame and our fear and then we can meet it in the lucid dream of course Nobody does it that way because lucid dreaming is fun and sexy and cool and shadow work is scary as fuck. So this is what people think. Of course, it's not. But that's what people think. However, I would really advise checking out my book, Dreaming Through Darkness. In many ways, that is, you know, more of a beneficial book than the lucid dreaming ones, simply because not everyone will be into lucid dreaming. But everyone knows shame. Everyone knows fear. Everyone knows regret. And shadow work can really help you transform those. And then, yeah, there's more online courses. Of course, there's Jade's Astral Projection Quest, which I think must launch after the summer at some point. So that'll be really good. Of course, this Thursday, the live call where I'll be interviewing the guy from the organization who trained the CIA in astral projection. And we'll be finding out about that. I'm sure me and Vishen will be doing more stuff too. You know, Mindvalley is a real family. So I hope to be at Mindvalley events when they start again and Mindvalley University and all that. But essentially, check my website. The new book comes out in October. That's again for stress or trauma -affected sleep. Yeah, keep in touch. We've only known each other for a month. Let's know each other for many years going forward. Beautiful, Charlie. Thank you so much. And Charlie's got a special request that we have a little dance party to close off this celebration call. My only request is that you bring waffles to dance as well. So at the end of my workshops and retreats, especially the shadow work retreats, because there's a lot of energy built up, we always end in a dance party. So usually we'll put on a track, everyone will put their screens on and we'll be dancing together. Now we're in the webinar function, so we can't get everyone's screens up. So embarrassingly, it's just going to be me and Ezra, but I hope that everyone will be dancing. We'll play the track. and they enjoy it it's like kind of afro beat party track i'll be dancing with waffles but do move your body you know it's really important to move the body and we are hardwired for dance and it's not about dancing well this whole idea of like we dance to look good throw that out the window dance to feel good So if you want for the next four minutes to just do this, because it feels really freaking good to do that, you do it. We can't see you anyway. Just go for it. I'm going to be looking crazy, so you won't look as crazy as me. But yeah, I invite us to dance, to celebrate. And I hope to see as many of you as possible Thursday, 4 p .m. UK time. Check it out on the Mindvalley app. Keep in touch. Add me on Instagram. Let's be friends. Thank you so much. And congratulations for completing this quest. It's been an absolute honor to be sharing it with you. Thank you. Thank you so much, Charlie. It's been an honor to host these calls for you. Can we say that too? Can we have a big thank you to Ezra in the chat? Because, you know, him hosting this, him holding the space, you know, setting all the timings, choosing who to do the questions. That's a skill, you know, and like he preps for these calls and he's a really cool dude. So yeah, lots of love to Ezra, man. Thank you. Thank you so much, man. Well, without further ado, let's get moving. Okay. Can we get that as loud as you can, Ezra? Yeah. Thank you, everyone. Thank you, thank you, Charlie. Thank you, Waffles. Thank you. What a great way to finish, right? Super, super. Thank you so much, Charlie. Thank you, everyone, tribe, wherever you are, whether it's early in the morning, late at night. I haven't danced that hard actually in a while, so it's fantastic. It's a long track, too. Thank you, Charlie. Very much. Thanks. Peace, love and lucidity.
