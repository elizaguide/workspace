====================

PREPARATION 1: Welcome to Your Quest

-   Hello, and welcome to this manifestation Quest. Firstly, I want to
    congratulate you. Thank you for saying yes to yourself, to your
    manifestations, and to your soul. It’s an honor and a privilege to
    be able to support you in this deep and potent journey that we are
    about to go on together. My name is Regan Hillyer. I’m your trainer;
    I’m your guide. I’m your sister in manifestation, and I’m so excited
    because I know what’s coming for you. This lesson is superimportant.
    Consider this your warmup before we get started on day number one.
    Today, we’re going to be covering off how this Quest works and also,
    how you can get the most out of this Quest. Welcome, officially, to
    the Mindvalley family, and once again, congratulations on joining
    this Quest. I’m really excited to dive deeper with you, and in order
    to do this, I want to share a few pointers so that you know what’s
    coming, and you know what to expect. If you’re someone who really
    wants to get the most out of this manifestation Quest, then what’s
    superimportant is that you choose, firstly, to show up, not for me,
    not for Mindvalley, but for yourself, for your future self that is
    hoping and praying and wishing that you’re going to say yes and go
    into this deep work, completing every single lesson, watching every
    session, watching and then rewatching, pausing, fast-forwarding,
    rewinding, going back, and really pulling these trainings apart.
    Every single one of these trainings has important pieces of soul
    work which you get to complete, and there are also many activations
    sprinkled throughout this Quest, and it’s really important that you
    go deep into these as well because these are going to help shift and
    elevate and accelerate your manifestation results. So this
    manifestation Quest is all about advanced manifesting. We start in
    the beginning, and we layer it up, piece by piece by piece. It is a
    whole formula where we take you behind the scenes of what it really
    looks like from the inside out to go into a deep adventure and
    journey in creating your ideal reality so that you can design a life
    that you’re madly in love with in whatever way that looks like for
    you. When you start diving into the lessons in this Quest, and when
    you start going into the soul work, and when you start going into
    the activations, you’ll start noticing that you can manifest from a
    place of ease, of grace, and of flow. Whether you’re an
    entrepreneur, a professional, or a student, or someone who just
    simply knows that you’re destined for more in your life, you’re
    going to experience instant physical results in your life that allow
    you to truly take your life and your career and every single element
    of your life to this next level. So as we go into my manifestation
    formula, we’re going to be taking you behind the scenes of how to
    break this down, where to start. We’re going to be understanding how
    manifestation is an inner game, and I’m going to be sharing with you
    so many tools and hacks and tips and secrets that you will only find
    within this manifestation Quest. Throughout this Quest, you are
    going to be using cutting-edge inner mind energetic strategies which
    will allow you to tap into your manifestation superpowers,
    activating ultimate visioning and expansion, learning how to handle
    blocks and limitations which come up. You’re going to understand how
    to bring the most powerful version of you to the table and, of
    course, how to accelerate your manifestations so that they show up
    faster. So how this Quest is structured is that you have your lesson
    that you get to dive into, and then after every single lesson, there
    are pieces of soul work designed for you to dive deep into your
    manifestation superpowers and start putting into action what you’ve
    actually learnt in the lesson. There are nine different areas of
    your life, and during this manifestation Quest, you get the
    opportunity to focus in on one of these. These categories are
    health, wealth, relationships, mindset, emotions, purpose, passion,
    contribution, and spirituality. And so you get to pick one of those
    focus areas, and then you’ll be guided on how to ground into
    specific intentions and manifestations within that focus area of
    your life. So while it is possible to manifest amazing results in
    all nine areas, I really recommend that you deeply connect and
    choose one of these areas of your life which you will then place
    your complete focus on throughout this Quest. so you can repeat the
    Quest, and every time you do so, you can choose to focus on another
    area of your life. The beauty of this Quest is that the tools that
    we’ll be using can be applied to any of these nine areas. So I want
    you to tune in and ask yourself right now what is going to be your
    area of focus throughout this Quest? The next thing that is
    important to know in order to prepare yourself is make sure you have
    a journal. Now, if you already have a journal that you can use, you
    can use that throughout the Quest, but I recommend you go and get a
    manifestation journal. Make sure this journal is special and unique,
    and you can think of it as really allowing it to be your sacred
    space where you dive into each of the lessons each and every single
    day. There are also downloadable and editable PDFs that you can use
    instead, but there’s something magical about picking up your pen and
    putting it to paper and spending that time with you, your
    manifestation journal, and your soul. As we go into each of these
    lessons and as you go deeper into the soul work and the activations,
    make sure that you have access to a private, quiet space where you
    can go really deep without any distractions and go deep into the
    tasks and all of the activations. Make sure you also join the Tribe.
    This is your community. One of the fastest ways to heal and shift
    and upgrade is to be witnessed, and what a gift that you have a
    whole family of like-minded, powerful people that are on this
    journey with you, that only want you to rise and succeed and be even
    more amazing, and manifest the life that you desire. So make sure
    you jump in there and introduce yourself to the Tribe. Let us know
    why are you here, who are you, and what are you most excited about
    with this Quest? Make sure you approach this Quest with childlike
    curiosity. Put any expectations or things that you’ve learnt in the
    past to the side, and even if you’ve gone really deep in spiritual
    or personal journeys and you’ve gone in and you’ve done a lot of
    inner work, I promise you, if you approach this with a blank slate,
    with total curiosity, you might be surprised as to what you get to
    unlock. The reason that you think you’re here in this Quest probably
    isn’t actually the reason, so stay open and stay curious. Now, I’m
    going to load you up with tools and activations, and downloads and
    transmissions throughout this powerful journey, and it’s your job to
    try on all the clothes. It’s almost like I’m giving you a new hat,
    and then I’ll give you a jacket, and then I’ll give you a pair of
    socks, and then I’ll give you another pair of socks and then another
    pair of socks, and then at the end of this Quest, you’re going to
    have all of Regan’s tools and all of Regan’s activations and all of
    Regan’s lessons and learnings and gifts, and then you get to choose.
    But if you don’t leave those old clothes at the door, then you’re
    not going to have space in your system to try on the new things and
    see if they fit, and see if you want to wear them into your future.
    So stay open; stay curious. There are activations sprinkled
    throughout this manifestation Quest. What is an activation? An
    activation is similar to a guided visualization or a guided
    meditation, but it’s different because instead of just meditating or
    just visualizing, I guide you into activating what is already within
    you. This is where this Quest is not about becoming something you’re
    not; it’s about getting into radical authenticity with the truth of
    who you are, at a deep level, at a soul level. The activations are
    closed-eye. I guide you through it with my voice, and the only way
    you can mess it up is if you’re sitting there going, “Oh, I don’t
    know if this is going to work. I’m not sure if this is something
    that will happen for me.” If you’re open, if you have a strong
    intention, and you’re ready and available for the magic and the
    miracles that get to unfold through these activations, then trust
    me, powerful things can unlock within you. These activations are
    using my method that I developed for years and years and years,
    called the Energetic Architecture Method. I explain this more as we
    go through the lessons, but just know that this is based off my own
    background in hypnosis and NLP and energy work and going deep into
    so many different modalities whilst refining my own modalities, and
    then coming through with this powerful activating process which you
    get to experience. Now, there is a special bonus that I have for
    you, that you are only able to unlock and activate if you are a part
    of this Quest, so make sure you show up and keep going through all
    of the lessons, and maybe, if you’re really good at completing the
    lessons and completing all the tasks and the soul work, you’ll find
    that you have access to this bonus activation. I am so excited to go
    deep with you. I have some soul work for you before we even get
    started in lesson number one. Remember, I said consider this your
    warmup, so part of warming up is practicing getting in the field and
    practicing diving into these soul tasks. So for the first piece of
    soul work, I want you to select your focus point for the Quest.
    Which of the nine areas of life are you going to choose to focus on?
    And then secondly, you get to set your intention for the Quest. Now,
    don’t worry about getting too specific on your manifestations at
    this stage. I’ll guide you through that, and I’ll share the best
    system of how to anchor in those manifestations, but for now, why
    are you here? What is your intention? Is your intention to go deep
    into a new iteration of yourself? Maybe your intention is to
    complete everything within this Quest. Maybe your intention is to
    manifest some magical things beyond what you’d even expect. Get
    clear, and get detailed, and make sure you share your intention with
    the Tribe and the group. And the third piece of soul work is to
    introduce yourself to the Tribe. We want to know why are you here;
    who are you? Let us feel your essence. Let us feel your intention.
    It’s beautiful for all of us to come together and really lean into
    this powerful community of other people that are also activating
    their manifestation superpowers. So I am so excited to get started.
    I am ready to run with you; I am ready to fly with you. I will go as
    fast as you desire to go, and I promise you, if you stay committed,
    and if you go through every single lesson and every single piece of
    soul work and every single activation, expect miracles to unfold in
    your reality. I love you so much. I’m so excited to get started in
    lesson number one. Blessings, and remember, of course, you
    absolutely can have it all. See you on the first lesson.

====================

PREPARATION 1: Call #1 - Wealth Manifestation

A beautiful introduction. It's so nice to be here, guys. Can you just type in a yes if you can hear me and see me okay? Let me know that the technology is working well. Yes, yes, yes. Beautiful. Okay, amazing. Well, yeah, I'm super excited to dive deep with you guys. And firstly, a massive, massive congratulations for saying yes and for being here. I'm super excited for you to dive into the layers of the quest. And there is a lot in this. So my intention over these calls, these bonus calls, really, which we're giving you guys. is to really give you some pieces and some accelerated activations in order to support you as you go through all of that course content and allow you to simply speed up your results and accelerate all of this even faster and faster and faster. So if you haven't yet started diving into the full manifestation quest, I really encourage you to do that because I'm not going to spend time today talking about my story or going into the fundamentals of manifesting because that's all in there. Okay. These are the more advanced acceleration pieces. You guys got to vote around what you would love this first session to be on. And the overarching votes was for manifesting financial abundance. So we're going to deep dive into that. I have a live immersive experience for you, which is going to be completely unique, one of a kind, never to be repeated anywhere else, specifically channeled and designed for you guys. And before we get into that, I would love to give you firstly, a little bit of context around some pieces, which we're going to be going into. with the activation. So you can hold your intention and be present to that. And then also know what's happening a little bit as we go through the flow. All right. So the first piece around this, when it comes to manifesting the next layer of financial abundance or wealth in your life is to get absolutely crystal clear on what it is that you actually desire. You're going to hear me go on and on about this in the quest, because it's not enough just to say financial abundance or more money or anything like that is too vague. You know, the universe turns around and says, well, what is it that you actually desire? So this is your opportunity through this activation today. to actually look at where do you want to focus your energy. Now, you might focus this on a one -week money goal that you have, maybe a one -month money goal. Maybe it's your yearly alignment when it comes to financial abundance. You can choose where you want to play with this. Any moment between the next week or so versus a year out from now is going to be absolutely perfect and work really well with this activation, okay? So take a moment right now just to tune in and have that alignment. What is that figure and by when? right? Money loves clarity. It loves precision. It loves being super, super, super clear on what is it that you're actually looking to manifest and why? For what purpose do you desire that money? Is it just so you can get all the cash out at the bank and roll around on the floor and be like, look at all the money that I have? Probably not, right? That money isn't actually just the vehicle to unlock what we desire to manifest in our reality, right? It's the vehicle to unlock where we want our resources to flow. So we've also got to be really clear and specific around, okay, well, why? Why do we actually have this driving energy forward into our lives? So deeply through this activation, what I will then take you through once you've grounded into that intention is a set of clearing protocols. Because the thing is, if this money... is not in your life right now, then there are things within you that are slowing the manifestation of that down, that are blocking it, that are stopping it, that is slowing down the manifestation process. So this clearing protocol that I'm going to guide you through is going to support you in releasing the parts of you and the blocks and the limitations within you, which is slowing down the process. And again, this goes hand in hand with everything and all of the activations and all of the teachings within the manifestation quest. This will be a deeper dive for you. And if you haven't done the quest yet, it's okay. You can do this in any order, but just know that they go hand in hand and they go together. So we're going to be looking around clearing and releasing elements like scarcity, for example, fear, doubt, having your system in contraction. We know that our internal reality is 80 % of the game. Why? Because it then creates the external reflections in our life. so if we are creating external reflections of there being say not enough money or not enough of the financial abundance that we desire or not hitting those money goals and targets or not scaling our business to where we want it to be then most people run around in their life and go well let me just work harder let me try this thing let me do 10 different strategies and they spin and they spin and they spin and then there's another person who goes oh hang on this is all a reflection of what's going on within me what if i conditioned myself from the inside out to become a full and complete energetic match for what i'm actually looking to call in So through this process, you will have the opportunity to start clearing some of these pieces, to start upgrading some of these pieces and actually having your system release these things that have been slowing down the process in order to create more space within you for what you're actually looking to hold. Just give me a yes if this is making sense. And I know I'm throwing you guys in the deep end here, but you're an advanced group. I can feel that you get it. Yes. Amazing. All right. I see you guys. Another piece that I want to bring in and touch on today, which I also go deep on in the quest, is raising your level of tolerance because this goes hand in hand with manifesting financial abundance. We don't necessarily get in life what we dream about, but we do get what we're willing to tolerate. We don't necessarily get in life what we dream about, but we do get what we are willing to tolerate. And if you're not sure what you're tolerating right now in your life, look at your life. look at your money look at your cash flow look at your savings account look at your assets look at your wealth look at your current reality not from judgment not from beating yourself up not from a place of oh my goodness why is it still like this just look at it curious raw and real and from that place of awareness you realize okay this is my minimum standard this is what i have tolerated in my past that has accumulated into right now Now here's the good news. Your future and where you're going has nothing to do with your past. Most people think that their past equals their future. Oh, I've always been like this with money, which means that My money is going to always be like that. Not true. That's a story and that's a program. Most people are copy pasting their past into their future unconsciously. But when you take your power back and you realize, hang on, my now and my present moment that I'm at right now is simply an accumulation of all of my past beliefs and decisions and conditionings and all of these pieces around money. and what if now was an opportunity to actually shift this and create a different future and a different reality what if right now was the moment to go oh wow this is what i've been tolerating and i no longer choose to tolerate this i no longer choose to tolerate this as my minimum standard and what if you were super clear on your vision and where you were going but you also committed to raising up this minimum standard right this is where people miss this of manifestation they're focused on their vision they're doing visioning work all day but they're not raising up their minimum standard now your minimum standard doesn't mean necessarily that you're broke and you're struggling and everything's terrible your minimum standard could be a substantially large amount of money that you've been capped at that you then say okay i am grateful for that and that's my minimum standard and i no longer tolerate that i now choose to raise this up so that i can become the vessel to receive even more financial resources to allocate them into the places that i desire in my life ultimately to change my life and the lives of others and leave this world a better place okay give me a yes if this is making sense because we're also going to be working on an energetic level through the activation around shifting this minimum standard yes amazing all right perfect and then the next piece in the activation that we will anchor in together is actually integrating the frequency of your money goal being done Because again, we are energetic beings and we are imprinting into our reality the frequency that's going on within us. So if we're operating from a place of, I really hope the money goal will manifest, or it would be great to maybe one day, someday, somehow receive this amount of money, then your money will always be imprinted slightly into your future, not into your near future, not into your right now. In order to actually receive the money and have it imprint into your field right now, What is important is that you become a full and complete energetic match with no blocks and limitations holding you back, raising up that minimum standard and allowing yourself to actually be in a place where you embody the vibration of it being done. Often with my private clients, you know, they'll hit a money goal and they'll write to me and go, oh my goodness, I just, I can't believe it. I just had my first $100 ,000 a month. And I will often write back and say, I'm so proud of you. Congratulations. Of course you did. and my response is often of course because i'm holding them in a frequency of yes that's your normal yes even though that seemed like a such a big goal a few months ago yes of course because that's who you are that's what you chose that's your birthright that's just how it gets to be so feel the difference between the energy of oh i wish hope pray maybe someday that would be amazing if i could be so fortunate to maybe manifest x versus i choose this i choose this right now in every single cell of my being because it's me it's my birthright it's what i choose and i'm a powerful manifester a sovereign being of light completely in control of my reality and from this place i say yes to being the vessel to receive this layer of financial abundance just type in a yes if you can feel the difference within you even just hearing that of those two different frequencies This is something that's available to all of you. We're going to activate this in the activation. And remember, the choice of that frequency, the frequency, I call it the frequency of it being done, is only ever one thought away. We're going to do it in this activation, but you don't need the activation. You can stop throughout your day and realize, wow, I'm in this energy of doubt or I'm in this energy of hoping something will happen. Stop. Recalibrate. and breathe it is done i choose that it is done with every single cell of my being i anchor that in i root that into my system right now i choose that i say yes and so it is holy moly yes frequency of being done everything is only one thought away beautiful family okay so what we're gonna do is we are now going to dive into this activation For those of you who haven't been on an activation with me before, welcome. This is going to be fun. You can do this as a closed eye or if you feel to have your eyes open, you're totally welcome to as well. But it is really powerful often if you close your eyes and go within. uh i'm going to be using a lot of different tools and modalities to guide you through this everything from my method of energetic architecture through to using different modalities of breath and sound and meditation and alchemy and everything in between you don't need any prior experience uh to activate this and to make this work the difference between a meditation and an activation is we're not necessarily trying to get into a zen meditation state where all of a sudden there's no thoughts in our head we're actually utilizing our mind and our system to come in and work through the energetic field which stores all of the information within your system and we're looking to activate what's already there within you so this is not about becoming something you're not this is not about trying to receive some sort of energy that you didn't have before this is about waking up you and allowing you to simply be the best, most awesome, most powerful, most abundant, most financially rich version of you that's available to you right now by actually activating what's lying dormant, right? By activating what's sitting underneath the surface. Okay. So is everyone good to dive into that? I'm going to switch my microphone and head on into my sound studio prior. Just give me a yes if everyone's clear, if there's any high level questions and let me switch my mic and then we will just test the audio. Okay. Great. Testing, testing, testing. Can you let me know if you can hear the sound here? Let me check. Yes. Not so good. Okay. Let me know how the sound is now. Sound is a little lower. Sound is far away. A little lower going. Okay. Let me just adjust one thing and come right back to you. Let me know about this. How is that sounding? Testing the sound. If not, I'm going to call my... amazing sound engineer who will be here in 10 seconds sounds good great okay let me check one thing because i don't know if it's still picking up through this mic or not let me know if you guys can hear and this at the same time sounds good all right and let me check one more thing let me see if you can hear now sound through here the music and also the microphone okay we're just gonna get this all switched on right now For now, if you have music and voice. Music and voice. Testing, testing, testing. No voice. Barely hear the voice. Voice is very distant. Okay, one more adjustment here. Testing, testing. Danny, can you please check on Zoom that it's switched over to the other system? That's the last thing to check. This thing was better before. Yeah, I think we need to switch it over here. Give us one second, guys. Okay. How's this now, guys? Can you hear the voice? Can you hear the music? Let me know better. Okay, good. Okay, good. And the music should just be, you know, quiet in the background, not like very loud music. Good sound. Voice is coming through better. Better. Okay. Some of you are saying you can't hear my voice. Some of you can. It's very strange. All right. Good. Yeah. And Danny, let's just turn the reverb down just a little bit, please. Yeah. Music should be very faint and small. Okay. All right. Okay. We're working just doing one more final adjustment just to check. Testing, testing, testing. Okay. Now let me know. If the voice is louder and clear. Okay. Voice is sounding good. Good. Perfect. Now tell me if I turn this up. Can you hear music and voice? Have we nailed it? Is it good? Yes. Okay. Looks like we're working now, Danny. Maybe just stay here for the next little bit. Perfect. Okay. Thank you for your patience, guys. Super appreciate it. We're going to start deep diving into this activation right now. i'm going to have the music very low it's a frequency so you should be able to actually hardly hear it it's just more energetic in the background okay beautiful good yeah some people are suggesting if you put headphones on if you have them that sound quality is even more amazing i would recommend that it's never the best just through computer um just through computer headphones okay the activation is going to be around 25 30 minutes roughly headphones sounds great amazing okay family well let's get started take a moment to just ground into this place and into the space and into this moment and allow yourself right now to either sit or lie in a comfortable position allowing yourself to gently close your eyes and turn inwards that's right beautiful and as you allow yourself to gently draw up into this place in this space you allow yourself to gently tune into your divine intention when it comes to activating the next level of financial abundance in your life and in your reality that's right and as you allow yourself to gently tune into this intention that's right allow yourself to gently drop drop down even deeper and deeper and deeper into this space of activation of deep remembrance good as you gently allow a red laser beam to shoot down from your tailbone all the way anchoring you grounding you solidifying you into the crystalline core of the earth and simultaneously allowing a golden laser beam of light to shoot up through your crown connecting you right now to your unique soul star allowing you to be guided grounded present protected and supported heaven on earth embodied right here right now that's right good and from this place of openness and awareness take a moment to invoke your guides beings of light of the highest vibration divinely assigned to supporting you in the full and complete embodiment of your divine intention you may be familiar with working with your guides or you may just simply know that they are here with you working through you in this space now either way is absolutely perfect welcome welcome welcome beautiful and as you ground even deeper into the space Allow yourself to gently lean into that intention one more time. What is it that you desire when it comes to financial abundance? What is it that you are looking to solidify, ground, and activate through this activation right now, specifically with the money in your life? What is that specific amount that you are calling in? Allow yourself to gently breathe into that right here, right now. And from this place of openness and awareness, With your intention anchored, grounded and solidified through you right here, right now, allow yourself to now gently be present to anything within you that has been slowing you down, blocking you or stopping you from the full and complete embodiment of your divine intention when it comes to financial abundance. Beautiful. And then from this place, you may notice that you may be aware of these some of these blocks and these limitations in your day -to -day reality or maybe some different blocks and limitations are coming to the surface right now as you allow yourself to gently be present to any fears any self -doubt any times you have not fully backed yourself when it comes to financial abundance any scarcity programs and frequencies through your system any layers of contraction when it comes to money allows you to be present to all of that right here right now and as you gently allow these blocks and these limitations to accumulate you allow themselves to gather right now within your solar plexus allowing yourself right now to gather all of these blocks and all of this information within your solar plexus right here right now that's right as you allow yourself to surrender even deeper and deeper and deeper into the space that's right And as you allow yourself to now sink and recalibrate even deeper and deeper and deeper into this place, into this space, into this openness and awareness right here, right now, you allow yourself to simply allow all of these blocks and limitations to accumulate into your solar plexus, allowing them to form a dense, dark, heavy ball. All of this accumulates into this dense, dark, heavy ball. Go ahead and simply request that your unconscious now gathers any information that has been blocking you, stopping you, slowing you down or holding you back. Any information that maybe you haven't even consciously been aware of. You may feel this ball filled with all of your blocks and limitations getting heavier and heavier and heavier and heavier right now. And from this place and this space, go ahead and simply request that this ball, this dense, dark, heavy ball in your soul complex is filled with all of your blocks and all of your limitations. Now drops, dissolves, shifts out of your system right here, right now. If you see this dense, dark, heavy ball, you may feel it. You may just simply know that it has left your system right now. Either way is absolutely perfect. That's right. And request that any final energy that's hanging out within your energetic field that has been blocking you, slowing you down, holding you back, complete embodiment of your divine intention. Go ahead right now. and gently request that all of that information now continues to gather joining the ball right here right now gently bear with to this ball as you request for it to spin which way is it spinning go ahead and spin it faster and faster and faster and now slow the spinning down slowing it down down down until it stops spin i'll spin it in the opposite direction Spin it in the opposite direction, allowing it to go faster and faster and faster, even if it feels slightly weird or uncomfortable. That's right. Spin it faster and faster and faster as it accelerates even more and more and more and more until it begins to turn into a beautiful golden ball of light before you. Shifting, alchemizing, transmuting, completely recalibrating and recoding. before your very consciousness right here right now that's right good now from this place go ahead this spinning ball of golden white light make it bigger and bigger and bigger that's it grow it right now and now allow it to expand getting even larger and larger and now change the density making it lighter and lighter and lighter as it fills with more light right here right now as you gently begin to remember the alchemist that you are the master manifester that you are your own unique capacity to gather up all of your blocks all of your limitations everything that has been holding you down slowing you down and holding you back from the full and complete manifestation of your divine intention and from this place you begin to remember that you have shifted and changed the geometric structure of all of these blocks and limitations transforming them into pure golden white light that's right and from this place in this space in this intention go ahead and gently hover this golden ball of spinning gold and white light right above your head right above your crown right here right now and gently allow it to now drop drop down even deeper and deeper until it begins to gently enter your full body system coming down down down deeper and deeper right now Until it is touching the very top of your head. That's it. Touching the top of your crown. Coming down and illuminating the brain center as it drops into your head right now. Dropping down, down, down, even deeper and deeper. And then coming down and dropping into your throat. Waking up and activating this portal, this vortex. Activating your capacity to speak your truth when it comes to financial abundance associated with this money goal to yourself and to others. That's it. This spinning ball of golden white light begins to drop down even deeper and deeper and deeper until it is resting gently within the center of your heart. That's right. And as it gently rests and settles within the center of your heart from this place, allow this ball of spinning golden white light to implode into every single cell of your being, allowing every single cell to wake up. and receive the light codes of the divine information associated inside this beautiful golden spinning bowl that has imploded into every single cell of your being as every single cell begins to wake up wake up wake up opening up and creating even more space right now even more space to hold the divine frequency of the wealth the money the financial abundance that is looking to anchor through you and be embodied right here right now we're working deeply old dna that is outdated and no longer in alignment with the full and complete embodiment this divine intention to drop dissolve and clear and shift allowing it to gently drop dissolve clear and shift out of your system out of your reality and allowing your new dna to wake up come online anchor stabilize and embody with ease with grace and with flow at a deep cellular level we begin to shift and recalibrate into the new level of tolerance as you allow your entire system right now to gently remember that it is safe to receive this amount of money that it is safe to raise your minimum standard that it is safe and it is your birthright to shift your level of tolerance allowing yourself to open up to receive even more abundance right here right now because it is who you are because you are choosing it right now with every single cell of your being in this place you allow yourself to gently remember how good it feels to raise your minimum standard to surrender and open up into the next layer of this next layer of tolerance as you begin to remember that you are a master manifester and your capacity to manifest specific amounts of money specific amounts of financial abundance activates through your system right now with ease with grace and with flow every single cell of your being to vibrate of having already received your intention right now. You may notice certain visions come to you knowing that across time and space you have already received this amount of money. That's right. And from this place, you allow yourself right now to let this frequency vibrate through every single cell of your being as you allow yourself to gently remember it is done, it is done, master manifesting. choosing right now to surrender and to receiving this amount of financial abundance with ease, with grace, and with flow. I choose to remember that the more money I receive, the more money I receive. And I choose to remember that it is easy and effortless for me to manifest the money that I desire. I choose to believe that every time I anchor into my intention, it shows up even earlier than I expect. that I desire with ease, with grace and with flow. The money that I am looking to embody is always one thought away. And I anchor it and stabilize it and recalibrate it through my system. I choose to remember that money is simply energy, flow and stabilize and embody through my life right here, right now. It is always easy for me to manifest the money that I desire. As you gently allow yourself to frequency of your intention, the specific amount of money being done breathe it through your heart every breath that you take in you are allowing this frequency of it being done and being done and being done to stabilize anchor ground and root through your system as your entire system right now sinks and recalibrates and becomes the true and complete energetic match for what you are looking to call in that's right you may feel the pulsation of this frequency through your system or you may just simply know that it is happening right now Either way is absolutely perfect. These shifts and upgrades and layers of transformation ground and stabilize and root into your system right now. Allow them to grow roots into your field just like an ancient tree roots herself into the ground. I decree and declare that all of these shifts, upgrades and layers of deep transformation and remembrance and activation continue. 24 hours a day, 7 days a week until they are fully actualized, stabilized, embodied, integrated and complete. and may they take place and embody through your system with ease with grace and with flow as you take a moment to thank your guides beings of light of the highest vibration divinely assigned to supporting you in this mission thank you thank you thank you for showing up for guiding us for being here for doing this work as you thank the beautiful mind belly tribe being here today live and also across the recording stabilizing this field anchoring in all of this work together witnessing each other as we shift and upgrade into the next layer of financial abundance, the full and complete embodiment of the money that we have called in. Thank you, thank you, thank you, beautiful tribe. beautiful community, beautiful mind valley. And taking a moment to thank yourself. Beautiful sovereign being of light that you are. Powerful manifester that you are. You are the alchemist, the shaman, and the manifester that you've been looking for. Take a moment in your own way to thank yourself. Love yourself, respect yourself, and honor yourself. Thank you, thank you, thank you. So as all of these shifts and upgrades and transformations roots and stabilize, and ground into your system you allow yourself to gently be present to your breath be present to your current awareness allowing yourself to come back into your body back into your own consciousness back into the portal of your heart having so much gratitude for yourself so much gratitude for your soul so much gratitude for your process knowing that however it was for you is absolutely perfect and exactly how it needed to be in order for you to unlock and shift into these next layers and as you gently allow yourself to breathe into your belly expanding all that energy through your heart as you gently begin to open your eyes you allow yourself to be fully awake integrated present available With so much love and so much gratitude. Welcome back. And as you take a moment just to stabilize back into this field, into your life, into your reality, go ahead and just type through one word. One word around what came up for you. One word around something that activated. I see you guys. it's a lot of comments moving fast beautiful precision magical peace glorious expansion golden lighter clarity bigger joy in the heart beautiful is it normal to not remember much of what happened yes that can happen sometimes the unconscious mind the conscious mind rather needs to get out of the way so the unconscious can do its work through the field certainty magical energizing yes shifts through the body orgasmic buzzing different outlook peace expansion tears certainty deep work moving light belief abundance substance positive good work everybody amazing well make sure you look after yourself this is a really deep activation a lot of shifts and they will continue if you heard me they will continue through your system 24 hours a day seven days a week until they're stabilized integrated and complete so we opened the portal and now the process keeps going so really listen to yourself around what you need maybe you need stillness and silence after this maybe you need to move your body maybe you need to sleep or have a nap really trust your rhythm and trust your flow make sure you look after your body as well your vessel give it the water that it needs um water really helps with these activations and just clearing and upgrading as we go into this thank you for your patience with the sound while we switched everything around sometimes when the energies are so strong with a group and a vortex that are looking to come through we can have some interesting technical pieces and it was extra interesting because half of you were saying you were fine the other half was saying that you were having some challenges so we were doing our best to switch and to change different things and to make sure you had the best experience possible and also just really trusting that whatever experience you did have was perfect for you. Okay, amazing. So Mindvalley crew, I think we can maybe jump into some questions now. I will hand back over to you guys. Most certainly we can. And what we can do is have people put some questions in the chat. Unfortunately, we don't have the Q &A version on this chat right now. I will scroll through and I'll pick some of the questions out and I'll copy them and read them to Regan. Is that okay? Makes it easier than, or would you prefer having people on the microphone? No, no, I think we'll get more done probably if it types through. Yeah, I agree. So let's just take a moment to allow some of these questions to come through. And I will, do we need to listen to the recording every night? um no you don't have to yeah you don't have to um however you can't overdose on these activations and they tend to work in layers it's almost like you know if someone goes to the gym just once versus never again they're going to end up with a different physical result than someone that goes maybe four or five times a week so it's not a set thing where you must listen to it every night but tune in and ask yourself is this good and useful for me to listen to right now? And maybe it is useful every night to listen until it's not, and then you would stop, right? And generally you would stop when it actually manifests. So you also have all the other tools in the quest, remember? So you're working in with those and maybe you're up to day seven and there's an activation there. Maybe you feel called to do this one once a week and then you're doing that other one each night. So trust your flow and your rhythm, only you will really know the answer to that, but just know that you can't overdose basically. Beautiful answer. I have another one from Tillman and it says, I did your advanced manifesting activation on Mindvalley many times, but I never got any results. Why and what to do about it? Yeah, great question. So, I mean, this is a very personal question, obviously, without knowing you or working with you intimately or looking in your field or seeing the blocks, it could be a number of different things. But what I feel when I tune into that and what I tune in is that there's still just things to upgrade within your system. So remember at the beginning of the call, we said, you know, if the money hasn't shown up now, then there's things within you that need to be cleared, shifted, and aren't fully recalibrated to that. In terms of what to do about it, I would keep going and really tune in if the money goal that you're setting is aligned. Okay. Because sometimes if we create a goal from our mind and we think, okay, this is like the biggest number I can think of, for example, and you write that down and you're like, that's my money goal, but that's not an aligned goal because it's not in alignment with your soul. You actually maybe don't need that much money. For example, maybe you need a third of that money. then it's a misaligned goal, which means it's simply going to be a lot harder for it to manifest. So tune in and ask yourself, really, what is the aligned number? And you can break it down into stepping stones. So for example, through that activation. If you, let's say you had a goal of $60 ,000 and maybe it hasn't shown up right now, break it down. Well, you need to manifest 20 before you can manifest 60. And then you need to manifest 40 before you can manifest 60. So break it down into the layers and the steps. And the more that you set yourself really achievable goals and you do it, the more your system's going to go, oh, wow, I can do this. And you create this proof in your life that you can do this as a manifester. And like, again, working out at the gym, your muscles, your energetic muscles, are going to get stronger and stronger and stronger. You'll get better and better at doing this and you'll get even faster and faster. So that's what I would be doing. I would break it down into the steps and then work with the micro pieces until you turn around and you've manifested that bigger goal. Yeah. Amazing. Good question and a great answer. Thanks so much. Because we often so often pick numbers that other people choose for us, right? And then we just think they're for us and they don't always align. I've done that so many times myself. I just want to share quickly from my experience in that activation, I just had this realisation in the solar plexus that my mum's side of the family, I would go to prison. with that much money and it would bring shame upon the family so it's just such a great awareness and i could feel the energy shifting so thank you regan wow it's so beautiful thanks for doing that work yeah absolutely so we've got a question from aviva how do we know when our vision is coming from the soul and heart space or from our head space yeah great question so only you will know this tune in and ask and if you have for example a vision or a money goal write it down and look at it and ask is this my soul's alignment is this coming from my soul or is this from my mind generally if it's from the mind there might be a whole lot of reasons around why is this and the mind wants to prove it wants to defend it wants to be right it wants to be like this is the thing right often with the soul it's not that logical it could be but more often than not it's not that logical often when something's from the soul it's like you know what i just feel this is right i feel this is for me so tune in and this takes practice obviously building this discernment but the more you start asking yourself these questions the better you're going to get at this so a few ways you can do this practice this outside of money and out So for example, someone invites you to go to a party on Friday night and they're telling you, you know, you have to come. It's going to be amazing. There's going to be free food and free drinks and the most amazing people. And the minute they ask you, your gut, it's like, I don't want to go. You feel a knob, right? But then the mind comes and the mind's like, but it's going to be amazing. And here's 50 reasons why you should go. So you're like, oh, okay. And you convince yourself to go. What happens guys? You know, the end of the story, you go and you have the worst night in the world. And you're sitting there at the party. You're like, I didn't listen. I didn't listen to my soul. Even though there were 50 reasons from the mind as to why this is awesome. The soul was like, I have one reason. It's not in your path. Don't go. Or maybe it is to go and vice versa. Right. And so. um when we have these scenarios practice checking in on this and then learn where you got it right and where you didn't you can learn so much by looking back at your past and be like oh that i got a nudge around that my intuition told me that that was my soul but my mind kicked in or vice versa and you can you can train yourself on this discernment from witnessing where you got it right and where you got it wrong and you can't do this from a place of judgment just from a place of pure curiosity yeah Amazing. I love that. Beautiful reminder. Got another question. I love this question, by the way. I think this is always useful for everybody. I was a bit distracted during the session. Is it worth repeating? I would go through it again. Yeah. If you did get distracted and again, sometimes the mind can pull us out. Just know that, you know, on an energetic level, it is still working. Even if you sat yourself in this room and there were 10 distractions, just know even just being in the space, it is working. But to go into the deeper layers, it is great to go in without external distractions. Yeah. Brilliant. Thank you. And from Leticia, I have some headache left. What should I do? A headache? Did you say? A headache. okay drink drink water personally and also um that's not normal now it's not that if you didn't get a headache it didn't work i don't expect you all to have headaches however it can happen right sometimes you can have a headache sometimes you can feel a little bit even nauseous in your stomach. Sometimes you could feel like you have so much energy. You want to go run around and go to the gym and it's 10 PM at night and you're like, what is going on? So often we can have these interesting physical sensations. All that is, is that is energy and motion that's shifting and moving through your system. So tune into the headache. And give yourself physically what you desire, aka more water. Maybe you want like a hot compress on it or do what you do whenever you get headaches. But beyond that, ask yourself, ask your head, what is this showing me? What is clearing through this headache right now? What energy is releasing out of my brain, of my mind, of my head, of past programs that I'm clearing? Because maybe there's also a message in that headache. right? Anything physical that's going on in our life, it's always a reflection of what's going on energetically. So when we move a lot of energy, this is why these things can happen. This is also why maybe some of you are like, wow, I just feel awesome. I feel inspired. I feel on purpose. I feel like clear in my body and my system because that's a reflection also of some of the things. So some of you guys are activated in that way. Some of you might still be clearing and releasing and that's great. Tune into it. See if there's a message there for you to unlock and give your system what it needs to be. supportive beautiful thank you um we've only got a little bit of time left so maybe one maybe two more questions but this next question i think is brilliant it's from nora and it says is it normal for action items to keep coming up during the activations is that a distraction from the unconscious work or is it inspiring action It's great. It could be either. It could be either. And it totally depends. So again, empowering you to tune into that, right? It could be the mind going absolutely crazy, being like, you need to do this. You need to do this. You need to do this. Trying to pull you out of the work. Now, chances are, if they're action items unrelated to what you're working on, chances are they're a distraction. You need to feed the dogs. You need to do this with the kids. Hang on, hang on. That's not relevant right now. We're here. And you bring it back, right? You train yourself to bring it back. if they're related to what you're activating they're most likely inspired pieces of intuitive guidance of your guides being like you need to call that person you need to go right you need to do this but they'll be related in some way to what you're actually working on so tune in and ask yourself but it's a great question you're right awesome thank you so much regan um because of the time i know there was some other really great questions in the chat so apologies that we can get to all of those however i want to remind everyone we got another call every week so this is the first we've got three more calls over the next weeks same time and uh you'll find the information on telegram links and in the emails do make sure you join you know how amazing this was being all together at the same time here experiencing this amazing activation so do that make sure you join the telegram group and the whatsapp if you need the the announcements through whatsapp telegram has chat feature as well And then we also have the resources document. You can find those all of those in the in the chats, in the announcements groups. We're also going to take a poll tomorrow and we're going to find out what what everybody collectively wants to work on for the next call. As you know, Regan loves to work in the present moment with the energy that's there. So we're going to send a poll out probably tomorrow and just give a bit of space for tonight and then and then we can decide together what we want for next week. So thanks, everyone. Thank you, Regan, so much for your time and energy and everyone else for your time and energy. It's been an amazing, amazing call. And thank you for sharing your gifts. Amazing. Thank you, guys. See you later, everyone. 

====================

PREPARATION 1: Call #2 - Wealth Manifestation

Guys, well, I'm looking at my phone because I have your comments here. So how is everyone? How are you guys doing? Let us know. I've been seeing everyone tuning in from all over the world. It's so nice to see you guys here. How are you feeling going through the quest? Feeling great, super good, blissed and blessed. Doing so well, loving it. Happy to be here. Hello, hello, hello. Amazing. Beautiful guys. So we're going to dive right into the activation today and portal you guys into a really deep immersive experience. So the idea with each of these bonus calls was that you guys got to vote and choose where you wanted to focus. Was it love? Was it relationships? Was it wealth? Was it this? Was it that? And so last week we went really deep into a wealth activation. I believe the Mindvalley team put out the poll for this week and the resounding request was to actually go into another wealth activation, which is very exciting because it means that we get to now go a layer deeper, which is awesome. So if you weren't here on this last call, through this activation, this is a guided experience. It works really well as a closed eye experience. If at any moment you feel to open your eyes and check out what's going on, you're more than welcome to do that. But we just request that you really stay in your intention and stay in your own field through this. So this activation is going to be really powerful. I tuned in before. this call and i tuned into the vortex of all the beautiful people and all of you souls who are going so deep right now in the quest and the beauty of this activation is that it will be repeated nowhere else it's totally unique and channeled for all of you by tapping into where you're at with your soul where you're at with the journey with the quest and this is really an activation to allow acceleration to take place when it comes to everything that you're working on and integrating as you go through the manifestation quest. So from the frame of wealth, what we're going to be looking at today is actually connecting in with a unique spirit guide in order to support you in your wealth manifestation journey. So what most people don't know, because I don't talk about it too much publicly, but I know I can deep dive here with a community like you guys. What most people don't know and realize is that I work with many different guides, many different beings of light in order to support me in my journey and my manifestations. Now, this is a very advanced conversation. This is also a very advanced technique. But once again, I know you guys are ready to dive right into this. And so through this activation. you will actually be able to start building the connection point through to one or multiple guides that are actually divinely assigned to support you when it comes to the manifestation of your intentions, when it comes to wealth, when it comes to money, when it comes to financial abundance. i just invite you firstly to remove any expectations if you're expecting a golden angel to appear it probably won't because often what we are attached to we then close down within our field so i open simply this field allowing you to remain curious allowing you to not have any expectations and simply be in your experience Now, for some of you, you may see a lot. For some of you, you may feel a lot. For some of you, you may just know that you're in it. And then it may be revealed to you with these connection points later in time. I've seen this work all different ways for all different types of people. And it totally depends on where you're at and your own journey and what work you've done on yourself in the past. And there's so many different factors. The one thing I know is that you can't mess it up. If you're having an intention and you're holding that intention to really go deep and to start unlocking these access points. Now, why do we want access to our guides? we're here in this human experience and so many people are trying to do it all themselves they're trying to figure it all out themselves they're trying to create wealth themselves when we have a whole team of so many angels and light beings and beautiful energies that are actually looking to support us now one of the laws of the universe which most people don't realize is that these guides these beings can't come and actually help and support us unless they have permission. So in other words, if we're not asking for their support, if we're not calling them in, if we're not saying we really want to make this connection point right now with you, please help me, please guide me, please support me, then they're watching you and they're like, ah, you're going right, you're meant to go left. They can't jump in and they can't do anything about it. And so this is gonna be a big activator and a big opener for all of you, again, to connect with this one guide that's going to help you and support you. And then you can use this recording to go deeper and deeper and deepen this relationship with this guide and deepen this access point, or even utilize this to deepen this, to working then with multiple different guides to actually support you. So when it comes to the intention, If you like, you can work specifically on the intention that you had in the last activation, that specific amount of wealth and financial abundance, that specific intention that you worked on in the previous week. You can ask to connect with the guide associated to that intention or. you cannot do that and you can simply ask that you just are open and available to connect with the most appropriate guide in order to support you in the manifestation of wealth in whatever way that looks like for you in your life okay so are there any core logistical questions before we get started or just give me a yes if you guys are ready to dive in and if you're excited to to jump into this thank you so much again as well everyone for your patience and actually rescheduling this session this time last week i had absolutely no voice whatsoever which is not so useful when you're meant to be guiding an activation and using sound frequencies and healing technologies through your voice and your voice goes so i really thank you for your your patience on that yes amazing excited and ready looking forward to trying this glad you're feeling well thank you Yes, you can sit or lie down wherever it is comfortable for you. As long as you just don't have any distractions going on in the space, that is absolutely perfect. All right, guys. So take a moment to simply clear your space of any distractions, maybe turn off any other technology, shut the door, whatever you need to do, have a sip of water, make sure you are comfy. And don't worry so much if you feel a little confused in the process, because I'm going to guide you through everything step by step. Yes, you can have an intention to connect with a guide to just generally support you in wealth manifestation, or you can connect with a guide to support you with a specific wealth intention. Either way is absolutely perfect. Okay. Amazing. Okay. Perfect family. So take a moment right now to gently close your eyes, dropping inwards, allowing yourself to be present firstly to your breath. As you allow yourself to gently breathe in and out. Breathing in deep into your belly, through your nose. And out. Breathing in. That's right. As you allow yourself to surrender even deeper right now into your divine intention, your intention to open and solidify a unique access point to one of your guides who is assigned to support you specifically with your wealth intentions. That's right. And as you gently allow yourself to lean even deeper into your intention right now, You allow yourself to gently allow a red laser beam to shoot down from your tailbone, anchoring you, grounding you, and solidifying you into the crystalline core of the earth. And simultaneously allowing a golden laser beam of light to shoot up through your crown, connecting you right now to your unique soul star, allowing you to be guided, grounded, present, protected, and supported, heaven on earth embodied, right here, right now. That's right. And from this place, you surround yourself with a ball of gold and white light and simply decree and declare that any energies frequencies or vibrations that are not yours and not of the highest drop dissolve shift and clearer alchemizing out of your system and out of your field right here right now beautiful and from this place of openness and receptivity you allow yourself once again to lean into your divine intention Gently opening the field of your heart as you allow yourself to be open and available to ground and solidify into the access point, the connection point of the divine guide that is looking to connect with you today, right here, right now, in order to support you in the acceleration of your divine wealth intention. Beautiful. And from this place of openness and receptivity, allow yourself right now to gently tune into anything you feel that may be blocking you, stopping you, slowing you down or holding you back from connecting with this unique guide today. You may be aware of certain thought patterns or programs, stories you have told yourself. Maybe you've told yourself a story that this is not possible. or you're not spiritual or connected enough. Maybe you've told yourself a story that some people have access to their guides and some people do not. Whatever those mental programs and stories are, simply associate them firstly as stories and programs. They are not you, they are programs running through your system right here, right now. And from this place of awareness, you can gently allow any of those old outdated programs to drop, dissolve, shift and clear and alchemize. out of your system right here, right now, clearing out any old conscious and unconscious programs sitting underneath the surface, including the ones that you may not even be aware of right now, allowing all of that to draw up out of the mental body with ease, with grace and with flow. And from this place of awareness, you allow yourself to tune into anything else that may be blocking you, stopping you, slowing you down or holding you back from this deeper connection and access point right now. Maybe there are fears underneath the surface, layers of self -doubt, self -sabotage patterns, old stuck emotions, frequencies stuck within your body and your system. Allowing all of that to come to the surface right now as it drops, shifts, dissolves and clears. Alchemizing and transmuting right now, out of your field and out of your system, working at a deeper unconscious layer, bringing anything to the surface right now that you may not even consciously be aware of. and allowing all of that to shift drop dissolve and clear alchemizing your system right now bringing its field back back to its natural state of purity opening up and creating even more space right now as all of these unconscious and conscious blocks and limitations dissolve away beautiful we decree and declare that this clearing and shifting and upgrading process continues 24 hours a day seven days a week until it's fully actualized integrated embodied stabilized and complete and as the clearing protocol continues to work through your field and through your system go ahead and gently notice how much more space is available within your system right here right now notice how much more open and receptive you are now that all of that has been shifted and cleared beautiful from this place of openness and receptivity allow yourself right now to gently bring out one of your hands in front of you. It can be your right hand or your left hand. Whatever hand feels good and aligned and appropriate. And as you have this hand resting gently beside you or on your knee or wherever feels comfy, gently open with the palm of your hand facing upwards, open and available. We now work through the energy vortexes of the hand. completely open up these chakra points allowing them to gently open right now running at full capacity and full openness beautiful and from this place of openness and receptivity holding your energy and your intention through the vortex in the field of your open and receptive hand right now we go ahead and gently invite a being of light divinely assigned to supporting you in the most highest and good way with your divine wealth intention we invite this being of light into the space right now as we gently allow them to enter into the space that you are in right now coming closer and closer into your field you may see this being you may feel it you may just simply know it is there and this process is taking place either way is absolutely perfect that's right and from this place of openness and awareness knowing that this being of the highest good divinely assigned to you is here to help you and support you in the full and complete embodiment of your divine wealth intention working through the field of your hands right now go ahead and gently invite this being to gently make contact with your hand you may feel this contact point you may see it you may hear it you may just simply know The contact has now been made. Either way is perfect. That's right. And as you gently connect in and tune into this contact point through your hand that has now been made, go ahead and gently allow yourself to simply notice what you see right now with no attachment or expectation. Maybe you are seeing a certain color. Maybe you're seeing a shape or a symbol. Maybe you're seeing the being itself in some form. Maybe you're seeing sparks of light.

Expanding your sensory field right now, allowing yourself to be aware of and process even more information as you tune into your unique multidimensional senses, as you allow yourself to simply ask yourself one more time, what else do I sense right now? What feelings, emotions, states of being, layers of my intuition are present to me right here, right now, as you allow yourself to sense this guide at an even deeper level? Beautiful, and as you allow yourself to now draw. even deeper and deeper into this connection point with so much love and with so much gratitude for all of the information right now that you are accessing and receiving even if it doesn't make sense in the logical mind you allow yourself to surrender even deeper and deeper into the state of connection with this beautiful divine being of light showing up fully in service to you right now in order to support you in the deeper embodiment of your divine intention and the manifestation of wealth in your 3d physical reality from this space allow yourself to gently zoom out so you're zooming away from this guide a little bit observing yourself now observing the guide you may even see yourself looking at and connecting to this guide but you've jumped out of your body and out of your system right now so you're observing yourself right now observing this guide and go ahead and gently notice from this perspective from the awareness from the observer go ahead and notice what else do you notice right now what do you notice about this relationship this connection point what do you notice that's going on that is important for you to realize right here right now as you witness yourself connecting right now to this divine being of light maybe you have an even better viewpoint and even better sensory access from this place right now from this observer point from this god -like or universe -like awareness allow yourself to gently notice what you notice right here right now as you continue to witness yourself observing yourself connecting with this beautiful divine being of light and beautiful and as you ground and solidify into this awareness right now allow yourself to now gently pop into your own body so now once again you're connecting with this beautiful guide this being of light of the highest vibration divinely assigned to supporting you in the full and complete embodiment of your divine wealth and intention and from this place of deep gratitude love and connection go ahead and now gently interact with this guide remembering that you are able to ask them anything that you desire And how we love to do this in a simple way is to gather one question at a time and gather that up within yourself as a little ball of golden light. And when you have your questions solidified into a little ball of golden light, allow yourself to solidify that right now and then simply go ahead and send it to your guide. That's it. Your guide has instantaneously received your divine intention encoded within this ball of light. It is now working on that question across time and space. And now gently allow the answer to come back to you encoded within another golden ball of light, coming back into your consciousness, back into your system right here, right now. That's right. Now you may be aware of the guidance. You may receive a direct answer to your question. The answer may come in unexpected ways. Maybe you receive a color or a feeling, a symbol, a sound. Maybe it doesn't make sense right now. Maybe it makes perfect sense. Either way is absolutely perfect as you allow yourself to remember that also sometimes the answers to our questions when we work with our guides are revealed to us in alignment with divine timing, meaning that We receive that answer maybe later in the day, maybe later in the week even. Sometimes we receive it by looking into someone else's eyes and then we know the answer. Sometimes we receive it driving down the road and we see a sign and then we know the answer. Sometimes we receive it the next day in our own meditation where it pops into our consciousness. Or sometimes we receive it right here, right now. Either way is absolutely perfect. Let's go ahead and practice this one more time. Gather up one more question. This may be a question within your own life, a question around wealth manifestation, maybe a question directly to your guide, like what is your name? Where are you from? What dimension do you reside in? How did you find me? Maybe it's something more specific to you and your life and your journey. Maybe it's a question around money that you're working on. Whatever it is for you, just gather that up within your unconsciousness right now. Allow yourself to surround it with a ball of golden white light. And then just like playing a little ball game, you know what to do. Go ahead and now send this ball out to your guide. That's it. With no expectation or attachment of when it comes back or how it comes back. This guide is always working across time and space. Working in with your soul monad. Working in with other beings of light supporting you through other realms, realities and dimensions. And as all of that gathers and completes its information cycle right now, your guide now sends back the answer to you encoded with another ball of golden white light coming back into your system now. Allowing yourself to receive the answer and this information now. Beautiful and with so much love and with so much gratitude for this connection point. You allow yourself to gently remember that this guide is only one thought away. Go ahead and allow yourself to right now to tune into your access point as to how you would love to invoke this guide in the future. Maybe it is their name that you received. Maybe it's what they visually look like and you draw up an image of that guide in your consciousness. Maybe it's a certain color or a symbol or a feeling. However it is for you is absolutely perfect, but go ahead and solidify that connection point right now. What will that access point now look like for you? That's it. Bring that access point up now so it's resting gently between you and your guide so that there's clear communication that this is the access point, the name, the color, the symbol, the feeling, the invocation, however it is for you. Just bring that into your awareness, allowing your guide to witness and receive that right now and allowing yourself to remember that. As you allow yourself to again remember that this guide is one thought away. You do not need a huge meditation for hours and hours to connect with this guide. You can be driving down the road and invoke this guide. You can be in a business meeting and invoke this guide. You can be working out at the gym and invoke this guide. One thought away. This guide is here to help and support you, guide you. But remember... They can only come and help and support if they are called upon, if they have your deep permission and your clear request to support you, to help you and to guide you. That's right. And as you allow yourself to just draw up into your heart center with so much love and so much gratitude, from this place of awareness, go ahead and gently thank this guide. Beautiful being of light of the highest vibration divinely assigned to supporting you in the full and complete embodiment of your divine wealth and tension. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you for showing up. Thank you for being present in this process right here, right now. Thank you for all of your help and support and guidance. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. I am here. I am open. I am available. Thank you. As this guide now gently dissolves away out of this activation, knowing that the access point is still there and still solidified, available to you at any time, bringing all your energy and your consciousness now back into your own field and your own system, allowing all of these shifts and upgrades and layers of deep transformation and remembrance to ground and grow roots and solidify within your system right here, right now.

Thank you for being here. Thank you for saying yes. Thank you for being bold enough and brave enough and humble enough to go into an activation like this and ask for help and ask for support. And maybe go outside of your everyday reality or outside of the constraints of the mind to open up and be available to something new. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. I see you. I love you. I honor you and I respect you. And my prayer for you today is that you see yourself. You love yourself. You honor yourself and you respect yourself deeply. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Beautiful. As you allow all of these shifts, upgrades, and layers of deep transformation to root and ground and stabilize within your system right now. Allowing yourself to gently breathe into the center of your heart with so much love and so much gratitude. Manifestation. Manifestation. Station. i decree and declare that all of these shifts upgrades and layers of deep transformation and remembrance continue 24 hours a day seven days a week until they are fully stabilized actualized integrated embodied and complete and may this take place with total ease total grace and total flow as all of us remember that our guides and our access points are always one thought away rooting, grounding, stabilizing all of this beautiful divine energy through our hearts, through our gratitude, through our system right here, right now. As you allow yourself to now come back into awareness, being present to your breath, being present to your body, you have a body. As you gently allow yourself to gently open your eyes, coming back into this vortex, feeling alive and awake and energized, integrating all of these beautiful pieces with so much love and so much gratitude. And so it is. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you, family. And when you are back into the space, let's just go ahead and type through how that was, how you were feeling. I believe we have some time for some questions. So I'm going to come and jump a little bit closer to the computer screen and catch your comments in a minute. All right, family. Just type a yes if you can hear me. from this computer, from this side of the room. Okay, amazing. All right, Steve, well, I'll hand back over to you for now. Looks like everyone's doing pretty good from these comments. It looks good to me for sure. Thank you so much, Regan, for that amazing experience. Super unique. And yeah, we have some questions. We have some questions from the Q &A section, so I'll go through some of those. if anyone wants to you can check out the q a section upvote because i'll go through them one by one for now um but there's not so many upvotes at the moment so you can you can do that now so should we get started uh first question i read here is please can you repeat how do we put in aligned action once we surrender to the how Oh, yes. So with manifestation, once you surrender to the how, you want to make sure the action that you are taking in your life and in your reality is aligned to your manifestation showing up even faster and faster and faster. So what I mean by that is we're not taking action blindly from a place of what do I do? How do I make this happen? Right. That actually undoes all of our manifestation work. We need to be coming from a frequency of knowing that it's already done. because you've done all of the manifestation work to know that it's done and to create intentionally your reality in a way where you know that it's done so instead of how do i make it happen that the frequency to embody is okay i know it's done what do i get to do right now in order to accelerate the process and then you sit down and you're like well i'm gonna call this person i'm gonna say yes to this i'm gonna write this list i'm gonna do this right and you do all of that and then from that place you commit to taking that action you go and call the person you do the thing so this means that you're operating from the right frequency and it also means that the action you're taking is aligning you to your vision not misaligning you out of your manifestation yeah wonderful thank you that was from amrin thank you for the question now we have one from tanya how do you double and 10x the feeling of the manifestation of your vision i have a knowingness that it is going to happen but I'm struggling to access the feeling, does not feeling it affect everything? Yeah, really good question. So firstly, no, it doesn't affect everything. It's really important to know that people access manifestations in slightly different ways. And this depends on our soul path. This depends on work that we've done in our life. This depends on so many variables and factors. Okay. This is why in the activation we just went through, I took you through seeing, I took you through hearing, I took you through touch, I took you through sensory systems, like all of that, because I didn't necessarily expect everything single one of you to have a massive breakthrough on each of those. Maybe you did, but for a lot of people, maybe visually they didn't see anything. That's fine. But maybe when it came to the feeling on the hands, they got goosebumps everywhere, right? So we access information because that's all that our senses are. We're processing information. We access this information. in different ways. So maybe if you're feeling like you don't feel it that much and you're like, I'm trying to times it by 10, but I don't feel it. It's okay. Whereas someone else might do that and they might be vibrating with it, but they don't see anything, you know? And so my suggestion is to keep with it, keep going. Don't get in a vibration of, oh, it's not working because then that will create an energy of it's not working and that will slow down your manifestation. But you want to make sure that you do still keep trying and pushing forward. Because ultimately, when humans are fully activated across every layer of their being, they do have access to all of their senses. They do have access to all of their multidimensional senses. They can see and hear and feel and all of it, right? But that takes time, that takes practice, that takes commitment, that takes walking a path and a journey and doing this work and working on the pieces that don't come as naturally to you. I hope that helps. Wonderful. Great answer. Thank you so much. And now we've got one from Sharon. What suggestions would you have for my newer program with a goal to empower over a million kind people to become millionaires and billionaires and philanthropists? Would you be willing to be interviewed for a show? Yeah, yeah. So anything like that, you can just email media at ReganHillier .com and my team will pick it up and they'll chat to you. And if it's in alignment and definitely say you're from the Mindvalley community and wherever I can, I'm super happy to support. And in terms of what to do, I'd just be doing all of this work. You know, I'd be. focusing daily on that vision. I'd be going through the quest. I'd be getting really, really clear on those outcomes. And I'd be doing all of the internal alignment combined with the 20 % of the aligned action on the outside to just every single day drive that vision forward into reality. So you should be able to, all of you should be able to go to sleep at night and go, yeah, I did things internally and externally in order to propel my manifestation forward, right? And if you have a day where that didn't happen, Notice that and notice where you fell off path and then recalibrate back the next day. Lovely. Thank you. And from Lucinda, this one's cool. So I was fascinated when I listened to your latest podcast episode, when you discovered your father was a block to your monthly revenue growth. Can you share with us what exactly you did to remove that block? Yeah, this is a little bit of a long story. So I will summarize it for anyone who didn't hear that story. Basically, I was looking to break through a certain level of money that I was making for a very long time. Nothing was working. And I was in meditation one day and it hit me. Like from my guides directly, like from what we opened up with this access point today, one of my guides came and said, literally, ask your father the largest amount of money he's ever made in a month. And so I was like, okay, so I called my dad. and i'm like i have a random question you know my dad's run a small business his entire life and i asked him this question and the number he told me was the exact number that i was capping out at financially for years and so i was blown away and so i was he's like what i was like don't worry thank you bye hung up the phone and i started asking myself and and i realized i was in an unconscious commitment to keeping my dad safe and happy and i was more committed to that at the time than i was to potentially have him feel not good enough as a man and actually achieve my money goals and so i had to zoom back on that and say well where do my actual commitments lie and and at the end of the day i realized you know my dad is a responsible sovereign being that's responsible for his own feelings and emotions and money and life and that's his journey as much as i love him and i choose actually that if i elevate into these next layers of money i might actually even inspire him into even more abundance and so i chose that so it was really awareness and a conscious choice around this and something you can be doing um all of you is looking at your family and seeing if there are any unconscious ties and commitments um that you've made at some point underneath the surface that is sitting there it's a really good thing to look at wonderful thank you This next one's from Tanya. How can you discern remaining in your sovereignty and not give away your power to any light beings or guides? Yeah, I think this is a great question and it totally comes from within you and where your energy is. And, you know, when you're giving away your power to light beings, guides, humans, family members, anybody, you're in an energy of basically pedestalling someone. Okay. And you can do this also with teachers and mentors and friends, anyone. Right. And so if you have anyone on any sort of pedestal where you're like, wow, they're better than me. You need to remove that pedestal right now, because at some point that pedestal is going to crash away and it's going to ruin your world. You're going to feel terrible about it. Right. And so. Just really check in because you can connect with guides, teachers, mentors, beings of light, family members, friends, everyone from a place of, wow, I honor you. I respect you. What you've done or manifested in life is amazing. Maybe it's like so much more than you manifested, but you're not in a place where you're like, that means you're so much better than me. Instead, you're in a place of going, wow. I'm a human and you're a human or I'm a human and you're a guide. And that's awesome. And we're on an equal plane because at the end of the day, we're all made up of life and frequency and it's just, we're all the same, right? But from this place, there's no energetic pedestal going on. So that's a really good piece to check in all of us on our lives. And I think this is not something that... just do once and then all of a sudden you have no pedestals i'm constantly checking in did i pedestal my partner because i said that oh he's so much better than this than me right did i did i pedestal this teacher that i had because i'm like oh wow they're so amazing i wish i could be like that i'm not like that wow right and we we choose to unhook ourselves from these pedestals it's a great question beautiful thank you and next one from tracy she mentions You said something about attachment to something closing down the field. And she was wondering if you had any ideas on how she could resolve that for herself and shift that limiting belief. What was the question, sorry, on how to close down the field? yeah she said she's got uh something about attachment just to to something so perhaps she has an attachment to closing down the field when she's having this experience and maybe that's the limitation that she's causing right okay got it yes so ask yourself why am i closing it down and what part of me doesn't feel safe to be open what part of me doesn't necessarily feel safe and held and protected in being intimate with my field open. And I wouldn't be surprised if this is happening, say, through this activation and with your guides, if this also happens maybe with friends, maybe with strangers you meet on the street, maybe with an intimate partner, right? Often when we have this program of I'm going to close my field, it's a false sense of I'm going to try and protect myself. But then you need to ask yourself from what? And who's trying to protect? The ego is just trying to protect at the end of the day. The soul is unstable and untouchable. It's pure light. Nothing can impact the soul. The ego is like, oh, I might get hurt. and not feel good right so the minute we can see this and unhook from this we realize that our safety comes within us our protection comes within us our sovereign choices come from within us and from that place i choose to have my field open and connect right now in a safe and intentional way yeah Beautiful. Thank you so much. I think we've got time for maybe just one last question. This one's about divine timing. And Marie's asking, this is what trips me up when I try to attach an end date to my manifestation. What if my manifestation is not meant to happen until a later date? Could you share a little bit about that? Yeah, yeah. I think this trips a lot of people up. the thing is that i love to play with this in a way where we remember that we are conscious intentional manifestors we are creating our reality and what i know for sure is that if we have no intention and if we just say divine timing someday somehow it will happen like way later often than what we want and what we expect so the thing is we want to put that date and hold that date in the manifestation but then we want to remove any attachment to it right because if we're attached to the date our whole system actually goes into contraction and we have all these expectations on it and we block the synchronistic divine timing that's looking to come in divine timing does not always mean that it's going to happen way later divine timing can often mean it's trying to happen way earlier than what we think so we need to be open and available to the magic and This also happens, you know, some people like, oh, you know, I put this intention for a month away and it didn't manifest. And then they get in this energy of like, it's not working. Whereas the divine timing is trying to make it manifest like just after that and even more and even better than what you even thought of. But you can't even see it because you're in an energy of like, oh, it didn't work. I suck at manifestation, right? So we need to make sure that we're playing with this. Remember like, yes, we're intentional manifestors and we're co -creating with the universe. We're co -creating with God. We're co -creating with this divine energy that is constantly coming through with our guides that can see from a higher perspective. Hey, hey, hey, like it's OK. Your mind thinks you want it then. But actually, if you just wait this little longer or if you just allow yourself to have it this little earlier, it's going to be so much better than your mind can even picture or imagine right now. So it's not a black or white answer. It's this beautiful dance of knowing that you're a creator, being intentional and also being totally open to the flow and the magic at the same time. That is an amazing answer. Thank you so much for that perspective. I don't think many of us have heard that put in those words so often. So thank you so much for that. This has been an amazing call, Regan. It's absolutely wonderful journey. Thanks, everybody, for jumping in and diving into all of this. We've got another live call coming up next week. I'm going to do another poll. Find out what you want again for next week. And make sure you, if you haven't done already, check out the Telegram group and check your emails for any links. have the resources in the telegram group as well so thank you Regan if there's anything else you would like to share to finalize this call please feel free Yeah, this is amazing. I just felt everyone went so deep and I'm watching the chat just flood with all of your breakthroughs and just how awesome this was for you. I know all these comments on Zoom go away. So also if you'd like to be witnessed in anything which came up for you, if there was a breakthrough, if you connected with a guide, if you got a message or an aha moment, put it on Facebook or Instagram and tag me and tag Mindvalley, tag Vish and let us know because we love seeing that. We love sharing you. We love actually witnessing you in your unlocks with this manifestation. So yeah, you guys have been amazing. and thank you so much, Steve, as well, for facilitating this. It's been awesome. Amazing. Beautiful. Thank you, everyone. Have a beautiful day, beautiful evening. Thank you, Regan. Ciao, family. Ciao. 

====================

PREPARATION 1: Call #3 - Wealth Manifestation

Thank you so much. So nice to be here with all of you guys and so cool to see these results, people signing up their first one -to -one coaching packages, people manifesting. um so many things which you were typing through here which is super super amazing an unexpected bonus at work very high royalty check from a book i wrote six years ago um amazing and now someone is a first -time home buyer at the age of 60. this is just amazing guys it's really really really cool so before we dive into this activation uh what i would love to do is to just check this sound a little bit um can you guys hear the background track and my voice at a good level just go ahead and type through maybe and let me know yes good okay amazing in that case guys we will we will dive right in um i don't know if you guys need to highlight my video on the end i can't see it highlighted at my end but it may be it may be a setting let's see cool okay amazing all right guys well we're gonna dive in today you guys voted and so here we are doing yet another wealth activation which is really exciting because there's definitely layers that we work through when it comes to activating wealth in our life and specifically financial wealth that we've been tuning into so this activation today It's going to be the same process in the sense that it's closed eye and I will guide you through everything. There's nothing you need to know or do prior or during the process. We're activating what is lying dormant within you. And from this place, we're actually going to go into a specific wealth activation around clearing and releasing specific things which are holding you back. So the thing is, if the financial wealth that you're looking to manifest and call into your life is not here right now, then that simply means that there's things within you which are blocking you or stopping you or slowing you down or holding you back. And you'll be seeing this deeply in the quest as you go through. There's a lot of clearing in there. There's a lot of shifting and a lot of pieces to go into. But the beautiful thing is, is that I believe we should always be doing this clearing work because it's layers. It's layers and layers and layers and layers and layers. So I myself right now in my life. i'm doing these activations i'm doing this clearing work i'm looking at these blocks and limitations which come up even if i've done this in the past because when you unlock a new manifestation and when you start having a higher frequency goal and when you start manifesting at a new level there are actually different blocks and limitations which come up and sometimes it's the same block but it's from a slightly different place or it's it wasn't cleared in a certain way before so now it's coming up to clear so the thing is if there are things in your life where you feel with wealth and with financial abundance okay i have these fears i have this self -doubt i have these self -sabotage patterns i have these limiting thoughts we're going to be going into all of that today by the way the good thing is is that if you're conscious enough to know that and recognize that it means that it's coming up to be cleared Because if you weren't conscious of it, then you wouldn't be ready to clear it. And we're going to go a layer deeper in this activation and actually support your system and going even deeper beyond the conscious mind and what you're even aware of. And we're going to be pulling some of these things that are sitting underneath the surface unconsciously in order to pull this forward into reality. Let me know if you guys are good and ready to rock and roll. Maybe just type through a yes if you're ready to dive straight into the activation. And then, of course, we'll leave some time at the end for some Q &A and some live coaching as well. Yes. Amazing. All right, beautiful Mindvalley family. So in that case, let's get some wealth frequencies going on over here. Beautiful. Alright guys, so make sure you're sitting or lying in a comfortable position. Allowing yourself to gently drop into this space. Allowing yourself to close your eyes, turning inwards right now. Being aware of your breath as you allow yourself to breathe in and out. Breathing in deep into your belly and out. Taking one more deep breath in. and from this place in this space and this frequency of intention of going deep and activating the next layer of the wealth frequency coming through you right here right now leaning deeply into your intention to clear and release anything that's blocking you stopping you slowing you down or holding you back from the full and complete materialization of the wealth that you desire to see in your life allow yourself to gently lean into that intention You may have a specific intention to clear something specific around wealth today. Or maybe you would like to keep it more broad and more general. Either way is absolutely perfect. Good. So from this space and this place and this frequency, as you allow yourself to lean even deeper into your divine intention, we begin to ground into this activation and into this space as you gently allow a red laser beam to shoot down from your tailbone, anchoring you, grounding you, solidifying you into the crystalline core of the earth. That's right. And simultaneously allowing a golden laser beam of light to shoot up through your crown, connecting you right now to your unique soul star. allowing you to be guided grounded present protected and supported heaven on earth embodied right here right now as you gently surround yourself with a ball of golden white light and from this place you decree and declare that any frequencies energies vibrations or emotions that are not yours and not at the highest in your system and in your field drop dissolve shift and clear alchemizing out of your system right here, right now, as you allow your field to return back to its natural state of purity, its natural state of abundance, its natural state of wealth. That's right. Beautiful, and from this place of openness and receptivity. We take this moment to invoke our guides, beings of light, of the highest vibration, divinely assigned to supporting you in this process, in this mission, in this embodiment of the next layer of your wealth frequency. That's right. We welcome you into this space, seen or unseen, known or unknown, but divinely assigned to supporting you in the full and complete embodiment of the highest frequency of wealth. Welcome, welcome, welcome. We're here, we're open, we're available. Please guide us. please support us thank you thank you thank you thank you beautiful and from this place Go ahead and gently allow yourself to notice right now that you are sitting in a circle. And as you connect with this circle, beautiful beings around you in this circle right here, right now, you notice that this is the whole Mindvalley tribe going through this quest, going through this activation, live on the transmission and also through the recording across time and space. That's right. as we allow ourselves to gently feel the vortex of the group right here right now thousands and thousands of beautiful souls that have said yes to coming in and waking up and activating and embodying a higher frequency of manifestation a higher frequency of wealth right here right now that's right you may feel the pulsation of the energy within the group you may feel the energy on your left from the person next to you You may feel the pulsation of the energy on the right from the person on your other side. You may just simply know you are here in this energetic circle. Either way is absolutely perfect. That's right. And as you connect right now to the very center of the circle, you notice there is a huge crystal in the middle of this circle. And as you connect to this crystal right here, right now, you notice that this crystal is actually recording all of the upgrade shifts and transformations taking place right now through you. and through the vortex of this tribe gathered here today across time and space right here, right now. And as you connect even deeper with this crystal in the middle of the circle, you allow yourself to notice this crystal is also supporting you in shifting, alchemizing, transmuting, and clearing anything within you and anything within the group vortex that is blocking you, stopping you, slowing you down, or holding you back from the full and complete embodiment of divine wealth right here, right now. That's it. As you allow yourself to gently connect through a golden laser beam of light from the center of your heart all the way into the center of the crystal, the center of the circle right here, right now. And from this place, you allow yourself to build this connection point. That's it. And now go ahead through this golden laser beam of light and simply send the highest frequency of wealth that you have access to right here, right now, into the very center of the crystal. Through this golden laser beam. That's right. You may notice how the crystal charges up, lights up, and stabilizes the higher frequencies through the entire group right here, right now. Shifting, alchemizing, and transforming. the information recorded in this crystal this crystal will now send you back a frequency maybe a frequency that you did not have access to before when it comes to embodying wealth of the highest frequency frequency is charged up from other members other people other souls within this circle within this tribe within this vortex within this group right here right now as you allow yourself to gently receive this frequency through the golden laser beam of light from the center of the crystal right into the center of your heart now beautiful and then as you bring your focus your attention your intention and your awareness back from the group vortex of the circle bringing it back into your own energy your own field your own space allowing yourself to surrender even deeper and deeper into your divine intention right here right now from this place you allow yourself to feel into the frequency of what it would feel like To have already received and manifested the wealth that you desire in your life in whatever way that looks like for you. That's right. Tune into that frequency right now. And as you begin to access the vibrational frequency of have already received the wealth that you desire, you're living into it. You're breathing it through your own lungs. You're seeing your life and your reality through your own eyes right here, right now. You allow yourself to gently go ahead and double that frequency. Let it rush through every single cell of your being. And now go ahead and triple that frequency, that vibration, that emotion, that state. Let it vibrate with every single cell as you gently allow yourself to remember. This is my natural state. This is my truest essence. Beautiful and activating that deep layer of remembrance. through every single cell of your being. You allow yourself to now gently take a moment to anything that may be blocking you, stopping you, slowing you down or holding you back from the full and complete embodiment of wealth, the highest frequency in your life, right here, right now. There may be certain blocks and limitations that you are aware of, patterns of information, behaviors that you've embodied, stories you've told yourself. There may also be some things sitting underneath the surface right now, unconsciously through your unconscious mind, also through your energetic field that you may not be present to. I invite you right now to hold also an intention to shift, clear, alchemize and release anything that you are not aware of consciously, which has been blocking you, stopping you, slowing you down or holding you back from the full and complete embodiment of wealth in whatever way that looks like for you in your life right here, right now. and as you gently tune even deeper into the space within you you allow yourself to firstly be present to any vibrations of scarcity that have been running through your system running through your body running through your mind running through your emotional body or through your energetic body any stories when it comes to wealth finances or abundance where you have told yourself that there is not enough you are not enough And from this place of awareness, you allow your systems to simply notice that this is simply a pattern, a program, and a frequency. Your system can operate in a frequency of scarcity or a frequency of abundance, but it cannot. do both. Your system can operate in a frequency of contraction or a frequency of expansion, but it cannot be in both. And so the question is, what do you now choose? And assuming that you choose to shift and recalibrate and alchemize and realign your system into a higher frequency of stabilized abundance, then we must also choose right here, right now to shift, clear, alchemize, transmute. Any old scarcity patterns that have been running through our field And running through our system right here, right now. Choosing to let this go is easy. It's a choice. And so as you tune into every single layer of your being, you allow yourself right now. to decree and declare that any vibrations of scarcity that are not in full and complete alignment with your embodiment of the highest frequency of wealth and abundance in your life right here right now drop shift dissolve clear shifting alchemizing transmuting allowing all of these old vibrations and stuck frequencies and all codes and layers of emotion to shift clear dissolve and alchemize through your field right here right now as these old patterns of information drop dissolve shift and clear and alchemize out of your system you may feel them vibrating and dropping out of your field and out of your body you may simply know that the clearing is taking place either way is absolutely perfect as you allow yourself to surrender into even deeper layers of clearing right now allowing yourself to drop dissolve shift and clear any old scarcity patterns frequency states of emotions and associated stories and mental programs that have been synced and linked through your system. Allowing all of that to drop, dissolve, shift and clear and alchemize right now. As you allow your system to open up and create even more space right now to hold a divine frequency of wealth. Now that all of this information is not clogging your system right here, right now. Beautiful. And as the clearing of those old patterns continue to gently take place. You allow yourself right now to now tune into your mental body. And as you gently tune into your mental body, you may be present to and notice certain stories that you have told yourself, maybe for a considerably long time. When it comes to wealth, when it comes to financial abundance, there may be certain limiting beliefs, old mental programs and patternings, stories from your past. That's right. And so from this place, allow your system right now to gently gather up all of the information within your mental body. You may feel all of these thoughts and old programs accumulating within your brain center right here, right now. You may just simply know that all of this information is gathering and taking place and forming a dense, dark, heavy ball in the very center of your mind right here, right now. either way is absolutely perfect and so we decree and declare and simply request that all conscious and unconscious information patterns programming through the mental body that is no longer in alignment no longer useful nothing more to learn we accumulate all of this right here right now and allow it to accumulate into this dense dark heavy ball that is forming within the brain center right here right now as we gather up the last of that unconscious information and from this place go ahead and simply request that this ball filled with all of these mental blocks and limitations now drop dissolves shifts and clears dropping out of your system right now until it's hovering just above you and just before you you may see it you may feel it you may just simply know it has now left your four body system either way is absolutely perfect that's it and from this place we call on one of your guides this could be a specific guide that you work with or simply request the most appropriate guide to now come forward and gather up all of this information within this dense dark heavy ball and simply request that they now dispose of this ball you may see it disappear into the universe you may feel it implode into a million pieces before you may just know it is gently dissolving either way is perfect as you allow yourself to simply notice that all of these mental blocks and limitations have now left your system All of them at the end of the day were just frequency light and information. And we remember that energy cannot be created or destroyed, but it can simply be transformed into something more useful as you alchemized this with the help of your guides into pure light as it returns back to the universe right here, right now. Beautiful as you gently allow yourself to notice how much more space has now been created through your mental body. Maybe your mind feels clearer. calmer, or maybe you simply notice a different frequency running through your system. Whatever is coming up for you is absolutely perfect as you continue to trust the process of alchemizing, shifting and clearing anything which is holding you back, slowing you down, keeping you blocked from the full and complete embodiment of wealth of the highest frequency. That's right. And as you allow yourself to now tune into a layer deeper, You gently begin to remember that as we do this work through the science and the process of epigenetics, we are shifting and alchemizing at a deep cellular level, at a DNA level, and at an energetic level. And we are affecting our family system, our family tree, seven generations forward and seven generations back. proven through science through the process of epigenetics and you allow yourself to remember gently that you have access to all of the information seven generations forward and seven generations back you may be present right now to the certain blocks and limitations that have been running within your field and within your system when it comes to wealth that are not yours maybe you've caught yourself thinking gosh this is my mom wow my dad was just like that wow my granddad used to say that to me and knowing that as we do this deep clearing and alchemizing work through our family system we are also impacting all of the generations after us all the generations that are also to come and from this place go ahead and allow yourself to gently tune into anything that has been blocking you stopping you slowing you down or holding you back when it comes to specific blocks around wealth through your family system you may be present to these or you may simply hold an intention that you are clearing anything right now that you are not even aware of tuning into those blocks and those limitations right here right now And with your breath, gently allow yourself, every time you breathe out, to breathe out all of those blocks, all of those limitations. Shifting, alchemizing, transmuting, clearing, opening up more space. Seven generations forward, seven generations back. those who came before us i heard that if we heal ourselves we heal those who came before us i heard that if we heal ourselves who came before us i heard that if we heal ourselves heal those who came before us seven generations fall and seven generations back seven generations fall and seven generations back because i heard that if we heal ourselves who came before us i heard that if we heal You may notice claring, shifting, alchemizing, transforming. of your family lineage before you right here, right now. You may see it, you may feel it, you may just simply not. It is taking place. Either way is absolutely perfect. And from this place, go ahead and gently tune into anything else within your family system right now that is present to you or sitting within your unconscious system that is coming up right now to shift, clear, and alchemize, allowing yourself to create even more space through your ancestral family system right here, right now. That's it. Beautiful, as you notice, how much more space right now. is available to you through your family system. Again, maybe you are aware of certain blocks and limitations that have been clearing. Maybe you simply just know the process is taking place. Either way is perfect. That's right. And from this place of openness and awareness, go ahead and gently tune in to any fears and other blocked and stuck emotions. that have been blocking you, slowing you down, or holding you back from the full and complete embodiment of divine wealth right here, right now. That's it. And as you allow yourself to be present with these fears, with these stuck emotions, this time you allow all of this information to gather within your solar plexus, just above your stomach, just below your ribcage, right in the center. That's it. As all of this information gathers within this vortex right here, right now, We decree and declare that any unconscious information that you're not even aware of that has been keeping the emotional body clogged and not allowing it to be in full expansion and in full and complete coherence with abundance right here, right now, allowing all of this information to come in and accumulate, forming once again a dense, dark, heavy ball within your solar plexus right now, gathering up the last of that information, allowing all of that to come. into this dense, dark, heavy ball, gathering all of that emotional material right here, right now. That's right. And now from this place, go ahead and request that this ball now leaves your body. Dropping it out of your four -body system right here, right now, as you gently notice that this ball is now hovering in front of you. You may see it. You may hear it. You may feel it. You may just simply know it is hovering right here, right now, just in front of you. That's it. As you gently allow this ball to shift, transmute, and alchemize. As it recalibrates its cellular and geometric structure, breaking up all of these old patterns, shifting the energy and the frequency of these old emotions, allowing these old patterns to shift and transform and alchemize before your very consciousness right here, right now. Go ahead and make this ball larger. That's it. and now change the density of it make it lighter and lighter and lighter and now go ahead and request that it begins to spin and now spin it faster and faster and faster and faster and faster and faster until it becomes a blur of gold and white light before your very consciousness right here right now that's right and now from this place go ahead and request that this ball now implodes into the universe shifting transmuting alchemizing This ball that was once filled with all of the emotional material blocking you, stopping you, slowing you down and holding you back from the full and complete embodiment of divine wealth has shifted, transmuted and alchemized it, recalibrated itself right now, changed its geometric structure into a return of pure light into the universe. Beautiful. And now from this place, go ahead and gently tune into your solar plexus one more time. That same spot in your body, you can even put your hands there. And if you are really present, you may feel a slight heartbeat. You may feel a slight opening. You may just simply notice that this part of your system feels somewhat different now that even more space has been created. Even more space to hold the energies and the vibrations and the frequencies of divine wealth in whatever way that looks like for you right here, right now. That's it. As you gently allow your solar plexus, this vortex within you right now, to gently fill and recalibrate with light of the highest frequency. Beautiful. As you take this opportunity right now to simply ground into any other blocks or limitations that you may be present to that are also coming up within your system looking to clear. Maybe there are specific self -sabotage patterns. Maybe there's a piece of your inner child that hasn't quite felt enough. Maybe there are other stuck frequencies within your body, mind or system. Or maybe through the next layer of this process, you allow yourself to just hold an intention that anything unconscious also comes up to clear. As you allow yourself right now to gently tune into whatever it is that you are looking to clear in this final layer, holding that intention right now. That all of the frequencies and all of the patterns of information associated with these blocks and these limitations begin to come to the surface, allowing them to shift, alchemize, and transmute out of your system right here, right now. Beautiful. And then from this place of divine awareness and so much gratitude, you allow yourself to gently be present to how much more space is available within your system right here, right now, after all of this deep clearing. alchemizing and transmuting and from this place of openness gratitude love and deep awareness you gently allow yourself to be present through the space that is being created through these deep layers of clearing alchemizing shifting and transmuting you allow yourself right now to gently be present to the divine frequency of wealth that is now coding through your system now that You are so much more available now that more space has been created. You may feel this frequency coming through your system. You may feel it vibrating through every single cell of your being. You may hear it. You may see it. Or you may just simply know right now that you are being coded with the divine frequency of wealth from your divine guidance in whatever way that looks and feels like for you right here, right now. as you allow yourself to gently surrender to that frequency and simply notice what comes up for you when you allow yourself to be the vessel to fully and completely embody the highest frequency of divine wealth that is coming through you right here right now allow yourself to gently notice what you notice i am divine wealth i am divine wealth i am divine wealth I am the healer, the shaman, the alchemist that I've been looking for. I am the healer, the shaman, and the alchemist that I've been looking for. I am the healer, the shaman, and the alchemist that I have been looking for. I easily and effortlessly continue to... clear my limitations. I easily and effortlessly continue to clear my limitations. I easily and effortlessly continue to clear my limitations. I surrender to divine wealth. I surrender to divine wealth. I surrender to divine wealth. I am wealth. Beautiful. And from this place of openness, of receptivity, from the center of your heart, from the frequency of divine remembrance, of the truest essence of who you are. Go ahead and allow all of these shifts and upgrades and layers of transformation to ground, alchemize, and stabilize within your system right here, right now, just like an old tree grows roots, root all of this into your consciousness. And take a moment, once again, circled up with this beautiful tribe, this beautiful group to thank. every being in this mind valley tribe going through this quest every being across time and space live with you right now through the portal of the recording go ahead and thank every single being for being here for doing this work for holding you and for witnessing you in the full and complete upgrade that you have just gone through that's right And take a moment to thank your guides, beings of light, of the highest vibration, divinely assigned to supporting you in the full and complete embodiment of divine wealth. Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you. We're here, we're open, we're available. We remember that you are always one thought away. Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you. And take a moment to thank yourself, beautiful being of light that you are. Allow yourself to honor yourself and truly love and respect and see yourself for doing this beautiful, deep work. for having this deep commitment to show up as the most powerful version of you each and every single day thank you thank you thank you thank you as all of these shifts and upgrades and deep layers of transformation root ground stabilize within your system right here right now we decree and declare that all of these upgrades layers of deep healing shifts and alchemy and layers of transformation and deep remembrance continue 24 hours a day seven days a week until they are fully stabilized actualized integrated embodied and complete And may this take place with total ease, total grace, and total flow as we all remember who we are. I am divine wealth. I am divine wealth. I am divine wealth. And so it is. As you take a moment right here, right now, to simply be present for where you're at, for whatever is coming up for you, knowing that your process is always perfect. always divinely designed and exactly as it is meant to be. As you allow yourself to take a deep inhale in and a grounding breath out, bringing your full and complete consciousness back into your body, back into this system right here, right now. As you gently wiggle your toes and wiggle your fingers, allowing yourself to gently open your eyes as you come back into this space, this place. This beautiful portal of magic that we have together. And as you start grounding in, it would be beautiful if you want to just type through one word that you are present to right here, right now. One word that's coming up for you. One word that's in your consciousness and in your awareness. Gracias. Abundance. Thank you. Love expansion. Healing grace. Powerful breath. jewel open love healed thank you thank you thank you gratitude blessings expansion bliss love joy peace amor love and gratitude light connection abundance sovereign open eyes awake hi i see you guys good work i'm going to hand back over to steve i'm going to switch my microphone and come and hang out with you guys for some q a and live coaching nice work everybody wow Thank you, Regan. Thank you, everyone. It's really an amazing thing to do these experiences collectively. And I certainly felt the energy of the room. And I see a lot of the comments also mentioned that. And I think it just makes it so powerful to be here live. I just loved watching this chat just flowing just now. It looked amazing. I actually just filmed the chat going crazy just for a few seconds. So I'm going to send that to you, Regan, later. Lots of thank yous, lots of joys and absolutely amazing. So whenever you're ready, did you want to share anything before we jump into the Q &A, Regan, or should we just do that? I think we can jump right in. Just remember, guys, really look after yourself. It's a very deep clearing protocol and process we went through. So just really trust yourself on needing more water or needing rest or needing space or whatever your process is after this. Yeah, just really listen to yourself. But yeah, we can dive into the Q &A for sure. Wonderful. So just a reminder for everybody, we have the Q &A section and you can upvote for your favorite questions. So first of all, I'm going to start with the top ones. But in the meantime, you can upvote for any others. Excuse me. So the first one comes from Tillman. Not anymore, but I'm going to start there. Is there really free will in terms of choosing what we should manifest or should we perhaps manifest that what our soul is aligned with? Beautiful. Well, this is a really great question. We could probably discuss this for about nine hours. But to give you a high level summary, I think and I believe personally that when we are truly connecting with free will, that is the power of our soul. So for me, that is not a separate conversation. There is the mind and what the ego thinks that they want. manifest and then there is the free will of the soul and there's the power of the soul and there's the intention of the soul and there's the magic of the soul and the alignment of the soul and i believe as sovereign powerful human beings in this 3d physical experience when we choose to be free to listen to our soul that's when true free will activates so i hope that helps you to me they're not separate and the answer is tune into your soul listen to your soul ask your soul every single day what does it desire how does my soul want to be expressed right now how does my soul desire to manifest oh this is manifestation i've been dreaming of is this from my mind or is this really soul aligned for me that's an unlock to true free will yeah beautiful thank you Evie, we have a question. It's quite a long one, so I'll try and break it down. Evie's asking about, do you have any specific tool that you could share for when you get triggered by limiting beliefs besides deep breathing, grounding, bring ourselves to the present moment? Yeah, take it away. Yeah, absolutely. So this is a big one and lots of different ways and techniques work differently for people. This is my go -to and this is what I really feel works super, super, super well. Firstly, if you have the capacity to catch a limiting belief and know that it's there, you are 90 % there to actually clearing it. The most challenging thing with limiting beliefs is when people don't know they have limiting beliefs and they're saying, well, this is just true. And then maybe I'm there and I'm like, well, that's not true. That's a belief that you've chosen to take on. So if you can see it and you go, wow, I have a belief, for example, that making X amount of money is hard. And maybe you're like, I feel that's so true. And it's like a really deeply ingrained belief. This is what I love to do. You recognize it as a program. And then you realize you get to rewrite the program. You get to run a new software within your system. So practically what I would do is I would sit down, I would write it in my journal. I'd be like, okay. I believe that making money, making X amount of money is hard. And then you look at it and you consciously choose. Do I now choose that this is going to be my reality? Is this what I want to believe? And if the answer is no, then you're at a choice point. And then if not that, then what? So this is when I then reprogram it. So I would write down, okay, making X amount of money is easy. Making X amount of money is simple to me. Making X amount of money is my birthright. Making X amount of money naturally manifests and flows into my life. The more I make X amount of money, the easier it gets. The easier it gets, the more I make X amount of money. And I just keep going. And I write like literally at least 20 empowering belief systems for my software program to run off that then naturally override this existing program. Now, let me say also, you might do this once and go, okay, well, that's all well and good, but... I still feel like it's hard. The old belief feels like it's still there. Guys, this takes practice. This is conditioning. You don't go to the gym once and then expect your entire physical body to change. You go every day and you work out or every once a week or whatever you do. You do 10X for 10 minutes, whatever. But there's a process, right? There's an actual system you follow and it's repetition and you keep going. So you wouldn't sit down right now and be like, I choose to believe the sky is blue. The sky is blue. The sky is blue. You'd be like. the sky is blue and i promise you you'll hit a point where you're like making that money is easy it will have the same frequency to it but you must first actually rewrite the system and stay committed to that and you do that until you feel like you just don't need to do it anymore because it's your reality yeah wonderful thank you um i hope that's helpful for you to take that tool away right tillman um he's the winner of the all the questions today so dear regan You say it's 80 % mindset and 20 % actions. How do you measure whether my actions are indeed 20 %? Are we talking about a number of hours? Yeah, I would say this. You know, this is a great question. And I would say it's probably generalized a little bit, right? Because how can we measure exactly? Like, today I was 23%, like, right? So you want to look at your life overall and you want to see like where the energy is flowing. right so if the amount of energy is 80 internal then the the 20 should be the pieces on the outside so the easiest way to do this is just to notice if you have it flipped right if you're like 80 working really hard doing all these things all this time all this energy figuring out what do i do every day and then you're like got to go meditate for 15 minutes you see like everything's completely out of whack now i'm not suggesting either this is not necessarily relating to time so i'm not suggesting that you spend if you have eight hours in a day where you're doing things i'm not suggesting that you spend 80 of those hours meditating and doing activations and things like that and then you'd like work for one hour i'm not suggesting that right so it's not necessarily linked by time it's the energy behind it but here's the magic trick right You can be doing things throughout your day and still be working on the 80%. I can be running this activation for you. And whilst I'm there, clearing out your ancestral line i can be present that like whoa there's like a money thing from my mother coming up right now so i'm here i'm doing my work i'm in service i'm doing action i'm in 20 but i'm also doing my 80 i'm also very aware at the same time okay i have this limit okay i'm clearing this at the same time as the tribe as the group you can be in a business meeting you can be on zoom and someone might say something and you feel triggered by it and you're touched by it now you can either go okay let me deal with that later or in the moment you can have a conversation and clear that limiting trigger that came up within you that's a fusion of doing your action but also doing the 80 so The challenge is to not think of these as separate things, which is what most people do. And if it helps having them separate in the beginning, that's okay. But the ultimate fusion is where life becomes the 80 % also at the same time as the 20%. That's the challenge for you. Beautifully put. For me, it feels like a seesaw. As long as I'm on the right side, that's all right. I don't have to overthink it. So thanks so much, Regan. Amazing call. I love that you took us on such a unique journey there. We've run out of time for questions. And if anyone... Well, I would recommend everyone that's left questions because there's quite a few in there. Put them in the community, the Telegram channel and the community. We can all share. We can all help with our experiences. So just trust the community as well. And remember the Telegram's there. If you haven't joined it already, please do join it. We have another call coming up. And that's it. Regan, do you have any more words? No, it was amazing. Good work, everybody. I just felt all of you so dialed in and just so willing to go into this space. Know that it's really normal for this process to keep going. So even if in a day or two, you notice, wow, I have like these negative thoughts around money right now. Just know that again, it's coming up to clear. It's like we've opened the clearing portal. And so it's now up to you to continue doing this work. You can tune into this recording again. You can't overdose on it. You can, if you feel like, wow, I woke up and I'm filled with all this fear and all this stuff like that. do this activation and it will support you again. You guys are amazing. Always keep tagging me and Mindvalley and all your stories and everything on social media because I love seeing your breakthroughs and your takeaways. And yeah, I love you guys so much. Thank you so much. 

====================

PREPARATION 1: Call #4 - Personal Life and Purpose

Welcome, everyone. I see you guys and all of your comments and everywhere you're tuning in from. Hello, hello, hello. Yes, guys, so important to share your stories, really, so we can celebrate you. You know, such a big part of manifesting is actually being witnessed in your manifestations and being celebrated in these manifestations. So we're super excited to gather all of those stories and super excited to be here with you today, right here, right now. And a big hi to everyone live and also everyone. Thank you for tuning into the replay. We are going to go through a powerful activation today all about purpose. And I really believe that it's totally possible in your life to fuse purpose and your personal life and all of these good things all together. You know, we don't have to be living in a paradigm where we're trading off one thing for the other. Okay, it can be in my purpose, but... means that i don't have a really great personal lifestyle or i can be in my purpose but i'm not getting paid the money that i want or i'm making the money i want but i'm not in my purpose like this is an old paradigm it's an old reality and what's really beautiful is that when you ground into knowing that you have a sovereign choice to actually have it all in your life in whatever way that looks like for you you get to have it all across the board in your life in every area of your life so i was personally so excited I mean, I saw that you guys voted for a purpose activation because like Steve said, it's been like wealth and finances, wealth and finances, wealth and finances. And now it's like purpose. Amazing that we are in that trajectory because, you know, one of my personal. deep visions and prayers that i hold every single day and part of my mission on this planet is to help redistribute the financial resources of this planet into the hands and the hearts of people that are really going to leave this planet a better place that are really going to do good things on this planet now how do you do good things if you're not in alignment with your purpose how do you change the world if you don't really know why you're here so this activation will allow you to go deeper into this and This is going to be perfect for you. If maybe you have absolutely no idea what your purpose is, you're going to start to tap into the first layers of it. And if you feel like you're already on purpose, then this is also perfect because you're going to get to go into deeper layers. And I really feel like for me and my experience of living into my purpose, it's like an onion. There's always like these deeper layers getting to the core of it. I don't think purpose is something where you take the box and you're like, oh, now I've completed my purpose. I feel like it's an evolution and it's constantly shifting and changing and transmuting. It's this beautiful opportunity to go into deeper layers of it. I feel like if someone asked me, Regan, are you on purpose? I would say yes, and I know there's so much more. Yes, and I'm always in an inquiry with these deeper layers. Yes, and I'm excited to see the deeper layers of my purpose be revealed. So wherever you're at right now is absolutely perfect. And I'm super excited to dive deep with you guys. Oh my goodness. You manifested 15K per month, three months before it was supposed to be manifested. Amazing. I'm celebrating you, Daryl. This is so good. Guys, make sure you write these stories in the link, really. We need these stories. This is amazing. It's so epic. So you guys know the drill. You know how to roll with this. There's nothing that you need to do so much so rather than be really present and create a beautiful space without any distractions. So take a moment to clean that up. If you need to shut the door or turn off some other technology or anything, like that and this is a closed eye guided process and wherever you're at with your purpose if you're holding an intention simply to start receiving what this purpose is or start going into the deeper layers of it then it's going to be absolutely perfect so let me know if you guys are ready to rock and roll and ready to go deeper give me a yes in the comments i'm not staring like at instagram by the way on my phone i'm actually looking at your comments on zoom yes ready yes yes yes yes amazing Okay guys, so on that note, let's take a moment to gently ground into this beautiful space, this beautiful vortex that we create together. Taking a moment to gently close your eyes as you turn inwards right now. Being aware of your breath. Breathing in and out. Breathing in and out. One more deep breath right into your belly. Beautiful. As you take this moment to gently ground yourself into the space, leaning gently into your intention of activating the next layer of your purpose in your life, impacting your lifestyle in whatever way that gets to look like for you. And from this place, go ahead and gently allow a red laser beam to shoot down from your tailbone, anchoring you, grounding you, solidifying you into the crystalline core of the earth. and simultaneously allowing a golden laser beam of light to shoot up through your crown connecting you right now to your unique soul star allowing you to be guided grounded present protected and supported heaven on earth embodied right here right now as you gently surround yourself with a ball of golden white light and decree and declare that any vibrations frequencies states or emotions that are not yours or not are the highest drop shift dissolve and clear dropping out of your field, bringing your field back to its natural crystalline state of purity. As you take a moment to call in your guides, beings of light of the highest vibration, divinely assigned to supporting you in the full and complete embodiment of your divine intention, we welcome you into this space. Welcome, welcome, welcome. We're here, we're open, we're available. Please guide us. beautiful and as you ground even deeper right now into your divine intention you allow yourself to notice that you are sitting in a beautiful big circle right here right now of all of the souls within this mind valley tribe across time and space live and also going through the recording that have gathered here today across time and space across different realms realities and dimensions at a soul level in order to be present and do this work to activate their divine personal intention when it comes to their purpose in their life. That's right. You may be aware of all of the souls here right now. You may feel them. You may see them. You may just simply know that we are gathered across time and space. Either way is absolutely perfect. You may feel the pulsation of the soul next to you on your left. You may feel the pulsation of the soul next to you on your right. Or you may just simply know that we are pulsating together right here, right now. As you allow yourself to gently notice a beautiful crystal in the center of the circle. Connecting heart to heart with this crystal right now through a golden laser beam. That's right. And sending the highest frequency of purpose through the laser beam, through the center of your heart, through your intention, all the way into the center of the crystal right here, right now. Go ahead and simply transmute that energy all the way into the center of the crystal. Beautiful. This crystal is shifting, alchemizing, transmuting and upgrading any of the frequencies contributed by the group and by the vortex. And so now gently allow yourself to receive back the highest, most useful frequency of purpose available through this vortex for you right here, right now. So through the golden laser beam connecting you with the very center of this crystal, Go ahead and gently allow yourself to receive the highest frequency of purpose. Divinely assigned to you right here, right now. Beautiful, I'm from this place of deep awareness. Allow yourself to now come back into your own field, turning your intention even deeper inwards right now. Turning your consciousness deeper inwards. Allowing yourself to surrender even deeper and deeper into your divine intention. That's right. And from this place, go ahead and gently pull up a screen in front of you. You may see the screen, you may feel it, or you may just simply know that you are connecting to it right now. Either way is absolutely perfect. And as you connect with the screen in front of you right here, right now, you notice there is a movie playing on the screen. And as you begin to gently watch the movie, you notice that this is a movie of you living fully and completely. in the embodiment of your divine purpose. That's right. Take a moment to watch this movie and notice what comes up for you. Notice where you are in your life. Notice how the embodiment of this purpose affects your lifestyle. Notice who's around you. Notice what it feels like to be you, living deeply into this mission and this purpose. If the mind comes and doesn't understand or it doesn't make sense or it's not logical, just tag that as the mind and return back to this vision. That's right. And as you continue to witness yourself in the movie, you notice that this movie screen is literally a portal into your future. A portal that is open and available right here, right now, in order for you to access information from your future, in order to embody it right here, right now, allowing you to embody. your intention when it comes to your divine purpose at an even deeper level. And as you continue to witness yourself in the movie screen right here, right now, allow yourself to tune into the ripples of your purpose in your personal life, with your lifestyle, with your family, with your community, and maybe even with your entire country or the entire planet that you're on. Allow yourself to simply ask yourself, your highest self and your guides, why am I here? Focus in on that one question right here, right now. Why am I here? Your soul put its hand up at one point and said, yes, me, planet Earth, right here, right now, this life, this country, this family, this human experience and this purpose. Why am I here? And as you gently allow yourself to sit with that question, With no expectation or pressure, you allow yourself to notice gently what comes up on the movie screen in front of you as the answers to why am I here begin to appear on the movie screen right here, right now. Some of these answers may be what you expect. Some of them might be quite unexpected. Well, they may not even make sense to you right now. Either way is perfect. Go deeper. Why am I here? Why am I here? Why am I here? And as you gently allow yourself to witness yourself, living out the answer to why am I here on the movie screen right here, right now. Now go ahead and ask yourself, why else am I here? Why else am I here? Why else am I here? And as you continue to witness yourself on the movie screen, as these answers begin to come to you, whether they make sense to the mind or not, As you tune into why you were here and these answers begin to reveal to you, go ahead and gently ask yourself now, for what purpose? What does all of this give you? And when you have that answer, ask yourself, for what purpose? What does that give you? What did you come here for in this human experience to experience? Allow yourself to center into one word. One answer for this one. Maybe it's peace. Maybe it's abundance. Maybe it's love. Maybe it's impact. Whatever it is for you is perfect. Ground into that one word and then ask yourself, for what purpose? What does that give you? If you answered love, you can ask yourself, for what purpose do I want to experience love? If you answered abundance, well, for what purpose do I want to experience abundance? What does that give me right here, right now? Allow yourself to gently notice what you notice on the movie screen right now. Being present to anything that is revealed to you. Maybe it is a super clear movie of what's going on in your purpose, your highest purpose. Maybe it's a color, a feeling, a vibration, a shape, a color, a sound. Whatever's coming up for you is absolutely perfect. That's right. And as you allow yourself to go deeper and deeper, right now, witnessing yourself in the movie screen, having just manifested the full and complete embodiment of your divine purpose. You gently begin to notice that some dials have appeared at the side of the screen. And as you connect with these dials right here, right now, you reach out and you can physically reach out with your hand or you can do this in your mind's eye. You reach out and begin to gently play with the first dial. And as you turn this dial up, you notice that you are altering the brightness of the movie. That's right. You're allowing this movie to become brighter and brighter and brighter. Go ahead. Turn it up. Turn it up. Turn it all the way up until it's pure white light. And now go ahead and turn this dial down. Turn it down, down, down, down, down. Until all of the light has gone out of the movie and it's totally black. And now turn this dial up. So it's somewhere in the middle. Absolutely perfect. The exact level of brightness that you desire it to be. as you continue to witness yourself in the movie screen having embodied your intention and living into the next layer of your purpose right here right now that's right now from this place you go ahead and gently notice that a second dial has appeared and as you reach out to play with this dial you gently turn it up and you notice that you were turning up all of the sounds in the movie as you continue to witness yourself having just embodied your purpose in the movie screen You're turning up all the sounds around you in the movie and then also everything you're saying in your own head. That's right. So go ahead, turn it up, turn it up, turn it up, turn the volume up until it's full sound. And now turn it down, down, down, down, down, down, down, down, down, down, down until all the sound is gone. Silence. And now go ahead and turn it up. That's it. Turn it up. Turn it up. Turn it all the way up until all of the sounds in the movie, internally and externally, are absolutely perfect, exactly as you desire them to be as you continue to witness yourself in the movie screen having just manifested the embodiment of your divine purpose. That's right. A third and final dial has appeared. And as you reach out to play with this dial, you notice this one is a little bit different because you're only going to turn it up. So as you gently begin to turn the style up, you notice that you are altering the feeling of you within the movie screen. The feeling of how good it feels to be you right here, right now, embodying your divine purpose. That's right. So go ahead and turn the style up. Turn it up. Turn it all the way up until the feeling is rushing through every single cell of your being with how good it feels to be you. having just embodied your divine purpose. That's right. And when this dial can't get any stronger and the feeling can't get any stronger, go ahead and double that feeling. Let it rush through every single cell of your being. And now go ahead and triple that feeling, that state, that vibration, that frequency. Let it vibrate right now through every single cell of your being as every single cell of your being begins to wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up. and receive the divine frequency of how good it feels to be you, having just manifested your divine intention in the movie Scream right now. That's right. Keeping this state, this vibration, this frequency, go ahead and now jump into the screen. That's it. So now you are in the screen, you're in the movie, you're breathing through your own lungs right now, feeling everything through your own sensory body, seeing through your own eyes, hearing everything, all the thoughts in your head and everything going on around you. Breathe deeply into your own lungs and feel how good it feels right now to be you fully embodied in your divine purpose. Notice how this feels to be you in your life with your lifestyle. That's it. Once again, double that feeling. Let it rush through every single cell of your being. And then go ahead and triple that state, that frequency, that emotion. Let it vibrate in every single cell as you allow yourself to bathe and marinate in the bliss of how good it feels to be you, fully and completely embodied in your purpose right here, right now. From this state within the movie, go ahead and make any adjustments to this movie. any adjustments to your life to make sure the full and complete embodiment of your divine purpose is indeed divine and absolutely perfect exactly as you desire it to be because it is your movie after all beautiful and now keeping this state this vibration this frequency and this emotion of deep knowing that your divine purpose is done embodied activated at a cellular level right here right now go ahead and now jump out of the screen So you're once again witnessing yourself in the movie screen having just manifested and embodied the next layer of your divine purpose. That's right. And now from this place, go ahead and physically reach out and hold the screen in front of you. That's it. Hold it in your two hands and you can actually feel it vibrating through your hands right here, right now. That's it. This movie screen encoded with the movie of you having just embodied and manifested your divine purpose is vibrating within your hands right here, right now. Now we will use some breath to activate this at an even deeper level. So in a moment, you're going to breathe in and you're going to breathe in all of your life force, energy and intention. And then when you breathe out, you're going to breathe it into the screen, charging up the screen, charging up this movie. That's it. Okay. Breathing in. That's it. Breathing out into the screen. Big, strong, long breath. Letting the screen vibrate within your hands. Right here, right now. Second time. Breathing in. All of your energy, all of your intention, all of your life force. Now breathe it out into the screen. That's it. Let the screen vibrate in your hands. Vibrating through every cell of your being. Right here, right now. Third time. Breathe it in. That's it. Breathing out right now, vibrating with every single cell of your being. As the screen vibrates to your hands, you may even feel it vibrating through your body right here, right now. And now simply go ahead, take the screen and now float up out of your body. That's it. Hovering up out of your body, up above now, taking the screen with you. So you're hovering above now, right now. And now simply go ahead. turn towards your future. That's it. Turn to your future and ask yourself, when is this moment in time that I decree and declare that I will fully and completely embody my purpose right here, right now? Maybe it is a few days from now. Maybe it's a few weeks from now, a few months, depending on the scope of the vision and the purpose that you tune into. Maybe it's even a year out from now. Whatever feels good, true, and aligned, go ahead. Taking that movie screen with you. And now gently go ahead and float out into your future, taking this screen with you, this vision encoded with the full and complete embodiment of your divine purpose and float out all the way out into your future until you're hovering just above that moment in time. Your unconscious mind knows exactly where to take you. As long as you request to be taken there, you will be hovering right now, just before that moment in time, just above that moment in time. And from this place, this space, this reality and this dimension, go ahead and now gently drop the screen down. That's right, allowing the screen to drop down, float down, sink down. That's right. Until it fully drops and locks into that exact moment in time. And as you hover just above that moment in time, just before that moment in time, from this place, from this space, across every single time, realm, reality, and dimension, go ahead and simply choose that. Choose that reality at a soul level. Choose it with every single cell of your being. That's right. Hovering just above this moment in time, just before this moment in time. Choosing this at a deep cell level. Across time and space. I choose to embody my divine purpose. I choose to embody my divine purpose. I choose to embody my divine purpose. That's right. And from this place, this state, this frequency, from this place of awareness and deep remembrance that this intention is done, it is done, it is done, go ahead and now gently begin to float all the way back to now, only as quickly as you can stop and notice all of the events in your life shift and recalibrate and realign themselves in light of the embodiment of your divine purpose. That's right. Notice what changes in your life, in your lifestyle. Notice what now lines up differently. That's right. As you gently begin to float all the way back to now, only as quickly as you can stop and notice the version of you that you now chose to bring to the table, to walk, talk, think and act in alignment with your divine purpose. Go ahead and gently notice the version of you that's walking, talking, thinking, and acting a little bit differently in order to support the full and complete embodiment of your divine purpose. That's right. Notice what is different within you. Notice how your beingness has shifted. Notice how there's a new version of you that you bring to the table each and every single day. Good. and continue to flow back all the way to now only as quickly as you can stop and notice all of the blocks and limitations that have shifted and alchemized and transmuted and dropped and dissolved and cleared out of your field and out of your system. Go ahead right now and simply notice from this place of observation the things that you have chosen to let go of in order to fully and completely embody your divine purpose and allow that to ripple into your personal life and your lifestyle. Maybe you are aware of certain fears that dropped away. Maybe you are aware of certain stories you've been telling yourself around your purpose that have also dropped, dissolved, shift and cleared away right here, right now. Maybe you've cleared out self -sabotage patterns, limiting beliefs, not feeling good enough. or any old states, vibrations, or frequencies that no longer serve you. Go ahead and gently tune in and notice all of your blocks and limitations that have now dropped, dissolved, shifted, and cleared away out of your reality right here, right now. And go ahead and gently request that anything that is still blocking you, limiting you, slowing you down, or holding you back from the full and complete embodiment of your divine purpose. Go ahead and simply request that this drops, dissolves, shifts, alchemize. Right now. Out of your field, out of your life, out of your reality. Shifting and transforming into useful energy. Requesting that any unconscious limitations that you may not even be aware of. Or any residual limitations that have not yet cleared. Requesting they now drop, dissolve, shift and clear. Alchemizing, transmuting. out of your system and out of your reality right here right now beautiful and as you gently continue to float all the way back to now only as quickly as you can stop and allow yourself to notice all of the divine synchronicities that have laid up in your life and in your reality miracles if you like in order to support you in the full and complete embodiment of your divine purpose Go ahead and gently notice how incredibly divine the layup of the synchronicities, the miracles, the architecture supporting you. As you take this moment to allow yourself to remain open to notice what is different. Notice the miracles. Notice the synchronicities and even expect them in your reality. when it comes to the full and complete embodiment of your divine purpose that's right as you allow yourself to now gently float all the way back to now until you are hovering above now coming back down into now back into the space back into your body breathing through your own lungs in this present reality right here right now allowing yourself to now be present to your heart Centering into your heart with so much love. With so much gratitude. With so much deep remembrance for who you are. For so much deep remembrance of your divine purpose. As you allow yourself to gently ground into the frequency of deep knowing that the full and complete embodiment of your divine purpose is done. It is done. it is done i am divine purpose i am divine purpose divine purpose deeper layers of my purpose with ease with grace and with flow i unlock deeper layers of my purpose with ease with grace and with flow i unlock deeper layers of my purpose with ease with grace and with flow the deeper i go into my purpose the more amazing my personal life gets. The deeper I go into my purpose, the more amazing my life gets. The deeper I go into my purpose, the more amazing my life gets. I am a magnet for miracles when it comes to my purpose. I am a magnet for miracles when it comes to my purpose. I am a magnet for miracles when it comes to my purpose. I am divine purpose. I am divine purpose. As you gently allow yourself right now to be present once again in this beautiful circle, this beautiful vortex that we created together with all of these souls, taking a moment to thank the beautiful tribe, the Mindvalley family that showed up today to witness you, to hold you and support you in the full and complete embodiment of your divine purpose. In your own way, go ahead and thank the collective group. Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you. And taking a moment to thank your guides, beings of light of the highest vibration. Thank you, thank you, thank you. Thank you for guiding us, supporting us. Thank you, thank you, thank you. And taking a moment to thank yourself, beautiful being of light that you are. Thank you, thank you, thank you for doing this work, for showing up, for saying yes, for being bold enough and brave enough. to lean even deeper into your purpose right here right now thank you thank you thank you you and as you bring your focus and your awareness and your intention back again into your own field we begin to gently seal up your field grounding down all of the layers that are shifting and activating right now as we decree and declare that all of these shifts upgrades and deep layers of transformation and remembrance continue 24 hours a day seven days a week until they are fully actualized stabilized embodied integrated and complete And may they take place with total ease, total grace and total flow. And that's right. As all of these deep layers of transformation and remembrance ground right now through your system, growing roots like an old tree. As you allow yourself to breathe gently into your heart, feeling the vibration and the frequency of your heart and how good it feels to be you right here, right now, saying yes to your divine purpose. Saying yes to your truth. Saying yes to why you were here. Feeling the pulsation of your heart right now. With so much love and with so much gratitude.

Thank you, Regan. Thank you everyone for playing along. Let's take just a moment while we sit here enjoying that space and just look at the comments as Regan was just sharing. Just look at them and just feel all of these people that we just connected with share this experience, one of a kind, and just acknowledge all of these individuals. i mean i'm just loving just reading beautiful experience it was it was such a journey we have a few questions coming up soon i will also post the story link in the chat again for people to to share let's have a look what we got lots of happy tears so much gratitude you guys are amazing thanks for doing this work it's it's really deep work guys you know make sure you really look after yourself after this and and give yourself what you need and lots and lots of water so beautiful and you have this recording you can go through this over and over and over again if you want to tap into deeper layers of your purpose if you want to if you feel like you're in your purpose but maybe a few months later you come back you want to go into this deeper level that you have this as a tool in your toolkit now yeah steve what questions do we have all right let's dive in we've One with 10 upvotes here. Thank you for the teaching. First of all, this is from Aurora. There's a short and long manifestation for the quest. There's a short and long manifestation. You gave us a lot of tools to keep working on the long manifestation of the quest. For the short one, you always say it will happen on or before the end of the quest. I've done the quest. And the short manifestation did not happen. What is your advice to still work on the short manifestation after the quest? Keep going. Everything you have for the short activation, keep going, keep doing it, you know, and, you know, everyone's different. and we've all walked different walks of life and we all have different blocks and limitations and we're all manifesting different things. Some smaller, some larger, some more complicated, some not like, you know, there's so much going on. But the only way for this to fail and not work is for you to give up and for you to say, you know what? It didn't work out, just stop, right? That's what you don't wanna do. So you want to humbly go back and go deeper and go into the deeper layers of it. Yeah, keep going. Keep going. Thank you. Next question from Matthew. What is the difference between getting mixed up in the how of manifestations and aligned action? And you would just like an example if you have any. Sorry, so getting mixed up in like... The how of the manifestation and aligned action. Okay, yeah. So... this is a really great question so you you want to make sure when you're taking a line to action it's coming from the right frequency so how most people do this is they're taking action in their life to manifest but they're doing this from this frequency of how do i make it happen how do i make it happen how do i make it happen which which actually guys is a frequency of fear because underneath how do we make it happen you're telling the universe I don't know how to make it happen. So I have to ask, how do I make it happen? Which means I have a fear that I'm not capable of manifesting it, right? So you don't wanna come from that place. And that's what 99 .9 % of society does, right? You don't wanna do that. Instead, and this is in the quest, right? You wanna ground into, okay, it's already done. I know it's done. I'm choosing that. I'm aligning that. I am that manifestation. And from that place. how do i get to participate in the process what do i get to do to now speed up the manifestation i already know it's going to happen that's a non -negotiable it is what it is it's written in the stars that's who i am and yes i'm going to participate i'm going to take action so what action can i do in order to accelerate it and just type in a yes if you can feel the difference of the frequency of like oh my god how do i make it happen versus oh yeah okay it's happening this is what i get to do to speed it up right so if you're feeling like the how frequency coming in do the work on clearing the limitations there's actually a limit right that that's a fear that's a limiting structure going on in your system you can clear that out using all your tools to clear out the blocks and limitations and then you want to come back from this really clear and grounded place where you know that you know that you know that you know that you know that your manifestation is done it is done it is done why because you're choosing that and that's who you are and then from this place you take action in your life two very different frequencies yeah wonderful thank you for the answer thank you for the question uh matthew and the next question actually is quite similar but it feels like it might be a nice follow -up to this so the question is basically how to expect magic and miracles without getting attached to the outcome yeah it's a choice it's a choice right so if you're i promise you if you were someone that expects miracles in your life if you expect magical things to happen if you expect manifestations to show up in wildly crazy ways that you couldn't even fathom i promise you that will become your reality because that is a frequency now that's not a god -given gift where some people have the capacity to manifest miracles and some people don't you can condition yourself into that frequency so if you're like oh i would love miracles but I've never had a miracle. I don't know if that is possible. Sit down and start writing out. I choose to believe that I am a magnet for miracles. I choose to believe that miracles always appear in my life. You know, a great money one to write out is I choose to believe that I always have money left over and I always receive more money than I expect. I choose to believe that I always receive more manifestations than I expect. I choose to believe that my manifestations show up in a way that delight me and surprise me. I choose to believe that I am a magnet for magical miracles to unfold and everyone around me goes, wow, you're just constantly having miracles happen in your life. Like, I'm just like, blah, blah, blah, blah. I could do this for hours with you because it's my internal reality. But it didn't used to be my internal reality. I conditioned myself to be like, I am a magnet for miracles. I have divine synchronicities always unfold. Life is always better than I expect it to be. My manifestations are so big and so good that they surprise me because my mind couldn't even see that or create that, right? And so you can condition yourself into that state. And it's super fun, by the way. It should be a really nice exercise to do. Wonderful. Thank you. And next question from Tanya. And it's... Fairly long paragraph, so I'll just take it step by step and we'll see. So can you share your thoughts on about the impact of severe childhood sexual trauma, dysregulating the nervous system, which limits your capacity to receive manifestations? And it goes on to say, how do you discern between getting the right support and this paradox of the pursuit to heal, keeping the sabotaging mechanisms in place? it feels like my personal life and purpose is very much entangled in this for decades yeah yeah this is really beautiful and thank you for this question and um okay and there's a lot of layers to this i mean this could be like an hour long like a process that we that we unpack but what's important to know firstly is that your past is your past and your past doesn't define your future so your past does not need to define your manifestations firstly so if that is entangled i would untangle that firstly untangle it to the point where it's like okay things happened in the past yes and That doesn't impact where I'm going in the future. Now, on another layer, if you feel this healing to be done, if you're feeling like, oh, this thing keeps coming up, or there's a memory, or I feel it in my nervous system, right? Ask yourself, like, what are the tools and modalities to go through in order to heal this piece? Now, the piece you asked about, almost like the pursuit of healing, and a lot of people do this, they fall in this constant loop of like, almost like I constantly need to be healing myself. Like nothing strong enough to remove this because it was so deep and it was so intense. And just know that in itself is a program. That in itself is a pattern. So what if you held a belief system that healing was easy? What if you held a belief system that when you felt to do this healing or that healing or this process, it worked and it was going to unlock it and allow yourself to be free because you're sovereign and you're choosing that you are now healed and free. So again, there's a lot of layers on that, but I hope that gives you some pointers to start going deep in and start untangling this a little bit and really claiming your power back, claiming your power back from the experiences and also from the unhealthy healing loop potentially. Yeah. Wonderful, beautiful question. And thank you for a wonderful answer as well. Yeah. The next question that comes up is Evie. She was talking about the biggest breakthrough for her in this quest was about the knowing frequency. So she feels that it's quite amazing. She's getting quite tuned into that. But sometimes I feel sometimes I don't. And she would like to see if there's any insights on further tools we can use to wake up the knowing frequency even further. yeah for sure practice right practice and and you know i don't know if there's a human out there me included that's just permanently in a perfect state of knowing in a perfect state of manifestation like we're a human right and we have ups and downs and things happen and fluctuations and different layers of stuff which comes up and so that's the work but what's important is to catch when you drop out at that frequency if you are aware that you're not in that frequency that is 95 of the game you're 95 there to going back into the other frequency it's when you're not aware of it that's when we have a problem because if you're not aware of something it can be a lot harder to recalibrate back so if you see it And you're like, hmm, I'm in like a frequency, for example, of doubting myself right now. Okay. okay great catch that and then don't judge it and not like oh why am i not in the annoying frequency i suck like i should get this by now like that's not going to help us either you need to go in from a place of deep curiosity and self -love and literally be like oh wow okay i am so grateful and happy that i caught that i'm not in this frequency let me recalibrate back get the alarm on your phone close your eyes for two minutes all the tools you guys have in the quest and and allow yourself okay if i was to come back into this knowing frequency right now with my manifestation. How would I feel? What would be going on? What would I see? Like just drop yourself in it and it can take 30 seconds, two minutes, but it is energetic conditioning and it does take time and practice. And again, like don't try and get to this place where you're just like never falling out of it because we're humans and this happens. And also as we elevate into higher frequency manifestations, often we have more things come up to clear which can pull us out of these frequencies, but that's the work. you know i wake up the other morning and i'm like oh i feel all this like fear in my solar plexus what's going on what i'm not like why is that there i'm actually like awesome what an opportunity that i can catch that alchemize it do my work and then come back into this knowing frequency and then 20 minutes later i'm good right so yeah i hope that helps beautiful thank you regan and uh looks like we are about that time so Thank you so much for your time and everybody else for sharing with us the space. Here's the link for sharing the story again. And make sure you check out the challenges group. Feel free to do the quest again on different manifestations, of course, and keep on going.

The Fundamentals of Manifesting

====================

LESSON 1: The 80/20 Trap

-   Welcome to lesson one in this manifestation Quest; congratulations.
    Congratulations for saying yes to yourself, to your future, to your
    future manifestations, and ultimately to your soul’s desires. It’s
    an honor to be your guide, your teacher, and your sister in this
    journey, this deep inner journey where you get to really peel back
    the layers behind the scenes and say yes to whatever it is that you
    desire in any area of your life. Now for lesson one, we’re diving
    right in. I’m going to jump you right in the deep end, because I
    know that you are ready for this, and you can handle it. I’m going
    to be sharing pieces of my story throughout this Quest. And also
    remember you have your tasks at the end, your action items, which
    are so important when it comes to manifesting the results that you
    desire through this Quest. So lesson number one is understanding
    that 80/20 trap. Now this is one of the biggest pieces with
    manifestation that people screw up and get wrong because they just
    don’t know about it. Just like I didn’t know about this when I
    started out on my journey. I grew up in Auckland, New Zealand, and
    in a family who very much loved me dearly and still does, but they
    were very traditional. You know, they believed in following the
    system, going to school, getting good grades, working really hard,
    getting a nine-to-five job and continuing down that pathway. And I
    never really knew what I wanted to do as a child. And my dad always
    said to me, “You know, Regan if I had your opportunities, I would’ve
    been an architect.” And so sure enough, I went to university, and I
    started studying architecture in an unconscious quest to fulfill my
    father’s dreams and desires. And I remember sitting there at
    university, and a new lecturer walked into the room, and he said,
    “Future architects, I’m going to get you to do a process that will
    change your life.” And I was sitting there, and I was excited, and
    he started to guide us through a guided visualization, meditation
    process. And I’d never done anything like this. This was completely
    new to me. And so I was excited. I sat there; I closed my eyes, and
    this man said something along the lines of, “Welcome future
    architects. Welcome to your future. I want you to picture your life
    20 years out from this exact moment in time as the architect that
    you were born to be.” And I remember I started seeing this vision,
    and I saw a life that I knew wasn’t my path, that I knew wasn’t my
    ultimate reality. I saw a life where ultimately I wasn’t even happy
    and fulfilled. And I had this moment where it’s like my mind
    disconnected from my body, and my body got up. And this voice deep
    inside me was like, “Get out.” And so I ran out of that room, and I
    made a decision that day that I was going to create a life that I
    was madly in love with. And I had no idea what that looked like, and
    I didn’t know how that was going to happen. And maybe you’re
    watching this right now, and you know that you are ready to create
    your ultimate reality and manifest your ultimate life, but maybe you
    don’t know how that’s going to happen. And that’s okay. That’s what
    we’re going to be diving deeper into through this Quest and through
    this process. And so, this led me into the personal development
    world. I went to Google and I started googling “How do I quit my
    nine to five job?” Because Google obviously has all of the answers
    all the time. And this led me into finding books and different
    courses and pieces of information that led me to wealth creation
    seminars and personal development events. And I started going to
    these events, and I started doing everything that the people on the
    stages told me to do. I started investing money I didn’t have; there
    was one point where I was maxed out on credit cards and personal
    loans, not for cars and holidays, but for my growth, for coaching,
    for courses, for mentoring, for education. I started learning sales
    and marketing. I started learning how to invest in cryptocurrency. I
    started grasping at any way possible to try and figure out how do I
    create a life that I love. And I found myself in a place where I was
    over six figures in personal debt, and things weren’t changing. I
    wasn’t seeing results. Businesses I was starting were failing. And I
    said to one of my mentors at the time, I said, “Simon, maybe I’m not
    cut out for this. Maybe I should just get a job. Maybe I should let
    go of this dream of my ultimate reality and my ultimate life.” And
    he looked at me, and he said something that changed my entire
    reality. And I’m about to share this with you. He said, “Regan, do
    you understand that 80/20 trap?” And I said, “What trap?” I had no
    idea what he was talking about. And he said, “Look, manifestation,
    success, your ultimate reality, whatever it is that you are looking
    to call into your life. It’s 80% your inner game. It’s 80% your
    conditioning; it’s 80% your mindset, your energy, the version of you
    that you bring to the table. And then just 20% what you do on the
    outside, the action you take, the strategy in your life.” And he
    said, “The trap is most people have this totally backwards. And
    they’re 80% focused on all the doing and 20%, if you are lucky,
    focused on the inner game.” And I was in that trap; I was so outside
    of myself and that threw me off into a different path, a path of
    studying NLP and hypnosis and energy work. And the minute I focused
    on that 80% and combined that with the action in my life, I started
    to see results. Things started to shift. This is the exact journey
    that you get to go through on this Quest. We’re not just going to
    tell you, okay, now focus on the 80%. We’re going to be breaking
    down what that looks like in clear, specific, precise action. So you
    know exactly how you are going to be able to condition yourself from
    the inside out in order to step into this next level. And when you
    do this and when you say yes to this and when you start playing this
    game where you’re operating outside of the trap and you’re actually
    flipping it to your advantage, this calls for a greater level of
    commitment from the inside out, a greater level of commitment to
    yourself, a greater level of commitment to your manifestations and
    what you truly desire, a greater level of commitment to this Quest.
    Because sadly, not everyone will complete this Quest, and not
    everyone will manifest what they desire because it takes commitment.
    And this is my invitation to you, to allow yourself to choose to be
    one of those people that does complete this Quest. This is my
    invitation to you, to be one of the extraordinary people, not like
    everyone else out there in the world but one of the people who says,
    “You know what? I’m going to choose to become a Masterful
    Manifestor.” And that starts with a deep choice from within, and you
    know what I’ve seen when I’ve seen people say yes to this, when I’ve
    seen people step into greater skills of manifestation, I have seen
    magic, and I have seen miracles unfold before their very eyes. So I
    invite you into that also. I invite you to start expecting miracles
    through this process because what we focus on expands, and we get
    what we expect every single time. So where do we start with this?
    Manifestation is a huge piece. And now that you understand the 80/20
    trap, and you are going to be one of the people that flips that and
    starts going deeper into this inner work, it’s really important to
    get clear and precise on your focus point. Manifestation can feel
    overwhelming. It can feel like you have your whole life to shift
    sometimes. In this Quest, you are going to be focusing on one area
    of your life, and don’t worry, every area is connected. So if you
    focus on one area, it’s going to affect all the other areas. And
    what’s even better is that once you complete this Quest, you can
    come back, and you can focus on another area of your life. So, what
    are these areas of your life? Firstly, we have your health; we have
    your wealth. We have relationships; that includes your family
    relationships, your intimate relationships, all relationships,
    working relationships. We have your mindset, right? Your inner
    mindset; we have your emotions. Are you controlled by your emotions?
    Or are they in a great place? We have your purpose and your mission.
    Also your passion, how much fulfillment you’re having in your life.
    We have contribution, and of course we have spirituality. Now these
    areas of life are not in any level of hierarchy. It’s important that
    you tune in right now and actually ask yourself, “What is the area
    that really requires my attention right now?” And I invite you to
    pick the area that you’re maybe not so masterful at. If you are
    really, really, really great at all of your relationships, but
    there’s some challenges going on with your money. Well, maybe you
    pick wealth in order to really accelerate that and go deeper. So, as
    I reminded you earlier, every single Quest you’re going to have
    specific tasks and actions to complete and get done. I like to call
    this your soul work. This is going to accelerate you forward on the
    80%, and then also shift and change the strategy and the action that
    you then take in your life. So for your first task, you are going to
    ask yourself, “What am I actually committed to during this Quest?”
    Remember, the deep 80% recalibration requires commitment. Are you
    committed to completing this Quest? Maybe you are committed to
    showing up every single day. Maybe you are committed to not being
    distracted by things in your life and in your reality. And maybe
    you’re committed to actually going deep within yourself and being
    totally raw and totally real. It’s up to you to create your
    commitments, but those are some ideas for you to go a little bit
    deeper. And task number two your second layer of soul work, to ask
    yourself, “Okay, what is going to be my focus point?” And pick one
    area of your life. We’re going to be working through this Quest and
    doing many deep inner work processes. And you’re going to have the
    opportunity to look at this from a larger long-term manifestation.
    And then also a specific manifestation throughout the days of this
    Quest. But what’s important is that both of those manifestations fit
    into the same area of life. So simple, easy, pick your focus point;
    which area are you going to focus on? The third piece of soul work I
    want you to ask you yourself is how are you now committed to
    integrating this 80% into your life? What will you do in order to
    focus on the 80%? Maybe you’re going to create time in the morning
    to have a morning ritual. Maybe you’re committed to seeing yourself
    at a deeper level. Maybe you’re committed to learning more tools,
    specific manifestation tools, to allow yourself to go deeper in the
    80%. I want you to write out three specific commitments, so you can
    really ground into this and anchor this in. So it’s been an honor
    diving deep with you in this training; I am so excited. This is just
    task number one, day number one, lesson number one; we have so much
    more to go deep in, and tomorrow we are going to be pulling back in
    the next lesson the next layers of how you can become an ultimate
    manifestor. I love you so much. Thank you for being here, and have
    fun with those pieces of soul work.

====================

LESSON 2: The Power of 2%: Take Control of Your Inner Reality

-   Welcome back; we’re going to be diving deep into how to actually
    take control over your inner reality. How do you actually deep dive
    into this 80%? And I know personally, it can feel so overwhelming
    with where to start. When I started out on my journey, I felt like
    oh okay, I understand; I want to shift and recalibrate and work on
    this 80%, but where do I start with this? What do I do with this?
    What most people don’t realize is that when it comes to accelerating
    your results from the inside out, there is a strategy to this; there
    is a method to this. And this is really one of the things that I
    wish someone had told me at the beginning of my manifestation
    journey. We’re going to be talking today about the power of 2% and
    what compounding manifestation actually looks like. Now in order to
    do this, it’s really important that we understand how our results
    are generated. What most people are doing out there in the world is
    they’re taking action, and they’re trying to shift their results;
    they’re taking action, and they’re trying to shift their results.
    But people are missing this very important piece which changes
    everything, and that is, firstly, rewiring their belief system.
    Rewiring their belief system. Now this happens whether people
    actually have focused on it or not. And if you are unconscious to
    your belief system, then this can actually spin your entire
    manifestations in a cycle that can be really harmful for you. So
    let’s use a little bit of an example. I want to teach this to you by
    sharing an example of going skiing for the first time. So whether
    you’re a skier or not, just imagine that you’re skiing for the very
    first time. And you head up the mountain, and as you do, you get a
    call from your friend, and your friend says, “What are you doing?”
    You say, “Oh, you know what? I’m excited. I’m going skiing for the
    first time.” And your friend says, “Oh, you know, I tried skiing;
    it’s really, really, really hard. I hurt myself a lot; be careful.”
    And already from hearing this information, your belief system, if
    you’re unconscious to it, starts going, “Oh no, skiing is hard. I
    might not be good at it; it’s going to take a lot of work.” So you
    start heading up the mountain, and you start trying to ski. You fall
    over, like everyone does when they first start learning how to ski;
    you fall over. And then your belief system goes, “Oh yeah, this is
    hard; I’m not good at this.” So your beliefs drop which shifts the
    action that you take which spirals your result down. And all of a
    sudden, you start going in this downward spiral; you start spiraling
    down with your manifestations, okay? Now I want you to think about
    this, if you started off differently. Let’s say you are heading up
    the mountain, and you’re telling yourself, “Okay, you know what? I’m
    going to choose to believe that skiing is easy. I’m going to choose
    to believe that actually I’m going to be really, really, really good
    at skiing. I’m going to choose to believe that I’m going to pick
    this up fast.” And you go on with that mindset and that belief
    system, and you start taking action, and you fall over, but you say,
    “Oh, it’s okay; everyone falls over in the beginning. Let me get up,
    that was my first fall. Let me try again, I know I’m going to be
    good at this one day,” and your results start to shift. Now all of a
    sudden what happens is with the manifestation spiral, your
    manifestations are spiraling up. Your results are spiraling up. Your
    belief system gets stronger and stronger. And then from this place,
    you start shifting the action that you’re taking; the frequency of
    the action is from a different place. And then from this place, your
    results start to shift. So what happens to most people is because
    they’re unaware of this formula, they’re unaware of the ultimate
    manifestation success formula, they’re constantly in a downward
    spiral with their manifestations. And even if they’re taking action,
    and even if they’re trying really hard, they end up spiraling down.
    Now this requires a choice point. Are you going to be someone that
    spirals up, or are you going to be someone that spirals down in your
    life? And it’s as simple as choosing, “You know what? I’m going to
    work on my belief system and allow that to positively affect the
    action that I take and allow that to positively affect my results
    which means I get some good results which means my belief
    automatically goes stronger. Which means my action that I’m taking
    is more efficient which means I start getting better and better
    results and everything keeps spiraling.” So let’s talk a little bit
    now about compounding interest. You know that if you have $1,000,
    and you put it in the bank, and you earn 2% interest on that, and
    you keep the interest in the bank, you don’t take it out; you keep
    it there. Well, you don’t have $1,000 every single month. That
    starts growing, and it starts compounding. The same happens with
    your belief system. The same happens with your belief system. All of
    a sudden, if you’re working on your belief system, and you make a
    choice just to be 2% better at your belief system, 2% stronger when
    it comes to your internal reality, we start having this compounding
    effect with our internal reality. This 2% acceleration in your
    belief system accelerates the 2% better action that you take which
    accelerates 2% more results. And then all of a sudden, as this
    spirals up, you start seeing like, “Wow, hang on, my results are
    actually compounding.” And this started with the initial 2% with
    your belief system. Now so many people mess this up, and they start
    trying something new. And they say, okay, I’m going to, for example,
    run a marathon, and they’ve never run a marathon before. So they
    start going to the gym, and they start trying to run for an hour and
    a half every single day. Now we know that if you’re not a runner and
    you try and run for an hour and a half in the gym, out of the blue,
    what’s going to happen the next morning? You’re sore; you don’t want
    to go; you’re in a downward spiral. Versus someone else says, “Okay,
    I have this goal to run a marathon. I choose to believe I’m going to
    do this. I choose to believe it’s going to be fun and easy. I choose
    to believe I’m going to be good at this. And I’m going to take 2%,
    just 2% more action on this than I took yesterday.” So what do they
    do? They go to the gym, and maybe they walk for 20 minutes. Maybe
    they run for just two minutes; maybe they run for five minutes. They
    don’t run for an hour and a half, or at least attempt to, right? And
    so all of a sudden, the next day they’ve got their result; they feel
    good. And they say, “Okay, well now I’m going to go, and if I ran
    for five minutes yesterday, I’m going to run for seven minutes
    today.” 2%, 2%, 2%, and all of a sudden, everything starts spiraling
    up and everything starts massively compounding. Until you turn
    around and you look at your life, and you see the result that you’ve
    manifested, and you remember, “Wow, this is literally due to the
    power of 2%.” This is literally due to the compounding effect that’s
    happened in your internal reality, from the inside out. I’m someone
    who’s extreme with my manifestations; I have big dreams and big
    goals. And so before I understood this, I would take so much action
    and then burn out and then not be able to actually align to the
    manifestation until I understood this. So for your soul work for
    this lesson, I want you to reflect for the first piece. And I want
    you to get really raw and real with yourself and ask yourself, have
    you mostly been spiraling up, or have you been spiraling down? And
    you can’t do this from judgment; you must do this from awareness,
    from curiosity. And it’s from this curious self-reflection that
    you’ll be able to shift this. Now for the second soul work, the
    second soul task, I want you to ask yourself, okay, who do you now
    get to be? Are you someone who spirals up with your manifestations,
    or are you going to be someone that spirals down? This starts with a
    conscious choice; this is an invitation to make your choice. Now for
    the third piece, you’re going to ask yourself, “What is my 2%
    commitment for both my belief system and my action daily?” And make
    sure this is attuned to the area of your life which you’re focusing
    on. What is is the 2% that you are going to condition yourself into
    believing every single day? And then what is the action that you get
    to take in your life in alignment with this specific focus point,
    this focus area in your life? I’m so excited for you to go deep with
    this, and we’ll be peeling back the layers even further on the next
    lesson.

====================

LESSON 3: Tap Into Surrendered Manifestation

-   Welcome back. Right now, we are going to go deep into talking about
    what is surrendered manifestation and how you can utilize
    surrendered manifestation as a tool to accelerate your results. Now,
    before we get there, it’s really important to understand what
    manifestation is and really understand the process of manifestation.
    I was recently speaking at an event in Dubai, and this was a very
    corporate serious event. And someone came up to me and said, “Oh,
    Regan, I’m so excited you are here. Thank you for being here.” And I
    said, “Oh, you’re so welcome. It’s an honor to be here.” And he
    said, “I’m a businessman and I’m a CEO. And I hear you’re speaking
    about manifestation.” I said, “Yes.” And he looked at me, and he
    said, “What is that?” And I looked at him, and I said, “Wow,
    manifestation is a magical process. It’s a process that all humans
    have the capacity to tap into. It’s not a God-given gift that some
    people have and some people don’t. No. It’s something that’s
    available within each and every single one of us if you understand
    the process, if you understand how it works.” And I went on to
    explain to him that the process of manifestation is really taking
    something that is a dream, a vision, an intention, and allowing that
    to be embodied and anchored through you so that it physically shows
    up in your life. And I saw his face. He was like, “Oh yeah.” And you
    could see his recollection around not only have I done that before,
    but wow, now that I have intention around that, this is powerful.
    And this is powerful for each and every single one of you. And now
    that you know the framework of manifestation, we are taking this
    much, much deeper. There are two different types of manifestation
    processes, and we’re going to be talking on both of them, so you can
    understand what manifestation is not. So you can understand how
    actually most people are manifesting, which is extremely dangerous.
    This first way of manifesting is called manufactured manifestation.
    Now, why is this dangerous? It’s dangerous because it actually does
    work. It’s dangerous because it can get you what you desire. But if
    you are using a process of manufactured manifestation, I promise
    you, you will hit a cap at some point. I promise you, you will have
    to work harder. I promise you, you’ll have to push and struggle and
    hustle at some point. At least 98% of the world function from a
    space of manufactured manifestation. What is manufactured
    manifestation? Manufactured manifestation is when you are attempting
    to control every step of the process every step of the way of how
    your manifestation is to come into your life. Now, I want you to
    think about this because when we look at manifestation, and think of
    something amazing that you have manifested, a vision, an idea that’s
    now here in your life; maybe it’s a health goal that you achieved.
    Maybe it’s a beautiful relationship that you have. Maybe it’s a
    money goal. If you trace that back and you look at your past and you
    start realizing that, hang on, this really wouldn’t have happened,
    unless I went to that event and then met that person and said yes to
    that and then figured this out and then flew here and did this and
    did this, this, this, this, this… and you start realizing, wow, hang
    on. There was a whole divine process that took place in order for
    this manifestation to show up. And you start realizing that, wow,
    hang on. Yeah, I had some intentions, and I did some things, but I
    didn’t really control that whole divine process. So when you start
    remembering this and you start remembering that, okay, that’s the
    manufactured controlling way of getting to some sort of vision,
    dream, or goal, you start asking yourself, well, if it’s not that,
    then how do I manifest? And this is where we start talking about a
    different way to manifest. This is where we start talking about what
    I call surrendered manifestation, remembering that we are born
    manifestors, but how we are manifesting makes a big difference to
    our results and how they show up. So when you are going deeper into
    surrendered manifestation, you are remembering that if you are not
    trying to control every little detail, you’re allowing yourself to
    surrender, and you’re coming from your soul. When you are
    manufacturing the process, you’re obsessed with trying to control
    every little piece, but when you’re surrendering into the
    manifestation process, you’re remembering that this is a
    co-creation. This is a co-creation with God or spirit or the
    universe, whatever label you’d like to use. And you start realizing
    that things can show up divinely in your life through synchronicity,
    through ease, through grace, and through flow. You see when you’re
    attempting to manufacture the results, again, you’ve got to work
    hard. You’ve got to push. You’ve got to struggle. It’s that
    frequency. But when you’re in a place of surrender, you are open.
    You’re available. You’re allowing the magic and the miracles to flow
    through you whilst still being intentional, whilst still showing up,
    while still taking the aligned action. Remember, that 20% in the
    action you take is still important. I have seen so many of my
    clients shift from manufactured manifestation through to surrendered
    manifestation, and I’ve seen them change their lives just with this.
    For me, I was in a place where I was 23 years old, and I had just
    manifested my first million dollars in that company. And I said,
    “Okay, well, you know what? I want to impact more people. I want to
    generate even more income.” And I started trying to do all these
    things differently. I started trying to figure out and take
    different action and join the pieces together. And I still kept
    making the same amount of money each and every single month until I
    understood surrendered manifestation, until I understood that, hang
    on, there’s a greater process available. And the minute I understood
    this and I went deeper into surrendered manifestation, my money
    results, my impact results, my service results, everything shifted
    through that company and through my life. And I’ve seen so many of
    my clients activate this as well. So the question now is, okay, I
    understand surrendered manifestation. And you’re probably thinking,
    yes, I would love to live my life from this place. How do you get
    into surrendered manifestation? How does this work? Well, here’s
    what’s interesting. Surrendered manifestation is your natural state.
    It’s who you are at your core. You’re not born to control everything
    and struggle and push and hustle. No, you’re born to be. You’re born
    to allow; you’re born to receive. So instead of “How do I tap into
    surrendered manifestation?” The question really actually is “What’s
    blocking it? What’s stopping you from being in your natural state of
    surrendered manifestation?” And there’s one answer to that, control.
    So when it comes to understanding control, it’s important to
    remember that the things we can control are our intentions. The
    things we can control is anchoring in our desires, but ultimately we
    can’t fully control how our intentions will manifest. We can’t
    control exactly how something is going to show up. And if we do
    that, we block our manifestations. So the key to this is to
    surrender the “how.” The key to this is to surrender and be okay
    with maybe not knowing exactly how this is going to happen. We’re
    going to talk about how to go deeper on this and with this with the
    next lesson. But for now, it’s important that we start anchoring in
    some of this soul work. So, I want to hear from you for your first
    piece of soul work, what are your biggest takeaways and
    breakthroughs and aha moments from this lesson specifically? Go
    ahead and post them with the Tribe, so you can be witnessed and
    seen, and also share your breakthroughs together. Then for the
    second piece of soul work, go ahead and create a list of all of the
    ways that you have attempted to control the process of
    manifestation. For example, maybe you’ve overthought things in the
    past. Maybe you’ve said, “Okay, I want this to happen, but it has to
    happen like this.” Maybe you haven’t been open to the infinite
    possibilities and the magical synchronistic ways that the universe
    is looking to line up your manifestations in front of you. Get clear
    on that. And then for task number three, I want to hear your
    commitments. We talked about this in the very beginning.
    Manifestation is a deep process of your own commitments. So what are
    you now committed to either no longer doing or saying or thinking in
    order to actually relinquish control and condition yourself piece by
    piece, day by day, moment by moment into a state of surrendered
    manifestation? What’s going to change? What’s going to change on the
    inside, and what’s going to change on the outside? What does that
    look like? I’m so excited for you to go deep with this, and we are
    peeling back even more layers. So make sure you get really clear and
    specific with these layers of soul work ’cause I’m excited to go
    into the next steps of the process with you. Enjoy.

Powerful Visioning

====================

LESSON 4: Allow Yourself to Dream Again

<v ->Welcome back to the next phase of this manifestation Quest. Now
that you have the fundamentals of manifesting under your belt, we get to
go a layer deeper into powerful visioning. Make sure that you’re staying
on top of all of the soul work because everything works in an exact
formula layer by layer, piece by piece. So, here’s what I know for sure
when it comes to manifesting. If you don’t claim what it is that you
truly desire, you will 100% never manifest it. So many of us have this
deep childhood conditioning that is blocking us and stopping us from our
true dreams, our big dreams. So many of us have all of this conditioning
from external forces, from society, from our parents, telling us we
should do this with our lives; we must do this; this is what is expected
of you; this is what is the logical next step. And as humans, sometimes
we block the big visions and the big dreams that are dying to come
through us, our soul’s initiations, our soul’s visions, our soul’s
pathways, our soul’s missions that are looking to be embodied and
manifested right here, right now. So, when it comes to starting to set
up your vision, being unapologetic with your vision, going deep into
what your vision gets to look like, it’s really important that we all
allow ourselves to receive our dreams and our visions that are actually
in alignment with our highest self. We’re going to be working deeply
later in this Quest with the highest iteration of you. But for now, it’s
important to know that you get to manifest from a place when it comes to
your vision, not from a place of what people expect of you, not from
what you’ve done in the past, not from what is the next logical step;
you get to do this in alignment with your soul. Now, alignment is a word
that is thrown around a lot in the personal development industry, but
what does alignment actually mean? Alignment means is your vision lined
up to your soul’s pathway? At a soul level, what is it that you actually
desire? Now, the mind may not know the answer right now. Maybe you are
even feeling overwhelmed with these questions. I know for me, even as a
child, people would ask me, “Regan, what do you want to be when you grow
up?” And I didn’t know, I didn’t have an answer. Why? Probably because
my truest expression is very multifaceted and multidimensional. It’s not
a one-word answer when it comes to answering that question. So, it’s
really important that we’re starting to tune in and work at a soul level
in order to make sure we’re living an even greater alignment. When you
are living in an aligned place with your vision, you know that you’re on
mission; you know that you’re on purpose. You wake up every single day
happy and satisfied and fulfilled and excited. And you go to sleep at
night knowing that you are doing what you are here to actually do in
whatever way that looks like for you. And that way is going to be
different for every single person in this Quest. So, we’re not going to
be answering this from the mind; we’re going to be using the mind in
order to allow you to receive the next layer of what your soul would
love you to see and experience when it comes to your vision. I have
created and founded and developed a powerful method in order to help you
do this. This is the Energetic Architecture Method. This uses the mind
but works beyond the mind into the energetic field around us to actually
help you access the deeper spiritual layers of your being and your
highest self in order for you to get clarity on your next step. In order
for you to get clarity on your big picture vision, and be totally raw
and real and unapologetic of what that vision looks like. So, we’re
going to be using the Energetic Architecture Method in a short
activation that I’m going to guide you through. And if you haven’t gone
through one of my activations before, at your end, it’s simple and it’s
easy. You get to close your eyes; you get to receive. And if you feel
that your mind comes in the way or you start overthinking, just bring
yourself back to my voice; bring yourself back to your breath, and allow
yourself to be gentle in this process, removing any of the control,
removing any attachment, removing any expectations, and instead allow
yourself to simply be in this process. And then after we go through this
process, you’ll have specific soul tasks to go into in order to help you
have even deeper clarity of what your next steps are when it comes to
anchoring in and locking in your most powerful vision. So, we’re about
to go into the activation. Make sure that you are sitting or lying in a
comfortable space, somewhere where you don’t have any interruptions,
where you can be totally present and really give yourself this gift of
beginning to activate your vision at a deeper level. Beautiful; so allow
yourself to gently close your eyes, and begin to tune your consciousness
inward right now. Taking a deep breath in and out. And in and out. And
in and out. Beautiful. And as you allow yourself to now draw up even
deeper and deeper and deeper into the state of activation, the state of
remembrance, the state of relaxation, allow yourself to simply ground
into an intention right now for you to begin to receive the next layer
of your soul-aligned vision in whatever way that looks like for you.
That’s right. And as you begin to anchor yourself into this intention
and into this space, go ahead and allow a red laser beam to shoot down
from your tailbone, anchoring you, grounding you, solidifying you into
the center of the Earth. And simultaneously, allow a golden laser beam
of light to shoot up through your crown, connecting you right now to
your unique soul star, allowing you to be guided, grounded, present,
protected, and supported, heaven on Earth embodied right here, right
now, as you surround yourself with a ball of golden white light.
Beautiful, and simply purify your field, dropping away any frequencies
or vibrations that are not yours and not of the highest, allowing them
to drop out of your system now. Taking a moment to call in your divine
guidance, beings of light of the highest vibration, divinely assigned to
you, and this mission of activating the next level of your soul-aligned
vision, we welcome you into this space. Beautiful. Now, from this place,
go ahead and allow yourself to simply notice that a screen has appeared
before you. This may feel or look like a movie screen or a TV screen;
however it is for you is absolutely perfect. And as you continue to pay
attention and notice this screen before you, you notice there is a movie
playing on the screen. And as you allow yourself to gently watch this
movie, you notice that you are literally witnessing a movie of you
having just manifested your highest aligned vision. That’s right. And go
ahead and notice what’s going on in this movie screen. Notice who’s
around you. Notice what you’re saying to yourself. Notice how good it
feels to witness yourself living into this vision right now. Maybe this
vision is something that you expected; maybe it’s totally unexpected;
either way is absolutely perfect. And that’s…beautiful. And as you
continue to notice the level of details and the pieces of what’s going
on in this movie, go ahead and allow yourself to now change anything in
the movie, anything that could be even better, even more powerful, even
more magical. As you continue to witness yourself having just manifested
your highest aligned vision right now, go ahead and make those changes;
upgrade this movie because it is your movie after all; that’s right.
Beautiful. And now, from this place and this space, go ahead and simply
begin to tune into how it feels to know that this vision is already
done. You are witnessing yourself having just manifested your
soul-aligned vision which is a vision from your future which has
appeared into the right now in order for you to experience it through
your own consciousness across time and space. Tap into the feeling,
knowing that your vision is done now; that’s it. However that feeling
shows up for you is absolutely perfect. And as you allow that feeling to
rush through every single cell of your being, go ahead and now gently
double that feeling; that’s it. Let it rush through every single cell
with every single cell vibrating with this feeling, this state, this
frequency, this emotion right now, and now go ahead and triple that
feeling. That’s it, let it vibrate even stronger. That’s it; feel how it
feels, knowing with every single cell of your being that this vision
from your future is done. It is done; it is done. As you continue to
witness yourself having just manifested your soul-aligned highest
vision, right here, right now. That’s it; beautiful. Now, from this
place, go ahead and surround this movie screen in golden white light.
Beautiful, and now go ahead and allow this screen to now shift into a
ball, a spinning ball of golden white light, shifting, morphing,
transmuting, alchemizing before your very eyes and your consciousness
right now. And now, hover that ball just above you and just before your
head. That’s it; beautiful. And now, allow this ball of spinning golden
white light and coated with all of the pieces of information desired and
required in order for you to embody this highest vision, allow it to
gently drop down, entering your full body system right now. As it begins
to drop, drop down, gently entering your head. Dropping down, down,
down, coming through your throat. Dropping even further and further
until it is resting gently within the center of your heart. Your vision,
your soul-aligned divine vision from your future is now literally
resting within the center of your heart right now. You may feel it; you
may just simply know that it is there; either way is absolutely perfect.
And from this space, this place, this frequency, and deep knowing that
this is done, go ahead and now allow this vision, this ball of spinning
golden white light to now implode into every single cell of your being,
allowing every single cell to wake up; wake up; wake up; wake up as
every single cell allows you to embody this vision, the coding of this
vision, the frequency of this vision, all of the information desired and
required in order for you to be a full and complete embodiment of this
vision. Let every single cell of your being remember it is done. It is
done; it is done. That’s right. And then now from this place, this
space, from this deep knowing and remembrance, this deep access point of
your vision, go ahead and allow this now to ground into your body, into
your system, into every single cell of your being right now. Grounding,
solidifying, anchoring this upgrade into place. Beautiful. As you begin
to now seal up your field, having so much gratitude for your guides,
your beings of light of the highest vibration. Thank you for guiding and
supporting and witnessing this process. Having so much gratitude for
yourself, the alchemist that you are, the manifestor that you are,
allowing yourself to be bold enough and brave enough to receive this big
picture vision right here, right now. It is done; it is done; it is
done. And from this space and this place, allow yourself to now gently
tune back into your body, back into your breath, coming back into the
space. And when you’re ready, gently opening your eyes, coming back in
your own rhythm. Hmm, beautiful. Okay, welcome back. So happy that
you’ve just gone through your first energetic architecture activation.
Really trust your rhythm now. This may be short, but this is extremely
deep work. And this works through every single layer of your being, your
energetic field, your physical body, your mental body, your emotional
body, all your spiritual layers. So, just really trust your rhythm.
Maybe it’s important you have some space and some time to integrate
this. Maybe you feel ready to jump into your day; make sure you drink a
lot of water after all of these activations. And what is really
important now is that you go into the first layer of soul work actually
reflect in whatever way is perfect for you with whatever came up for you
during this activation. So, for this task, this layer of soul work,
journal and ask yourself, “If I was to be totally unapologetic with what
it is that I actually desire, what would I ask for?” Or you could ask
yourself, “If I was to wave a magic wand and allow myself to manifest
whatever it is that I’m looking for in my life at a soul level, what
would be going on? What would you give yourself permission to dream
into?” Now, when you journal on this, be clear and be specific; allow
yourself to really get into detail around what this gets to look like.
Now, for the second layer of the soul task, allow yourself to go ahead
and create two specific intentions. You’re going to do one specifically
for the manifestation during this Quest, so on or before your completion
date of this Quest. And then, you’re going to create another intention,
another manifestation, and this one is to be for a longer period of
time. So, for the second one, what we’ve seen works really well is a
time period of anywhere between one month to about 12 months out.
Anything after that can be a bit challenging and a bit long; anything
shorter than that, you’re going to be too close to your Quest
manifestation. So, when you’re doing this, be clear and be specific.
Many people when they’re setting their intentions say, “Oh, you know,
I’d like to manifest financial abundance.” Well, what does that look
like for you? If I say, “Okay, well, financial abundance… let me give
you more abundance of money; let me give you another $10.” Is that going
to be your manifestation? Probably not. Be clear and be specific. Now,
when you go into this, I want you to write both of these manifestations
out as if they are already done. This looks something like “I am so
happy and grateful that I have manifested this manifestation X, Y, Z,”
whatever that is for you, on or before this certain date and time. So,
you’re not hoping and praying and wishing that maybe one day your
manifestation will be true; you are anchoring it and embodying it and
allowing it to already be solidified in the now. Now also, when you get
clear on these manifestations, it’s important that they have a feeling
to them of, “Okay, this feels big; this feels new. I might not know how
to do this, but I have a feeling that this is going to be my reality. I
have a feeling this is going to happen.” So, it should feel like a bit
of a stretch but at the same time, a yes from your soul. So, when you do
this, share your two specific manifestations into the Tribe; make sure
you share them as if they’re already done. And I’m superexcited to hear
what your anchoring in after this process, and I’ll see you in the next
lesson.

====================

LESSON 4: Meditation - Activate Your True Vision

- Beautiful. So allow yourself to gently close your eyes and begin to tune your consciousness inward right now. Taking a deep breath in and out and in and out, and in and out. And beautiful. And as you allow yourself to now draw up even deeper and deeper and deeper into the state of activation, the state of remembrance, the state of relaxation, allow yourself to simply ground into an intention right now for you to begin to receive the next layer of your soul aligned vision in whatever way that looks like for you. That's right. And as you begin to anchor yourself into this intention and into this space, go ahead and allow a red laser beam to shoot down from your tailbone, anchoring you, grounding you, solidifying you into the center of the earth. And simultaneously allow a golden laser beam of light to shoot up through your crown, connecting you right now to your unique soul star, allowing you to be guided, grounded, present, protected, and supported heaven on earth. Embodied right here, right now as you surround yourself with a ball of golden, white light, beautiful. And simply purify your field, dropping away any frequencies or vibrations that are not yours and not of the highest, allowing them to drop out of your system. Now, taking a moment to call in your divine guidance beings of light, of the highest vibration divinely assigned to you. And this mission of activating the next level of your soul aligned vision. We welcome you into this space. Beautiful. Now from this place, go ahead and allow yourself to simply notice that a screen has appeared before you. This may feel or look like a movie screen or a TV screen, however it is for you is absolutely perfect. And as you continue to pay attention and notice the screen before you, you notice there is a movie playing on the screen. And as you allow yourself to gently watch this movie, you notice that you are literally witnessing a movie of you having just manifested your highest aligned vision. That's right. And go ahead and notice what's going on in this movie screen. Notice who's around you. Notice what you're saying to yourself. Notice how good it feels to witness yourself living into this vision right now. Maybe this vision is something that you expected, maybe it's totally unexpected. Either way is absolutely perfect. And that's right. Beautiful. And as you continue to notice the level of details and the pieces of what's going on in this movie, go ahead and allow yourself to now change anything in the movie. Anything that could be even better, even more powerful, even more magical. As you continue to witness yourself having just manifested your highest aligned vision right now, go ahead and make those changes. Upgrade this movie because it is your movie after all. That's right. Beautiful. And now, from this place in this space, go ahead and simply begin to tune into how it feels to know that this vision is already done. You are witnessing yourself having just manifested your soul aligned vision, which is a vision from your future, which has appeared into the right now in order for you to experience it through your own consciousness, across time and space, tap into the feeling knowing that your vision is done now. That's it. However that feeling shows up for you is absolutely perfect. And as you allow that feeling to rush through every single cell of your being, go ahead and now gently double that feeling. That's it. Let it rush through every single cell with every single cell vibrating, with this feeling, this state, this frequency, this emotion right now. And now go ahead and triple that feeling. That's it. Let it vibrate even stronger. That's it. Feel how it feels knowing with every single cell of your being that this vision from your future is done. It is done. It is done as you continue to witness yourself having just manifested your soul aligned. Highest vision right here, right now. That's it. Beautiful. Now from this place, go ahead and surround this movie screen in golden, white light. Beautiful. And now go ahead and allow this screen to now shift into a ball, a spinning ball of golden white light shifting, morphing, transmuting alchemizing before your very eyes and your consciousness right now. And now hover that ball just above and just before your head. That's it. Beautiful. And now, allow this ball of spitting gold, white light, ENC coated with all of the pieces of information desired and required. In order for you to embody this highest vision, allow it to gently drop down, entering your four body system right now as it begins to drop, drop down, gently entering your head, dropping down, down, down, coming through your throat, dropping even further and further until it is resting gently within the center of your heart. Your vision, your soul aligned divine vision from your future is now literally resting within the center of your heart right now. You may feel it, you may just simply know that it is there. Either way is absolutely perfect. And from this space, this place, this frequency and deep knowing that this is done, go ahead and now allow this vision, this ball of spinning gold, white light, to now implode into every single cell of your being, allowing every single cell to wake up. Wake up, wake up. Wake up as every single cell allows you to embody this vision, the coding of this vision, the frequency of this vision, all of the information desired and required. In order for you to be a full and complete embodiment of this vision, let every single cell of your being remember, it is done. It is done. It is done. That's right. And now from this place, this space, from this deep knowing and remembrance, this deep access point of your vision, go ahead and allow this now to ground into your body, into your system, into every single cell of your being right now, grounding, solidifying, anchoring this upgrade into place. Beautiful. As you begin to now seal up your field, having so much gratitude for your guides, your beings of light, of the highest vibration, thank you for guiding and supporting and witnessing this process, having so much gratitude for yourself, the alchemist that you are, the manifesto that you are allowing yourself to be bold enough and brave enough to receive this big picture vision right here, right now. It is done. It is done. It is done. And from this space and this place, allow yourself to now gently tune back into your body, back into your breath, coming back into the space, and when you are ready, gently opening your eyes, coming back in your own rhythm. Mm. Beautiful.

====================

LESSON 5: Your Total Life Analysis

<v ->Welcome back. Now that you’ve begun to explore your big picture
vision and what that looks like for you, now, we go into the total life
analysis. You see, in order to manifest what you dream of, you must get
raw and real with where you’re at in every area of your life. I know we
are focusing on one category of life through this Quest for both of your
manifestations and intentions, but at the end of the day, we are
holistic beings, and every area of our life is not separate. In fact,
everything is deeply interconnected. I’ve seen so many people focus on
expanding their wealth container, and then all of a sudden their
relationships get better, and their health improves. When we have a
holistic approach to manifesting, what happens is that we get these
magical upgrades through every area of our lives. You don’t want to be
the type of person who only focuses on one area of your life because
what can happen is that you become a master in that area, but it can
also affect the other areas in a negative way. We all know that person
who’s made a lot of money, but their health has gone down the drain. Or,
we know the person where they’re really fit and healthy, but they’re
struggling with their finances. You get to have it all on your terms
right now. And although we focus on one area, it’s important to sync
this up holistically. We do this by looking at every single area of our
life, getting raw and real with where we’re currently at, and then we
start raising the bar and raising that standard. We don’t necessarily
always get in life what we dream about, but we do get what we are
willing to tolerate. Let me say that again. You’re going to get what you
are willing to tolerate. So, if you’re not sure what you are tolerating
in your life right now, take a look at your life, and specifically in
the focus area that you’re focusing on take a look at where you’re at
with this. You are living into your minimum standard. Your minimum
standard through every area of your life. Right now exactly as your
reality is, you are living into your minimum standard of health, your
minimum standard of wealth, of relationships, your minimum standard with
your mindset, your emotions, your purpose, your passion, your
contribution, and your spirituality. So, when we start realizing that
we’re at this minimum standard, the fun part of this is that you get to
start raising the bar. You get to start shifting and raising your level
of tolerance. So once again you are going to get what you are willing to
tolerate. Imagine that there are two men and they both live identical
lives, and they both have identical businesses, and some crisis happens
in both of their businesses. Now, one of the men, he winds up homeless.
He’s an alcoholic. He’s living on the street. He’s telling himself, “I’m
never going to create a life that I love ever again.” And the other man
instead utilizes that opportunity and unlocks the gifts and the
breakthroughs and actually creates an even more powerful business than
what he had before. What is different about these two men? Well, the
first man had an unconscious level of tolerance that allowed him as a
minimum standard to wind up homeless. Where the other man said, “I would
never tolerate that,” and did whatever he needed to do to make sure that
that wasn’t his reality. You need to go all in with your new level of
tolerance. And by the way, when you are raising your level of tolerance,
it doesn’t mean that everything’s bad. I’ve worked with
multi-multimillionaires who have said, “You know what? I’m so happy and
grateful for everything that I’ve created. And this is my minimum
standard. I’m raising that. I’m raising the bar to the next level of
income, to the next level of impact.” And I’ve seen them shift and
accelerate, but how do they do this? They do this from gratitude. They
do this by accepting nothing less than their new minimum standard with a
deep inner commitment, but from gratitude. ’Cause it’s very difficult to
shift if you’re coming from judgment, if you’re coming from complacency,
if you’re coming from not enoughness and scarcity, and we’re going to
talk deeply about scarcity and abundance as we go further into this
Quest. But it’s really important to remember for now that gratitude is
the key. So as you reset your minimum standard, as you begin to raise
the bar whilst being totally raw and real with where you’re at and
having deep gratitude for where you’re at, but accepting nothing less
than the new standard and your new minimum. From this place, you then
get to be that version of you. You get to be the version that walks and
talks and thinks and acts from that new standard of tolerance. So for
your soul work for this lesson, I want you to take every single category
of your life, every single area, not just your focus area, all of them.
And I want you to look at them, and I want you to rate them out of 10,
10 being they can’t get any better. They’re absolutely perfect. You
couldn’t even imagine how they could get better. And by the way, if
you’re a 10, please teach me how. As humans, we’re always shifting,
growing, and evolving. And a 1 is that, that area of life is down and
out. It’s in distress. It really needs work. Get raw and get real
because it’s from this place of awareness through gratitude that you’re
then going to start anchoring your new level of tolerance. So then after
you’ve done that, the second soul task is to look at every single area
of life. And you are now going to raise your level of tolerance. So what
I want you to do in every area, once again is write out your new minimum
standard. So for example, let’s use money as an example. If you have
$40,000 in your savings account right now you might say, “Okay, cool.
I’m aware of that and grateful for that. But my new minimum standard is
$50,000.” So you write this out as if it’s done. “I’m so happy and
grateful that my new minimum standard or my new minimum level of
tolerance is that I already have at least $50,000 in my savings
account.” You anchor that in and make sure you share these as well into
the Tribe. Now for the third piece, in your focus area, now that you’ve
anchored in your new minimum standards, I want you to ask yourself how
will you now choose to be? Now that you begin to live into this minimum
standard, you’re going to notice that this requires some different
behaviors, some different actions, and maybe some different thoughts in
your internal reality. Maybe you start doing some different things in
that specific focus area. Maybe you stop doing some things which are
sabotaging this area. You’re going to look at this and actually write
out “This is how I choose to be.” Write it out in detail; share it
within the Tribe. So the next piece around this is that we are going to
activate this. We’re going to go deeper and begin to solidify your new
level of tolerance. Once again, this is a closed-eye process, using the
Energetic Architecture Method. You get to sit or lie in a comfortable
position as I guide you through this. And remember, if your mind begins
to wander just bring yourself back to my voice, and bring yourself back
to your focus and your intention in this process. Let’s go. Beautiful.
So let’s dive right in. Making sure you’re sitting or lying in a
comfortable position, and gently begin to close your eyes and turn
inward right now. Taking a deep breath in and out and anchoring yourself
again with a red laser beam from your tailbone into the core of the
earth. And simultaneously allowing a golden laser beam of light to shoot
up through your crown and connect you to your unique soul star. As you
surround yourself with a ball of golden white light, allowing you to be
guided grounded, present, protected, and supported, heaven on earth
embodied right here, right now. Beautiful. Calling in your divine
guidance. Beings of light divinely assigned to assisting you in raising
your minimum standard in integrating this new level of tolerance.
Beautiful. And as you allow yourself to come deeper into the state of
activation of remembrance. Allow yourself to lean into your intention of
integrating this version of you and activating this new minimum
standard, this new level of tolerance in your specific focus area,
specifically aligned to your two intentions right here, right now.
Beautiful. As you begin to drop even deeper, you notice a being of
golden white light has appeared before you. You may feel them. You may
see them. You may just simply know they are there. Either way is
absolutely perfect. And from this place of curiosity and awareness, you
continue to notice that this being of golden white light is a higher
iteration of yourself. The highest iteration of you that’s come back
from your future all the way to right now, in order to support you in
upgrading your minimum standard and stepping embodied into your next
level of tolerance. That’s right. This version of you has already walked
your path and unlocked the gifts it needed to unlock and lived through
the challenges. It already has the consciousness, the frequency, the
emotional intelligence, and the mindset, all of the pieces required in
order to step into that next level version of you that has already
raised your minimum standard. That’s right. So as you connect with this
being of golden white light in front of you, allow yourself to connect
heart-to-heart with this being. Connecting the hearts together with a
golden laser beam of light. That’s right. And beautiful. And in a
moment, we will begin an information transfer which will allow the
information to be transmitted from your highest self all the way through
into the center of your being. All of the information that will be
transmitted will be useful and easily able for you to be integrated and
solidified and have this anchored and grounded into your system.
Beautiful. Allowing this information process to start and take place
now. Beautiful. And you may feel that information coming into the center
of your heart. You may notice tingling through your body. You may just
simply know that the process is taking place; either way is absolutely
perfect. And that’s right. As we begin to now complete this transfer of
information. Beautiful. Any last information transmitting through,
anchoring, grounding, solidifying into your essence. Beautiful. Allowing
the golden laser beam of light connecting you heart-to-heart to now
dissolve, and taking a moment of so much gratitude to thank your highest
self for coming back from your future all the way to right now in order
to facilitate this transmission and this upgrade process. Go ahead and
thank your higher self in whatever way you desire. And now turn your
focus and your attention and your intention back into your own field,
into your own consciousness. As you begin to gently notice what is
different, what is now different within the essence of your being, what
is now different around the integration of your new minimum standard,
what is now different within your unique frequency that you hold, what
is now different with how you show up in alignment to constantly raising
your level of tolerance in this area of your life. Notice what is
different through the subtle layers. You may receive visions, thoughts,
feelings. You may just simply know that this information will be
revealed to you in divine timing. Either way is absolutely perfect.
That’s right. Beautiful. And allowing all of this to integrate and
assimilate within your system and within your field. Beginning to ground
and root all of the information. Sealing up the field right now.
Thanking your divine guidance. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you for
helping and facilitating this process. Thanking your highest self.
Always available to you by the way, one thought away at any time. And
thanking yourself for allowing yourself to be bold enough and brave
enough to integrate this next level to raise your minimum standard.
Beautiful. Anchoring, grounding, solidifying this activation into place,
and gently being aware of your breath and aware of your body. Beautiful.
And now from this place gently coming back. Beginning to open your eyes,
so much love and gratitude. Welcome back. Beautiful. So again, trust
your rhythm; trust your flow; be gentle with your integration process.
And then for your soul work, we want to hear from you. How was this for
you? What is now different now that you’ve activated and integrated this
version of you? And now that you’re choosing to really live in an
embodied way into this new minimum standard with this raised up level of
tolerance, what do you notice within your beingness that is different?
We can’t wait to hear from you in the group. We can’t wait to witness
you in this upgrade. Thank you so much for going deep with me. And I’m
excited to dive deep on the next lesson.

LESSON 6: Get Clear on Your Big Picture Vision

<v ->Welcome back. Now that you’ve allowed yourself to dream into what
it is that you actually desire at a soul level, and now that you’ve
shifted and raised your level of tolerance, you get to go deeper into
actually locking in your vision in order to accelerate it becoming a
reality for you. Now, it’s really important that we go through this
locking-it-in process. I see so many people with huge dreams and huge
goals and huge visions, but they don’t materialize on or when someone
desires because it’s not locked in. When we use energetic architecture,
we’re working through every single layer of your being, and every single
layer must actually be in alignment with what you are looking to call
in. I remember when I first started my online business, and I started at
absolutely from zero, I knew nothing about online business. I didn’t
know how any of it worked. It was a full startup, and I grew that
business and scaled it to be doing over a million dollars in the first
eight months. I was about 25 years old at this time. And many people
then started interviewing me and hearing about this, and they started
asking me, “How did that feel? That must have felt amazing.” And I
remember saying to them, “How did it feel? I mean, yes, it felt amazing.
Of course I was grateful, but I expected it to happen.” That didn’t
happen by default. It didn’t happen by chance. It wasn’t a random
synchronicity series of events. That happened because I prayed into it
and dreamed into it and anchored it in and locked it in every single day
with every single breath. I spent so much time playing and locking in
that manifestation and the impact and the service that I got to create
with that, that when it actually happened in my life, it was this energy
of, “Wow, that’s really cool. I’m excited, I’m grateful. But of course.
But yeah, I knew that was going to happen. Well, yeah. I dreamed that, I
prayed into that. I manifested that.” So when you start going into your
intentions, we’re going to go through a guided process that’s going to
allow you to begin to now access this of course, manifestation energy.
It’s going to allow you to lock in your vision and start bringing it
into the full and complete embodiment of it, so it can show up in your
reality instead of it just staying as a vision or staying as a dream. So
remember through this Quest, you’re working on your two manifestations
simultaneously. Your first one that is going to manifest on or before
the end of this Quest, and then remember, you have your long-term
manifestation. Both should feel stretchy, but an energy of, yes this is
going to happen. An energy of of course this gets to happen, okay? So
when we go through this process, you are going to actually do this
activation twice. I’m going to guide it once, and you’re going to do it
for the first time focusing on your Quest manifestation. And then for
the next time, you are going to be focusing on your bigger picture
manifestation. Remembering that these are interlinked, remembering that
these have the same focus point, and remember that the deeper you go
with one of them, the more it’s going to accelerate you going deeper
into these next places, okay? So in order to set up this energetic
architecture activation, you need to jot down a couple of things before
we get started. Firstly, you need to be very clear as you already are on
your intention and what that looks like. You need to be clear as you
should be already on the date that it’s going to manifest on or before
that certain date and time. If you’ve set a goal of say six months or 12
months, what is the date? Now’s your opportunity to pick the date. And
then the last thing you need to know is how are you going to measure
this? How will you know when it is done? For example, you might say,
“Okay, well, Regan, I have this intention; it’s on the focus area of
health, and my goal is to release five kgs.” I’m going to say, “Great.
Okay, if you knew that was done, how would you prove it?” And you might
say, “Well, my jeans fit differently.” Or “I can see that I’m different
in the mirror.” Or “I now step on the scales and it says this.” It’s
measurable, okay? So make sure that you are really clear on this. What
is your intention on or before when, and then how are you going to know
when it’s done. Remembering that as I guide you through this, focus
firstly on the Quest manifestation, and then secondly, you’ll come out
of this, and we’ll reset, and you’ll do it again, but for your longer
term manifestation. Now let’s get started. Okay, so take a moment to now
sit or lie in a comfortable position, allowing yourself to gently close
your eyes, turning inward right now. Being aware of your breath;
breathing in your manifestation; breathing out anything not aligned to
your manifestation. Breathing in your intention; breathing out anything
not aligned with that intention. Breathing in, and one more time
breathing out and releasing. Beautiful. And from this place, we begin to
anchor everything in through your intention right now, as you allow
yourself through your own consciousness to decree and declare the full
and complete integration and locking in of your specific manifestation
on or before this specific date and time. Allow yourself to ground into
that now. Good. Now as you allow a red laser beam to shoot down from
your tailbone, anchoring you, grounding you, solidifying you into the
crystalline core of the earth, and simultaneously allowing a golden
laser beam of light to shoot up through your crown, connecting you right
now to your unique soul star, allowing you to be guided, grounded,
present, protected and supported. Heaven on earth embodied right here,
right now, as you surround yourself with a ball of golden white light.
Cleansing, purifying your system and your field, and allowing any
energies or frequencies or vibrations that are not aligned with the full
and complete locking in of your manifestation to drop, dissolve, and
clear out of your system. Now that’s it. And now calling in your divine
guidance beings of light of the highest vibration, divinely assigned to
supporting you in locking in your manifestation. Welcome; welcome;
welcome into this space. Beautiful. Now go ahead and pull up a screen in
front of you. You know how to do this. We’ve done this before. Maybe a
TV screen or a movie screen. Either way is perfect. And as you continue
to witness the screen in front of you, you go ahead and you notice that
you are witnessing yourself in a movie having just manifested your
divine intention. How do you know that you’ve manifested it? What’s
going on? Watch that movie. Witness yourself. Notice how you are able to
measure your intention clearly, precisely, right now. Beautiful. Now
from this place, go ahead and as you continue to witness yourself having
just manifested your intention in the movie screen right now, you
continue to notice that a dial has appeared on the side of the screen.
And as you gently reach out to play with this dial, you notice that as
you shift and play with this dial, it alters the brightness of the
movie. That’s it. And so now go ahead, and gently turn this dial up.
That’s it. Turn it up, up, up, making the movie brighter and brighter
and brighter. Turn it up all the way up until it’s pure white light. And
now turn it down. Turn it down, down, all the way down, taking all the
light out of the movie until it’s totally black. And now turn it up.
That’s right. Turn it up so it’s somewhere in the middle. Absolutely
perfect. The exact brightness that it’s meant to be, totally real and
defined, as you continue to witness yourself having just manifested your
divine intention in the movie screen right now. Good. Go ahead and
notice that a second dial has now appeared. And as you’ve reach out to
play with this dial, you notice that this is the volume, and as you
gently turn it up, you’re turning up the volume of the movie, everything
which is going on around you in the movie, but you’re also turning up
all the amazing things that you’re saying to yourself in your own head
in the movie. That’s it. Crank it up; turn it up; turn it up; turn it up
full volume. And now turn it down, down, down, down, down, down. Taking
all the sound out of the movie, a faint whisper, and then no sound. And
now turn it up; turn it up; turn it up; turn it up until the volume is
somewhere in the middle. Absolutely perfect. Sounding totally real.
Exactly how it’s meant to be. As you continue to witness yourself having
just manifested your divine intention in the movie screen right now.
Good; that’s it. Now from this place, this space, this frequency, you
notice a third and final dial has appeared. And this one’s a little bit
different because you are only going to turn it up. That’s it. And as
you gently turn this dial up, you notice that you are turning up the
feeling of how good it feels to be you in this movie. That’s it. Feel
how good it feels to be you having just manifested your divine
intention, and now turn it up. Turn it up; turn it up; turn that feeling
up. Turn it all the way up until it can’t get any stronger, full
feeling, full frequency, full emotion. And now that it’s on full feeling
and it can’t get any stronger, go ahead and double that feeling. That’s
it. Let it rush through every single cell of your being. And now go
ahead and triple that feeling. That’s it. The state that frequency, that
emotion, notice how it’s vibrating through every single cell, and from
this place, this space, having just witnessed yourself, having
manifested your divine intention in the movie screen, now go ahead and
jump into the movie. That’s it. So now you are in the movie, you’re
breathing through your own lungs, witnessing everything. Through your
own eyes, hearing everything exactly perfectly as you’re meant to hear
it. Notice how good it feels to be you in the movie. Double that feeling
again; triple that feeling again; let it rush through every single cell
as you stand there in the movie, completely embodied with the state, the
frequency, and the vibration. That’s it. Notice how good that feels.
Good. Locking, locking, anchoring, solidifying that in right now, and
keeping this state, this frequency, this vibration and these emotions.
Now go ahead and jump out of the screen. That’s it. So once again you
are witnessing yourself. Witnessing yourself having just manifested your
divine intention in the movie screen right now. And from this place, go
ahead and pick up the screen in front of you. You can do this in your
mind’s eye, or you can physically hold your hands out in front of you.
Hold that screen in your hands. Feel it vibrating within your hands. And
we are going to use breath to activate the screen at an even deeper
level. So in a moment, as you feel the screen vibrating within your
hands, you’re going to breathe in all of your life force, energy, and
intention and deep knowingness that this vision is done, and then you’re
going to breathe it into the screen, allowing the screen to receive all
of your energy and activate it at a much deeper level. Here we go. Feel
the screen vibrating in your hands right now. Breathing in. That’s it.
Now breathing out. That’s it. Let the screen vibrate with every single
cell of your breathing; second breath. That’s it. Breathing in. That’s
it. Now breathe out everything you’ve got. That’s it. Letting it vibrate
at an even deeper level, and third and final breath. Breathing in.
Making it as strong as possible, and now breathing out. That’s it.
Letting it vibrate through every single cell becoming one with the
vibration of the screen and the deep remembrance and knowingness that
this is done. And from this place, this space, this energy, this
frequency take this vibrating screen full of all of your life force,
energy and knowingness that it is done. Take it with you, and float up
above now, up out of your body. That’s it. So now you’re hovering above
now, taking this vibrating screen of all of your life force, energy and
deep knowingness, and take this screen, and turn your focus and your
intention out towards your future. That’s it. Go ahead and now float
out, out, out, out, out, out into your future, all the way out into the
specific moment in time that you decree and declare that your
manifestation will be locked, anchored, and solidified into your
reality, on or before this specific moment in time. And when you are
there, hovering just above that moment, just before that moment, from
this place, this space, this frequency, go ahead and drop that screen
down. That’s it. Allowing it to gently sink down, drop down, dropping
deeper and deeper and deeper into that specific moment in time, allowing
it to then anchor, lock, solidify, ground. Now that’s right. As it
begins to grow roots within your field, on or before that exact moment
in time. As you are hovering just above that event, just before that
event, looking down on that event at a soul level across every single
realm, reality, and dimension, go ahead and choose that. Choose it.
Choose it now with every single cell of your being. It is done. It is
done. It is done. That’s right. It is done. It is done. It is done.
Good. Locking, anchoring, solidifying this choice point, recording this
in your timeline within your system. And from this place of deep
knowingness and deep remembrance, go ahead with so much gratitude, and
gently begin to float all the way back to now. Only as quickly as you
can stop and notice all the events in your future shift and realign
themselves in light of your new manifestation. Notice how you shift and
constantly raise your level of tolerance. Notice how you show up for you
and constantly redefine your vision. That’s it. And continue to float
all the way back to now, only as quickly as you can stop and notice the
version of you that you choose to bring to the table each and every
single day. Notice how you take action and accelerate your inner reality
and your belief system by 2%. Notice how this creates the compound
ripple effects and the waves that shift and alter and recalibrate your
reality. And that’s it. And now go ahead and float all the way back to
now, until you are hovering above right now, allowing yourself to come
back into your body, back into your breath, anchoring all of this in,
and allowing yourself to simply remember how powerful you are. I am a
born manifestor. I manifest my manifestations with ease, with grace, and
with flow. My intention is done. It is done. It is done. I’m taking a
moment of gratitude to thank you, divine guidance, beings of light of
the highest vibration; thank you for showing up and supporting us in
this process, and thanking yourself for the manifestor that you are. So
much love and so much gratitude. Now, decree and declare that all
shifts, upgrades, and transformations continue, 24 hours a day, seven
days a week until they’re fully actualized, integrated, embodied,
stabilized, and complete. And may they continue to activate and
stabilize with total ease, total grace, and total flow. It is done. It
is done. It is done. Locked in of course. And so it is. Beautiful. And
so as you allow yourself to come back into this space, welcome back.
Once again, deep journey; trust your rhythm; trust your flow; drink lots
of water. And now the next layer of soul work to solidify all of this.
What do you notice is different? What came up for you? And most
importantly, what are you committed to from here? Post in the group;
share with the Tribe, and make sure you now repeat this and the soul
work task to also lock in your bigger picture manifestation as well. I’m
proud of you. I love you so much. Thank you for going so deep, and I’m
excited for the next step of the journey.

LESSON 6: Meditation - Anchor in Your Vision

- Okay, so take a moment to now sit or lie in a comfortable position, allowing yourself to gently close your eyes, turning inward right now, being aware of your breath, breathing in your manifestation, breathing out anything not aligned to your manifestation, breathing in your intention, breathing out anything not aligned with that intention and breathing in. And one more time, breathing out and releasing. Beautiful. And from this place, we begin to anchor everything in through your intention right now as you allow yourself through your own consciousness to decree and declare the full and complete integration and locking in of your specific manifestation on or before this specific date and time. Allow yourself to ground into that now as you would allow a red laser beam to shoot down from your tailbone, anchoring you around and you solidifying you into the crystalline core of the earth and simultaneously allowing a golden laser beam of light to shoot up through your crown, connecting you right now to your unique soul star, allowing you to be guided, grounded, present, protected, and supported heaven on earth. Embodied right here, right now as you surround yourself with a ball of golden, white light cleansing, purifying your system and your field, and allowing any energies or frequencies or vibrations that are not aligned with the full and complete locking in of your manifestation to drop, dissolve, and clear out of your system. Now that's it. And now calling in your divine guidance beings of light, of the highest vibration divinely assigned to supporting you and locking in your manifestation. Welcome, welcome, welcome into this space. Beautiful. Now go ahead and pull up a screen in front of you. You know how to do this. We've done this before. It may be a TV screen or a movie screen. Either way is perfect. And as you continue to witness the screen in front of you, you go ahead and you notice that you are witnessing yourself in a movie having just manifested your divine intention. How do you know that you've manifested it? What's going on? Watch that movie. Witness Yourself. Notice how you are able to measure your intention clearly, precisely right now. Beautiful. Now from this place, go ahead and as you continue to witness yourself, having just manifested your intention in the movie screen right now, you continue to notice that a dial has appeared on the side of the screen. And as you gently reach out to play with this dial, you notice that as you shift and play with this dial, it alters the brightness of the movie. That's it. And so now go ahead and gently turn this dial up. That's it. Turn it up, up, up. Making the movie brighter and brighter and brighter. Turn it up all the way up until it's pure white light. And now turn it down. Turn it down, down all the way down. Taking all the light out of the movie until it's totally black. And now turn it up. That's right. Turn it up so it's somewhere in the middle. Absolutely perfect. The exact brightness that it's meant to be totally real and defined as you continue to witness yourself having just manifested your divine intention in the movie screen right now. Good. Go ahead and notice that a second dial has now appeared. And as you reach out to play with this dial, you notice that this is the volume. And as you gently turn it up, you're turning up the volume of the movie, everything which is going on around you in the movie, but you're also turning up all the amazing things that you're saying to yourself in your own head in the movie. That's it. Crank it up, turn it up, turn it up, turn it up. Full volume. And now turn it down, down, down, down, down, down. Taking all the sound out of the movie, a faint whisper and then no sound. And now turn it up. Turn it up, turn it up. Turn it up until the volume is somewhere in the middle, absolutely perfect. Sounding totally real, exactly how it's meant to be as you continue to witness yourself having just manifested your divine intention in the movie screen right now. Good. That's it. Now from this place, this space, this frequency, you notice a third and final dial has appeared. And this one's a little bit different because you are only going to turn it up. That's it. And as you gently turn the style up, you notice that you are turning up the feeling of how good it feels to be you in this movie. That's it. Feel how good it feels to be you having just manifested your divine intention. And now turn it up, turn it up, turn it up, turn that feeling up. Turn it all the way up until it's can't get any stronger, full feeling, full frequency, full emotion. And now that it's on full feeling and it can't get any stronger, go ahead and double that feeling. That's it. Let it rush through every single cell of your being. And now go ahead and triple that feeling. That's it. The state, that frequency, that emotion. Notice how's vibrating through every single cell. And from this place, this space, having just witnessed yourself, having manifested your divine intention in the movie screen. Now go ahead and jump into the movie. That's it. So now are in the movie. You are breathing through your own lungs, witnessing everything through your own eyes, hearing everything exactly perfectly as you are meant to hear it. Notice how good it feels to be you in the movie. Double that feeling again. Triple that feeling again. Let it rush through every single cell as you stand there in the movie, completely embodied with the state, the frequency and the vibration. That's it. Notice how good that feels. Good locking, locking, anchoring, solidifying that in right now and keeping this state, this frequency, this vibration, and these emotions. Now go ahead and jump out of the screen. That's it. So once again, you are witnessing yourself, witnessing yourself, having just manifested your divine intention in the movie screen right now. And from this place, go ahead and pick up the screen in front of you. You can do this in your mind's eye or you can physically hold your hands out in front of you. Hold that screen in your hands, feel it vibrating within your hands. And we are going to use breath to activate the screen at an even deeper level. So in a moment, as you feel the screen vibrating within your hands, you're going to breathe in all of your life force energy and intention and deep knowingness that this vision is done. And then you're going to breathe it into the screen, allowing the screen to receive all of your energy and activate it at a much deeper level. Here we go. Feel the screen vibrating in your hands right now. Breathing in. That's it. Now breathing out. That's it. Let the screen vibrate with every single cell of your bringing sec. Second breath. That's it. Breathing in. That's it. Now breathe out everything you've got. That's it. Letting it vibrate at an even deeper level. And third and final breath, breathing in, making it as strong as possible. And now breathing out. That's it. Letting it vibrate through every single cell, becoming one with the vibration of the screen and the deep remembrance and knowingness that this is done. And from this place, this space, this energy, this frequency, take this vibrating screen full of all of your life force energy and knowingness that it is done. Take it with you and float up above now, up out of your body. That's it. So now you're hovering above, now taking this vibrating screen of all of your life force energy and deep knowingness, and take this screen and turn your focus and your intention out towards your future. That's it. Go ahead and now float out, out, out, out, out, out into your future, all the way out into the specific moment in time that you decree and declare that your manifestation will be locked, anchored, and solidified into your reality on or before the specific moment in time. And when you were there hovering just above that moment, just before that moment from this place, this space, this frequency. Go ahead and drop that screen down. That's it. Allowing it to gently sink down, drop down, dropping deeper and deeper and deeper into that specific moment in time, allowing it to then anchor, lock, solidify ground now that's right as it begins to grow roots within your field on or before that exact moment in time as you are hovering just above that event just before that event. Looking down on that event at a soul level across every single realm, reality and dimension. Go ahead and choose that. Choose it. Choose it now with every single soul of your being. It is done.

- It is done. It's done. That's right, it's done. It's done, it's done. Walking,

- Anchoring, solidifying this choice point, recording this in your timeline, within your system, and from this place of deep knowingness and deep remembrance, go ahead with so much gratitude and gently begin to float all the way back to now. Only as quickly as you can. Stop and notice all the events in your future shift and realign themselves in light of your new manifestation. Notice how you shift and constantly raise your level of tolerance. Notice how you show up for you and constantly redefine your vision. That's it. And continue to float all the way back to now. Only as quickly as you can. Stop and notice the version of you that you choose to bring to the table each and every single day. Notice how you take action and accelerate your inner reality and your belief system by 2%. Notice how this creates the compound ripple effects and the waves that shift and alter and recalibrate your reality. That's it. And now go ahead and float all the way back to now until you are hovering above right now, allowing yourself to come back into your body, back into your breath, anchoring all of this in and allowing yourself to simply remember how powerful you are. I am a born manifester. I manifest my manifestations with ease, with grace, and with flow. My intention is done. It is done. It's done. I'm taking a moment of gratitude to thank you divine guidance beings of light, of the highest vibration. Thank you for showing up and supporting us in this process and thanking yourself for the manifesta that you are so much love and so much gratitude. My decree, and declare that all shifts, upgrades and transformations continue 24 hours a day, seven days a week, until they're fully actualized, integrated, embodied, stabilized, and complete. And may they continue to activate and stabilize with total ease, total grace, and total flow. It is done. It is done. It is done. Locks

- In of course. And so it's beautiful.

Expanding Your Capacity To Receive

====================

LESSON 7: Build Awareness of Your Energetic Containers

<v ->Welcome back to this next phase of the manifestation Quest which is
all about increasing your capacity to receive. We are only able to
manifest what we have the capacity to hold energetically, and all
successful manifestors understand this concept, and they use it a lot to
accelerate their results. So, here’s the thing. In order to manifest
what you desire, you must have energetic containers for your
manifestations to flow into. And if you’re not familiar with the term
energetic container, these are intentional spaces that you create within
your own consciousness in order to hold your manifestations, because
everything is energy at the end of the day. And so, it’s important that
we are working through our energetic field in order to hold what we
desire. For some of us, it’s almost like we have buckets, and then our
manifestations come into our life, and there’s holes in these buckets,
and they feel like they’re just dropping through our fingerprints. And
sometimes, when we are looking to call in a manifestation in our life,
sometimes we come into this place where we haven’t solidified the
containers, which means the energy doesn’t understand or know where to
be directed or where to flow in our lives and in our reality. Everything
is energy. If you’re looking to manifest more love in your life, maybe a
beautiful relationship, if you’re looking to accelerate your health, or
if you’re looking to tap into your next layer of purpose or business,
all of that requires containers in order to hold that. Now how do we
start setting up these containers? Well, we’re going to go into a
powerful activation to make this possible, but before we do that, it’s
superimportant to understand why. Why do you desire this manifestation?
What will that specifically give you? And when you start doing this, you
start actually creating a space for that in your field because your
manifestation energy then understands, “Oh, I get it. I am meant to flow
into this person’s life for this particular reason.” So if you desire to
manifest a certain amount of money, why? What will that actually give
you? Start creating the space for that. To be successful with
manifestation, you have to work through every layer of your being, your
physical layer, your emotional layer, your mental body, your energetic
bodies and layers. And this lesson is going to focus in on the energetic
layers using your energetic field. Now, the term energetic field may
also not be so familiar to you. What is the energetic field? It’s your
energy field around you. Your energy field is encoded with light. At the
end of the day, we are made up of light. And what is light? It is pieces
of information. And what is within those pieces of information? There
are certain geometric patterns and certain layers of geometry. So, when
we start playing with this information, we realize that we’re actually
able to shift the information within our own energetic field in order to
create greater cohesion across every single layer of our being. This
activation that we’re going to go through right now, using the Energetic
Architecture Method, is an activation that works specifically on your
energetic field, helping you tap into your energetic layer and bring it
into greater cohesion so that you are able to anchor in the energetic
containers in your life to actually hold the manifestations that you’re
looking to anchor into your reality. So when we go into this activation,
it’s simple and it’s easy. As usual, I’m going to guide you. All you
need to know is when you focus on your intention, firstly, the
manifestation during this Quest, you just need to simply ask yourself,
“Why do I actually desire this? What is the reason that I’m looking to
call this into my reality?” What will that manifestation give you? And
then you’re going to repeat the process and do the same process around
setting up the energetic containers within your system to then hold your
longer-term manifestation, your manifestation beyond this Quest. So as
we go through this activation, you’ll be guided to set up these
containers within your field, and then we’re going to be running certain
energies through these containers in order to turn them on, activate
them, and actually anchor them and solidify them into your field. This
is working at a very subtle layer. So don’t have any attachments going
into this. You may see a lot; you may feel a lot; you may see or feel
nothing. The only way for these activations not to work is if you don’t
want them to work. So let’s dive right in and get started. Go ahead and
sit or lie in a comfortable position, and allow yourself to gently close
your eyes and drop inwards right now, allowing yourself to center
yourself with your breath, and then lean into your intention, your
specific intention to activate your energetic containers within your
field in order to hold and create space for your divine manifestation.
That’s right. So from this place, we now anchor ourselves by allowing a
red laser beam to shoot down from your tailbone all the way down,
solidifying you into the crystalline core of the earth and
simultaneously allowing a golden laser beam of light to shoot up through
your crown, connecting you right now to your unique soul star, as you
surround yourself with a ball of golden white light and requesting that
any energies, frequencies, or vibrations that are not in alignment with
the full and complete activation of your energetic containers within
your system be dissolved and cleared, dissolved and cleared with ease
out of your field right now. Beautiful. And then from this place, we go
ahead and now begin to gently call in your divine guidance, beings of
light of the highest vibration, divinely assigned to assisting you in
activating your energetic containers; we welcome you into this place.
Please support us, and please guide us in this activation process.
Beautiful. So now we begin to work through the subtle layers of your
energetic field, connecting through your heart, simply to why you desire
these energetic containers to be set up and solidified right now. This
why might be one word; it might be a short sentence. Whatever your why
is, which is personal to you, connect into that right now. Beautiful.
And from this place, go ahead and simply request that the energetic
container in your energetic field that is specifically designed to hold
your manifestation begins to unlock and solidify and take place within
your field right now. Go ahead and notice how this energetic container
is showing up for you. It may look a certain way. It may feel a certain
way. It may sound a certain way. It may be a certain size, a certain
color, a certain vibration. Tune into it right now. And whatever your
experience is of this energetic container is absolutely perfect. That’s
right. Beautiful. So as we now go ahead and gently update the geometries
within this energetic container, allowing them to update right now and
become a full energetic match to your highest self and the highest
frequency that you’re looking to embody in order to hold these divine
manifestations, looking to anchor into this energetic container, go
ahead right now and gently begin to expand this container; that’s it.
Make it bigger and bigger and bigger, larger and larger and larger,
larger than you expected it to be; that’s it. And as these energetic
containers continue to open and expand with ease and with grace, go
ahead and from this place, allow yourself to visualize, see, feel, or
know that your manifestations are now gently coming into these
containers. You may see physical manifestations being held by these
containers. You may feel the energies starting to sprinkle and ground
and activate through your system. You may feel the pieces of information
associated to these manifestations coming into your system. Whatever
your experience is right now is absolutely perfect. I now decree and
declare an acceleration of these energies coming into your field, an
acceleration of these divine manifestations that are held with such ease
and such grace. And as this acceleration continues, notice how easy it
is to hold your manifestations. Notice how effortless it is to simply
hold your manifestations and have them here, present, activated, and
solidified within your field with such grace with such ease. And that’s
right. And now go ahead and simply allow an energy of gratitude to run
through your energetic container. Beautiful. Allowing this energy to
come in, working through the container, updating the container, allowing
it to sink to the highest frequency of gratitude. Beautiful. And now
allow a frequency of love to run through this container. You may see
these energies running through; you may feel them; you may just simply
know this is taking place through the subtle layers of your being;
either way is perfect. That’s right. Allowing the gratitude and the love
to simultaneously run through the containers. Beautiful. And now run a
deep frequency of knowing, a deep frequency of knowing that your
manifestations are held, that your manifestations are supported, that
your manifestations have a place; and notice how good it feels to deeply
know that it is safe and easy to have your manifestations held through
your system with ease and with grace. That’s it. Continuing to run these
energies and run these frequencies, and you may notice how certain parts
of your field begin to light up and open and expand. You may begin to
notice how certain pieces of the geometries within your energetic field
begin to update and come online, returning back to their crystalline
state. You may continue to notice how some of these energies update and
come online and return back to their crystalline state. You may continue
to notice how some old geometries that are no longer useful and not
aligned to these new containers that you have solidified in your field,
you may notice that they simply drop away with ease and with grace.
Perfect. Allowing a continuation of this upgrade, continuation of this
activation. And from this place, go ahead and simply witness your own
energetic field. You may see it; you may feel it. You may just simply
know you are witnessing it right now. And from this place and this
space, allow yourself to have so much gratitude, so much gratitude for
your own capacity to anchor and activate these new spaces within your
system, as dormant parts of your unconscious mind begin to remember. “It
is easy for me to hold my manifestations.” As you begin to remember, “It
is easy for me to increase my capacity to receive.” As dormant parts of
your unconscious mind begin to remember, “It is easy to bring my
energetic field into greater cohesion with the other layers of my
being.” And that’s right. Beautiful. As you allow all of this to anchor,
ground, solidify, growing roots within your field and within your
system, recording all of this right now, remembering that the expansion
of these energetic containers is your natural state. That’s right.
Beautiful. Beginning to now seal up the field, allowing all of this to
anchor and solidify in. These containers are activated and solidified
and grounded. And with so much gratitude coming back to your breath,
back to your body, back to the state, and allowing yourself to gently
come back into the now. And gently opening your eyes. Beautiful.
Trusting your rhythm and your integration process as usual. And remember
to go through this activation twice. We just did this for the first time
for your manifestation on or before the completion date of this Quest,
but remember to do this for your greater manifestation also. And then
for your soul work, we want to hear from you. Share your breakthroughs
in the Tribe. What happened with this activation? What happened through
this lesson? What were the aha moments? What did you realize, and what
do you now notice that is different? I can’t wait to hear from you, and
I’m excited to go into the next layer of expansion with you on the next
lesson. See you then.

====================

LESSON 7: Meditation - Activate Your Energetic Containers

- Go ahead and sit or lie in a comfortable position and allow yourself to gently close your eyes and drop inwards right now. Allowing yourself to center yourself with your breath and then lean into your intention, your specific in intention to activate your energetic containers within your field in order to hold and create space for your divine manifestation. That's right. So from this place, we now anchor ourselves by allowing a red laser beam to shoot down from your tailbone all the way down, solidifying you into the crystalline core of the earth, and simultaneously allowing a golden laser beam of light to shoot up through your crown, connecting you right now to your unique soul star as you surround yourself with a ball of golden white light and requesting that any energy's, frequencies or vibrations that are not in alignment with the full and complete activation of your energetic containers within your system. Be dissolved and cleared. Dissolved and cleared with ease out of your field right now. Beautiful. And then from this place, we go ahead and now begin to gently call in your divine guidance beings of light, of the highest vibration divinely assigned to assisting you in activating your energetic containers. We welcome you into this place. Please support us and please guide us in this activation process. Beautiful. So now we begin to work through the subtle layers of your energetic field, connecting through your heart simply to why you desire these energetic containers to be set up and solidified right now. This why might be one word, it might be a short sentence. Whatever your why is, which is personal to you, connect into that right now. Beautiful. And from this place, go ahead and simply request that the energetic container in your energetic field that is specifically designed to hold your manifestation, begins to unlock and solidify and take place within your field right now. Go ahead and notice how this energetic container is showing up for you. It may look a certain way, it may feel a certain way, it may sound a certain way, it may be a certain size, a certain color, a certain vibration. Tune into it right now. And whatever your experience is of this energetic container is absolutely perfect. And that's right. Beautiful. So as we now go ahead and gently update the geometries within this energetic container, allowing them to update right now and become a full energetic match to your highest self and the highest frequency that you are looking to embody in order to hold these divine manifestations looking to anchor into this energetic container. Go ahead right now and gently begin to expand this container. That's it. Make it bigger and bigger and bigger, larger and larger and larger, larger than you expected it to be. That's it. And as these energetic containers continue to open and expand with ease and with grace, go ahead and from this place, allow yourself to visualize, see, feel, or know that your manifestations are now gently coming into these containers. You may see physical manifestations being held by these containers. You may feel the energies starting to sprinkle and ground and activate through your system. You may feel the pieces of information associated to these manifestations coming into your system. Whatever your experience is right now is absolutely perfect. I now decree and declare an acceleration of these energies coming into your field, an acceleration of these divine manifestations that are held with such ease and such grace. And as this acceleration continues, notice how easy it is to hold your manifestations. Notice how effortless it is to simply hold your manifestations and have them here present, activated and solidified within your field with such grace, with such ease. And that's right. And now go ahead and simply allow an energy of gratitude to run through your energetic container. Beautiful. Allowing this energy to come in, working through the container, updating the container, allowing it to sink to the highest frequency of gratitude. Beautiful. And now allow a frequency of love to run through this container. You may see these energies running through. You may feel them. You may just simply know this is taking place through the subtle layers of your being. Either way is puff. That's right. Allowing the gratitude and the love to simultaneously run through the containers. Beautiful. And now run a deep frequency of knowing, a deep frequency of knowing that your manifestations are held, that your manifestations are supported, that your manifestations have a place. And notice how good it feels to deeply know that it is safe and easy to have your manifestations held through your system with ease and with grace that's continuing to run these energies and run these frequencies. And you may notice how certain parts of your field begin to light up and open and expand. You may begin to notice how certain pieces of the geometries within your energetic field begin to update and come online, returning back to their crystalline state. You may continue to notice how some of these energies update and come online and return back to their crystalline state. You may continue to notice how some old geometries that are no longer useful and not aligned to these new containers that you have solidified in your field. You may notice that they simply drop away with ease and with grace. Perfect. Allowing a continuation of this upgrade, continuation of this activation. And from this place, go ahead and simply witness your own energetic field. You may see it, you may feel it. You may just simply know you are witnessing it right now. And from this place and this space, allow yourself to have so much gratitude, so much gratitude for your own capacity to anchor and activate these new spaces within your system as dormant parts of your unconscious mind. Begin to remember, it is easy for me to hold my manifestations as you begin to remember. It is easy for me to increase my capacity to receive as dormant parts of your unconscious mind. Begin to remember it is easy to bring my energetic field into greater cohesion with the other layers of my being. That's right. Beautiful. As you allow all of this to anchor ground, solidify growing roots within your field and within your system. Recording all of this right now, remembering that the expansion of these energetic containers is your natural state. That's right. Beautiful beginning to now seal up the field. Allowing all of this to anchor and solidify in these containers are activated and solidified and grounded. And with so much gratitude coming back to your breath, back to your body, back to the state, allowing yourself to gently come back into the now and gently opening your eyes. Mm. Beautiful.

====================

LESSON 8: Expand Beyond Your Limits

<v ->Welcome back. Now that you’ve activated and solidified your
energetic containers within your energetic field, it’s now time to shift
beyond your limits and go into this next layer of expansion. Many people
who are looking to manifest many things hit caps, and they hit limits,
and this lesson alone is going to accelerate you right past any
conscious or unconscious limits that may be hiding out in your inner
reality. Now, for us to go into this, we must understand firstly the
unconscious mind. We talked a lot about the energetic field in the last
lesson. Today, we’re going deeper into the mind. You see, many people
think their conscious mind is in control; they think that the thoughts
that they’re thinking are the thoughts that are actually dominating
their reality, but really it’s the unconscious mind underneath the
surface that’s shifting everything. Your unconscious mind is pumping the
blood around your body; your unconscious mind is telling you to move
that piece of hair, to scratch your shoulder without you even thinking
about it. So here’s the thing: if your unconscious mind isn’t on board
with your manifestations, you can be thinking all the positive thoughts
in the world, but your unconscious won’t be in alignment or cohesion
with where you are looking to go. It’s a little bit like there’s a big
ship, let’s say it’s a pirate ship, and there’s the captain of the ship,
and then there’s the crew. Now, most people think that the captain is in
charge. He’s the one barking the orders saying, “Go to port!” “Go to
starboard!” “Bring in the sails!” when really, at the end of the day,
the crew are in control because the captain could be yelling at
everyone, but if the crew don’t follow those instructions, the ship
doesn’t move. Your unconscious mind is actually in control; your
unconscious mind is the crew. Now, why is the unconscious sometimes so
stubborn to come into alignment naturally, get on board with helping us
with our manifestations? Well, that’s because your unconscious can throw
many limitations which, we perceive, block our manifestation or slow our
manifestation process down. Why does this happen? This happens because
your unconscious mind is wired to keep you safe and to keep you alive,
which is a good thing; we want to be safe, and we want to be alive, but
if we are moving into the next layer of our manifestations, then our
unconscious can block us, stop us, and slow us down. So, what our
unconscious does in an attempt, a good attempt, to keep us safe is that
it creates upper limits in our unconscious reality in order to keep you
from stepping out into the unknown and to keep you in your comfort zone.
Now, we all know you don’t grow in your comfort zone; we all know that
you grow when you step into your new uncomfortable zone, but your
unconscious is trying to keep you in this comfortable place because it
is safe, and it knows that you are going to be okay because it’s
familiar. You see, this is why people keep manifesting the same thing
even if they do different things, even if they’re trying different
strategies, even if every single month, they try a new way to generate a
result, and they get the same result. Well, often, that’s because
they’re hitting an upper limit in their unconscious reality. So the
question then becomes, how do we expand past these upper limits? How do
we expand past these caps? And one of the ways that we are going to
focus on today is getting clear on your vision beyond your vision, your
manifestation beyond your manifestation, your peace beyond the peace
where your system starts expanding into a place of expansion that it
didn’t even know was possible. So our upper limits kick in often when we
are very close to actually receiving our manifestation; you get very
close to it, and then your unconscious goes, “No, no, no, no, no! I
don’t know if that’s safe; I don’t know if that’s okay; I don’t know
actually what’s on the other side of that manifestation, so let me keep
you back here in the comfort zone, not manifesting that.” So in order to
shift past this limit, you need to lean into not your upper limit, but
your upper upper limit, you need to focus on increasing your energetic
containers just like we did in the last lesson; you get to focus on
expanding your capacity to receive, going deeper into deeper layers of
surrender, and, most importantly, expanding your vision. Something
really interesting happens when you start tapping into what I call the
vision beyond the vision because all of a sudden, when you start tapping
into that, your whole system goes, “Wow, okay; I can actually see what
is beyond this manifestation.” If your unconscious mind can’t see what
is beyond that manifestation, it marks it as death; it marks it as
unknown; it marks it as a big black hole that you might fall into and
die, literally, which seems crazy ’cause you’re thinking well, my
conscious mind would love this manifestation; your unconscious is trying
to keep you safe and breathing. So what happens when we start activating
the vision beyond the vision, the manifestation beyond the
manifestation, all of a sudden, not only does your unconscious see that
beyond that manifestation, it’s safe; it actually sees that it’s really
good, and it’s exciting. And when you start tapping into the vision
beyond the vision, energetically, there’s a shift in your field; all of
a sudden your big picture vision, your massive manifestation, well, it’s
not that big or massive anymore; it energetically becomes a stepping
stone to where you are actually going which is your vision beyond your
vision, your manifestation beyond your manifestation. So, here’s your
soul work, I want you to dive right into this. I want you to journal for
the first piece, and ask yourself, “If I woke up tomorrow and my big
picture vision, my big manifestation, was already done, what would my
vision be?” And chances are, you are not going to be hoping and praying
and wishing for your vision to appear again; you know it’s done; you
woke up; you’re like, this is my life. So you’re going to get into
detail with this; you’re going to get into clarity on this, and this is
normal by the way; if you sit down to journal on this, and you feel
stuck, and you feel like you don’t even know, and you feel like you
can’t think any bigger than that, congratulations, you’re hitting your
limit. Congratulations, you’re hitting your limit. Congratulations,
you’re hitting this upper part in your unconscious reality that’s been
blocking you and stopping you and slowing you down and holding you back.
The only way for this not to work is to stop, is to give up on it, is to
say, “You know what? This Quest isn’t for me; this is too much.” But
you’re not one of those people because I know that you made this
commitment to go deep and to do all of the pieces of the soul work, so
really push yourself on this; go into expansion with this, and allow
your energetic field to expand as you do this process whilst your mind
expands at the same time because you’ll notice when you are journaling
and when you are going into the vision beyond the vision, and you are
saying to yourself, “Wow, I mean, if I woke up and I was already living
my ultimate reality, and and I started tuning into a bigger dream,”
you’ll notice that the feeling associated to your manifestation starts
to shift; it starts to change. Be with that feeling; feel into that
feeling. That feeling is important. So after you’ve done that first
piece of critical soul work, the second piece around this is to journal
also, and I want you to create a list of a minimum of 20 reasons as to
why your vision beyond the vision is not only safe but amazing and
incredible. And I want you to create proof and evidence to your
unconscious mind that when you manifest the vision beyond your vision, I
want you to show your system how good it is, how powerful it is; I want
you to provide proof and evidence of how epic your life gets to be
specifically in this focus area, remember, so that your unconscious can
not only realize that you’re going to be safe, but you’re going to be
good; you’re going to be really good. So have fun with this; go deep
with this; make sure you share both of these pieces into the Tribe. Let
us know what comes up for you, and I’m excited for our next lesson.
We’re going to be anchoring in your vision beyond the vision and going
even deeper, have fun.

====================

LESSON 9: Anchor in Your Vision Beyond the Vision

<v ->Welcome back. Now that you’ve shifted past your upper, upper limit,
let’s anchor in your vision beyond the vision. Now that your system can
see that your vision beyond the vision is safe and possible and amazing,
it’s time to install it into your unconscious. So remember when you do
this, you can create huge shifts in your manifestations. This is
literally a manifestation hack that so many people don’t know about
because your big picture vision, that initial manifestation, again
becomes a stepping stone to where you’re actually heading, and most
importantly, your energy around it changes. I want you to go through
this activation that we’re about to go through, this beautiful guided
energetic architecture process. And afterwards, I want you to really
feel the difference with your manifestation directly linked to this
Quest. So again, through this activation, we’re going to be working
through all layers of your being, your physical, your mental, your
emotional, your energetic, every single layer. And this is important
before the process. Firstly, ask yourself, what is your vision beyond
the vision in precise detail? And you covered that in the last lesson.
So to add to this, after you’ve refreshed that in your memory, ask
yourself by when? How will you know when your vision beyond your vision
has manifested? So we’re going to go into this activation once again.
It’s easy, simple, and guided whilst being potent and deep. Make sure
you are connected to your vision beyond your vision. Make sure you have
anchored in those two dates, the first date for your manifestation, on
or before the end of this Quest, and the other date for your longer-term
manifestation. You’re going to do this activation twice, focusing
firstly on your manifestation for the Quest, remembering your connecting
to the vision beyond your vision for that. And then also the vision
beyond the vision for your long-term manifestation. Okay, let’s get
started. Go ahead and sit or lie in a comfortable position, allowing
yourself to close your eyes and turn inward right now. Allowing yourself
to firstly go around yourself, center yourself into the space using your
breaths, being aware of your center, and then gently lean into your
intention, your intention to activate and anchor and solidify your
vision beyond your vision. For this specific manifestation, on or before
your specific chosen date and time. Beautiful. So from this place, allow
a red laser beam to shoot down from your tailbone, anchoring you,
grounding you, solidifying you into the crystalline core of the earth,
and simultaneously allow a golden laser beam of light to shoot up
through your crown, connecting you right now to your unique soul star.
Allowing you to be guided, grounded, present, protected, and supported.
Heaven on earth embodied right here, right now, as you surround yourself
with a ball of golden white light, requesting that any energies,
vibrations, or frequencies not of the highest dissolve out of your
system right now. Perfect, now go ahead and simply begin to tune into
any parts of your awareness that are blocking you or stopping you or
holding you back from the full and complete activation of your vision
beyond your vision, your manifestation beyond your manifestation. Any
layers that are blocking you, stopping you or holding you back, simply
declare that they now drop, dissolve, and clear out of your system right
now, allowing your whole system to open up and have more space to hold,
through your energetic containers, the vision beyond the vision, the
manifestation beyond the manifestations that are looking to come through
and anchor through your system and be embodied in your 3D physical
reality right here, right now. Good. Now go ahead and once again, pull
up a screen in front of you. That movie screen or that TV screen, either
way is perfect. However it looks or feels to you is absolutely divine
and perfect. And as you do this, you notice, yes, there is a movie
playing in the screen. And as you watch the movie, you notice that this
is you, having already manifested your vision beyond your vision. And as
you continue to watch the movie, you notice that this is you having just
manifested the manifestation beyond your manifestation. Go ahead and
watch this movie, and simply notice what is happening right now. Notice
what’s going on. What’s not going on. Notice who’s around you. Notice
any other details that are important to you. And now from this place, go
ahead and simply make any adjustments in the movie. Adjust anything
within the movie, making it absolutely perfect. The upgraded version of
your vision beyond your vision. As you continue to witness yourself
having just manifested the manifestation beyond your manifestation in
the movie screen right now. Beautiful; good. And now from this place,
allow yourself to be aware of where your energetic container is in your
system. You may see it; you may feel it; it may be to your left, to your
right, up or down; wherever it is for you is absolutely perfect. And
then just like on a computer with a mouse where you click, drag, and
drop, you’re going to click, drag, and drop this movie screen all the
way in your field, in your system, into the energetic container,
allowing it to drop in there. Now good. Now as that movie screen clicks
into place within this energetic container, allow it to settle in there,
growing roots there. And from this place, go ahead and witness this
integration of your vision beyond your vision, noticing yourself in the
movie screen as the movie still plays, noticing yourself having just
manifested your manifestation beyond your manifestation that is now held
within your energetic container right now. That’s right. Beautiful. And
now go ahead once again, and simply request that your energetic
container now expands, allowing it to gently open and expand more and
more and more. Allowing it to take up even more space in your system.
More space in the universe. That’s right. It is safe to hold a vision
this big. It is safe to hold a manifestation this grand; that’s right.
And as this expansion continues to take place within your system, you
begin to remember at a deep unconscious level that you are deserving and
worthy of this manifestation beyond your manifestation and so much more;
that’s right. Beautiful. Go ahead and surround your energetic container
that is now holding your movie screen that still has the movie playing
of you. Having just manifested your manifestation beyond your
manifestation on the screen right now, and surround all of this with
golden white light. That’s it; put a bubble of golden white light around
this, allowing this to act as a bubble of protection. Protecting this
within your system, protecting this within your field, and allowing this
gentle expansion through your energetic field to continue to take place.
As you go ahead and continue to notice an expansion through your mental
layer, noticing more and more spaces now created through your mind,
through your consciousness, more and more space to hold the next layer
of your manifestation. As you continue to notice through your energetic
body more and more space is now created, more and more space to utilize
the positive energy in motions. The positive emotions that are looking
to come and support you in this manifestation process. As you continue
to notice as this expansion process takes place, the gentle expansion
through your physical body, allowing every single cell of your physical
body to open up and expand, creating more and more and more space, more
space within your physical vessel. More space to hold the vision beyond
the vision, the manifestation beyond the manifestation that is divinely
yours and divinely assigned to you that you say yes to right now through
every single cell of your being. That’s right. And as this expansion
continues through every single layer of your being, you begin to
remember your capacity to receive. You begin to remember your capacity
to expand constantly in order to hold this divine vision beyond the
vision divinely assigned to you and only you right now. That’s right. As
all of this continues to ground and activate and solidify within your
system through every single layer of your being. You gently begin to
remember who you are. I am a divine manifestor. I am constantly in
expansion. I expand my capacity to receive my vision beyond the vision
with ease, with grace, and with flow. I am. I am. I am. Beautiful.
Anchoring, solidifying, grounding all of this into place right now with
so much gratitude through the center of your heart. Begin to gently seal
up your field, allowing this activation and this work to complete in the
3D, but continue through the subtle layers of your being with ease and
with grace and with flow, allowing yourself to come back, being aware of
your breath, coming back into your body, back into the space, allowing
yourself to gently open your eyes. Mm. Welcome back. Mm, beautiful
activation. This is going to continue working through your subtle
layers. So again, trust your rhythm; give yourself what you need right
now. And when you’re ready, remember to go through this activation a
second time, this time focusing on the vision beyond your vision for
your longer-term manifestation. For your soul work, go deep and reflect
on what is different. What do you notice? What is your breakthrough with
that? And share that with the Tribe. We want to witness you, and we want
to celebrate you. I’m excited to dive even deeper with you on the next
lesson. See you then.

====================

LESSON 9: Meditation - Anchor in Your Vision Beyond the Vision

- Go ahead and sit or lie in a comfortable position, allowing yourself to close your eyes and turn inward right now. Allowing yourself to firstly ground yourself. Center yourself into the space, using your breasts, being aware of your center. And then gently lean into your intention. Your intention to activate and anchor and solidify your vision beyond your vision for this specific manifestation on or before your specific chosen date and time. Beautiful. So from this place, allow a red laser beam to shoot down from your tailbone, anchoring you, grounding you, solidifying you into the crystalline core of the earth. And simultaneously allow a golden laser beam of light to shoot up through your crown, connecting you right now to your unique soul star, allowing you to be guided, grounded, present, protected, and supported heaven on earth. Embodied right here, right now as you surround yourself with a ball of golden white light requesting that any energies, vibrations, or frequencies not of the highest dissolve out of your system right now. Perfect. Now go ahead and simply begin to tune into any parts of your awareness that are blocking you or stopping you, or holding you back from the full and complete activation of your vision beyond your vision, your manifestation beyond your manifestation. Any layers that are blocking you, stopping you, or holding you back, simply declare that they now drop, dissolve and clear out of your system right now. Allowing your whole system to open up and have more space to hold through your energetic containers. The vision beyond the vision, the manifestation beyond the manifestations that are looking to come through an anchor through your system and be embodied in your 3D physical reality right here, right now. Good. Now go ahead and once again, pull up a screen in front of you. That movie screen or that TV screen, either way is perfect, however it looks or feels to you, is absolutely divine and perfect. And as you do this, you notice, yes, there is a movie playing in the screen. And as you watch the movie, you notice that this is you having already manifested your vision beyond your vision. And as you continue to watch the movie, you notice that this is you having just manifested the manifestation beyond your manifestation. Go ahead and watch this movie and simply notice what is happening right now. Notice what's going on, what's not going on. Notice who's around you, notice any other details that are important to you. And now from this place, go ahead and simply make any adjustments in the movie. Adjust anything within the movie, making it absolutely perfect, the upgraded version of your vision beyond your vision as you continue to witness yourself having just manifested the manifestation beyond your manifestation in the movie screen right now. Beautiful. Good. And now from this place, allow yourself to be aware of where your energetic container is in your system. You may see it, you may feel it, it may be to your left, to your right, up or down, wherever it is for you is absolutely perfect. And then just like on a computer with a mouse where you click drag and drop, you're going to click drag and drop this movie screen all the way in your field, in your system into the energetic container, allowing it to drop in there now. Good. Now, as that movie screen clicks into place within this energetic container, allow it to settle in there growing roots there and from this place, go ahead and witness this integration of your vision beyond your vision. Noticing yourself in the movie screen as the movie still plays, noticing yourself having just manifested your manifestation beyond your manifestation that is now held within your energetic container right now. That's right. Beautiful. And now go ahead once again and simply request that your energetic container now expands, allowing it to gently open and expand more and more and more. Allowing it to take up even more space in your system. More space in the universe. That's right. It is safe to hold a vision this big. It is safe to hold a manifestation this grand. That's right. And as this expansion continues to take place within your system, you begin to remember at a deep unconscious level that you are deserving and worthy of this manifestation beyond your manifestation and so much more. That's right. Beautiful. Go ahead and surround your energetic container that is now holding your movie screen that still has the movie playing of you having just manifested your manifestation beyond your manifestation on the screen right now and surround all of this with golden white light. That's it. Put a bubble of golden white light around this, allowing this to act as a bubble of protection, protecting this within your system, protecting this within your field, and allowing this gentle expansion through your energetic field to continue to take place as you go ahead and continue to notice an expansion through your mental layer. Noticing more and more space is now created through your mind, through your consciousness, more and more space to hold the next layer of your manifestation as you continue to notice through your energetic body. More and more space is now created more and more space to utilize the positive energy in motions, the positive e motions that are looking to come and support you in this manifestation process. As you continue to notice, as this expansion process takes place, the gentle expansion through your physical body, allowing every single cell of your physical body to open up and expand, creating more and more and more space, more space within your physical vessel, more space to hold the vision beyond the vision, the manifestation beyond the manifestation that is divinely yours and divinely assigned to you that you say yes to right now through every single cell of your being. That's right. And as this expansion continues through every single layer of your being, you begin to remember your capacity to receive. You begin to remember your capacity to expand constantly in order to hold this divine vision beyond the vision divinely assigned to you and only you right now. That's right. As all of this continues to ground and activate and solidify within your system, through every single layer of your be you gently begin to remember who you are. I am a divine manifester. I am constantly in expansion. I expand my capacity to receive my vision beyond the vision, with ease, with grace. And with flow. I am. I am. I'm beautiful. Anchoring, solidifying, grounding all of this into place right now. With so much gratitude through the center of your heart, begin to gently seal up your field, allowing this activation and this work to complete in the 3D, but continue through the subtle layers of your being with ease and with grace. And with flow, allowing yourself to come back, being aware of your breath, coming back into your body, back into the space, allowing yourself to gently open your eyes.

====================

LESSON 10: Rewire Your Belief System

<v ->Welcome back. If you don’t believe that your manifestation is
possible on every single layer, then it won’t be possible. Today, we are
diving deeper into understanding your belief system and rewiring your
belief system to come in even higher alignment so that your
manifestation can show up with even more ease, more grace, and even
faster than you expected. So remember back to when we talked about the
ultimate success formula and the power of your belief system, combined
with your actions and your results and your compounding 2%. Remember you
made a choice to continuously spiral up. It’s important to remember that
your belief system is like a software that’s currently running within
your computer, and just like your iPhone requires updating, so does your
belief system. Many of you have your iPhone flashing at you saying
software update, software update, software update, and you keep saying
later, later, tomorrow, later. Well now is the time to say yes to these
updates and allow you to actually update your system in order to step
into even greater and greater manifestations. In order to rewire our
belief system at a deep unconscious level and then also shift our
conscious reality, it’s important to understand a little bit around how
our unconscious mind works at a deeper level, building on what we talked
on in the last few lessons. So we have so much information coming
through all of our senses constantly. So much information that if we
were to receive all of that information all at once, we would
self-combust. It’s just too much to make sense of. So what we do is our
unconscious mind takes all the information from our senses and it
deletes it; it distorts it, and it generalizes it in order to create
what we call a program, in order for your unconscious reality to run on.
So, so many people are not actually looking at the program running
underneath in their internal reality of their belief system. They’re
just trying to do different things in the world. They’re just trying to
think positive, but it’s important that we actually update this program.
When you do this, you’ll notice all of a sudden that your belief system,
when you update into these new programs, it becomes your new normal. And
then all of a sudden, like we talked about with the ultimate success
formula, the action you take is a little bit different, from a different
frequency, which means you get some different results, and everything
continues to spiral up. So when you are reconditioning yourself to
succeed and reconditioning yourself to become a powerful manifestor, you
will hit a point in time where you start doing this, and you start
installing the new programs in your belief system. And it’s normal to
hear these sometimes or to even write them down yourself, and go, “Well,
yeah, you know, I would like to believe that, but I don’t believe that
right now.” You might be writing out “I’m a powerful manifestor,” and
then your conscious mind may go, “You know what? You’re not that
powerful. What have you done so far?” That’s normal. This happens to
every single human, but I promise you, if you keep playing this game, if
you go deeper with this, if you day after day after day go in and work
on recalibrating your belief system, you will get to a point where you
new beliefs become your now beliefs. And you would sit down, for
example, and you would never write out, “Oh I really hope to believe
that the sky is blue; the sky is blue; the sky is blue.” You just know
that the sky is blue. The same thing will happen. You’ll start writing.
“I’m a powerful manifestor. I’m a powerful manifestor. I’m a powerful
manifestor.” And then one day you will simply just know that. And you’ll
have a moment where you wake up and you look around you in your life,
and you’ll go, “Wow. You know, everything that I’ve manifested in my
life I decreed and I declared and I aligned to, and I shifted my belief
system into.” Now, one of the powerful ways to rewire your belief system
is to shift into a deeper frequency of knowing. And I know you’ve
already heard this, ’cause I’ve been fusing it into some of the
activations, but this powerful frequency of knowing allows you to truly
own this new program, which you are installing into your software
system. There are many different ways to rewire your belief system, but
one of the most powerful ways that I’ve personally found and that my
clients have had such deep results with is to reprogram your belief
system whilst you are sleeping. And I think you’re going to be happy
about this because all it requires from your side is an open mind, some
clear intentions, and then a good night’s sleep. For this first piece of
soul work, I want you to ask yourself and journal and say to yourself,
“Okay, if I knew was 100% certainty that my manifestation for this Quest
was done, what would I choose to believe? And I want you to sit down and
write out a minimum of 30 new empowering beliefs. This would look
something like”I choose to believe that my manifestation of X, Y, Z is
done. I choose to believe that X, Y, Z has showed up with ease and
grace. I choose to believe that I am worthy and deserving of receiving
this manifestation. I choose to believe that this manifestation has
showed up even earlier than I expected.” Play with this and have fun
with this. Now, once you’ve gone into that, and only once you’ve gone
into that, when you have those 30 powerful beliefs, a minimum of 30
powerful beliefs, then you can go into the sleep meditation. So how the
sleep meditation and activation works is that you get to go to sleep.
It’s very simple. And when you start going to sleep, you’re going to
either have headphones on or, if you’re sleeping alone, you can play
this meditation and activation just next to you. And you’re going to
simply hold an intention to upgrade into the next level of your
manifestation. Then all you need to do is lie down, close your eyes,
relax, and simply allow this activation and meditation to play and
recode your unconscious reality whilst you are sleeping. Now for some
people when they go through this process, I’ll be honest, they have a
terrible night’s sleep. They feel like they’re waking up. They feel
uncomfortable. They feel that the voice is too loud or too soft. That
generally means that things are shifting. For some people they drop so
deep that they feel that they can’t remember anything of what was said
during the night. Whatever your experience is is perfect. There’s no
right, and there’s no wrong. And it’s going to be a different experience
for everyone listening to this, depending on work that you’ve done
prior, depending on your level of sleep, depending on your unconscious
reality and what there is to come up and clear and shift and upgrade.
So, however, this is for you is perfect. There’s no way to mess this up.
Now, when you wake in the morning, this is very important. Your next
piece of soul work is to immediately notice what is different when you
wake up. Notice what is different, and share that with the Tribe. Let us
know, “Wow, I had this vision.” “I saw this image.” “I felt this
feeling.” “I felt different in this way.” “I saw this part of myself
that was coming up to clear and release.” Whatever your experience is,
make sure you share it. And I’m so excited for you to deep dive into
this sleep meditation and activation. So go deep with this; have fun
with this, and have a beautiful activated night’s sleep. Blessings.

Overcome Resistance

LESSON 11: Get Raw & Real with Your Limits

<v ->Welcome back to the next phase of this manifestation Quest. As you
know, our natural state is being in a constant state of manifestation
because we are all born manifestors. And here’s the thing, if we’re not
in a state of manifestation, it’s really important to look at what is
blocking us or stopping us, or slowing us down. This phase of the Quest
allows us to go deeper into understanding your limits and not just
understanding them, but looking at how to work with them so that you can
massively accelerate your manifestation results. So you can speed up
what it is that you actually desire. So where do we start with this?
When we start with diving deep into your blocks and your limitations
that every human has by the way, it’s really important, firstly, to get
really raw and really real with where you’re at. Really raw and really
real with what has been blocking you, stopping you or slowing you down.
So the first thing we want to do is understand the different types of
limits that show up for us as a human. We all have fears, doubts,
worries, overthinking, stuck emotions that get stuck in our mind and
stuck in our body, and stuck in our emotional body. We all have
self-sabotage patterns, limiting beliefs, disempowering stories.
Sometimes we’re too far out into our future and sometimes we’re living
back in the past. Sometimes we’re worrying about how is this going to
happen? There are so many other limits, but these are some of the main
ones that I want you to tune into right now and start having awareness
on what has been showing up for you and where have you been stuck? What
kind of limits are more common for you when it comes to manifesting what
you desire? Now there’s many people out there that will tell you the
goal is to have no more limits and the goal is to not have any fear, but
it’s not about not having limits. It’s about learning how to dance with
these limits. It’s about learning how to move forward in spite of these
limits. Can you stand on your stage in your life even if you still have
fear, even if you still have self-doubt, even if your knees are shaking,
are you able to step onto that stage? How are you moving forward and how
are you staying in action despite any limits that may actually be
present to you? It’s a little bit like you’re driving a car right now,
you’re driving the car towards your future. You’re driving it towards
your vision. And now you can see your vision with crystal clear clarity.
You can see your intentions and your manifestations, and you’re driving
this car and as you keep driving the car, you see beyond that vision,
you see your vision beyond the vision. And you see that with crystal
clear clarity and you see yourself raising your level of tolerance, and
rewiring your belief system and moving forward. And it feels good
driving that car. And then as you continue on this drive, something
interesting starts to happen. You look in the rear vision mirror and you
notice that your limits are hanging out in the back seat. The fear, the
self-doubt, the self-sabotage, the disempowering stories. It starts to
creep forward and it starts to maybe grab your throat and you feel like
you can’t speak what you desire into your life. And all of a sudden it
starts to cover your eyes and you’re trying to drive the car, but you
can’t see properly. Choice point. This is where so many people get out
of the car and they say, you know, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. That
was too much. That was too intense. I didn’t want to drive to that
vision anyway. I don’t care about that vision beyond the vision. I’m
happy with my life. My life is good. No problem. I don’t need to get
back in the car. Choice point. This is an invitation for you to jump
back in the car and instead of worrying about how you’re going to handle
and drive forward, understand your limits. Because if you understand why
these limits are coming up, you’re able to look in that rear vision
mirror and go, hey, fear, hey, doubt, hey, self-sabotage, I understand
that you’re just trying to keep me safe, but guess what? I’ve got this.
I’m in the driving seat, not you, and we’re moving forward. We’re moving
forward into this vision. And then we’re moving forward into the vision
beyond the vision. That is a choice. So during these next few lessons,
you’re going to learn to dance with your limits. You’re going to then go
into a process of understanding them deeper and then activating what I
call alchemy to transform them. You see, energy cannot be created or
destroyed. It can only be shifted and transformed. Are you able to shift
your limits, the things that have blocked you and kept you stuck, or
maybe kept you small or kept you disconnected from your power. And are
you able to actually use that energy in order to propel you and drive
you forward? We’re going to go into a powerful activation today that is
going to help you do this. So for your soul work for this lesson, what I
want you to start with is for the first piece, I want you to journal and
I want you to get really raw and really real with where you’re currently
at and ask yourself, if I was to know what is blocking me, what is
stopping me, what is limiting me and what is slowing me down, what would
you be present to? What is stopping you from having your intentions and
your manifestations show up in your life? And I want you to get into
detail. The more honest you are with this, the more humble you are with
this, the more raw and real you are with this, the more you’re going to
be able to actually go in and shift these things. The second piece of
soul work is it’s time to get into action. So ask yourself, what am I
now committed to to taking action on, regardless of these limits? Maybe
you’re going to call that person anyway even though you’ve been scared
to have that conversation. Maybe you’re going to say yes to starting
that business even if you’re overthinking how it’s going to happen. What
are your action items around that? And then for the third piece, I want
you to take action of three of those actions today. So we’re not just
writing this and praying about this, and hoping for this. No, it’s time
to get into practical action in your life. Remember we said,
manifestation is a co-creation process and you must show up and
participate in the manifestation process. We’ve been going deep into the
80% in the inner work and now it’s time for you to take physical action
in your life. Make sure you share with us in the Tribe what are your
commitments and what are those three commitments that you got done today
right now. The next layer is that we’ll be going into a closed-eye
activation. Once again, an energetic architecture process in order to
help you alchemize these limits. Make sure you only do this process once
you’ve done the first pieces of soul work so you know what limits you’re
actually alchemizing. So you know what pieces you’re actually bringing
to the table to shift and turn into positive energy. So let’s start by
diving deep into this activation. Make sure you pause this if you
haven’t done yet the other pieces of soul work, and then when you’re
ready, you can dive right in. So let’s get started. Go ahead and sit or
lie in a comfortable position and close your eyes, and gently turn
inwards right now. Allowing yourself to be aware of your breath.
Breathing in and breathing out centering and grounding yourself right
now. As you allow yourself to gently lean into your intention, your
intention to shift and alchemize anything that is currently blocking
you, stopping you or holding you back. That’s right. So go ahead and now
gently allow a red laser beam to shoot down from your tailbone anchoring
you into the crystalline core of the earth and simultaneously allow a
golden laser beam of light to shoot up through your crown connecting you
right now to your unique soul star, allowing you to be guided, grounded,
present, protected, and supported. Heaven on earth embodied right here
right now as you surround yourself with a ball of golden white light,
and simply request that any energies, vibrations or frequencies that are
not yours drop, dissolve and clear out of your field with ease, with
grace, and with flow. Beautiful. Now from this place, go ahead and allow
yourself to tune into anything that has been blocking you, stopping you,
or holding you back from manifesting your manifestations in this focus
area of life. That’s it. These are the specific limits that you are now
clear on, that you went deep in in that piece of soul work. Allow
yourself to be present to them right now. Go ahead and now request that
any of these limits, any fears, any doubts, any self-sabotage patterns,
any overthinking, anything too out in the future or back in the past,
whatever your personal limits are or have been, make sure that you now
request that they begin to accumulate within your solar plexus. Allowing
all of this energy, all of these patterns of information to gently
accumulate in your solar plexus allowing them to form a dense, dark,
heavy ball. That’s it. You may feel this ball. You may just simply know
that this process is taking place, either way is absolutely perfect. And
as all your limits begin to accumulate into this dense, dark, heavy ball
in your solar plexus, go ahead and now request that any other limits
that you are unaware of that are sitting deep within your unconscious,
request that they join in also. Bringing all of those unknown limits
into this dense, dark, heavy ball. You may feel it. You may just simply
know it’s there. And from this place, connecting with this dense, dark,
heavy ball that is now an accumulation of all of your limits that have
blocked you and stopped you, and held you back. Now, go ahead and simply
request that this ball now shifts out of your body. Whew! That’s it. So
now it’s hovering just in front of you. You may see it or you may feel
it, either way is perfect. We’re now going to shift and transmute and
alchemize this ball allowing it to literally transform before your very
eyes, before your very consciousness right now. So go ahead and connect
with this ball floating right there. This ball filled with all of your
blocks and limitations known and unknown. And now simply go ahead and
make this ball lighter. It was a dense, dark, heavy ball. So now go
ahead and change the density and make it lighter and lighter and
lighter. And now go ahead and request that this ball gently now becomes
bigger, change its size, make it bigger and bigger and bigger. Beautiful
and now go ahead, it was a dark ball and so now go ahead and make this
ball a golden color, a shiny, beautiful golden color. And now request
that this ball begins to spin. That’s it, spin it faster and faster, and
faster and faster and faster until it becomes a ball of spinning golden
white light. That’s it. This ball that was once filled with your
limitations is shifting and completely transforming before your very
consciousness right now. And now go ahead and send this ball of spinning
golden white light out into the universe. Whew, that’s it. You may see
it go out. You may feel it go. You may just simply know that it went,
either way is perfect. And as this ball is out in the cosmos, out in the
universe, this ball is now gathering pieces of information in order to
allow you to have a gift encoded within this ball. And this will be one
of the greatest gifts that you ever receive. That’s right. This ball is
now working across time and space gathering these pieces of information
with ease and grace. This ball is now completing the accumulation of
this gift. And now this ball now pops back into your field, whew, until
it’s hovering just above you and just before you. This ball that was
once filled with your limitations is now encoded with one of the
greatest gifts that you will ever receive. The spinning golden white
light spins faster and faster and faster. And now go ahead and allow
this ball to gently hover above your head. That’s it. So it’s hovering
just above your head, just above your crown encoded with one of the
greatest gifts that you’ll ever receive. And now go ahead and gently
allow this ball to drop, drop down. That’s it, gently touching the top
of your head, the top of your crown, gently entering your four-body
system, and then entering your physical body. That’s it. Allowing this
ball to gently drop, coming down through your brain, beautiful.
Illuminating your brain center as it goes with its spinning golden white
light. And now drop this ball down, down, down even further allowing it
to now drop through your throat activating with golden white light to
your throat, your capacity to speak your truth in relation to your
manifestations. And now drop this ball down, down, down even deeper,
until it is resting gently within the center of your heart. Beautiful.
And as this ball encoded with one of the greatest gifts that you’ll ever
receive is resting gently within your heart center, go ahead and now
simply request that this ball now implodes into every single cell of
your being allowing every single cell to wake up, wake up, wake up, wake
up and receive the golden spinning white light, these fragments and the
pieces of information all of the fragments and pieces of the information
desired and required in order for you to receive and embody this great
gift. That’s it. Every single cell of your being begins to receive this
beautiful gift. And you may be aware of this gift. Maybe you have a
certain feeling, an image, a vision, a sound which comes, a deep sense
of knowing or a message, or maybe this gift will be revealed to you in
perfect timing, either way is absolutely perfect. Every single cell of
your being opens up and creates space to truly hold and embody this
gift. That’s right. As you gently begin to integrate all of this
information and you remember how powerful you are, you remember that you
have just shifted and alchemized some of your greatest limitations from
your past and shifted them and alchemized them into one of the greatest
gifts that you will ever receive. And from this place and this space of
deep remembrance, you allow all of this information to integrate within
your field, integrate within your system growing roots within your
consciousness. As you begin to remember the Alchemist that you are, the
divine manifestor that you are. That’s right. As we begin to seal up the
field and ground down, completing this activation and having so much
gratitude. Gratitude always for your divine guidance, gratitude for the
outcomes that you are. Gratitude for this beautiful gift that you have
received and will continue to receive in divine timing. That’s it,
integrating, grounding, stabilizing all of this in, requesting that any
shifts, upgrades, and transformations continue 24 hours a day, seven
days a week until they are fully actualized, integrated, stabilized,
embodied, and complete. Beautiful. As you allow yourself to come back to
your breath, come back into presence, back into this space. Gently
opening your eyes. Welcome back. Beautiful activation. Thank you for
going deep once again. Remember to trust your rhythm, drink lots of
water. Notice what’s coming up for you. And for the final piece of soul
work, please share your breakthroughs from this lesson and from this
activation in the Tribe. So we can witness you as the Alchemist that you
are. I celebrate you. I celebrate your breakthroughs, and I’m excited to
dive deeper. We’re going to be talking about handling fear in the next
lesson. So let’s dive right into that. I’m looking forward to going
deeper with you. Blessings.

LESSON 12: The Passionate Fear Override

<v ->Welcome back. Yesterday, we worked on your general limits and
learning how to alchemize them at a deep, unconscious level. And now
over the next few days, we’re going to go deeper and deeper into some
specific limits that can be really challenging for people to shift
because they require some deeper attention. So the limit that we’re
going to be focusing on today is fear, and I chose to start here because
fear is really one of the biggest limits and challenges that often stops
people from moving forward the most. And in this lesson, you’re going to
understand how to handle fear and also how to release deep, deep, deep
fear which can be showing up in a way that really doesn’t serve you at
all. So when we start with this, it’s important that we understand fear
and understand why fear shows up because the goal is not to have no fear
at the end of the day. We’re actually wanting to have fear in our human
experience because fear keeps us safe. Fear is actually a good thing.
It’s required as a natural human response to keep us alive and keep us
breathing. If you walked to an edge of the cliff and you feel a little
bit of fear, that’s a good thing because that’s your system telling you,
“Hey if you step off this cliff, you might die.” But here’s the thing
with fear is that when fear is coming up in an attempt to keep you safe,
but it’s showing up in a seemingly uncontrollable or unruly way, that’s
when it can stop us moving forward with our manifestations. So people
think that fear is something within them that they have no control over,
but actually you get to choose your experience with fear. And I’m here
to let you know that it’s possible to actually recode fear so that you
can have a different experience of it. Now, in order to do this what’s
important is that we start working with what I call the root cause of
fear. And this is actually the very first moment in time that your
system started generating a fear response. Now, if you are trying in
your life just to not feel fear or ignore the fear when it comes up,
this doesn’t really create long-lasting change. It’s important that we
go right to the root. So it’s a little bit like a tree. And if you have
a tree, and it’s growing fruit, and it’s growing leaves, and you just
trim the leaves around the tree, the fruit and the leaves are eventually
going to grow back. But if you take that tree, and you rip it out of the
ground, that tree is done; that tree is not going to grow again. So this
is exactly what happens when we start working at a deep, energetic and
unconscious level to get into the root cause of fear. And we go in, and
we release with ease that very first moment, that very first experience
where your system created a fear response. So before we go deep into the
activation for this, your first piece of soul work is to journal, and
make sure you do this before you do the activation, so you’re clear on
this. I want you firstly, to journal and get really real with fear; ask
yourself, how does fear show up for you? What is your current experience
with fear? And then if you were to have a different, more powerful
experience when fear came up, what would be going on instead? You get to
craft your relationship with fear. You get to play with your experience
of fear. And what if fear came up and you were able to dance with it and
move forward in spite of it; how would that specifically look for you?
So make sure you do that. And then for the second piece, we are going to
go deep into this activation which is going to be working deeply at an
unconscious level showing your system how to get rid of and release and
clear this root cause of fear. And instead install a different
experience of it. Now, remember the goal is to not be fearless and then
have no fear ever again. No, you want the fear, but it doesn’t show up
in a way after this activation where it consumes you, where it controls
you, where you have an unruly experience that stops you from moving
forward. Instead when you go in and you clear this root cause, you’ll
notice in your consciousness, in the future you’ll have a micro choice
point where something happens, and you’ll have a micro choice point
where you go, “Oh, do I want to be scared of this or not? Oh, do I want
to experience fear?” Or, “I’m experiencing a little bit of fear, but I
can handle that. I can work with that. I can play with that,” instead of
the fear just kicking in, and you feel like you can’t even do anything
in your day or your life or move forward because the fear is so intense.
So how this works in this activation, it’s almost like having a string
of pearls, and you have a string of pearls. And what we are going to do
is go to the very bottom pearl on this string, right? And then you are
going basically cut just above where that first pearl is. And then what
happens? All the pearls start falling away. So we’ve seen this happen
when you go through this process, and you go deep into the root cause,
and you clear and release the energy that has been stuck from this root
cause, this very first experience of fear. We’ve noticed that all of a
sudden, all the other experiences of fear through your life in the past
and also in your future, they lose their charge. Have you ever noticed
where fear has come up for you and it’s not even logical, and you even
think to yourself, “Why do I feel so much fear right now?” Your mind
knows this is something that you don’t even need to be scared about.
It’s completely illogical, but that’s because it’s not the mind creating
it. That’s because it is now what we call stacked fear. Stacked time
after time after time after time, till someone says one little thing,
and you have a full fear response in your body. That no longer needs to
be your reality when you go in through this activation and clear out
this root cause, this very first base experience. So as always, this is
simple and easy for you. All you need to do is be guided through this
process, be unattached, and simply allow yourself to have an open mind
and go deep. So let’s get started into this activation. Once you’ve done
that first piece of soul work, come back to this, and let’s dive right
in. So go ahead, and sit or lie in a comfortable position, allowing
yourself to gently close your eyes, turning inwards right now, centering
yourself with your breath. And allowing yourself to lean into your
intention of clearing out the root cause of fear. That very first
experience through your unconscious reality. Remembering that we are
working through the unconscious mind. So things may not be logical. They
may not make sense in this activation, but you’re here; you are open.
You’re choosing to be available and surrender to the power and the magic
of this activation. Allow a red laser beam to shoot down from your
tailbone, anchoring you and grounding you into the crystalline core of
the earth. And simultaneously allow a golden laser beam of light to
shoot up through your crown connecting you right now to your unique soul
star, allowing you to be guided grounded, present, protected and
supported. Heaven on earth, embodied right here, right now, as you
surround yourself with a ball of golden white light, dropping any
energies that don’t serve you out of your system and calling in your
divine guidance. Beings of light of the highest vibration, divinely
assigned to assisting you in clearing out and purifying that root cause
of fear. That very first experience of fear. That’s right. Beautiful.
Now I’m about to ask you some questions, and simply allow the very first
answer that comes to you to be your answer. Even if it doesn’t make
sense, even if it’s not logical. I will ask the question, and then I
will say one, two, three. And at that time, you allow yourself to
receive this answer. You can say it in your mind, or you can say it out
loud; either way is perfect. Here’s the first question. If you were to
know the very first time that you experienced fear, was it before,
during, or after your birth? One, two, three. Perfect. If it was before
your birth, that very first time that you experienced fear, how many
lifetimes ago was it? One, two, three, first answer that comes to your
mind. Perfect. If that’s you, stay with that timestamp. If it was, the
answer was, during your birth then stay with that. And if it was after
your birth, if you were to know what age were you between the ages of
one and seven. One, two, three. Good. That’s your answer if that was
you. Beautiful. So now go ahead, and simply tune into your body, leaning
into your intention to release the root cause of fear. And I want
yourself to go ahead, and now float up, float up out of your body, up
above now. And I want you to take yourself back, all the way back, to
that exact moment in time, wherever that answer was for you, allowing
yourself to float back in your past; your unconscious knows where to
take you; float all the way back, back, back, back until you are there
hovering just above that event, just before that event, and looking down
on that event. That’s it; this event is the very first time that your
system experienced a fear response, the root cause of all other fear
that has been stacked in your reality. And I want yourself to simply
notice anything that you notice which is going on. You may see a
specific event. You may feel it. You may hear it. You may see, feel, or
hear nothing; either way is absolutely perfect. What counts is that your
unconscious has taken you there. Beautiful. So hovering just above this
moment in time, just before this moment in time, looking down on this
moment, go ahead and notice that your system triggered a fear response
because it felt that it was unsafe. Fear is something that, when stored
through the body, it can accumulate and even cause health problems in
the future. If we have these stuck unruly emotions that are not
processed, and that gets stacked up. Go ahead, and allow yourself to
remember that this fear does not serve you. Go ahead, and allow yourself
to remember that it is safe to release this fear. And from this
perspective, looking down on this moment in time, from this perspective,
with these positive learnings, go ahead, and allow yourself to release
that fear. That’s it. Remembering that your system can hold onto the
positive learning, or your system can hold onto the stuck fear, but it
cannot do both. Once again from this place, this space, this intention,
hovering just above this event, just before the event, looking down on
the event, go ahead, and simply allow yourself to release the fear.
That’s it. Good. From this place of awareness, now noticing that this
fear is released, go ahead, and now float down into the event. So you’re
now down into the event, surrounded by the event right now, and allow
your system to notice what is different. Notice that in the past, there
may have been deep, unruly, unwarranted levels of fear. Notice what is
different. Maybe there’s a different thought. Maybe something different
is happening. Maybe you make a different choice in that moment. Notice
what is different. Good. Have a quick check-in in this event right now,
and ask yourself, are you still able to feel that fear, or has it just
gone? Good If it’s gone, perfect. And if you can still feel it a little
bit, once again, go ahead, and request that your system now accepts what
there is to learn and then chooses to release the fear now. Good. That’s
right. And now go ahead, and now float up above this event once again.
So you are hovering just above the event, looking down on this event,
and from that perspective, at a soul level, across every single realm,
reality, and dimension, go ahead and choose that. Choose this new
relationship with fear. Good. And with so much gratitude, go ahead, and
gently begin to float all the way back to now. That’s it. And when
you’re hovering above now, remembering that you now have a new
experience with fear, now begin to float out into your future. Wherever
that is for you is absolutely perfect. Go ahead, and float all the way
out, out, out into your future, and take yourself to an unspecified
event in your future. An event where in the past you would’ve felt
unwarranted or unruly amounts of fear, and simply go ahead, and now
notice what is different. That’s right. Notice how your relationship
with fear has now shifted. Good, beautiful. And with so much gratitude,
gently begin to float all the way back to now, until you are hovering
above now, coming back down into now, back into the space, back into
your body, back into your grateful heart, grounding and anchoring and
solidifying this in. Having so much gratitude for your guides. So much
gratitude for the alchemist that you are, and so much gratitude to your
newfound relationship with fear that you get to play with. That’s it. As
you come back into your breath, gently opening your eyes. And welcome
back. Beautiful. Well, congratulations. That is a superdeep process. And
your next layer of soul work is to share your breakthroughs from this
lesson and from this activation with the Tribe. We want to witness you.
We want to celebrate you. We want to hear and see about your new
relationship with fear. What came up for you? Maybe you saw some really
interesting things during this process. Maybe things just feel very
different. Please remember there’s an integration with this process. So
take it easy. Give yourself what you need. And we are talking about
another very powerful process tomorrow, going deeper into a limit that
can stop so many people. So get ready, ’cause we are diving even deeper.
See you on the next lesson.

Float up out of your body up above now. And I want you to take yourself back all the way back to that exact moment in time, wherever that answer was for you, allowing yourself to float back in your past. Your unconscious knows where to take you, float all the way back, back, back, back until you were there hovering just above that event, just before that event and looking down on that event. That's it. This event is the very first time that your system experienced a fear response, the root cause of all other fear that has been stacked in your reality.

====================

LESSON 13: How to Blast Through Self Sabotage

<v ->Welcome back. We’ve been going really deep on these lessons, so
make sure that you stay strong with your commitment of going deep into
all the pieces of soul work. These lessons in themselves are an
activation and a transmission, and you upgrade a lot watching them, but
remember, the real work is that 80% and going deeper within. So
yesterday we alchemized fear; we got into the root cause. And today we
are going to be blasting through self-sabotage. So usually,
self-sabotage kicks in at the last minute, right before you are going to
actually manifest what it is that you desire. So if you master
self-sabotage, it’s going to massively accelerate you forward. There are
so many people that I’ve worked with where the self-sabotage kicks in,
and they come to me as their coach and as their mentor, and they tell
me, “You know, I’m sabotaging myself; I have a health goal, but I just
started eating that thing again.” “I had this money savings goal, but I
just went and spent this money,” and I actually celebrate that. I
celebrate that they’re self-aware enough that they’re able to catch the
self-sabotage, and I’m excited that this pattern is kicking in because
often this is our last attempt from our unconscious to keep us safe and
keep us in the known and keep us in the comfort zone, okay. So
self-sabotage can show up in your life as really huge things. You could
sabotage yourself in a really dramatic way, but self-sabotage can also
be really subtle, and it can be sneaky. It can even be little thoughts
in your head that pop up, where you say, “Oh, you know, I don’t know if
I am actually good enough to do this,” or, “You know, I don’t actually
know if this manifestation is possible; maybe it’s not going to show
up.” You must become a master at catching self-sabotage. Remember, it’s
not about not having self-sabotage, it’s about catching it. That’s 95%
of the game because if you can have enough self-awareness to catch your
own self-sabotage patterns that are attempting to click in, then you can
change them; you can recode them. And this is a little bit different
around how you handle self-sabotage, compared to how we looked at fear,
for example, because handling self-sabotage is very in the moment. So
your first task is to journal and create a list of all the ways that you
have self-sabotaged yourself in the past. Maybe these are really big
ways; maybe these are small ways; maybe these have been little thoughts
that actually pop into your head. What’s important is that you start
being self-aware of what self-sabotage specifically has looked like for
you. Once you’ve done that, and only once you’ve done that, you’re going
to go into the second piece of journaling and ask yourself, “When I
connect with my manifestation for this Quest, what are all of the ways
that I could potentially screw this up?” And I know this might sound
like a strange question, maybe not a very spiritual question to ask, but
it’s really important that you know what you are capable of. It’s really
important that you look at what are all the different ways that you
could sabotage this; what are all the different ways that you could
potentially screw this up. So when you connect with your manifestation
for this Quest, you might say, “You know what, well, I have the capacity
to potentially just drop out of the Quest and not watch the rest of
these videos.” “Maybe I could sabotage this and screw it up by telling
myself a story that I don’t have enough time now to do the soul work.”
“Maybe I could screw this up by allowing something in my external
reality to take priority, in which case I say, ‘Oh, you know, I no
longer do this manifestation Quest thing.’” Maybe you are going to have
stories in your head that tell you you’re not good enough to actually
manifest what it is that you desire in this Quest. Maybe you have a
self-sabotage pattern running of a story or some layers of self-talk
that says it’s impossible that it shows up before the end of this Quest.
I’m giving you some ideas; go deep with this. Get really clear on this,
because if you are able to put everything out on the table and go, “Wow,
okay here’s all the ways that I could screw it up; here’s all of my
self-sabotage patterns; here’s all the things that I could do, you are
not just going to be catching the self-sabotage if it shows up; you are
ready for it. In fact, you are looking for it; you’re aware of it.
You’re able to cut it off at the curb and say,”No, no, no, you don’t
even need to kick in because I’m not available to that.” We talked about
raising your minimum standard in a previous lesson, accelerating your
level of tolerance. This is part of this, okay. “You know what, I no
longer tolerate these sabotage patterns. I no longer tolerate acting
like that. I no longer tolerate making those excuses.” Whatever it is
for you, your system can now see, huh, okay, this is no longer a
surprise that’s going to show up. You’re actually ready and waiting for
it if it does happen. For your third piece of soul work, you’re going to
go in and ask yourself, what are you committed to when it comes to your
old self-sabotage patterns? If these patterns do show up, what are you
going to do differently? And when you catch these self-sabotage
patterns, what behaviors are you then going to lock in instead of the
sabotage pattern? What thoughts are you going to start thinking instead
of the old sabotaging thoughts? What actions are you going to take? Get
clear on this. This is how you recode your system from the insight out.
This is how we update the computer software package to no longer be
running on these unconscious self-sabotaging patterns. So I’m
superexcited for you to go deep with this. Please share this into the
Tribe. The more that you share in the group, the more you are going to
show other people what’s possible, and you’re going to be witnessed in
your breakthroughs and your transformations. And make sure you look at
what everyone else is sharing because you might see some self-sabotage
patterns written from someone else where you go, “Oh wait; hang on;
actually, I have that one too. No, no, no, wait, let me adjust mine, I’m
no longer going to tolerate this.” So go deep with this; have fun with
this, and I’m excited to see you on the next lesson.

====================

LESSON 14: Re-Code Your Self Belief

<v ->Welcome back. Today we’re going a layer deeper into really
understanding how to handle those old limitations that have shown up for
you, blocked you, stopped you, and held you back. If you don’t believe
that you were deserving and worthy of what you are intending to
manifest, then you never will be. But the good news is is that once you
understand how to upgrade your belief system, anything becomes possible.
Today we’re diving deeper into actually rewiring your belief system,
recoding it. And we start by firstly, recognizing what is going on
underneath the surface in your unconscious reality. We’ve already talked
a lot around the conscious and the unconscious mind and how it’s so
important to condition your unconscious to come into greater alignment
and cohesion. We talked about the computer software program that gets to
be upgraded. And the good news is in this lesson you are going to be
writing new programs to program your next level of manifestation, your
next level of self-belief so that your system can be in total alignment
and you can accelerate your results. Now what’s really important whilst
you do this work, whilst you go into these soul-aligned practices is
that you are aware of your energetic and emotional state whilst you’re
doing this. You know, someone could sit there and write out new beliefs
and start to craft a belief system that they would love to have and feel
nothing. Even if they do it for two or three hours. That is not the most
potent way to do this. Someone could spend say two or three minutes
doing this and start to feel what it feels like to truly believe that.
That is more beneficial. So when I give you these journaling soul tasks,
it’s really important not just to be robotic and writing things out on
paper. Stop; breathe; allow yourself to feel it. Allow yourself to get
into the feeling of what it would feel like if you did believe that.
Allow yourself to tap into the feeling of the version of you that
already has this level of belief system. The feeling and the emotions
are so important here. So how do we do this? What does this look like?
You get to recode your belief system from the inside out. Here’s your
first piece of soul work. You’re going to journal and ask yourself,
“What do I currently believe when it comes to manifesting X, Y, Z?” and
you can do this firstly around your manifestation on or before the end
of the Quest. And then you can repeat this as the second layer to this
first task. And you can focus in on your longer-term manifestation. So
when you start doing this I want you to be really real with this, really
raw with this. Really just get out on paper what you believe, and maybe
you believe some good things about it, but maybe also you notice some
things coming up. For example, “I believe it’s hard to manifest that.”
Maybe you believe it’s impossible. Maybe you believe deep down that it’s
not for you, or you don’t know how to do it. Whatever comes up, allow
yourself to write that down. No judgment. You want to purge this. You
want to get it out. This is a clearing process because we can’t write
the new programming system for this piece of software in your
unconscious mind if it’s stuck with the old software. So you need to see
what’s going on under the surface, again with no judgment and with total
curiosity for what’s actually happening. And for some of you, you may be
surprised what comes up. You may think, “Wow, do I really believe that?
Wow, that old belief is still there. Wow, that story really doesn’t
serve me.” No judgment, curiosity. Then what you’re going to do is we
start to then rewrite the new program. So your second piece of soul work
is to journal and for everyone of those limiting self-beliefs that you
wrote out in task number one, you’re going to take each one individually
and write out a minimum of three empowering self-beliefs in order to
start overriding the old program. So this might look something like if
you wrote out in task number one, you might have said, “Okay, you know,
deep down I believe that this manifestation before the end of the Quest,
I think it’s really hard. I think it’s hard for me to manifest that.”
Okay, so then for task number two you’re going to take that. And then
for the three empowering ones you might write something like “I choose
to believe that manifesting X, Y, Z on or before the end of the Quest is
easy. I choose to believe that this manifestation shows up in a way that
surprises me. I choose to believe that it’s easy for me to manifest this
and so much more into my life.” Okay? So you are writing it out in a way
where you write “I choose to believe,” and then you’re completing that.
And remember you need three for each one of these. So you need to take
every single one, and you start having at least three of them. Remember
what is really important is your emotional state and your energy. So
when you’re writing out I choose to believe that this manifestation is
now easy, allow yourself to feel that; allow yourself to get into the
frequency of that. Now your mind, your conscious mind may pop in at some
point when you are writing out these positive beliefs and these, you are
reaffirming this new reality, and you’re writing this computer software
program. It’s not uncommon for your unconscious to pop up and have a
conscious thought come into your mind and go, “Yeah right. I would like
to believe that but I don’t believe that. I’m writing out I choose to
believe, but I don’t believe right now. I don’t believe that it’s easy.
I don’t believe that’s true.” Allow that to come up. That’s another
clearing process through your mind. That’s another purging process. And
I promise you, if you stick with this, if you go deep with this, if you
spend time reprogramming your belief system, you will get to a point
where you become one with these beliefs. You wouldn’t sit there and
write out “I choose to believe the sky is blue. I choose to believe the
sky is blue. I really believe the sky is blue. I really hope I believe
that one day.” You’d be like, “The sky is blue. I know the sky is blue.”
I promise you. You’ll get to a point as you condition yourself from the
inside out where you won’t even need to write out. That’s easy to
manifest, ’cause you’ll be like, “I know that’s easy to manifest. That’s
just who I am. That’s just what I believe. That’s now truth.” You have a
deep frequency of knowing anchored into that. Like we talked about in
that previous lesson. Now you might not get to that frequency of knowing
overnight. This might take some time. This might take some commitment.
This might take living and breathing and dancing into these new beliefs.
But the only way to screw this up is to not do this. So go deep with
this. Now, in order to help you accelerate this, once you’ve done those
first two pieces and only then, make sure you pause this if you haven’t
done those yet, you’re going to go into a powerful, energetic
architecture activation. It’s a shorter one, but it’s going to allow you
to start connecting with the version of you where you truly back
yourself, where you have that next level of self-belief. And you’re
going to access this feeling state and this emotion of manifestation
that I’ve been talking about through this lesson. So once you’ve
completed those first tasks, let’s dive into the activation. Okay, go
ahead and allow yourself to sit or lie in a comfortable position.
Closing your eyes, turning inwards right now, grounding and anchoring
yourself into place with your breath and allowing yourself to lean into
your intention. To activate the version of you that already fully
embodies the belief system that you have crafted and defined and written
out in order to support your manifestations. Good. Allowing a red laser
beam to shoot from your tailbone, anchoring you and grounding you into
the crystalline core of the earth and simultaneously allowing a golden
laser beam of light to shoot up through your crown, connecting you to
your unique soul star, allowing you to be guided, grounded, present,
protected, and supported, heaven on earth embodied right here right now.
As you surround yourself with a ball of golden white light and drop any
energies and vibrations out of your field that do not serve you.
Allowing yourself to call in your divine guidance, divinely assigned in
order to support you in upgrading your belief system. As you lean even
deeper into your intention, and deeper remembrance, remembering that you
have full and complete access to this version of you that embodies such
a powerful level of self-belief. Allowing your manifestations to
manifest with ease, with grace, and with flow. Beautiful. Now from this
place, go ahead and pull up a mirror in front of you. That’s it. And as
you begin to notice and be aware of this mirror, you go ahead and you
look into this mirror. And as you look into this mirror you see a
version of yourself. That’s right. And as you connect with this version
of yourself, you notice that in this mirror you are looking at a version
of you from your future. That has come back all the way to right now in
order to support you in this upgrade. As you continue to look at this
version of you, you notice that this version of you has already
integrated and embodied and stabilized the exact high-level belief
system desired and required in order for you to truly embody the
manifestations that you are looking to anchor into your reality. That’s
right. And take a moment to connect with this version of you. Notice
this version of you. Notice what’s different about them versus this
version of you now. Notice what looks different, sounds different, feels
different. That’s it. Beautiful. And connecting with this version of you
that’s come back from your future all the way to right now in order to
support you in integrating the next level of your belief system, the
next level of self-belief. Go ahead and connect with this version. And
you begin to notice that this version is starting to gently step out of
the mirror and gently come towards you right now. That’s right. Until
this version of you is hovering right in front of you, close to your
four-body system, close to your physical body, hovering right there.
That’s it. You may notice a sensation through your physical body, maybe
even heat through your physical body. As you notice this version of you
coming closer and closer and closer, until it’s just a few inches or a
few centimeters away from you. That’s right. Looking directly into the
eyes right now of this version of you that has already embodied this
high-level belief system. That’s right. And now go ahead and gently
allow this version of you to come even closer and closer and closer,
until this version of you gently touches your physical body and begins
to merge into your physical body, becoming one with your physical body,
as every single layer of your being begins to fuse with every single
layer of your being from your highest self that showed up with this
integrated belief system. That’s it. Allowing a full and complete fusion
right now, becoming one with this version of you. You may feel this
version of you within your physical body. You may just simply know that
they have fully merged with you right now. Either way is absolutely
perfect. You may feel a slight tingling within your brain or within your
head as your unconscious mind and your conscious mind begin to receive
these upgrades. Dropping, dissolving, clearing any old beliefs out of
your system now that no longer serve you and that are not of the highest
and are no longer useful. And allowing these new layers of your belief
system to come online, activate, wake up, turn on and fire and wire,
creating new neural pathways through your brain center, allowing an
illumination of bright white light to allow parts of your brain that
were lying dormant, allowing them to wake up right now and come online.
Activating your innate intelligence and noticing that as these facets of
your consciousness come online, every single cell of your being begins
to gently return to an even purer, even truer essence of who you are.
You remember who you are. You remember how easy it is to embody this
high-level belief system. You begin to remember how easy it is to truly
embody self-belief and self-love at this deep, deep, deep level. That’s
it. And as you begin to access this deep feeling and this deep knowing
of the integration of this belief system. Go ahead and tune into the
feeling of how easy your manifestations now feel, how normal your
manifestations now feel, and allow that feeling, that state, that
frequency, that vibration, that emotion to rush through every single
cell of your being, allowing every single cell to wake up, wake up, wake
up and receive this feeling, this frequency, this vibration, this
emotion. And from this place, this state, this energy, and this emotion,
go ahead and double that feeling. That’s it, let it rush through every
single cell of your being. And now go ahead and triple that feeling.
That’s it, let it rush through every single cell. Vibrating with every
single cell right now. As you begin to remember how good it feels to be
you. You begin to remember how authentic this feels to truly be embodied
in a higher version of yourself. The version of you that has now
integrated, activated, and stabilized this high-level belief system at
such a deep level. That’s right. Beautiful. Allowing all of these shifts
to upgrade, ground, integrate, and stabilize within your system. I
remember who I am. I remember who I am. I remember who I am. This is me.
This is me; this is me. It is done. It is done. It is done. Beautiful,
and allowing all of that to ground, anchor, stabilize into place.
Requesting a full and complete upgrade continues of the integration of
your new belief system, 24 hours a day, seven days a week until it is
fully actualized, integrated, stabilized, embodied, and complete. And
may this activation continue with total ease, total grace, and total
flow. Allowing all of this to stabilize and integrate, as we begin to
now close down the field. Grounding this down, having so much gratitude
for your guidance. So much gratitude for yourself. So much gratitude of
that version of you that showed up from your future into right now in
order to support you in this upgrade. That’s it Beautiful. And coming
back to your breath, back to your body and gently, beginning to open
your eyes, and welcome back, and welcome into your new integrated belief
system. Take your time as always with this activation; drink lots of
water. This is a really deep unconscious shift and activation. And then
for your last piece of soul work, share with us. What is now different?
Connect to those feelings and those new emotional states. Maybe you want
to journal, meditate, or write down what is now different, what feels
different within you? What do you notice, and share that with the Tribe;
share that with the group, so we can witness you and celebrate you.
Congratulations on another powerful lesson. And I am excited to deep
dive into the next one with you.

That's it. And beautiful. And coming back to your breath, back to your body, and gently beginning to open your eyes.

====================

LESSON 15: Quieten Your “How” Addiction

<v ->Welcome back. Do you realize that you may have an unconscious
addiction that you don’t even know that you have? And this addiction
could be massively blocking you, stopping you, and slowing you down from
manifesting what you desire. As humans, so many of us are addicted to
what I call the “how,” addicted to asking yourself constantly, “How do I
make it happen?” And if you’re in a frequency of constantly running this
“how” addiction, of needing to figure out how something’s going to
happen, you’re in a frequency of fear. You’re in a frequency of doubt.
You’re in a frequency of uncertainty. You’re definitely not in a
frequency of deeply knowing and trusting that your manifestations will
happen and appear with ease and grace. No, you’re wearing the weight of
your manifestations on your shoulder. And you’re basically saying to
yourself, to God, to the universe, “I don’t know if my manifestations
are going to happen because if I don’t figure out how it’s going to
happen, then I don’t know how it’s going to happen. Which means that it
might not happen.” And you’re operating from this frequency of doubt,
this frequency of fear. This is such a big limit that can block us and
that can stop us. But the good news is is that, in this lesson, you’re
going to get this handled. So the mind can get addicted to trying to
figure out how something’s going to happen. And what this does is it
sends us in loops. It puts us in these circles. Because really,
ultimately, it’s impossible for us to control the full process. Remember
back to the lesson where we spoke about manufactured manifestation
versus surrendered manifestation. And remember we talked about when you
are attempting to manufacture how something shows up in your life, then
you’re not in an energy of abundance. You’re not in an energy of
expansion. You’re not in an energy of allowing miracles to unfold before
your very eyes. No, you’re in an energy of control, an energy of fear,
an energy of doubt. And guess what? When we talked about releasing
control in order to activate surrendered manifestation, well one of the
biggest ways that people attempt to control is through overthinking.
Overthinking is a form of control. And so tune into this right now, and
ask yourself, “Have I been overthinking? Have I been allowing my mind to
spin in circles? Has my unconscious”how” addiction been blocking me from
my powerful manifestation frequency and also from taking aligned
action?” Chances are, at some level, the answer is yes. We all get to
look at this. We all get to upgrade this. We all get to release our
“how” addiction. How do we do this? We do a process, and how I call it
is I call it a “how dump.” You can call it a how purge, a how clearing;
I call it a how dump. It’s literally when your unconscious mind dumps
everything that it no longer needs and requires, everything that’s been
driving these patterns of overthinking and spinning in circles and
looping you round. We dump it out into your journal and out onto your
paper. And then from that place, you begin to train yourself to notice
what is different when you’re not addicted to the “how,” when you’re not
spinning in circles, when you’re not constantly worrying about “how is
this going to happen?” Okay. So let’s dive right into this. Your soul
work for today is to journal and to do two “how dumps” and clear your
unconscious mind from spinning around in the “how.” And I want you to
really go into this and ask yourself, when you tune into your
manifestations, how could they show up? What are all the different ways
that possibly they could show up? Now, remember you’re doing two, one
for the Quest and one for your larger manifestation. So what you would
do for task number one is you would ask yourself, “Okay when I connect
to my manifestation that’s going to happen on or before this Quest, when
I connect to that, how could they show up? Well, it could show up by
turning up in this way. It could also show up by turning up in this way.
I could have this happen by taking this action. I could also have this
happen by taking this other action over here.” And you write out this
big list. We’re operating in the field of infinite possibilities. And so
remember, this is not about your mind figuring out how your
manifestation’s going to happen. No, this is about clearing that out,
purging that out, dumping that out of your system so that you can
actually be in a frequency of surrendered manifestation. Do this task
twice; repeat it, and then do it for your larger manifestation. Now for
the second layer of soul work, I want you to simply notice what is
different within your mind, within your energy, within your emotions
after this purging and clearing process. You might notice that your mind
is more clear. You might notice that your energy isn’t so worried about
how something’s going to happen. You might notice that you actually
start thinking different thoughts even about how something could show
up. When we’re in the field of infinite possibilities, and we’re
connected to that; that feels very different to unconsciously spinning
and looping around in your “how” addiction. So for your second task,
notice what is different. For your second task, notice the pieces that
feel different within you, and share this with the Tribe. Share your
breakthroughs and your takeaways with the Tribe, and let us know how was
it for you when you went through this “how dump,” this purging process
of the mind, and what is now different with the version of you that
you’re choosing to bring to the table? Go deep with this. This may take
some time, but this is potent work. And when you release your “how”
addiction, you really start playing into the magic of manifestation. I’m
excited to dive even deeper with you on the next lesson.

====================

LESSON 16: Remove Resistance and Transform It Into Gifts

<v ->Okay, welcome back. You’ve been doing such deep work around
clearing out so many layers of resistance and blocks that have been
blocking you and stopping you and holding you back. It’s important to
now remember in this lesson that manifestation is a holistic experience.
Every single layer of your being must be in alignment with what you are
looking to manifest, including your physical body. And that’s exactly
what we get to focus on today. In this lesson, we are going to be
learning how to clear out blocks and layers of resistance from our
physical bodies and specifically at a deep cellular level. So what you
need to know is that we all have trauma stuck in our physical bodies
from the past. And you might be thinking, “Regan, you know, I didn’t
have a traumatic childhood,” or “I can’t remember anything traumatic
that happened to me.” We all have this trauma as humans; our bodies
literally record everything. You know, even if you are at school and you
are sitting there, and you are waiting for your parent to come and pick
you up, and for whatever reason, they’re running late, and you’re
sitting there, and you’re waiting, and you’re watching all of your
friends go into the car, until you’re the only child left. And so you go
up to the teacher and you say, “Have you seen my mom? Have you seen my
dad?” And they say, “Oh, you know, I’m sure they’re just running late.
I’m sure they’ll make it. They’ll be here soon.” And then, all of a
sudden you start feeling abandoned: trauma. All of a sudden you start
feeling like you might be left alone forever: trauma. You start feeling
that your parents don’t love you: trauma. And this happens at a very
deep unconscious level, even as adults. If we look back and we think,
“Oh, you know, that’s no big deal now.” This micro trauma is still
recorded in ourselves. So in order to manifest faster we must become an
energetic match for what we are calling in. We’re going to be diving
deep in further lessons and really learning how to become an energetic
match. But for now simply know that in order to manifest what you
desire, all layers of your being must be in cohesion. And if your body
is not vibrating at a certain frequency, if it’s not vibrating at the
same frequency of what you’re looking to call in, it simply slows down
the manifestation process. So we must remove these microtraumas and
these bigger traumas from our body. We must remove these old stuck,
lower frequencies and any of these other blocks and limitations from our
cells in order to have our body clearer. This is about allowing your
body to return to its pure, natural, crystalline state. So how do we do
this? For the layers of self-work and soul work that you get to dive
into on this lesson, the first piece is to journal and simply ask
yourself what is currently blocking you or stopping you or holding you
back from your manifestation for this Quest. And when you start tuning
into those limits that you feel may still be present for you, even after
going through all of the processes up to this point, anything that’s
still present or still feels like there’s layers to work into. Then I
want you to ask yourself, okay for each of these limits that are still
present for you, where do each of these show up within your body, and
tune into this. Maybe there’s some fear still there. Maybe there’s some
doubt hanging out. Maybe a new limit has come to the surface ’cause
you’ve done so much clearing work over the last few lessons that
something new has been revealed. Where are each of these limits in your
body? So one by one specifically go through, and note, okay, this limit.
“Mm, I feel it in my neck, and this limit over here, that’s present to
me in my stomach area.” This limit here, maybe you feel it in your
heart. It could be anywhere within your physical body; simply tune into
where it is, and allow your body to guide you into the exact point. Then
for the second layer, only once you’ve done that piece, you’re going to
be guided through a powerful, closed-eye energetic architecture process
which is going to allow you to shift and clear these blocks and these
limitations from your body. For this process that we’re about to go
into, I want you to focus, firstly, just on one specific place in your
body that is housing maybe one or more of these blocks. Again, that
could be your head, your heart, your back, your shoulders, your neck,
your lower back, your upper back; wherever it is for you is perfect.
Maybe it’s in your hips. They can be in strange places; tune into that,
and pick one specific area of your body. And then from there you get to
be guided through this process of actually clearing out this part of
your body and allowing your body to come back to its natural state. So
after you’ve done this piece of soul work and you’ve gotten clear on
these blocks and these limits and clear on these specific areas, let’s
dive into this activation, remembering that you can use this activation
over and over again and repeat it for different areas of your body as
well. Okay, let’s dive right in. Go ahead and sit or lie in a
comfortable position, allowing yourself to close your eyes, and turn
inward right now, as you sink deeper and deeper into your center,
centering your breath, coming into the state of alchemy, being aware of
your physical body, your beautiful, crystalline body. As you ground into
this intention of allowing these old blocks and limitations that have
been stored and recorded as microtraumas or even larger traumas through
your body, holding this intention that you are aware of them, and you’re
able to clear them and release them with ease, grace, and flow.
Beautiful. As you allow a red laser beam to shoot down from your
tailbone, anchoring you and connecting you into the crystalline core of
the earth and simultaneously allowing a golden laser beam of light to
shoot up through your crown, connecting you right now to your unique
soul star, allowing you to be guided, grounded, present, protected, and
supported; heaven on earth embodied right here, right now. As you
surround yourself with a ball of golden white light, and clear out any
vibrations or frequencies that are not of the highest in order to bring
this activation into a state of purity. Beautiful; good. Now from this
place, go ahead and allow yourself to tune into that specific part of
your body, building conscious awareness with that part of your body
right now; wherever it is for you is absolutely perfect. And go ahead
and simply speak directly to that section of your body right now, and
simply let that part of your body know that it is safe to release these
limits. It is safe to clear these energies. It is safe to let go of
these old traumas; go ahead and speak directly to that part of your
body, and let that part of your body know that the information that has
been stored within this part of the body is no longer useful, is no
longer necessary. That’s right. And now go ahead and connect with that
part of your body, and ask that part of your body, “What would you like
me to learn? What would you like me to know?” And allow yourself to
receive that answer. Now, maybe it’s one word. Maybe it’s a short
sentence. Maybe it’s an image. Maybe it’s a feeling, a sound; whatever
that part of your body wants you to know, allow yourself to receive that
and integrate that right now. And now go ahead and talk to that part of
your body, and say to it directly. “Thank you so much. I receive that. I
integrate that. Thank you for sharing that.” Beautiful. And from this
place, go ahead and now tune into that part of your body, and go ahead
and now simply notice what is different with how this part of your body
feels versus how it used to feel. That’s right. You may notice subtle
shifts, subtle layers of releases, or you may simply notice that that
stuck feeling that that body area had has now gone. That’s right. Is it
there, or has it just disappeared? Good; beautiful. And now from this
place, you’re going to go and breathe into that part of your body,
wherever it is for you. And as you breathe in, you’re going to breathe
in light. You’re going to breathe in gratitude. You’re going to breathe
in love. And as you breathe it in, breathing all of this energy right
now into that specific part of your body, focus it there as if that part
of your body has lungs. And now hold that breath; hold that energy.
Bring in a little bit more breath; hold it right there. Allow it to
shift and recalibrate. And then when you breathe out, when you are
ready, you’re going to breathe out any last layers or pieces of
information associated with this body part, this area, being stuck,
ahhh, using the sound. We’re going to do this again, breathing into that
area. Maybe you’re breathing into your shoulders. Maybe you’re breathing
into your lower back. Maybe you’re breathing into your heart or your
stomach; wherever it is for you is perfect. Breathing in light. Love,
gratitude, breathing, all of that in right now, deeper this time; that’s
it. Hold the breath; breathe it in a little bit more. Allow it to
recalibrate, sink, realign to this new frequency, expanding, filled with
light, love, gratitude. And then when you release the breath, when
you’re ready, use the sound, and clear anything stuck or left around
this. Ah, good. In doing this a third and final time, breathing in even
stronger, even deeper this time, as if this area of your body has its
own lungs, breathing in light, love, gratitude; that’s it. Fill it up;
hold it there a little bit more. That’s it, allowing this section of
your physical body to recalibrate and open and expand and increase its
capacity to receive, noticing how much more space it now has to hold all
of these new frequencies and these new vibrations. And when you’re
ready, using your clearing breath, releasing anything that is not pure
light, love, and gratitude. Ah, beautiful. And as you tune into this
section of your body, go ahead and simply notice what is different.
That’s right. Maybe your body now wants to move in a certain way. Maybe
it wants to relax and integrate into stillness in this new vibration;
whatever your rhythm is after this activation is absolutely perfect. As
we begin to ground and anchor and solidify all of this down right now,
recording this beautiful release and upgrade and activation through
every single cell of your being; that’s right, allowing your body to
continue to return back to its crystalline state, to purity continuing
this activation 24 hours a day, seven days a week, until it’s fully
actualized integrated, stabilized, embodied, and complete; that’s right.
And as we ground all of this down, having so much gratitude through your
heart for this beautiful part of your body that is upgraded and
recalibrated, having so much gratitude for your entire body, for its
infinite, innate intelligence. Having so much gratitude for your guides
and so much gratitude for yourself. Remembering the alchemist that you
are, remembering your innate capacity to shift and transform and
alchemize any blocks or limitations which have been blocking you,
stopping you, or slowing you back. Notice how different you now feel.
That’s right. Beautiful. As we ground all of this down, anchoring this
in, coming back to your breath. Back into your conscious awareness and
into this moment. And then gently, beginning to open your eyes. Welcome
back. Beautiful deep process. Hmm, congratulations on clearing and
upgrading this part of your body. This is very deep work. So really
trust your rhythm around what your body needs right now. Maybe it needs
water. Maybe it needs sleep. Maybe it needs to move. Maybe it needs
stillness; whatever it needs is perfect. Really trust that. And from
here, your next layer of soul work is to repeat this process, repeat the
journaling, and do this actually for your larger manifestation now, and
then repeat the activation again for that part of your body. That’s
going to help you shift, clear, and upgrade your physical body to be in
greater alignment for your larger manifestation also. Now we want to
hear from you. We want to celebrate you, and I would love to hear
exactly what came up for you. What has been your breakthroughs, your
takeaways, your “aha” moments. What do you now notice that is different
within the physical layer of your being? Make sure you share this; share
it with the Tribe be witnessed in your transformation. I’m so proud of
you. The layers we have gone into through these different healing and
clearing and upgrading protocols is so deep and so potent and so
profound. I’m extremely excited to dive into the next phase of this
Quest; have fun integrating all of these upgrades, and I’ll see you soon
blessings.

LESSON 16: Meditation - Clear Blocks From Your Body

- Go ahead and sit or lie in a comfortable position, allowing yourself to close your eyes and turn inward right now as you sink deeper and deeper into your center. Centering your breath, coming into the state of alchemy, being aware of your physical body, your beautiful crystalline body as you ground into this intention of allowing these old blocks and limitations that have been stored and recorded as microtraumas or even larger traumas through your body, holding this intention that you are aware of them and you're able to clear them and release them with ease, grace, and flow. Beautiful as you allow a red laser beam to shoot down from your tailbone, anchoring you and connecting you into the crystalline core of the earth, and simultaneously allowing a golden laser beam of light to shoot up through your crown, connecting you right now to your unique soul star, allowing you to be guided, grounded, present, protected, and supported heaven on earth, embodied right here, right now as you surround yourself with a ball of golden white light and clear out any vibrations or frequencies that are not of the highest in order to bring this activation into a state of purity. Beautiful. Good. Now from this place, and go ahead and allow yourself to tune into that specific part of your body. Building conscious awareness with that part of your body right now, wherever it is for you, is absolutely perfect. And go ahead and simply speak directly to that section of your body right now. And simply let that part of your body know that it is safe to release these limits. It is safe to clear these energies. It is safe to let go of these old traumas. Go ahead and speak directly to that part of your body and let that part of your body know that the information that has been stored within this part of the body is no longer useful, is no longer necessary. That's right. And now go ahead and connect with that part of your body and ask that part of your body, what would you like me to learn? What would you like me to know? And allow yourself to receive that answer. Now, maybe it's one word, maybe it's a short sentence, maybe it's an image, maybe it's a feeling, a sound. Whatever that part of your body wants you to know, allow yourself to receive that and integrate that right now. And now go ahead and talk to that part of your body and say to it directly, thank you so much. I receive that. I integrate that. Thank you for sharing that. Beautiful. And from this place, go ahead and now tune into that part of your body. And go ahead and now simply notice what is different with how this part of your body feels versus how it used to feel. That's right. You may notice subtle shifts, subtle layers of releases. Or you may simply notice that that stuck feeling that that body area had has now gone. That's right. Is it there or has it just disappeared? Good. Beautiful. And now from this place, you're going to go and breathe into that part of your body, wherever it is for you. And as you breathe in, you're going to breathe in light. You're going to breathe in gratitude. You're going to breathe in love. And as you breathe it in, breathing all of this energy right now into that specific part of your body, focus it there as if that part of your body has lungs. And now hold that breath, hold that energy, bring in a little bit more breath. Hold it right there. Allow it to shift and recalibrate. And then when you breathe out, when you are ready, you're going to breathe out any last layers or pieces of information associated with this body part, this area being stuck. Ah, using the sound. We're going to do this again, breathing into that area. Maybe you are breathing into your shoulders, maybe you're breathing into your lower back. Maybe you're breathing into your heart or your stomach. Wherever it is for you is perfect. Breathing in light, love, gratitude, breathing, all of that in right now, D for this time. That's it. Hold the breath, breathe it in a little bit more. Allow it to recalibrate, sink, realign to this new frequency, expanding, filled with light. Love, gratitude. And then when you release the breath, when you're ready, use the sound and clear anything stuck or left around this. Ah, good. And doing this a third and final time. Breathing in even stronger, even deeper this time as if this area of your body has its own lungs. Breathing in light, love, gratitude. That's it. Fill it up. Hold it there a little bit more. That's it. Allowing this section of your physical body to recalibrate and open and expand and increase its capacity to receive. Noticing how much more space it now has to hold all of this new frequencies and these new vibrations. And when you're ready, using your clearing breath, releasing anything that is not pure light, love and gratitude. Ah, beautiful. And as you tune into this section of your body, go ahead and simply notice what is different. That's right. Maybe your body now wants to move in a certain way. Maybe it wants to relax and integrate into stillness and this new vibration. Whatever your rhythm is after this activation is absolutely perfect. As we begin to go ground and anchor and solidify all of this down right now, recording this beautiful release and upgrade and activation through every single cell of your being. That's right. Allowing your body to continue to return back to its crystalline state, to purity. Continuing this activation 24 hours a day, seven days a week, until it's fully actualized, integrated, stabilized, embodied, and complete. That's right. And as we ground all of this down, having so much gratitude through your heart for this beautiful part of your body that is upgraded and recalibrated, having so much gratitude for your entire body, for its infinite innate intelligence, having so much gratitude for your guides and so much gratitude for yourself. Remembering the alchemist that you are, remembering your innate capacity to shift and transform and alchemize any blocks or limitations which have been blocking you, stopping you, or slowing you back. Notice how different you now feel. That's right. Beautiful. As we ground all of the stone anchoring the sin, coming back to your breath, back into your conscious awareness, and into this moment, and then gently beginning to open your eyes.

Step Into the Next Version of You

====================

LESSON 17: Re-Code New Structures of Reality Into Your Field

<v ->Welcome back to this next phase of the manifestation Quest. I’m
excited for you because we now get to dive into such a deep, potent
layer during this phase. As you remember, we’ve said this many times
through the Quest, you don’t necessarily get in life what you do, but
you do get who you choose to be. Now in this phase, we’re going deeper
into recalibrating the version of you from the inside out that is ready,
willing, and available to step into manifesting whatever it is that you
desire. Now, the first phase to this is to prepare your energetic field.
It is so important to be working deeply on your energetic field in order
to bring your energetic field in deeper alignment and acceleration with
your manifestations. Now, if there are pieces of your consciousness and
your energetic field that are not aligned, this literally slows down
your manifestation process. So we are going to be utilizing, of course,
the energetic architecture method to go even deeper, now, into
recalibrating your energetic field, to bring your system into higher
alignment. Remember, the energetic architecture method works deeply,
working through the energetic field, and it works through utilizing the
structure of reality. It works by playing with the pieces of light and
the information within your field in order to bring them into greater
cohesion, in order to allow your field and your system to return to its
natural, crystalline state. Through this activation, we’re also going to
be working and clearing and dropping out anything that’s in your
energetic layer, in your energetic field, that’s not in alignment with
the specific manifestations that you are calling in. When you work at
this deep energetic layer, you’re going to be working through the
patterns of geometry at a deep geometric blueprint level. Every single
person has a current blueprint running in their energetic field. And
this then alters our unconscious mind and our belief system and
everything that we’ve touched on in this Quest so far. This is why it’s
so important to run these updates and facilitate these upgrades, so that
you can actually upgrade the geometries within your field, so that your
system can, again, come into even greater alignment. So this activation
works at a very subtle level. Please don’t have any big attachments or
expectations as you go into this. It may be life-changing. You may see
and feel a lot, or it may be very, very, very subtle, recoding gently
your energetic field. As we go into this, I invite you to do this
activation twice. Firstly, we’re going to do the energetic update for
your specific manifestation on or before the end of this Quest. And then
you get to repeat the process and do this activation for your
longer-term manifestation. So again, I’ll be here guiding you. Make sure
you’re in a beautiful, safe, comfy position, and let’s get started. Go
ahead and sit or lie in a comfortable position, and gently close your
eyes, and allow yourself to now drop inwards right now. Beautiful. As
you become available to ground into your intention, your intention to
update all of the information within your energetic field, allowing your
energetic layer of being to come into even greater alignment and
cohesion with your desired manifestation. Beautiful. As you allow a red
laser beam to shoot down from your tailbone all the way down, anchoring
you, grounding you, solidifying you into the crystalline core of the
earth, and simultaneously allowing a golden laser beam of light to shoot
up through your crown, connecting you right now to your unique soul
star. Allowing you to be guided grounded, present, protected, and
supported; heaven on earth, embodied right here, right now. As you
surround yourself with a ball of golden white light. Beautiful. And
taking a moment to call in your guides, beings of light of the highest
vibration, divinely assigned to specifically support you in upgrading
your energetic field. Welcome; welcome; welcome; please guide us. Please
support us. Please assist us in facilitating this upgrade in this
beautiful activation. Beautiful. As we now begin to work through the
subtle layers of your being, go ahead and gently tune into your
energetic field. You may feel your energetic field. You may see it. You
may just simply know that you are connecting to it right now; either way
is absolutely perfect. And as we go even a layer deeper into the
structure of reality, working now at a very subtle light blueprint
level, go ahead and allow yourself to see, feel, or know that we are
starting to gather all of the geometries, the pieces of informations
that create the codes, the unique pieces of coding that is required in
order for your field to become an energetic match for what you are
looking to call in. Beautiful. You may see some of these geometries,
crystalline, stunning in their nature, and you may just simply know that
you are connecting with them right now. Either way is perfect. So now we
go a layer deeper, connecting in at this geometric light blueprint
level. And we begin to actually work within these geometries, zooming
into them right now, going into the structure within the structure. I
decree and declare a full and complete update of all the geometries
within these specific sets of codes, right here, right now, and
requesting that these updates begin to take place, and these geometries
begin to gently return back to their full, natural, crystalline state of
being, their essence, their purity. Allowing these geometries to gently
shift and recode and allow themselves to come back into their natural,
powerful, pure, crystalline state, right here, right now. Beautiful; you
may feel this taking place. You may feel a tingling in your body. You
may just simply know that this update is happening. Either way is
perfect. And as you allow yourself to now surrender deeper and deeper
into this place, in this state of alchemy, of recalibration, of
activation, allow yourself now to gently tune into anything within your
energetic field that is currently misaligned. Anything that is blocking
you, stopping you, slowing you down, limiting your capacity to hold and
become an energetic match for your divine manifestations. You may be
aware of these energetic blocks or limits. You may simply know that
you’re tuning into them right now, calling forth any limits within the
energetic field, any limits and any distortions within the light
blueprint level. Working now to accumulate any of these limits, blocks,
or distortions specifically that are not yours, that have been imprinted
by humanity. Requesting all of these now gather within the field.
Beautiful. And as this accumulation starts to take place, go ahead and
simply request that all of these blocks and limitations and distortions
through the energetic field now begin to drop, dissolve, and clear out
of the energetic field with ease, with grace, and with flow. Requesting
that any distortions, any blocks, any limitations that are not yours,
request right now that they be returned to the center, all the way back.
That’s it, sending them all the way back into the center of the
universe, allowing them to return to source, sending them via the
sender, clearing any old karmic patterns as we go. Beautiful. I’m
requesting this continuation of this clearing process through these
subtle layers continues. Beautiful. Requesting that the clearing
protocol and process continues, working through the subtle layers of
your being right now. And as this continues, simply go ahead and notice
how much more space is now available within your energetic field.
Beautiful. You may notice new energetic containers starting to form in
order to hold your manifestations that are looking to come and be
anchored through your energetic field and then into your physical
reality right here right now. You may just simply know that these new
energetic containers are taking their new structure within your system;
either way is perfect. Beautiful. And now washing your energetic field
with golden white light; beautiful. Allowing a full and complete
activation and purification of the field, allowing it to become even
more crystalline, even more shiny, even more divine, increasing your
capacity through the energetic field to hold more light, hold more
information, hold more of your divine manifestations that you desire to
manifest; as above, so below. We get to now allow these links of the
energetic field to be imprinted through every single other layer of our
being, allowing these imprints to take place and these upgrades to take
place through our mental body, our emotional body, all the spiritual
layers of our being, and also through our physical body, imprinting
these updates at a deep cellular level. You may notice also an
increasing expansion taking place through every single layer of your
other being. That’s right. Every single other layer expanding,
increasing, holding even more light, even more information, increasing
the capacity for you to hold your divine manifestations, as you notice
that working through these subtle geometric blueprints, you are
literally updating who you are. You are updating your energetic capacity
to be the version of you that naturally is an energetic match for your
divine manifestations; that’s right. Beautiful. Allowing all of this to
now ground and anchor and solidify into your field with ease, with
grace, and with flow. Requesting all of these updates grow roots and
solidify into your consciousness, and requesting that these energetic
updates continue through the field 24 hours a day, seven days a week,
until they’re fully actualized, integrated, stabilized, embodied, and
complete. And may they update with ease and with grace. Simply and
effortlessly integrating into your system right here, right now.
Beautiful. As we anchor all of this into your system and allowing
yourself to now take a deep breath. Beautiful. Breathing in all of this
new information, and then breathing out, ah; allowing all of this to
integrate, stabilize, and embody at the subtle layers of your being.
That’s right. As we begin to seal the fields up, having so much
gratitude, this beautiful energetic update, so much gratitude. For your
divine guidance, so much gratitude for yourself. The being of light
embodied right here, right now, that you are the alchemist that you are.
That’s right. It is done. It is done. It is done. And as you allow
yourself to gently drop back into this state; go ahead, bring yourself
back into this present moment in time, back into your breath, into your
now consciousness. And when you are ready, now you can gently open your
eyes. Beautiful. Remembering that whatever process you are in right now
is absolutely perfect. Every experience is subtle and profound and
unique all at the same time. Your soul work is to now take care of your
integration, and then share with the Tribe. What do you now notice is
different within you at a subtle layer, at an energetic layer? What came
up for you? What’s your breakthrough? Let us celebrate you.
Congratulations, again, on another powerful update. And in the next
lesson, we are going even deeper into becoming an energetic match for
your manifestations. I’ll see you there.

LESSON 18: The Key to Becoming an Energetic Match

<v ->Welcome back. We’ve been talking a lot now around becoming an
energetic match for what you are looking to call in. And in this lesson,
we are going to be discovering what does that really mean and more
importantly, how do you actually make that happen? As I have now said
multiple times, we attract what we are, and if we want to accelerate our
manifestations, we must become an energetic match for what we are
looking to manifest. We must be vibrating at the same frequency of what
we are looking to call in, and this is important across all of your
layers of your being. Now, many people have this backwards, and they
think, “You know, when I manifest what I want to manifest, then I’ll be
that version of myself.” For example, if someone wanted to manifest a
million dollars, people often think, “Well, I’ll be a millionaire once I
manifest a million dollars or multiple millions of dollars,” when really
it’s completely backwards; it’s completely around the other way. No, you
must be that millionaire from the inside out. You must breathe that
version of you. You must be in resonance energetically with that
frequency of already having that amount of money, and then the money
shows up almost as a side effect from the deep energetic alignment
that’s taken place within you, as you become more and more and more of
an energetic match for what you are calling in. Please remember, this is
not about becoming something you are not. No, this is actually about a
deep return, a return to your natural state, a natural state of
abundance, a natural state of truly having it all on your terms, in
whatever way that looks like for you. How do you know when you are a
full energetic match with your manifestations? Well, quite simply, if
your manifestation hasn’t shown up yet in your physical reality, then
you’re not quite a full energetic match yet. But the good news is is
that you can train your system to become an energetic match. It’s not a
God-given gift where some people are energetic matches for their
manifestations, and some people are not. No, there is a process around
this. There’s a system around this, and that’s exactly what we are going
into on this lesson today. You must get into the frequency of your
manifestation being done. Even if you don’t know what it feels like,
even if you don’t know how it’s going to happen, you must create that
feeling. We’re frequency beings. Everyone thinks that money is our
currency, but no, our frequency is our currency. Let me say that again.
Our frequency is our currency. Our frequency is our energetic exchange
with the universe, and our frequency is our currency when it comes to
our manifestations. So you must learn to cultivate the frequency of
having your manifestation now, from the inside out. The inner energetic
alignment, the inner energetic match comes first every single time. So
how do we do this? This is a practice. This is a practical action. This
is a step in your soul school that you get to dive into and integrate
into your lifestyle because becoming an energetic match for your
manifestations isn’t something that you just do once. It’s a lifestyle
that you commit to, and you go deeper and deeper and deeper into. So the
process that I love to use, I use this personally and I’ve used this
with hundreds of thousands of people all over the world now, is to use
something very simple that you have; it’s called an alarm. Now in order
to do this process and attune yourself to becoming an energetic match
for your specific manifestation, here’s what you’re going to do. You’re
going to set an alarm on your phone, and you’re going to set that alarm
as many times as possible throughout your day. Ideally once an hour, if
that’s possible, and make sure it’s a nice alarm, not an alarm that
stresses you out every time it goes off but a nice alarm, a peaceful
alarm, a manifestation alarm. And when you set up these manifestation
alarms, when they go off throughout your day, your job is to stop. Stop
what you’re doing. Stop sending that email; stop having that
conversation. Let that alarm go off; you’re going to stop; you’re going
to close your eyes for no longer than two minutes. And then you are
going to simply allow yourself to feel and ask yourself, “What would it
feel like if my manifestation was done? What would it feel like if my
manifestation had already showed up in my reality?” And feel that
feeling; then when you start to feel that feeling, tell your system to
double that feeling. When you start to feel that feeling, tell your
system to triple that feeling. Let it rush through your cells, and
notice how good it feels. Now, the first time you do this, you might not
feel much; that’s okay. Do it again. Do it again. Do it again. And then
eventually you’ll get really good at dropping into the energetic state
of what it feels like to have your manifestation be done. And then over
time, over maybe some days or even some weeks or beyond, those alarms
will go off, and you’ll think, “Huh? Hang on. I’m already in that state.
I’m already in that feeling.” Keep going; close your eyes; double the
feeling; triple the feeling; let yourself feel how good it feels. And
then something very interesting will happen. That alarm will go off and
you’ll realize, “Huh? I’ve manifested what it is that I desire.” That’s
when you know you are a full energetic match because your manifestation
is here. It’s manifested; it’s in your reality already. And then you
don’t stop and stop setting alarms. No, you go deeper; you go to the
next level, and you shift your focus and your attention into these next
steps and these next places and these next phases of your
manifestations. So you can probably guess, your soul work is to set your
manifestation alarm; set that alarm ideally every hour, every day, if
possible. And when that alarm goes off, stop 30 seconds to two minutes
max; close your eyes; allow yourself to feel, visualize, or know that
your manifestation is done. Notice how good it feels, and when you feel
that feeling starting to increase, double it; triple it; be with it;
celebrate it from the inside out, no attachment. Even if you do this for
days and you feel like you feel nothing, it’s working on a very subtle
level; you just have to keep going. And then your second piece of soul
work is to share your breakthroughs into the group. We want to hear you.
I want to celebrate you. I want to hear how is it every time your
manifestation alarm goes off? How is it knowing that you are building
your energetic muscle and becoming even more and more of an energetic
match? I want to see and celebrate your breakthroughs. So please share
them with us, knowing that you’re going to inspire so many people as
well to go deeper with this. So play with this, have fun with this, set
those alarms and I’ll see you on the next lesson. Blessings.

====================

LESSON 19: Build Awareness of Your Current Reality

<v ->Welcome back. I trust you’re having fun playing with your
manifestation alarms. Now you get to go and layer deeper into really
inner-standing how you can condition yourself into truly being an
energetic match combined with this action that you are already taking.
So in order to shift your beingness, as we talked about, you must shift
your identity, and in order to shift your identity, which we’re going to
actually go into in the next lesson, you’ve got to get really clear on
where you are currently at with your current identity. Who are you being
currently? So how you do this is you must take stock and get really raw
and real and understand your current identity, so you know what you get
to shift and upgrade. It’s very challenging to shift something if you
are not sure what needs to be shifted. So I love to call this the
identity reality check. This is where you start asking yourself some big
questions about who you really are right here, right now, today. You
cannot do this through judgment. You can only do this through conscious
curiosity. So these questions that you start to ask are things like who
do you really believe that you are right now? I want you to ask yourself
what are you capable of currently? And what do you believe that you’re
not capable of? I want you to also ask yourself, what are you doing or
not doing each and every single day in order to move your manifestations
forward? What parts of yourself do you desire to upgrade? What are the
parts of yourself that you know could be better or in even more
alignment with your manifestations? Ask yourself, what are you currently
tolerating that you really no longer desire to tolerate anymore? These
are questions to get you started. And you can play with this, and ask
yourself even greater questions. If you ask great questions, you tend to
get some really good quality answers. So go deep, and get really raw and
real when you start doing this process. Now it’s really important that
you do have gratitude for your current identity. I mean, this version of
you has got you to this point. It’s got you to right here right now, and
you’ve got to be thankful for that. Even if there are parts that you can
see need to shift and upgrade, and we’re getting there, that’s exactly
what we’re going to go into on the next lesson. It’s important when you
do the identity reality check that you’re doing it from a place of
curiosity and from gratitude. So the first piece of soul work is to go
in and do your identity reality check. And once you go through this
process, we’re going to be shifting this and upgrading this in the next
lesson. So don’t worry if you’re not superhappy with everything that you
write down. And then the next layer to this is you get to go into a
powerful, closed-eye, energetic architecture process. And I’m going to
be taking you through a choice point where you get to choose and anchor
in your new identity that you are going to be stepping into. This is the
setup for the deep work that we are going to be doing tomorrow. So this
process of course is guided, and you get to go deep into this right now;
make sure that you complete task number one and that first layer of soul
work before you dive into this. So assuming that you’ve now completed
that, let’s go into this activation and get started with this right now.
Go ahead and sit or lie in a comfortable position, and allow yourself to
gently close your eyes, turning inwards right now. As you center and
ground yourself through your breath, allowing a red laser beam to shoot
down from your tailbone all the way down, anchoring you into the
crystalline core of the earth. And simultaneously allowing a golden
laser beam of light to shoot up through your crown, connecting you right
now to your unique soul star, allowing you to be guided grounded,
present, protected, and supported; heaven on earth embodied right here,
right now, as you surround yourself with a ball of golden white light.
And simply request that any energies, frequencies, or vibrations that
are not yours dissolve and clear out of your system with ease, with
grace, and with flow. As you call in your divine guidance and allow
yourself to gently lean into your divine intention. And as you lean even
deeper into your intention, you realize that through this activation,
you will be making a choice across every single realm, reality, and
dimension in order to step and choose with every cell of your being this
next version of yourself. This next version of you that is desired and
required in order to become a true and complete energetic match, and
allow your manifestations to show up with ease, with grace, and with
flow. Beautiful. Now from this place, go ahead and allow yourself to
pull up two mirrors in front of you. You may see these mirrors; you may
feel them; you may just simply know that you have pulled them up in your
consciousness right now; either way is perfect. And as you look into the
first mirror, you see a reflection of yourself looking back, and you
notice that you are connecting with a reflection of you, a version of
you that is indeed your mirror reflection right now. A true and complete
mirror reflection of your current identity. A true and complete mirror
reflection of the version of you embodied right here, right now, that
has got you to this point. All of your beliefs, all of your patterns,
all of your layers of beingness, your behaviors, your vibration, your
frequency, your emotions, your mental state, all of it encoded within
this identity. Beautiful. And now go ahead and turn your focus and your
attention to the second mirror. And you notice another version of you
looking back, but this version of you is a version of you from your
future. A version of you with a even more upgraded identity. A version
of you that has walked the path and gone deep into your inner work and
recalibrated so many gifts and so many lessons. A version of you that
has lived and grown and learned through so many challenges. A version of
you that has upgraded and updated your mental layer of your being, your
belief system, your unconscious reality. A version of you that has a
different emotional state, a different frequency. A version of you that
feels different at a cellular level. A version of you that has an even
deeper spiritual connection through your spiritual layer of your being.
A version of you that is energetically upgraded. That’s right. Take a
look at this version. Notice anything that’s important about this
version right now. That’s right. This version of you from out in your
future that is still you, just a more evolved version of you. A version
of you that has already manifested what you desire to manifest in your
life. That’s right. And now step back and notice these two mirrors.
Notice these two versions of you. You are at a choice point, and in a
moment you get to make a choice that will shift your entire reality. You
get to choose whether you keep your old identity or whether you choose
to integrate this new identity of your highest self from your future
into the right now. Take a look at those two mirrors, and now simply
make your choice. What will you choose? I’m going to make a bold
assumption, because you’re in this Quest, that you chose the second
mirror and the second identity, the version of you that’s already
manifested your manifestations. So assuming that, go ahead and look now
at the first mirror, the current identity, that version of you, and
simply share your gratitude with that version. Allow yourself to love on
that version and have so much gratitude for everything that that version
of you has lived through in order to bring you to right now. That’s it.
Beautiful. And now you can also let this version of you know that this
version, this old identity is no longer required because you are about
to go through an identity recalibration and upgrading process. Now you
get to release this identity, and you can do this in whatever way feels
aligned for you. You could dissolve the mirror in front of you. You
could send that mirror out, allowing it to simply fade into the
nothingness. You could allow this mirror to shatter and break before
your very eyes. Whatever feels good and aligned. Go ahead and dispose of
this mirror and this version of you and this identity with so much love
and gratitude now. Phew. Beautiful. And this leaves now one remaining
mirror. Bring this mirror so it is directly in front of you right now.
Choose this with every single layer of your being. This is your moment,
your chance, your opportunity to choose across every single layer of
your being, this higher identity of your highest self. This version of
you that’s already manifested your divine manifestations. Choose that
with so much love, gratitude, excitement. That’s right. Looking back at
this reflection of you in this mirror, this version of you from your
future that has come back from your future all the way to right now.
Alow this version of you to now step out of the mirror, so it’s coming
closer and closer and closer towards you. Beautiful. And as this version
of you gets closer and closer and closer, go ahead and invite this
version of you to now fuse with you entirely right now. Phew! That’s it.
Become one with this version. Allow this version in. Integrate this
identity now. Beautiful. You may feel a tingling through your body as
this version of you begins to update at a cellular level. You may feel
your brain centers illuminating and waking up. You may feel subtle
shifts through your energetic bodies. You may just simply know that this
upgrade and this assimilation and integration is taking place; either
way is absolutely perfect. Allow every single cell of your being once
again to choose this. “I say yes to my highest self. I say yes to
integrating my highest identity. I say yes to my soul. I say yes. I say
yes. I say yes.” And as this upgrade begins to integrate and assimilate
and lock into your system, growing roots within your field right now,
allow yourself to have so much gratitude for this integration, for this
upgrade. So much gratitude for your highest self and this acceleration
of the embodiment of who you truly are at your core. That’s right. So
much gratitude for your guides. So much gratitude for your own innate
manifestation power. It is done. It is done. It is done. Beautiful. As
we begin to ground all of this down, integrating these upgrades and
allowing them to continue 24 hours a day, seven days a week until this
higher identity is fully integrated and embodied with ease, grace, and
flow. Anchoring in this choice point and allowing space in your field
and in your system to go into the next layer of this activation that we
will go through in the next lesson, prepping and preparing your field
and your system for the next layer of this upgrade. Allowing yourself to
breathe with so much gratitude through your heart, coming back into
awareness, back into your breath. And when you are ready now, you can
open your eyes. Mm, beautiful. Welcome back. Ah! Amazing to dive deep
into this new choice point with you. Congratulations. Your task now for
your soul work is to share with us. How was that for you? What did you
choose? What is now different in the essence of your being? Let us
witness you. Most people don’t realize that one of the fastest ways to
shift and grow and heal and transform is simply to be witnessed. So let
us witness you. Let us celebrate you. Let us celebrate your choice
around this highest identity. Congratulations for going through this.
The next lesson, we are diving deeper into the recalibration of your
identity, to pull forth your manifestations with even more grace in an
accelerated way. See you there.

- Go ahead and sit or lay in a comfortable position and allow yourself to gently close your eyes, turning inwards right now as you center and ground yourself through your breath, allowing a red laser beam to shoot down from your tailbone all the way down, anchoring you into the crystalline core of the earth, and simultaneously allowing a golden laser beam of light to shoot up through your crown, connecting you right now to your unique soul star, allowing you to be guided, grounded, present, protected, and supported heaven on earth, embodied right here, right now as you surround yourself with a ball of golden white light.

You get to choose whether you keep your old identity or whether you choose to integrate this new identity of your highest self from your future into the right. Now, take a look at those two mirrors and now simply make your choice. What will you choose? I'm going to make a bold assumption because you're in this quest that you chose the second mirror and the second identity, the version of you that's already manifested your manifestations. So assuming that, go ahead and look now at the first mirror, the current identity, that version of you, and simply share your gratitude with that version. Allow yourself to love on that version and have so much gratitude for everything that that version of you has lived through in order to bring you to right now. That's it. Beautiful.

I say yes to my highest self. I say yes to integrating my highest identity. I say yes to my soul. I say yes. I say yes. I say yes. And as this upgrade begins to integrate and assimilate and lock into your system, growing roots within your field right now, allow yourself to have so much gratitude for this integration, for this upgrade.

====================

LESSON 20: Anchor in Your Highest Self

<v ->Welcome back. Now that you know where your identity is currently
at, and you went into that next step of really making that conscious
choice around the next layer of your identity, the next piece we get to
go into is all about embodying the version of you that has already
manifested what you desire. Now, when you go through this process, I
have seen people go through this, and I’ve seen them quantum leap their
reality, and literally allow their future self to be embodied right
here, right now. It is a powerful, powerful activation and process that
we’re going to go into. And everything we did in the last lesson was to
set you up for this moment, right now. Now, when it comes to embodying
your highest self, it’s superimportant that we don’t just do this from
the mind, and we understand what our highest self is like, but we
actually show up as them. We actually take action in our lives to be
that version of ourselves. So here’s what you need to know. We are
multidimensional beings having a multidimensional experience. There is a
version of you, across time and space, out in your future, that has
already manifested what you desire. You had a taste of this in the last
activation. You looked in that mirror; you saw, you felt, you connected
with that version. And what’s important to know is that version of you
has desire for what you’re looking to manifest. Now, desire is not a bad
thing. Desire is a great thing. Desire is how your soul speaks to you.
If you didn’t have desire for your manifestations, then they probably
wouldn’t be in alignment from your soul. They wouldn’t be in alignment
for you to manifest. So when your soul is speaking to you through these
desires, your highest self is literally guiding you into greater
alignment. Greater alignment to what? Greater alignment to actually
living from your soul, right here, right now, in this human experience.
So we’re going to go into a deeper conversation, in a future lesson in
this Quest, around time. But for now, please know that time is a
construct, and it’s also an illusion. And it’s also something that, when
you understand your quantum reality and your energetic field, you get to
play with it. This is how my clients have been able to quantum leap
their results and create results in every area of their lives that seem
barely recognizable versus where they were at. This is how you get to
now create results with your manifestations, where people turn around
and say, “But how did you do that in such a short period of time?” I
told you at the beginning of this Quest to expect magic and expect
miracles. This piece is a huge part in allowing these magical miraculous
manifestations to come in, in quantum speed. We do this by connecting
with the version of you that has already manifested what you desire, and
we bring that version of you from your future into the right now. So in
order to go into this activation, we need to do a little bit of prep and
a little bit of setup process. Again, asking yourself some quality
questions, just like you did yesterday, and receiving some quality
answers in order to go into these next layers. So, the version of you
that has already manifested what you desire, I want you to start
connecting with that version. Now you might think, “Regan, you know, I
don’t know; I don’t know what that version is like because that’s not me
right now.” You might also say, “Regan, is this about faking it till you
make it or becoming something you’re not?” No, this is not about faking
it till you make it. This is not about becoming something you’re not.
This is about getting into radical authenticity with the truth of who
you are. This is about saying yes to living from your soul. This is
about allowing yourself to download that future version of you that is
wanting to be embodied right here, right now, on this planet, so that
you can show up in a bigger way, so that you can manifest in a bigger
way, so that ultimately you can leave the mark that you are here to
leave on this planet and leave this planet a better place. So when you
start connecting across time and space with that version of you, you get
to start downloading some of this information by asking yourself some
specific questions. This is called the highest self recalibration
process. And you get to ask yourself, “Okay, this version of me out in
the future; how does this version of me think? How does this version of
me walk? How does this version of me talk? How does this version of me
show up in my daily life? This version of me that is already living into
my manifestations, what’s different about them versus who I am now?” And
look at this holistically in your life; remember, we’re holistic beings
having a holistic experience; even if you’re focusing on this one focus
area right now, how is this version of you doing life through all the
other different categories of your life? How does this version of you
show up for your physical body? How do you move your physical body each
and every single day? What kind of foods does this version of you choose
to fuel itself with? What kind of thoughts and patterns of the mind and
what emotions does this version of you embody? What does this version of
you and your future say yes to, that maybe you didn’t say yes to in the
past? What does this version of you say no to that maybe you wouldn’t
have said no to before? What does this version of you no longer
tolerate? What does this version of you do when you connect every single
day to your vision? How does this version of you manifest? What’s
different? These are questions to start your exploration, but play with
this, and go deeper with this. And then once you’ve done this, we’re
going to actually activate and embody this into your system. So, your
Soul Work for today is to firstly, do the highest self recalibration
process. And you can do this across both manifestations, your
manifestation for this Quest and also your larger manifestation. For
this piece, connect overall with the highest version of you; go through
the recalibration; download the information; get clear; get specific,
and get precise. And most importantly, start to feel what it feels like
when you start downloading the specific information. Then we are going
to go into a powerful, closed-eye, energetic architecture process where
we’re going to be anchoring in your highest self and allowing yourself
to embody this right here, right now. You set this up in the last
lesson; you went through that choice point and chose your highest self
in that last lesson, and now once you’ve gone through the first task and
you’re clear on all these pieces and how this version of you walks and
talks and thinks and acts and shows up differently, once you have all of
that information, come and join us and go deep into this activation so
that we can integrate this and start the embodiment process of this. So
assuming now that you’ve completed your first piece of Soul Work, let’s
dive deeper into this activation. Allow yourself to sit or lie in a
comfortable position, gently closing your eyes, turning inwards right
now, centering yourself with your breath and allowing yourself to gently
lean into your intention of embodying and activating the highest version
of you, integrating it out from your future into the right now, so that
you may show up in a more powerful way, so that you may allow your
manifestations to come forward into your physical reality with more,
ease, more grace, and more flow, on an accelerated timeline. That’s
right. Anchor yourself in, allow a red laser beam to shoot from your
tailbone and anchor you right now into the crystalline core of the
earth, and simultaneously allowing a golden laser beam of light to shoot
up through your crown, connecting you right now to your unique soul
star, allowing you to be guided grounded, present, protected, and
supported; heaven on earth embodied right here, right now. Surrounding
yourself with a ball of gold white light and simply dropping,
dissolving, any energies, vibrations, or frequencies that are not of
service out of your system now, cleansing and purifying your field.
Beautiful. And as you allow yourself to drop even deeper into this state
of alchemy, this state of recalibration and activation, go ahead and
notice that a being of golden white light has appeared before you. You
may see this being; you may feel them; you may just simply know they are
there; either way is perfect. And as you connect even deeper with this
being, you continue to notice that they feel rather familiar. Indeed,
this being is your highest self that has come back from your future, all
the way to right now in order to assist you and facilitate this upgrade
and the full and complete activation and integration of your highest
self, this recalibration of your identity. That’s right. So as you
connect with this being of golden white light, this version of you from
your future that has come back all the way to right now, you begin to
remember that this version of you walks and talks and thinks and acts a
certain way, in alignment with what you went into in that first soul
task. That’s it. Notice that this version of you is literally already
encoded with all of the pieces of information, all of the codes, all of
the structures, everything desired and required in order for you to
embody your divine manifestations and have them show up with ease, with
grace, and with flow. All of that information is already within your
highest self right here, right now. That’s right. Beautiful. And from
this space of openness and receptivity, go ahead and allow your highest
self to now come, come closer into your four body system, allowing this
version of you to hover gently above your head, above your crown. And
then from this place, go ahead and gently allow your highest self to now
enter the top of your head, dropping gently down, illuminating your
brain center, activating parts of your unconscious mind and your
conscious mind and your consciousness. Beautiful, allowing for a full
and complete brain illumination as your highest self, gently drop, drop
down even deeper, through your brain center, dropping down through your
throat right now; beautiful. Dropping gently down, activating the
throat, activating your capacity to speak into your manifestations,
speak your truth from your highest self, speak the things that maybe you
didn’t have the capacity to speak before, activating all of this through
this energy center right now; beautiful. And dropping, dropping down
even deeper and deeper right now, until your highest self is resting
gently within the field of your heart, activating your heart, updating
the geometries within your heart, opening and expanding your heart
center, allowing your heart to be a portal of information in and
information out, always filtered through the filters of your highest
self. That’s right; beautiful. And just as your highest self rests
gently within the field of your heart, go ahead and simply allow your
highest self to now implode into every single cell of your being,
allowing every single cell to wake up, wake up, wake up and receive all
of the pieces of information encoded within your highest self, allowing
the light from your highest self to encode every single cell of your
being, allowing the frequency and the vibration of your highest self to
flood through every single cell of your being, allowing yourself to
receive the feeling of how good it feels to be fully and completely
embodied in your highest self, and from this state, this frequency, and
this vibration, go ahead and double that feeling. Let it rush through
every single cell of your being. And now go ahead and triple that
feeling, letting it vibrate through every single cell. You may feel
this; you may just simply know it is happening; either way is absolutely
perfect. As we allow any old DNA that is no longer required or in
alignment or useful and is not synced with your highest self, we allow
this old DNA to simply drop, dissolve, and clear and shift out of your
field right now, out of your system with ease, with grace, and with
flow, and allowing the new DNA from your highest self to come online now
and be embodied, allowing these strands of your DNA to wake up, wake up,
and fully turn on and be activated, activating your innate gifts from
your highest self, activating the innate lessons from your highest self,
activating your unique frequency from your highest self, activating all
of this through your system. Now. Beautiful. As you allow this new
vibration to settle within your system, I decree and declare that the
unique, energetic signature of your highest self be now run through your
entire four body system right now. And I request that it be run at the
highest possible frequency, that your system is able to easily integrate
and stabilize with ease, with grace, and with flow. That’s right. As you
gently begin to remember who you are. “I remember who I am. I remember
who I am. I remember who I am. I say yes to my highest self. I say yes
to my highest self. I say yes to my highest self through every single
cell of my being. I am my highest self. I am my highest self. I am my
highest self. I remember. I remember. I remember.” Beautiful. Requesting
that all of these shifts, upgrades, and transformations continue to
stabilize and anchor in until they are fully actualized, integrated,
embodied, and complete. I decree and declare that you now walk and talk
and think and act and make choices in every single way from your highest
self. That’s right. Beautiful. Having so much gratitude for your highest
self and this divine activation, having so much gratitude for your
guides, so much gratitude for you, the alchemist that you are, the
manifestor that you are, the highest being that you are. That’s right.
As you gently allow yourself to come back into presence and back into
the now, and when you are ready, now you can gently open your eyes.
Welcome back, and welcome into your new reality. Welcome into the full
and complete embodiment of your highest self. I know the feeling, and it
feels really good to be you, more of you, all of you. It feels really
good to allow the most authentic, shiny, powerful version of you to be
embodied. And now that version of you gets to be expressed in your life.
Your next piece of Soul Work is to write out a minimum of three things
that you are now committed to taking action on now, in your life, in
order to allow for an acceleration of your manifestations. What are you
committed to? What are your commitments from your highest self? Share in
the Tribe your breakthroughs, your transformations, your commitments,
and how was this activation for you? I’m looking forward to celebrating
you and witnessing the embodiment of your highest self. Thank you so
much for going deep. I love you so much, and I’ll see you on the next
lesson.

LESSON 20: Meditation - Anchor Your Highest Self Into the Now

- Allow yourself to sit or lie in a comfortable position. Gently closing your eyes, turning inwards right now. Centering yourself with your breath and allowing yourself to gently lean into your intention of embodying and activating the highest version of you, integrating it out from your future into the right now, so that you may show up in a more powerful way so that you may allow your manifestations to come forward into your physical reality with more ease, more grace, and more flow on an accelerated timeline.

And as you allow yourself to drop even deeper into the state of alchemy, the state of recalibration and activation, go ahead and notice that a being of golden white light has appeared before you. You may see this being, you may feel them. You may just simply know they are there either way as perfect and as you connect even deeper with this being, you continue to notice that they feel rather familiar. Indeed, this being is your highest self that has come back from your future all the way to right now in order to assist you and facilitate this upgrade and the full and complete activation and integration of your highest self. This recalibration of your identity. That's right. So as you connect with this being of gold and white light, this version of you from your future that has come back all the way to right now, you begin to remember that this version of you walks and talks and thinks and acts a certain way in alignment with what you went into in that first soul task. That's it. Notice that this version of you is literally already encoded with all of the pieces of information, all of the codes, all of the structures, everything desired and required in order for you to embody your divine manifestations and have them show up with ease, with grace. And with flow. All of that information is already within your highest self. Right here, right now. That's right. Beautiful. For and from the space of openness and receptivity. Go ahead and allow your highest self to now come. Come closer into your full body system, allowing this version of you to hover gently above your head, above your crown, and then from this place, go ahead and gently allow your highest self to now enter the top of your head, dropping gently down, illuminating your brain center, activating parts of your unconscious mind. And your conscious mind. And your consciousness. Beautiful. Allowing for a full and complete brain illumination as your highest self gently drop drops down even deeper through your brain center, dropping down through your throat right now. Beautiful. Dropping gently down, activating the throat, activating your capacity to speak into your manifestations, speak your truth from your highest self. Speak the things that maybe you didn't have the capacity to speak before. Activating all of this through this energy center right now. Beautiful and dropping. Dropping down even deeper and deeper right now until your highest self is resting gently within the field of your heart, activating your heart, updating the geometries within your heart, opening and expanding your hearts into allowing your heart to be a portal of information in and information out always filtered through the filters of your highest self. That's right. And beautiful.

Allowing the light from your highest self to encode every single cell of your being. Allowing the frequency and the vibration of your highest self to flood through every single cell of your being. Allowing yourself to receive the feeling of how good it feels to be fully and completely embodied in your highest self. And from this state, this frequency, and this vibration. Go ahead and double that feeling. Let it rush through every single cell of your being. And now go ahead and trickle that feeling, letting it vibrate through every single cell. You may feel this, you may just simply know it is happening. Either way is absolutely perfect as we allow any old DNA that is no longer required or in alignment or useful and is not synced with your higher self. We allow this old DNA to simply drop, dissolve, and clear and shift out of your field right now, out of your system with ease, with grace. And with flow and allowing the new DNA from your highest self to come online now and be embodied, allowing these strands of your DNA to wake up, wake up and fully turn on and be activated. Activating your innate gifts from your highest self, activating the innate lessons from your highest self, activating your unique frequency from your highest self. Activating all of this through your system now beautiful. As you will allow this new vibration to settle within your system. I Korean declare that the unique energetic signature of your highest self be now run through your entire four body system right now, and I request that it be run at the highest possible frequency. That your system is able to easily integrate and stabilize with ease, with grace and with flow. That's right. As you gently begin to remember who you are. I remember who I'm I remember who I'm I remember who I'm, I say yes to my highest self. I say yes to my highest self. I say yes to my highest self through every single so of my being. I am my highest self. I am my highest self. I am my highest self. I remember, I remember, I remember beautiful requesting that all of these shifts, upgrades, and transformations continue to stabilize and anchor in until they are fully actualized, integrated, embodied, and complete. I decree and declare that you now walk and talk and think and act and make choices in every single way from your highest self. That's right. Beautiful. Having so much gratitude for your highest self in this divine activation. Having so much gratitude for your guides, so much gratitude for you, the alchemist that you are, the manifesto that you are the highest being that you are. That's right. As you gently allow yourself to come back into presence and back into the now and when you are ready now you can gently open your eyes.

LESSON 21: Quantum Inner Child Healing

<v ->Welcome back to the final lesson in this phase of the manifestation
Quest. Congratulations on the deep work that you’ve done up to this
point in time, becoming an energetic match and integrating your highest
self. Now, this last piece is a superimportant piece when it comes to
allowing for a full and complete embodiment of your highest self, and
that is making sure that your inner child is on board and in alignment
with your manifestations. Now, we all have an inner child within us. We
all have a little girl or a little boy deep inside of our consciousness.
I often joke with people and say, “Look I’ve never had a client that’s
over seven years old,” because it’s proven that all of our limits, all
of our challenges, all of our old beliefs, all of our patterns,
everything is formed when we’re under seven. Many people are speaking
these days about inner child healing, and for many people, it can take
days or even months or even years to see results with working with their
inner child. But the good news is is that once you understand quantum
inner child healing, you’re able to upgrade much, much faster, and
that’s exactly what we’re going into today. I’ve seen so many fully
grown adults being superlimited by their inner child. These patterns
from our inner child can play out as adults in a way where we have these
behaviors show up when they’re not from the mind, they’re actually from
a wounded inner child response, and this can absolutely slow down
manifestations. I want you to just simply reflect right now when maybe
you’ve had an emotional response to someone or something that has showed
up in your life, and you’ve thought about this and thought, “Hm, that
wasn’t really a logical response that I got that angry or that upset.
That wasn’t a logical response that that self-sabotage pattern kicked
in.” Well, often when we get to the core of this, it’s because there is
an inner wounded child that’s simply not on board with what you’re
trying to manifest and achieve in that moment. So the process that we’re
going to go through today allows for quantum inner child healing. This
process is going to allow your inner child to get on board with your
manifestations, and if someone doesn’t go through this process, even if
they do a lot of other manifestation work and they’re taking a lot of
action in their life, their inner child can be in conflict with this
manifestation. I mean, think about it. Would your three-year-old, your
five-year-old or even your seven-year-old fully understand everything
that you wanted to manifest in your life? Maybe not, and that’s why we
get to go in and do this deep work and do this quantum inner child
healing, to allow for greater alignment and acceleration of your
manifestations. So for this particular process, there’s no deep prep
work for this. We’re actually going to dive right into the activation,
and all you need for this activation is an open mind and an intention of
being willing to actually learn from your inner child, to integrate your
inner child, and to simply notice what comes up for you during this
process, without attachment and without expectation. So let’s dive right
now into this beautiful piece of soul work and start going into this
energetic architecture, quantum inner child healing activation. Let’s
get started. Go ahead and allow yourself to sit or lie in a comfortable
position, gently closing your eyes and turning inward right now.
Centering yourself with your breaths. Breathing in. And out. And
allowing yourself to lean even deeper right now into your intention.
Your intention to connect with your inner child, that little girl or
that little boy within you. To allow your inner child to come on board
with your manifestations. That’s right. Allowing a red laser beam to
shoot down from your tailbone, anchoring you, grounding you, solidifying
you into the crystalline core of the Earth, and simultaneously allowing
a golden laser beam of light to shoot up through your crown, connecting
you right now to your unique soul star, allowing you to be guided,
grounded, present, protected, and supported. Heaven on earth embodied
right here, right now, as you surround yourself with a ball of golden
white light. Requesting that any energies that may be slowing down or
blocking this activation drop, dissolve, and clear out of your system
now. Good. Now from this place and this space of activation, of
curiosity, go ahead and simply ask yourself, what age were you when your
inner child decided that it wasn’t fully in alignment with your specific
manifestation? The first age that comes to you below the age of seven,
what is it? One, two, three. Perfect. Whatever that age is for you is
the perfect answer, and we’re going to be working with that age right
now. So go ahead and gently allow yourself to float all the way up until
you’re floating above now, hovering above now, floating up out of your
body. Beautiful. And now turn your focus and your attention towards your
past. And now begin to float all the way back, all the way back to that
specific moment in time where your inner child made a choice that for
whatever reason, they weren’t fully on board with aligning to this
specific manifestation. And when you are there, hovering just above that
moment in time, there, just before that moment in time, looking down on
that moment in time, go ahead and notice what’s going on. You may see a
specific event. You may see certain people. You may feel certain
emotions. You may see your inner child at that age. You may just simply
know that you were there and see or feel nothing; either way is perfect.
Beautiful. And now from this place of total curiosity, go ahead and
simply allow yourself to float down into that event. Floating down into
that event, noticing this younger version of you before you right now.
What’s going on for them? What are they experiencing in this moment?
What story have they created from their lens, from their perception of
reality at that time? What do you notice? Beautiful. Now, as you
continue to notice what’s going on in this moment, go ahead and connect
with this younger version of you, and simply share with this younger
version of you your intention to manifest what it is that you desire.
Let this version of you know why you want this, why you intend this, why
this manifestation will be good and useful and helpful in your life. Go
ahead and share that with your inner child right now. Beautiful.
Allowing your inner child to receive this information, and now go ahead
and ask your inner child, what do they need right now to feel safe with
this manifestation? What do they need to be in alignment with this
manifestation? What do they need in order to support and be excited
about this manifestation? Let your inner child share with you what they
need now. Maybe they need a hug. Maybe they need you to let them know
that they will be loved, or they will be safe. Maybe they need to know
they’re important and they won’t be forgotten. Maybe they have something
very specific that they need. Whatever it is that your younger version
of you needs, desires, requires, go ahead and give that to them now.
Give that to them. Allow this to recode and reimprint your past,
shifting and recalibrating your future, as you give that little girl or
that little boy exactly what they needed in that moment that for
whatever reason they didn’t receive. That’s it. And now go ahead and
check in with this younger version of you. Ask them how they are now.
Ask them how they feel different. That’s right. Beautiful. And now go
ahead and allow yourself to now hold that younger version of you in your
arms. Maybe if they’re really young, you’re cradling them like a baby.
Maybe you pick them up in your arms. Maybe if they’re a little bit
older, they jump on your back. However it is for you is perfect. But
pick them up right now. And then allow this younger version of you to
come with you and float up, up, up above this event, just before this
event, hovering just above this event, this event where you now gave
this younger version of you exactly what they needed that they didn’t
receive in the past. And now take this younger version of you with you.
Take them with you and begin to float all the way back to now, until
you’re hovering above now, and allow them to now come with you out into
your future. Take them gently out into your future, and show them how
good your future looks. Show them how powerful your future is. Take them
out to specific moments in time, to specific events, and show them how
good your future looks once you have manifested what it is that you
desire. Continue to take them with you. And thank them. Thank them for
being on board with your manifestation. Thank them for being in
alignment with these manifestations. Show them what a powerful team you
are together and what you have co-created together out in your future
and how good it feels, how fun it feels, how playful it feels.
Beautiful. And now take your younger version of you with you all the way
back to right now, until you are hovering above now. Beautiful. And now
ask your inner child, this younger version of you, if they would like to
stay with you, if they would actually like to come with you and play
with you in your everyday life. If this younger version of you doesn’t
want to do that, no problem. They can gently float back to that specific
moment in time where they were getting what they needed. But if they
want to stay with you, go ahead and allow this younger version of you to
now gently fuse into your heart, allowing them to come into your heart,
entering your body, coming into your heart space right now. And allow
this version of you, this inner child, this younger version of you to
rest gently within your heart, knowing that that is their new home, that
is their space and their place where they get to be. And right in the
center of your heart, this younger version of you is able to always get
what it desires and needs, to feel safe, to feel loved in any moment.
That’s it. Allowing this younger version of you to fuse into your heart.
Breathing that into your heart right now. And now gently begin to drop,
drop down into now. Coming back down into now, back into the space, back
into your body. Being aware of your breath. Being grateful for all of
the shifts, for all of the upgrades, for all of the integrations. Being
grateful for your own connection to your inner child that is always
available to you. That’s right. So much gratitude for your guidance, so
much gratitude for yourself and your capacity to go in and be open and
available to this beautiful inner child healing in order to support your
manifestations. That’s right. Anchoring, grounding, solidifying all of
this into your system and into your field, sealing everything up and
completing this activation, as you allow yourself to return back into
the now, into the present and back into your breath. And when you are
ready now, you can gently open your eyes. Welcome back. This is a deep
process. Make sure you are present to any emotions that may be with you
right now, that may be coming up for deeper healing or clearing. Spend
time with them. Allow yourself to feel them. And maybe you are feeling
amazing right now, in which case, celebrate that. Either way, the
process is absolutely perfect and totally unique to you. You can repeat
this activation again, and do this now for your larger manifestation.
Trust me, your inner child has some different needs and desires for
every manifestation. If you really want to have them on board, this is a
great process to do this. And then when you’ve completed this activation
again, share with us, what was it that your inner child needed? What was
the experience that you went through? We’d love to witness you and
celebrate you and really see you in the full and complete integration of
having this beautiful divine relationship with your inner child, this
inner child that is now on board and in alignment with your
manifestations. Congratulations; this has been deep work. And in the
next phase of this manifestation Quest, we’re only diving deeper. I
celebrate you, and I can’t wait to dive into the next phase with you.
Much love.

Accelerating Physical Results

====================

LESSON 22: Collapse Timelines That Don’t Serve You

<v ->Welcome back to this next phase in the manifestation Quest.
Congratulations for going this far and this deep, and right now we are
just going deeper. This next phase of the Quest is all about
accelerating the physical results so that your manifestations get to
show up even faster. Where to start with this? The place we’re going to
start is we are going to be talking about something in today’s lesson
that, honestly, so many people are completely unaware of. And when you
understand this piece, you are able to collapse time and space and have
your manifestations show up faster and faster and faster. The concept
that we are going to be learning about and playing with today is the
concept of timelines. Here’s what you need to know. If you don’t work to
collapse out old timelines in your field, in your life, then your
manifestations can take much longer than you expect. So you might be
thinking, “Okay, what are timelines?” Timelines are running on our
energetic system, and timelines are effectively the blueprints of
information that are linked to timestamps within the time and space
paradox that we work through in this physical reality. And what happens
is that if you aren’t constantly updating your timelines within your
energetic system, you can set a goal, an intention, a manifestation, and
say, “Okay, I want this to happen on or before this certain date. On or
before this moment in time.” And then from there, if you don’t update
the timeline to be in sync with that, then sometimes the manifestation
can take longer than expected. So as we shift and upgrade our timelines,
we accelerate our vision; we release our limits; we allow ourselves to
become a different version of ourselves, and while all of this happens,
’cause this is such deep inner work, we literally start creating new
realities in our life. Now as we’re doing all this work that you’ve been
doing up until this point in this Quest, and we’re creating these new
realities, and we’re tapping into the field of infinite possibilities,
sometimes your system can still be running on an old energetic timeline,
that basically, has your manifestation appearing at a later timestamp in
your life. So if you’re doing all of this work, but you want your
manifestations to show up faster, we’ve got to go into your system and
update your timelines through your energetic field. Remembering that
time is an illusion. Remembering that time is a construct that you get
to play with. Remembering that time is malleable, and you get to change
your relationship with time. So, the question is now how do we do this?
How do you get to collapse old timelines that no longer serve you? Well,
we’re going to be doing this by going through a deep energetic process.
And through this process, we’re going to be working through your system,
collapsing out old timelines that are now outdated, that were linked to
your previous version of you that you were operating from. And then
we’re going to be anchoring in new timelines within your system, in
order for your manifestations to show up on or before when you actually
desire in your physical life. So this task that I’m about to guide you
through, you’re going to do this once, but you are going to do this for
both of your manifestations. You’re going to do this having a larger
focus on your larger manifestation, but then also knowing that, as you
update those timelines, that’s also going to influence and impact your
manifestation that gets to show up on or before the end of this Quest.
’Cause, remember, they’re in the same focus area, the same area of life,
and they’re deeply interconnected. So you get to go through this process
just once. It is a deep, powerful process; we’re working through the
subtle layers of every single layer of your being, and there’s nothing
else to do other than to be present to your larger and your smaller
manifestations, and also be present to those timestamps that you chose
way back in the beginning of this Quest, where you declared that these
manifestations would happen on or before those certain dates in time.
Make sure you have that just present in your consciousness right now,
and we can dive right in. Beautiful, so go ahead and sit or lie in a
comfy position, allowing yourself to gently close your eyes and turn
your consciousness inward right now. Anchoring through your breath.
Beautiful. And from this space, allow yourself to lean into your
intention, your intention to update the timelines within your field in
order for your manifestations to show up with ease and grace, on or
before these specific chosen moments in time. Beautiful. Allowing a red
laser beam to shoot down from your tailbone, anchoring you, grounding
you, solidifying you into the crystalline core of the earth, and
simultaneously allowing a golden laser beam of light to shoot up through
your crown, connecting you right now to your unique soul star. Allowing
you to be guided, grounded, present, protected, and supported. Heaven on
earth, embodied right here, right now. As you surround yourself with a
ball of golden white light and requesting that any energies,
frequencies, or vibrations that are not yours and not of the highest,
simply drop, dissolve, and clear, purifying your field right now, and
taking a moment to call in your divine guidance. Beings of light of the
highest vibration, divinely assigned to assisting you in updating these
timelines within your system. Welcome; welcome; welcome. Thank you for
supporting us in this beautiful process. Beautiful! Now as you drop even
deeper into this state of alchemy and activation, go ahead and allow
yourself to be present to the timelines that are currently running
within your system. The timelines associated to your manifestations. The
timelines that have been birthed and created through the version of you
that has led you in your past, all the way up until this point in time.
You may see these timelines; they may be showing up a certain way for
you visually. You may feel yourself connecting to them. You may hear
them. You may just simply know that you are connecting through your
intention right now. Either way is perfect. Beautiful! Now from this
place, we’re going to go ahead and simply go ahead and request, right
now, that any old outdated timelines that no longer serve you, that are
linked to an older version of you, that are no longer useful or
relevant, simply request that they begin to drop out of your field.
That’s it. You may see them dropping away; you may see them dissolving
away, breaking down, shifting out of your system right now with ease,
with grace, and with flow. Beautiful, and requesting that this clearing
through the timelines continues. As these old outdated timelines
dissolve, drop away right now. And noticing gently, how much more space
there is now, within your system, within your field. Beautiful! Now from
this place, connecting into the highest version of you, the version of
you that is activated and anchored within you, that has already
manifested everything that you desire with your manifestations, and so
much more. Go ahead through your intention and tune into those
timestamps, the specific dates or moments in time, for each of your
manifestations, for your larger manifestations, and also for your
manifestation on or before the end of the Quest. Go ahead and simply
tune into them right now through your intention. Beautiful! And now
holding those timestamps from your 3D physical reality, in your
intentions right now, we’re going to go ahead and simply update the
timelines. I decree and declare that new timelines, that are in a higher
alignment with your highest self, and the highest frequency, a higher
alignment of your manifestations showing up on or before these specific
dates in time. I decree and declare that these new timelines now come,
come, come, and be activated, and solidified within your field. That’s
it. Allowing these new timelines to sink and anchor in. Beautiful. You
may see them coming into your system. You may feel them. You may just
simply know that these new timelines are now anchoring, solidifying, and
grounding themselves into your system and into your field. Beautiful.
And now running golden white light through these timelines, waking them
up, turning them on, activating them. Beautiful, and allowing your
system to now recalibrate to these new timelines. Beautiful! Allowing
your entire resonance of your being to now sink and shift and
recalibrate to these new timelines. As a deep sense of knowing activates
within your consciousness, as you begin to remember how easy it is to
manifest your intentions on or before these specific moments in time. On
or before these specific dates in your 3D physical reality. Now that you
have the appropriate timelines anchored, locked, and solidified within
your field and within your consciousness right now. Beautiful! Allowing
these new timelines to activate, solidify, ground, and grow roots within
your system. Allowing now within your own system to shift, dissolve, and
clear anything outdated, anything not aligned with these new timelines.
Beautiful. As you become an even greater energetic match for these new
timelines that have been divinely laid out right in front of you.
Beautiful! Good! Now, at a soul level, across every single realm,
reality, and dimension, go ahead and simply choose these new timelines
now. That’s it. Choose them now. Good. Beautiful! Allowing all of this
to ground and anchor and solidify within your field, requesting these
updates through the timelines, and the solidification of these timelines
continue, 24 hours a day, seven days a week, until they’re fully
actualized, integrated, stabilized, embodied, and complete. That’s
right! Beautiful! Anchoring this down, sealing up the field. Taking a
moment of gratitude for this beautiful upgrade, and this recalibration
of your timelines. A moment of gratitude for your divine guidance. Thank
you; thank you; thank you for always assisting and guiding and
supporting us. Beautiful! So much gratitude for yourself and the mastery
that you are now stepping into. “I am a masterful manifestor. I am a
masterful manifestor. I am a masterful manifestor.” That’s right.
Beautiful! As you now allow yourself to gently come back, be aware of
your breath, breathing through your heart. Coming back into this space,
and allowing yourself to now gently open your eyes. Beautiful! Welcome
back! Congratulations. Another powerful update. Expect miracles, and
they may just show up in your reality. Your piece of Soul Work, now that
you’ve done that update and that activation, collapsed the old timelines
and anchored in the new, is to simply notice what now feels different
about your manifestations. What feels different, when you tune into your
manifestation on or before the end of this Quest? And also when you tune
into your longer-term manifestation, what feels different? We’re
conditioned to always look for what’s the same, but if you start
conditioning yourself to notice what’s different, what you focus on
expands, and you’re going to expand the changes that you’re activating
through this Quest at an even deeper level. I can’t wait to celebrate
your breakthroughs. Please share them with the Tribe. I love you so
much, and we’re diving deeper on the next lesson. I’ll see you there.

LESSON 22: Meditation - Collapse Timelines That Don't Serve You

- Beautiful. So go ahead and sit or lie in a comfy position, allowing yourself to gently close your eyes and turn your consciousness inward right now anchoring through your buress. Beautiful. And from this space, allow yourself to lean into your intention. Your intention to update the timelines within your field in order for your manifestations to show up with ease and grace on or before these specific chosen moments in time. Beautiful. Allowing a red laser beam to shoot down from your tailbone, anchoring you, grounding you, solidifying you into the crystalline core of the earth, and simultaneously allowing a golden laser beam of light to shoot up through your crown, connecting you right now to your unique soul star, allowing you to be guided, grounded, present, protected, and supported heaven on earth. Embodied right here, right now as you surround yourself with a ball of golden white light and requesting that any energies, frequencies, or vibrations that are not yours and not of the highest, simply draw, dissolve and clear purifying your field right now and taking a moment to call in your divine guidance beings of light of the highest vibration divinely assigned to assisting you in updating these timelines within your system. Welcome, welcome, welcome. Thank you for supporting us in this beautiful process. Beautiful. Now, as you drop even deeper into the state of alchemy and activation, go ahead and allow yourself to be present to the timelines that are currently running within your system. The timelines associated to your manifestations, the timelines that have been birthed and created through the version of you that has led you in your past all the way up until this point in time. You may see these timelines. They may be showing up a certain way for you visually. You may feel yourself connecting to them. You may hear them, you may just simply know that you are connecting through your intention right now. Either way is perfect. Beautiful. Now from this place, we're going to go ahead and simply go ahead and request right now that any old outdated timelines that no longer serve you, that are linked to an older version of you that are no longer useful or relevant, simply request that they begin to drop out of your field. That's it. You may see them dropping away. You may see them dissolving away, breaking down, shifting out of your system right now with ease, with grace, and with flow and beautiful. I'm requesting that this clearing through the timelines continues as these old outdated timelines dissolve. Drop away right now and noticing gently how much more space there is now within your system, within your field. Beautiful. Now from this place, connecting into the highest version of you, the version of you that is activated and anchored within you, that has already manifested everything that you desire with your manifestations and so much more. Go ahead through your intention and tune into those timestamps, the specific dates or moments in time for each of your manifestations, for your larger manifestations, and also for your manifestation on or before the end of the quest. Go ahead and simply tune into them right now through your intention. Beautiful. And now holding those timestamps from your 3D physical reality in your intentions. Right now, we're going to go ahead and simply update the timelines. I decree and declare that new timelines that are in a higher alignment with your highest self and the highest frequency, a higher alignment of your manifestations showing up on or before these specific dates and time. I decree and declare that these new timelines now come, come, come and be activated and solidified within your field. That's it. Allowing these new timelines to sink and anchor in beautiful. You may see them coming into your system. You may feel them. You may just simply know that these new timelines are now anchoring, solidifying, and grounding themselves into your system and into your field. Beautiful. And now running golden white light through these timelines, waking them up, turning them on, activating them, beautiful and allowing your system to now recalibrate to these new timelines. Beautiful. Allowing your entire resonance of your being to now think and shift and recalibrate to these new timelines as a deep sense of knowing activates within your consciousness as you begin to remember how easy it is to manifest your intentions on or before these specific moments in time, on or before these specific dates in your 3D physical reality. Now that you have the appropriate timelines anchored, flocked, and solidified within your field and within your consciousness right now. And beautiful. Allowing these new timelines to activate, solidify ground and grow roots within your system, allowing now within your own system to shift, dissolve and clear anything outdated, anything not aligned with these new timelines. Beautiful. As you become an even greater energetic match for these new timelines that have been divinely laid out right in front of you. Beautiful. Good at a soul level across every single real reality and dimension. Go ahead and simply choose these new timelines now. That's it. Choose them now. Good. Beautiful. Allowing all of this to ground and anchor and solidify within your field, requesting these updates through the timelines and the solidification of these timelines continue 24 hours a day, seven days a week, until they're fully actualized, integrated, stabilized, embodied, and complete. That's right. Beautiful. Anchoring this down, sealing up the field, taking a moment of gratitude for this beautiful upgrade and this recalibration of your timelines, moment of gratitude for your divine guidance. Thank you, thank you. Thank you for always assisting and guiding and supporting us. Beautiful. So much gratitude for yourself and the mastery that you are now stepping into. I am a masterful manifester. I am a masterful manifester. I am a masterful manifester. That's right. Beautiful. As you now allow yourself to gently come back, be aware of your breath, breathing through your heart, coming back into the space, and allowing yourself to now gently open your eyes. Beautiful.

====================

LESSON 23: Accelerate the Manifestation Process

<v ->Welcome back to this next lesson. We are going deeper into
accelerating your manifestation process. You have done so much work up
to this point. You have gone so deep into so many different layers, and
now what is really important, after yesterday’s lesson of shifting and
recalibrating and setting up these new timelines in your system, it’s
important to look at your relationship with time. If you believe that
something is going to take a really long time, guess what? It will. And
the good news is is that you get to shift and upgrade your relationship
with time. We get to play with time. Now, people ask me all the time,
“Regan, how do you have time to do everything that you do in your life?”
I mean, I run 12 different companies; I have an amazing family; I have a
beautiful partner; I have an amazing lifestyle, and I still have more
than enough time for myself. And some people look at my life from the
inside out and they just don’t get it. They literally say, “I just don’t
understand how you fit everything in and how you make it all happen.”
And when people ask me, “How do you do that? How do you live that life?”
my number one answer to all of the things that go into it is I have a
really good relationship with time. Now, I wasn’t born having a good
relationship with time. I used to literally believe that there wasn’t
enough time in the day. I used to say to myself, “Oh man, I wish there
were more hours in the day.” I would even say, “I wish there was an
extra day in the week; I have so much to do! There’s so much to do, and
there’s not enough time.” So guess what my reality was? So much to do,
and not enough time. You get to look at your current relationship with
time, and then you get to upgrade it. Once again, time is malleable;
time is a construct that you get to play with. And what if you chose to
believe that time was on your side? What if you chose to believe that
you always had more than enough time to complete all the things that you
really desired? So, for your first piece of soul work, you must get
really raw and real with where you are currently at, because we can’t
install a new relationship with time until you’re superclear on what is
currently going on. And I want you to journal and ask yourself, what do
you currently believe about time? What do you believe about time? And be
really honest with yourself. Write down what are the stories that you
find yourself telling yourself around time. Maybe you’re telling
yourself, just like I did, that you don’t have enough time in your day.
Maybe you’re telling yourself that you would love to manifest X, Y, Z,
but that’s a big manifestation, so that must take a lot of time. Isn’t
it interesting how we tend to link up the size of a manifestation, and
then put a certain amount of time on it when it just doesn’t have to be
that way? Now we’re going to talk about how to change it in a minute,
but I really want you to get really, really clear and specific with
this. Are you telling yourself that you never have time for yourself?
Maybe you’re telling yourself that, “Wow, you know, if I was actually
living into all of my manifestations, I would never have time to be with
my family or be with my kids or be with my husband or my wife.” What are
these stories? We’ve got to purge these stories out. It’s like the how
dump you did earlier. Remember, you’ve got to clear these stories out.
Get them on paper, so you can witness them and look at your current
relationship with time. And maybe there’s some good things in there too,
but chances are there’s a lot of things that get to be shifted and get
to be upgraded. So, once you’ve done that, and only once you’ve done
that, you’re going to go into the second piece of soul work, and this is
where you get to choose your relationship with time. You get to craft
exactly what it’s going to look like. You get to play with this, and you
get to define this relationship with time, because no one’s telling you
your relationship with time must be like this. No one’s telling you,
well, because your whole family never has enough time, you must never
have enough time either. No, you get to craft this; you get to play with
this. You get to birth this relationship from the inside out and shift
your relationship with time in order to create the results that you
desire with time. Remember back to the Ultimate Success Formula, and we
talked about playing with the belief system, which then impacts the
action that you take, which then impacts the results. If you want to
change your results with time in your life, if you want even more time,
if you want more time available, if you want to feel like time is a
beautiful partner that’s on your side, that’s supporting you with your
manifestations, if you’d like to see results of your manifestations
showing up faster and faster, if you’d like to get really wild and see
your manifestations show up before you expect them to, if you desire
results like that, then we change the action, but prior to that, we
change the belief system. So for task number two, you’re going to sit
down and look firstly at task number one, and you’re going to take each
of the limits that you wrote down, each of the things that you wrote
down in task number one, and you’re going to take them and look at them.
And then you’re going to craft a minimum of three new choices, three new
decisions, three new beliefs that you’re going to choose to embody
around time that’s going to help reprogram your unconscious and your
unconscious relationship with time from the inside out, okay? You’ve
done a process similar to this already in the Quest, so you should be
very familiar on how to do this, remembering that as you catch each and
every single one of those limits, and then you start the reprogramming,
and you write out these three new structures that you’re choosing,
remember, you’re tapping into the feeling of what it feels like to
already have that relationship with time. So for example, if you’re
writing out, “Okay, well, you know, I’m getting raw and real in task
number two, and I believe that my manifestation of manifesting this big
manifestation that I’m focusing on right now, you know, I believe that’s
going to take a lot of time.” You’re going to catch that. And then for
task number two, you’re going to write, “Okay, I now choose to believe
that this manifestation shows up earlier than I expect. I now choose to
believe that this specific manifestation happens even easier and faster
than what I even thought it could. I choose to believe that this
manifestation shows up in a way where it surprises me at how quickly it
shows up,” okay? And remember, the conscious mind can come in and go,
“Yeah, but I don’t know if that’s true.” Stick with this. Go deeper with
this. You don’t completely change your entire relationship with time by
writing something out for a few minutes. It takes some time. You’ve got
to play with it, breathe into it, lean into it; get into the feeling of
what it feels like to be the version of you that interacts with time in
this way. And I promise you, if you go deep with this, time can be your
greatest friend. Time can be this quantum malleable element that you
have that supports your manifestations, that shows up for you and your
manifestations, that allows your manifestations to happen so much faster
than what you expect. You start living a reality where you’re like,
“Wow, okay, that happened quickly.” You start living a reality where you
go, “Wow, okay, that was fast!” When I started shifting my relationship
with time and doing these two processes, everything shifted for me. I
remember when I had just exited out of a long-term relationship, and I
was very clear this wasn’t the relationship with me; I closed that
container, and I spent a lot of time breathing into what this new
relationship got to look like. I was clear on it. I did this whole
manifestation process that I’ve been sharing with you in the Quest, and
I started getting clear, you know what? I would love a man, a partner, a
divine union, soulmate relationship that looked like this and felt like
this. And I collapsed the timelines, and I conditioned my vision of
myself from the insight out, and I rewired my belief system, and I
raised my level of tolerance; I did all the things that I’ve been
teaching you through this training. Now, at the same time in my life in
general, I was also working on my relationship with time. I wanted to
have a better relationship with time. I didn’t like feeling that I was
running out of time or there wasn’t enough time. So separate to this
relationship manifestation, I was going deep on these two tasks that
I’ve just given you. Now, what’s interesting is I ended that
relationship, and then two weeks later, at a Mindvalley event, I will
have you know, I ended up at this event in Mexico at A-Fest, and on the
very last night, really the last few hours of the last night of this
event, I met JuanPa. And as you know, here we are, living and creating a
beautiful life together. But I remember being so caught off guard by
this ’cause I remember seeing him, and I knew, my soul knew, deep down,
my soul knew, but I was like, “Wow, this has happened in two weeks; this
is too fast!” And then I remembered, hang on, this is an older version
of Regan saying this is too fast. This is how I want things to manifest
in my life. I want them to show up faster. I want them to surprise me. I
want them to show up so much earlier than I ever expected. And I
realized in this moment after we connected, wow, this is such living
proof of these timelines collapsing. This is such living proof of the
reflection of the relationship that I’ve been crafting with time from
the inside out then combined with all the manifestation pieces, which is
exactly what you have been doing this entire time. So, once again,
expect miracles with this, and they might just show up and really catch
you off guard. So for the next layer of this, once you’ve done the first
and second layer of your soul work, I want you to go and actually
connect with the activation that you did in the last lesson. And I want
you to redo this, and I want you reclear out the timelines and reanchor
in these new timelines. Because once you do task number one and two and
the soul work, once you do this, your whole relationship, also
energetically with your timelines, is going to be completely different.
So the work you did in the last lesson set you up for this moment.
You’re now going deeper into these layers, and then you’re going to redo
that last activation and notice what is different. So, for the last
piece of soul work, I want you to journal, and I want you to ground in
and write out your commitments around what you now choose to believe
about how quickly you are able to manifest what you desire. I want you
to declare your new relationship with time and your new relationship
with your manifestations, and I want you to post this; share this in the
Tribe. We want to hear from you. We want to know what your relationship
with time now looks like. We want to know what actually is important to
you around time. We want to know the fun things that you’re now choosing
to believe around time, and we want to know how specifically this
impacts your manifestations. So I’m excited to celebrate your new
relationship. I’m even more excited to hear all your physical 3D results
from this Quest and continuing on after this Quest. And you will see
these moments in time where you realize, “Wow, this is showing up faster
and faster and faster. What a reflection of my new relationship with
time.” So, have fun; go deep with this, and I’m super excited to dive
into the next phase of the Quest with you. Blessings.

====================

Locking In Your Future

====================

LESSON 24: Pulling Your Reality Into the Now

<v ->Welcome back to the final phase of the manifestation Quest.
Congratulations on going this deep and making it this far. We are going
into a superimportant final phase right now which is all about locking
in your future and bringing it into the right now. So, when we start
with this, it’s really important to remember the 20%. We talked about
this in the beginning, the 80/20 trap, how so many people have it
backwards. And if you’ve made it this far, you’ve definitely got this
the right way round. You’ve been doing at least 80% internally, rewiring
and shifting yourself, conditioning yourself to be the version of you
that naturally embodies your manifestations. But don’t forget about that
20%. Some people disconnect from the 20%, and they stay doing the inner
work. You must still take action, and you must show up, and you must
strategically do things in your life to allow your manifestations to
come into your reality. But most people are taking action and doing
things in order to allow their manifestations to come forward, but
they’re taking action from a frequency that just doesn’t serve them, a
frequency that actually blocks manifestation. Imagine doing all of this
inner work, and then you take action in your life, and you focus on the
20%, and you show up, and you take massive aligned action, but you’re
doing it from the wrong space, and you end up blocking your own
manifestations. I’ve seen so many people do this. So let’s dive deeper
into this; let’s dive deeper into starting to anchor your manifestations
into the right now. And what’s important is firstly that we recalibrate
your frequency. I said this on an earlier lesson; when it comes to life
and manifestation, your frequency is your currency. Now, if you are
constantly asking, “How do I make this happen?” as we talked about,
again, in a previous lesson, you’re coming from fear; you’re coming from
control. But instead, you get to act and be as if your manifestation is
already done. You get to act and be and take a aligned action as if your
manifestation is already here in the 3D physical reality. So, how we do
this at a frequency level is, I’m going to share some different states
and some different frequencies with you so that you can feel the one
that’s most potent and most powerful to propel your manifestations
forward. So, what most people do when they’re operating from a space of
fear and doubt and worry and lacking control is that they’re taking
action from a place of hope. And action from a place of hoping that
their manifestation may be one day, someday, hopefully, is going to show
up. And as you can imagine, that frequency doesn’t serve you. That
frequency can block your manifestation. It definitely doesn’t accelerate
your manifestation forward into having it show up. So I started figuring
this out when I was learning about manifestation and going deep and
trying so many different things. I started realizing, “Wow, there are so
many things in my life that I have this hoping energy with,” and I
decided to shift that. So instead, I shifted that to a frequency and a
feeling of expectation, a frequency and a feeling not of hoping
something was going to show up, but expecting that it will. And I
operated from this frequency for years, years and years and years, and
it serveD me really well, and my manifestations showed up. But I had a
moment where I was sitting in Peru, and I was sitting in a beautiful
ceremonial space. Myself and JuanPa take groups to Peru, and we go
really deep with people in these containers. And I was working in this
ceremony, and I asked my highest self, help me upgrade my manifestation
frequency. Help me upgrade my state of being to go into an even deeper
state of expectation. And the answer from my highest self, and what my
highest self said to me in that moment was very interesting. She said to
me, “Stop expecting.” And I remember saying to my highest self, “What do
you mean stop expecting? I mean, this is the frequency that’s helped me
so much with my manifestations.” And my highest self said to me, “This
frequency of expectation is holding you back.” And I was so confused, I
said, “Well, okay; well, thank you. But if I’m not in an energy of
expectation, what kind of energy am I in? What frequency am I meant to
be in in order to accelerate my manifestations?” And my highest self
said to me, “You should be in a frequency of knowing.” A frequency of
knowing. And that has stuck with me for so many years because something
shifted in me from the inside out. And I started playing with this
knowing frequency. I started playing beyond expecting but deeply knowing
that my manifestations were going to show up with ease, with grace, and
with flow. So in order to start feeling this right now, I want to give
you an example. Imagine if you go outside in the morning, and you are
hoping that the sun’s going to rise. Feel what it feels like to hope
that the sun’s going to rise. I mean, you’re probably not going to do
this because you know that the sun’s going to rise, but feel the
difference now if you expect the sun to rise. Okay, you’re sitting
there, and you’re like, “Okay I’m expecting it to come up. I mean, I
guess it will come up; I think it’s going to come up. I expect it to
come up.” And now feel what it feels like to know that the sun is going
to rise. And you go outside, and you just know. You know it’s going to
rise probably at about this time. And you’re in a frequency of knowing.
Now, of course, maybe that day the world explodes, and the sun doesn’t
rise. There’s always that possibility, but really, you know that you
know that you know that you know that probably, most likely, the sun is
going to rise. Imagine if you had that same embodiment of that frequency
with your manifestations. What would be different in your life if you
knew that you knew that you knew that you knew that of course you were
going to manifest what you desire. ’Cause remember, the 20% is
important, but it’s the frequency that we take this action from that
really, really, really counts. So instead of asking yourself, “How do I
make this happen?” And getting in this fear and worry and doubt
frequency, instead we’re going to get you to go deeper into the
frequency of knowing. Where you know that you know that you know that
you know that of course your manifestations are going to show up. My
clients will message me and say, Regan, “I’m so excited; this just
manifested.”I’m celebrating,” and I’ll say, “Congratulations; I knew you
were going to do that.” “Congratulations; of course that happened for
you.” “Congratulations, you knew that you knew that you knew that that
was going to be your reality.” One thing that I love to say to myself,
and you would’ve heard this in so many of the activations, Is that when
I ground into a manifestation, I’m often saying to myself, “Okay, it’s
done.” And I’m getting into the frequency of it being done. I’m getting
into the frequency of deeply knowing that this is my reality. You can
even use this as hashtags on social media. You can go, #itsdone, #iknow,
right? And we will know as a manifestation Tribe that that is your
invocation and declaration to actually embodying this manifestation
frequency that so many people don’t know about. So, for the first piece
of soul work we’re going to go through, and I’m going to help guide you
into remapping the energetics of what it really feels like to know that
you know that you know that you know that your manifestations are done.
Now, I want you to do this process twice. The first one, we’re going to
do this for your manifestation on or before the end of this Quest. And
then I want you to do this again, and do it for your larger
manifestation. You get to go through this process twice. It’s a potent
process, and it’s going to help you tap deeper into this state. So let’s
dive right into the activation, and then we’ll come back for the final
pieces of soul work. Okay, go ahead and sit or lie in a comfortable
position, allowing yourself to gently close your eyes, turning inwards
right now. Beautiful; anchoring into your breath, and breathing in and
out. Beautiful; as you lean into your intention to activate the deep
frequency of knowing, and apply this to your specific manifestation.
Good, as you go ahead and allow a red laser beam to shoot down from your
tailbone, all the way down. Anchoring you, grounding you, solidifying
you into the crystalline core of the earth. And simultaneously allowing
a golden laser beam of light to shoot up through your crown, connecting
you right now to your unique soul star. Allowing you to be guided,
grounded, present, protected, and supported. Heaven on earth embodied,
right here, right now, as you surround yourself with a ball of golden
white light. Requesting that any vibrations that are not serving you,
any energies, just drop out of your system and dissolve, purifying your
field; beautiful. Calling in your divine guidance into the space. And
from this place, go ahead and pull up a screen in front of you. And on
the screen, there’s a movie playing. And as you continue to watch the
movie, you notice that there is a beautiful sunrise that is about to
come up on the movie. You can see the light in the sky getting very
subtly brighter and brighter and brighter, just before that sun is about
to rise. And as you continue to watch this movie, go ahead and connect
with the specific feeling of deeply knowing that the sun is going to
come up in this movie; that’s it. Go ahead and watch this movie, and
connect with this movie, and know that you know that you know that you
know that the sun will rise, just like every other morning in this
movie, as you continue to witness this movie right now; that’s it.
Beautiful, and now tap into the feeling of the deep knowing, and allow
yourself to access that feeling of what it feels like to know that the
sun is going to rise. And now go ahead and double that feeling; that’s
it. Let it vibrate through every single cell of your being. And now
triple that feeling; beautiful. Good, that’s right, and as you go deeper
into this deep feeling of knowing, go ahead and continue to watch the
movie, and notice that the sun is starting to rise. It’s a beautiful
sunrise. Notice how it feels to feel the feeling of deep knowing, and
then see what you knew was going to happen happen. That’s it; double
that feeling; triple it. Let it rush through every single cell of your
being, as you continue to watch the sunrise right now. And as you watch
it, just notice that feeling of what it feels like to know that you knew
it was going to rise, and it did; that’s it. The knowing frequency is
vibrating through every single cell of your being. Good, now go ahead
and give this knowing frequency a shape, a simple shape; maybe it’s a
circle, a triangle; however it appears for you is perfect. Give it a
shape, and then give it a specific color. A desirable color, whatever
that color is for you is perfect; beautiful. As you allow yourself to
have this knowing frequency encoded within the symbol or the shape and
also the color. Go ahead and now float that symbol or shape of that
specific color just above the movie screen. Good, knowing that this deep
feeling and frequency of the knowingness, the manifestation knowing
frequency is encoded within this symbol and this shape; good. And now go
ahead and simply notice that a second screen has appeared. And as you
continue to witness the movie on the screen, you notice that this is a
movie of yourself having just manifested your intention; that’s it.
Notice what’s going on; good. Beautiful, now I want you to now rewind
the movie, and rewind it back to a moment in time so it’s just before
you actually manifested your intention. Maybe it’s a few minutes before,
a few hours before, a few days before. Wherever it is for you is
perfect. Rewind the movie back, until it’s at that moment in time, right
before you manifested your intention; good. And as you gently allow that
movie to play, go ahead and now connect with that symbol or shape that’s
encoded with the knowing frequency. And just like on a computer with a
mouse you would click drag and drop, we’re going to do the same thing
with this symbol or shape encoded with the knowing frequency; that’s it.
And so, click on that in your mind’s eye. Drag it; drag it; drag it;
drag it all the way, and go ahead and place it in the movie screen,
allowing it to then be dropped into you in the movie screen. That’s it.
Noticing the symbol or shape encoded with the deep manifestation knowing
frequency is now resting gently within you in the movie. As you continue
to witness yourself about to manifest your divine intention in the movie
screen right now; that’s it; good. And now speed the movie up again, you
can fast forward it a little bit, and take it to the moment in time
where you have just manifested your intention. Good, notice what’s going
on. And now go ahead and jump into the movie. So now you’re breathing
through your own lungs, seeing everything in the movie exactly real and
perfect exactly as it’s meant to be. Hearing all the sounds in the
movie, knowing how good it feels that you’ve just manifested your
intention. And now feel into the feeling of deep knowing; that’s right.
As you begin to remember that you knew that you knew that you knew that
of course you were going to manifest this. It’s just who you are; it’s
your minimum standard. There was no other option; it was done; it was
done; it was done. You knew that because you chose that; that’s it.
Double that feeling; that’s it. Triple that feeling; let it rush through
every single cell. Know how good it feels to be in this deep knowing
frequency. And from this space, this place, this frequency, and this
vibration, go ahead and now jump out of the screen. So once again you’re
watching the movie, witnessing yourself having just manifested your
divine intention from this deep frequency of knowing. That’s it; tune
into your heart center right now as you continue to watch this movie.
Breathing into your heart, breathing this frequency even deeper into
your heart. And as you exhale, just letting anything go that’s not that
frequency; that’s right. You know that you know that you know that you
know. The knowing frequency is your natural state. It is done; it is
done; it is done. Beautiful, as you gently begin to remember that you
can access this knowing frequency through that symbol, through that
shape that encodes that frequency that is literally encoded within you
right now. You can access that at any time; it is one thought away; it
is simply who you are at your core; good; beautiful. And now you can
begin to come back into your present moment in time, into your breath,
into your body. Beginning to ground and seal all of this down deeply,
anchoring this knowing frequency as your natural state in your system.
Mm, beautiful, and requesting these upgrades continue until they’re
fully stabilized and complete. Taking a moment to thank your guidance,
and to thank yourself for the energetic frequency being that you are;
that’s it. Deep knowing is my natural state. Deep knowing is my natural
state. Deep knowing is my natural state. Deep knowing is my natural
state. Deep knowing is my natural state. And so it is; that’s right.
Beautiful, so coming back into awareness; back into your breath. With so
much gratitude, now you can gently open your eyes. Beautiful, so
congratulations on this frequency upgrade. Take your time with this
integration, and now you get to be this vibration. You get to act, walk,
talk, think, and act from this vibration. Your piece of soul work now is
to notice what now feels different. And then from this place, what are
you committed to? We want to hear from you, what are three separate
action items that you commit to taking today to accelerate your
manifestation into the now? Taking action on these items with this new
frequency. Maybe you commit to calling that person. Maybe you commit to
writing that post. Maybe you commit to go and talking and speaking your
truth to that person. Whatever it is for you is perfect. Allow it to
propel your manifestations forward, but make sure you do it from this
frequency of deeply knowing that your manifestation is done; it is done;
it is done because you know that you know that you know. Beautiful
diving into this with you. Please share all of this into the Tribe, your
takeaways, your breakthroughs. We want to hear from you; we want to
celebrate you. And in the next lesson, get ready because we’re going
deeper; see you then.

LESSON 24: Meditation - Map the Energetics of the Sunset

- Okay, go ahead and sit or lie in a comfortable position, allowing yourself to gently close your eyes, turning inwards right now. Beautiful anchoring into your breath, and breathing in and out. Beautiful. As you lean into your intention to activate the deep frequency of knowing and apply this to your specific manifestation. Good as you. Go ahead and allow a red laser beam to shoot down from your tailbone all the way down, anchoring you, grounding you, solidifying you into the crystalline core of the earth, and simultaneously allowing a golden laser beam of light to shoot up through your crown. Connecting you right now to your unique soul stuff, allowing you to be guided, grounded, present, protected, and supported. Heaven on earth and embodied right here, right now. As you surround yourself with a ball of golden white light requesting that any vibrations that are not serving you, any energies just drop out of your system and dissolve, purifying your field. Beautiful. Calling in your divine guidance into the space. And from this place, go ahead and pull up a screen in front of you. And on the screen there's a movie playing. And as you continue to watch the movie, you notice that there is a beautiful sunrise that is about to come up on the movie. You can see the light in the sky getting very subtly brighter and brighter and brighter just before that sun is about to rise. And as you continue to watch this movie, go ahead and connect with the specific feeling of deeply knowing that the sun is going to come up in this movie. That's it. And go ahead and watch this movie and connect with this movie and know that you know that you know that you know that the sun will rise just like every other morning in this movie as you continue to witness this movie right now. That's it. Beautiful. And now tap into the feeling of the deep knowing and allow yourself to access that feeling of what it feels like to know that the sun is going to rise. And now go ahead and double that feeling. That's it. Let it vibrate through every single cell of your being. And now triple that feeling beautiful. Good. That's right. And as you go deeper into this deep feeling of knowing, go ahead and continue to watch the movie and notice that the sun is starting to race. It's a beautiful sunrise. Notice how it feels to to feel the feeling of deep knowing and then see what you knew was going to happen. Happen. That's it. Double that feeling. Triple it. Let it rush through every single cell of your being as you continue to watch the sunrise right now. And as you watch it, just notice that feeling of what it feels like to know that you knew it was going to rise and it did. That's it. The knowing frequency is vibrating through every single cell of your bee. Good. Now go ahead and give this knowing frequency, a shape, a simple shape, maybe it's a circle, a triangle, however it appears for you is perfect. Give it a shape and then give it a specific color, a desirable color. Whatever that color is for you is perfect. Beautiful. As you allow yourself to have this knowing frequency encoded within the symbol or the shape, and also the color, go ahead and now float that symbol or shape of that specific color just above the movie screen. Good. Knowing that this deep feeling and frequency of the knowingness the manifestation, knowing frequency is encoded within the symbol and the shape. Good. And now go ahead and simply notice that a second screen has appeared. And as you continue to witness the movie on the screen, you notice that this is a movie of yourself having just manifested your intention. That's it. Notice what's going on. Good. Beautiful. Now I want you to now rewind the movie and rewind it back to a moment in time. So it's just before you actually manifested your intention. Maybe it's a few minutes before, a few hours before, a few days before. Wherever it is for you is perfect. Rewind the movie back until it's at that moment in time right before you manifested your intention. Good. And as you gently allow that movie to play, go ahead and now connect with that symbol or shape that's encoded with the knowing frequency. And just like on a computer with a mouse, you would click drag and drop. We're going to do the same thing with this symbol or shape enc coated with the knowing frequency. That's it. And so click on that in your mind's eye. Drag it, drag it, drag it, drag it all the way, and go ahead and place it in the movie screen, allowing it to then be dropped into you in the movie screen. That's it. Noticing this symbol or shape encoded with the deep manifestation. Knowing frequency is now resting gently within you in the movie as you continue to witness yourself about to manifest your divine intention in the movie. Scream right now. That's it. Good. And now speed the movie up again. You can fast forward it a little bit and take it to the moment in time where you have just manifested your intention. Good. Notice what's going on. And now go ahead and jump into the movie. Whew. So now you're breathing through your own lungs, seeing everything in the movie. Exactly. Real and perfect, exactly as it's meant to be. Hearing all the sounds in the movie, knowing how good it feels, that you've just manifested your intention. And now feel into the feeling of deep knowing that's right. As you begin to remember that you knew that you knew, that you knew that of course you were going to manifest this. It's just who you are. It's your minimum standard. There was no other option. It was done, it was done, it was done. You knew that because you chose that. That's it. Double that feeling. That's it. Triple that feeling. Let it rush through. Every single cell. Know how good it feels to be in this deep knowing frequency. And from this space, this place, this frequency and this vibration. Go ahead and now jump out of the screen. So once again, you're watching the movie, witnessing Yourself, having just manifested your divine intention from this deep frequency of knowing. That's it. Tune into your heart center right now as you continue to watch this movie. Breathing into your heart, breathing this frequency even deeper into your heart. And as you exhale, just letting anything go, that's not that frequency. That's right. You know that you know that. You know that. You know the knowing frequency is your natural state. It is done, it is done, it is done. Beautiful. As you gently begin to remember that you can access this knowing frequency through that symbol, through that shape, that encodes that frequency that is literally encoded within you right now. You can access that at any time. It is one thought away. It is simply who you are at your good, beautiful. And now you can begin to come back into your present moment in time, into your breath, into your body, beginning to ground and seal all of this down deeply anchoring this knowing frequency as your natural state in your system. Beautiful. I'm requesting these upgrades continue until they're fully stabilized and complete taking a moment to thank your guidance and to thank you yourself for the energetic frequency being that you are. That's it. Deep knowing is my natural state. Deep knowing is my natural state. Deep knowing is my natural state. Deep knowing is my natural state. Deep knowing is my natural state. And so it is. That's right. Beautiful, sir. Coming back into awareness, back into your breath, and with so much gratitude now you can gently open your eyes.

====================

LESSON 25: Future Gratitude Rewire

<v ->Welcome back. In this lesson, we are diving deep into a powerful
manifestation accelerator that so many people aren’t using because
they’re not even aware of. This accelerator is gratitude. And when you
choose to work with the power of gratitude in this way, this can
massively shift and accelerate your results. So here’s the thing: if you
are not grateful for where you’re currently at and what you’re calling
in, you are missing a huge opportunity to accelerate your manifestation.
Now, you’ve probably heard of gratitude before; you probably know, okay
it’s good to have a practice of gratitude, but how we are going to be
utilizing gratitude is even more powerful. We’re combining this with
your new state of knowing. We’re combining this with your new
relationship with time; you get to fold time and space and accelerate
your manifestations by utilizing gratitude as a manifestation
accelerator in this specific way. Having a grateful heart, a grateful
heart, is one of our manifestation superpowers. Now, this is not just
about being grateful in your life. This is about taking the gratitude,
the specific gratitude from your future, and mapping it into the right
now in order for you to be even more in a natural state of your
gratitude, even more in a natural state of being grateful that your
manifestations are already here, being even more in a deep frequency of
knowing that your manifestation has already showed up. This helps you
shift your resident frequency once again into your manifestations being
done and to deeply noticing that your resident frequency gets to be this
constant state of gratitude, knowing that your manifestations are
already here. So for your first layer of soul work, we’re going to dive
right in and activate this. There’s nothing that you need to do in this
process other than to be open and to be available. I’m going to guide
you through it, and you’re going to be able to not just be grateful for
where you’re at right now but actually access the gratitude from your
future, and then allow yourself to bring that into your state of
beingness right now so that you can integrate this and have this be part
of your resident frequency right now. So let’s dive right into this
activation, and then we’ll go into your other pieces of soul work after
you’ve completed this. Go ahead and sit or lie in a comfortable
position, allowing yourself to gently close your eyes, turning inwards
right now, using your breath to ground and center yourself, as you allow
yourself to drop into your intention, your intention to activate, at a
deep cellular level, the frequency of gratitude, utilizing gratitude as
one of your manifestation superpowers in order to accelerate your
manifestations. Beautiful. So go ahead and now allow a red laser beam to
shoot down from your tailbone, anchoring you, grounding you, solidifying
you into the crystalline core of the earth, and simultaneously allowing
a golden laser beam of light to shoot up through your crown, connecting
you right now to your unique soul star, as you allow yourself to be
guided, grounded, present, protected, and supported; heaven on earth
embodied right here, right now. As you surround yourself with a ball of
golden white light. And request that any vibrations or energies that are
not yours, that are blocking or stopping your own flow of gratitude, may
they drop out of your system right now with ease and with grace.
Beautiful. As you take a moment to call in your divine guidance, beings
of light of the highest vibration, divinely assigned to assisting you in
integrating these deeper frequencies of gratitude. That’s right.
Beautiful. Go ahead and float up above now, and from this place, in this
space, go ahead and turn towards your future, and now go out and float
all the way out into your future, all the way out to that specific
moment in time, just before that moment in time where you know you will
have manifested your larger manifestation; that’s right. And when you
are hovering right there just above that event, just before that event,
just take a moment to look back, and notice that your manifestation for
this Quest has already manifested, and it is simply a stepping stone in
this focus area and this area of life towards your grander
manifestation, which is about to activate and manifest in this moment in
time right now; that’s right. And from this perspective, looking down on
this event, hovering just above the event, you may see the event; you
may feel it; you may just simply know you’re there. Either way is
perfect. Go ahead and notice as you look down into this event and you
access that version of you that has just manifested your larger
manifestation, go ahead and notice how grateful they are. That’s it. Go
ahead and simply notice the deep level of gratitude that you feel in
that moment, that deep celebration, that deep gratitude of being so
grateful that your larger manifestation is here; it’s now; it’s
happened; it’s done. That’s it. Now from that space, go ahead and float
down into that event, and now jump into your own body in that event.
That’s it. Now you’re breathing through your own lungs, seeing
everything through your own eyes, hearing everything, and allow yourself
to feel that feeling of being so deeply grateful. Your larger
manifestation has happened. It’s here; you can see it. You’re living it;
you’re breathing it. Feel how good it feels; feel how grateful you feel
in this moment; that’s it. And allow yourself to now amplify that
feeling of gratitude. That’s it. Amplify that feeling of gratitude. Let
it rush through every single cell of your being. And now go ahead and
double that feeling. That’s it. Double down on that. Let it rush through
every single cell. And now go ahead and triple that feeling. Let it
vibrate with every single cell of your being, as you allow this
frequency of gratitude to rush through you. And now from this place, go
ahead and get your thumb and your first finger on either of your hands,
whichever feels right for you. And now, press that together. And as you
press that, allow yourself to feel that feeling; double that feeling
once again. When that feeling gets stronger and stronger, go ahead and
press that point on your two fingers together. Once again, triple that
feeling. Let it rush through every single cell. Press it again; that’s
right; anchor it in. When you do this, you are creating new neural
pathways in your brain and in your system. That’s right. And now go
ahead allowing this frequency of deep, deep, deep gratitude to vibrate
through every single cell getting stronger and stronger and stronger;
press those two fingers together, and now breathe. That’s it. Breathe in
the gratitude, and breathe out the gratitude. You are pure gratitude in
this moment. Press that button again on your fingers. That’s right,
those two points. Press them together. That’s it. Anchor this in; this
is your natural state. This gratitude is available to you right here,
right now. Now keeping your fingers pressed together in this moment,
keep your fingers together; anchor and solidify. Keep that feeling of
deep gratitude. And from this place, go ahead keeping your fingers
pressed together like that. And now float up above that moment. That’s
it. Float up, up, up, until you are hovering just above that event with
your two fingers still pressed together; gratitude’s still vibrating
through every single cell of your being. That’s right. Looking down on
that event, having so much gratitude for that event, keeping your
fingers pressed and anchored together. Take this feeling, this frequency
of gratitude. Turn towards your past and then back towards now. And
gently begin to float all the way back to now. Taking this feeling and
this frequency of gratitude with you. Continuing to float back, back,
back, all the way back, until you are hovering above right now. That’s
it. Keeping your fingers together. Go ahead and now gently float down
into now, back into this space; back into your body. Keeping your
fingers anchored together right now. Feeling that frequency, the state
of gratitude. And now once again, double that feeling. That’s it; let it
rush through every single cell of your being right now. And then go
ahead and triple that feeling. That’s it; let it vibrate. Press your
fingers together now one more time. That’s it. Anchoring this in,
solidifying this in, creating new neural pathways in your system,
activating this frequency at an even deeper level through every single
cell of your being. Allowing yourself to bathe in the bliss of
gratitude, your future gratitude that is now anchored, solidified, and
activated through every cell of your being right here, right now. That’s
it. Beautiful. You can now release your fingers and simply allow
yourself to feel how good it feels to be you right now. Allow yourself
to notice how good it feels to have this frequency of gratitude
vibrating through every single cell; this is your natural state. You are
gratitude. That’s right. “I am gratitude. I am gratitude. I am
gratitude.” That’s right. Beautiful. Allowing all these shifts to
anchor, lock, solidify, and recalibrate. Continuing to upgrade through
your system, until they are fully stabilized, integrated, embodied, and
complete. Allowing yourself to feel into your grateful heart. Having so
much gratitude for the frequency being that you are; having so much
gratitude for your own capacity to literally pull your own gratitude out
from your future into the right now in order for you to embody this
manifestation accelerator at an even deeper level. It is done. It is
done. It is done. That’s right. Beautiful. As you take your time to now
gently come back into your breath, back into the space. And of course
with so much gratitude, now you can gently open your eyes. Welcome back.
I’m excited to hear how this activation was for you. This is very potent
and very powerful because you have just created a new access point for
your own future gratitude that is now embodied through you and available
to you at any time right now. So in any moment where you desire to feel
this gratitude, feel this state, this frequency, you can close your
eyes, and you can press these two fingers together or these two fingers,
whichever fingers they were for you. And you can allow yourself to feel
that feeling. And the more you do this, the stronger it gets, and the
stronger it gets, the more you do this, until you can be having a day
where you feel down and out, and the feeling of gratitude feels so far
away from you; close your eyes; press, and you’ll notice your system has
now rewired and recalibrated this state at a very deep level through
every single layer of your being. This is a huge manifestation
accelerator. And if you can stay in this state as much as possible every
single day, this helps you go even deeper into being the version of you
where your manifestations are already done, until you wake up and you
open your eyes and you turn around and you realize, “Oh, my
manifestations are done.” In which case you get to fire off your
gratitude point in celebration and then go deeper with it into the next
layers of your next manifestations. So your next layer of soul work is
to now reflect on this and to write a list of at least 20 things that
you are grateful for specifically relating to your two manifestations.
Write these out as if they are done. Write them out as if this already
happened. “I am so happy and grateful that because my manifestations
showed up, it now allowed me to do this.” “I’m so happy and grateful
that because my manifestations are here, it’s changed my life in this
way.” And go deep on this; share this. We want to celebrate you. We want
to hear your biggest breakthroughs and your takeaways and anything that
you are anchoring in from this lesson. We’re nearing the end of this
Quest. We still have deep, deep layers to go into. You’re seeing how
every piece stacks upon the last piece. So make sure you keep up with
these final pieces of soul work, and I’m excited to dive deeper with you
on the next lesson. Blessings.

LESSON 25: Meditation - Tap Into Gratitude

- Go ahead and sit or lie in a comfortable position, allowing yourself to gently close your eyes, turning inwards right now, using your breath to ground and center yourself as you allow yourself to drop into your intention, your intention to activate at a deep cellular level, the frequency of gratitude, utilizing gratitude as one of your manifestation superpowers in order to accelerate your manifestations.

Continuing to upgrade through your system until they're fully stabilized, integrated, embodied, and complete. Allowing yourself to feel into your grateful heart. Having so much gratitude for the frequency being that you are having so much gratitude for your own capacity to literally pull your own gratitude out from your future into the right now in order for you to embody this manifestation accelerator at an even deeper level. It is done. It is done. It is done. That's right. Beautiful. As you take your time to now, gently come back into your breath, back into the space, and of course, with so much gratitude now you can gently open your eyes.

====================

LESSON 26: Your Daily Manifestation Practice

<v ->Welcome back. Manifestation is a lifestyle. It’s a way of being.
Everything you’ve learnt in this Quest is not something you do just
during this Quest and then forget about it. No. This is a way of being
that you then get to integrate into your life. Please remember, when you
chose to come and be a part of this Quest, you chose this because you’re
in this for the long-term game. I’m pretty sure you’re not interested in
just manifesting something during this Quest and then never manifesting
something ever again in your life. No, this is a long-term game. Please,
don’t be one of those people that forgets about the magic of
manifestation. Don’t be one of those people that finishes this Quest and
then goes back to their old way of living. It’s so important that you
get to remember that you get to integrate everything that you’ve learned
and activated and said yes to during this Quest into your day-to-day
life. Now, the way that I love to do this is I love developing what I
call manifestation daily rituals. Now, we’re going to break this down
and have a look at what does this look like, and the good news is is
that this is something that you can continue on literally for the rest
of your life if you choose. It can be totally custom to you. You can do
this at any time during your day. I recommend in the morning if
possible, but maybe your mornings are crazy, and you do your
manifestation daily rituals at night. Perfect. As long as you get this
done, this is what really counts. So remember that it’s not about what
you do in these rituals that is actually so important; it’s about using
your manifestation rituals to set yourself up for the rest of your day.
It’s almost like someone goes to the gym, and they work out for an hour,
and they feel really good, and then the other 23 hours of the day, they
eat terrible food; they don’t move their body; they feel in a really bad
state. That’s not that efficient versus someone who maybe spends 10 or
15 minutes doing some exercise and committing to their health goals in
the morning, and then they choose to live a healthy lifestyle for the
rest of the day. Well, that’s much more efficient. Your real
manifestation ritual is your life. Life is the real ceremony. It’s not
the ceremony that you do in the morning or in the night, but what’s
important is that you do have this manifestation ritual to set yourself
up for the rest of your day, the rest of your week, the rest of your
month, and beyond. So you have so many tools available to you right now.
You may even feel a little bit overwhelmed with how many tools you have
available. So what you get to do is you get to now go back through this
Quest and look at all of the tools that you now have. Look at all of the
activations that you now have, and your job is to start deciphering
which ones are really important for you to work with deeper. And for
some of you, some of these tools may not be so impactful because you’re
focusing on something else, so you’ve already done a lot of deep work on
that in your life, and then there may be another tool that you use every
single day for weeks and weeks and weeks ’cause it helps you so much.
This is where, with your daily manifestation ritual, you get to make
this totally customized. You get to design this in a way every single
day where this feels perfect, and this feels aligned for you. So when
you reflect back on this Quest and all of the deep lessons that we’ve
gone into, remember, you started looking at the 80/20 trap, and you went
through a deep inner recalibration of actually coming back to at least
80% of your inner game. Then you learned the power of 2%, and you looked
at committing to your 2% and whatever way that looks like for you right
now; 2% with your beliefs, 2% with your action, accelerating 2% with
your results, and then compounding that. Remember all of the activations
with each of these lessons as well. You went deeper into surrendered
manifestation, burning out that control, and shifting out of
manufactured manifestation, bringing yourself back into the state where
you get to be open and available, and in this powerful synchronistic
surrendered vibration. You tapped into the deeper vision, and you locked
that in. You surrendered to the true authentic vision, and even though
that may feel like years ago now, maybe this is something as well that
you get to go back to, to go deeper in, to expand the next layers of
your vision. You went deeper into raising your level of tolerance,
shifting your minimum standard, and remember the activations that
allowed you to say yes to the version of you that was stepping it up and
playing an even better game in your actual life. And then we had the
lessons on expanding your capacity to receive, your capacity to increase
your energetic containers, remembering that you can only hold what you
have the capacity to actually receive energetically. Maybe it’s
important that you go deeper, and you work on the expansion pieces
through those lessons. Then we dove into expanding beyond your limits,
right? Looking at what are these limits sitting underneath the surface
and shifting your capacity to move beyond them, starting to activate the
vision beyond your vision. Maybe it’s important you go back and you
really ground into the bigness of your vision beyond the vision that you
get to hold. And then we went into upgrading your belief system,
shifting, recalibrating, updating that computer software program in
order for you to truly believe that everything you desire is absolutely
possible. It’s going to be important for many of you to go back and
reassess how you get to dance with your limits. How you get to release
fear. How you get to recode self-sabotage. How you get to upgrade your
self-belief to bring the most powerful version of you to the table, and
maybe it’s important that you go back and you look at the activations
and the processes and the soul work around releasing your “how”
addiction. Remember, as you go through this work, it’s not about doing
this once. As you shift and recalibrate and upgrade and step into new
manifestations, you have new pieces come to the surface. That’s why I am
still in all of the soul work and all of the activations that I’ve given
to you. These are the things that I still use in my life on a daily
basis because I’m constantly shifting into new paradigms, which bring up
new things to look at from our unconscious reality. Remember the piece
around clearing resistance from your body, working at a cellular level
and tuning into the different parts of your body, learning to listen to
your body. And then upgrading the energetic structures within your
field. Remember the important of “as above, so below.” Working through
these subtle layers in order to update the information so that your
energetic field is in alignment and in cohesion with all of your other
layers of your being. And then we talked about how to become an
energetic match, going deeper into vibrating at the frequency of having
already received your manifestation whilst you recalibrated your
identity, whilst you did the activations to allow your highest self that
has already manifested what you desire to come in and be anchored into
the here and the now. And then don’t forget the piece about your inner
child. Superimportant that you have this little girl or this little boy
onboard with you. Constantly giving your inner child what you need.
Constantly going into that activation and redoing that so that you can
be living in a state where you’re not acting from a wounded inner child,
which holds up your manifestations, but instead, you have your inner
child playing and onboard and helping you manifest. Then we looked at
the pieces around releasing timelines, clearing and shifting old
timelines that are now outdated and bringing in new ones in order to
support your manifestation showing up even faster. We recoded your
relationship with time. This is so big for so many people. Maybe this is
something you went deep on, but maybe listening to this now, you know
you could go back and go even deeper. We activated your frequency of
knowing. I’m working still so deeply on activating this as well, knowing
there’s always deeper and deeper and deeper vibrational states. And the
deeper we go with this, the faster our manifestations show up. We
learned the power of gratitude, being grateful for where you’re at in
your life, but even more importantly, connecting to that future
gratitude, and mapping that through your system into the right now,
anchoring that so you can embody that and access that at any time. What
is your commitment to the 80%? What is your commitment to moving
forward? What is your commitment to diving into these pieces and
actually accelerating everything forward. Make sure also when you’re
going through all of these pieces of soul work and all of these lessons
and all these things that you’ve learned and upgraded that you’re now
remembering, make sure that you also make a list of all the activations
that are available to you. These activations are available to you go
into as tools each and every single day. And so every day, you can
choose what’s important for you. So what does your manifestation ritual
get to look like? You can literally take tasks from each of the layers
of the soul work from this Quest, and you can work on them every single
day. Now, if you love the system and you feel like it would serve you,
maybe every day in the morning or in the night, whenever you choose to
do your manifestation ritual, you can go through and follow the format
of this Quest, and you can redo it for the same focus area if you
desire. Maybe for different manifestations. Or you could choose a
totally different focus area of your life. Or now that you have
everything across the board, you can dip in and out of this. You can
feel yourself in the moment. The thing that I love to do with my
manifestation rituals every single day is I just put my hand on my heart
and ask myself, “What does my soul need right now?” I ask myself “What
is going to move forward my manifestations right now?” And sometimes the
answer is “Hmmm, okay; I can feel there’s some fear when I connect with
my manifestations. Let me work on that piece.” Sometimes the answer is
“Hmmm, okay; I’m worried it’s not showing up fast enough. Let me work on
that piece on time.” Sometimes it’s like “Hmmm, I just feel like I’m not
quite sure if I’m the version of me that can handle this right now, so
let me work on these pieces with my higher self and recalibrating my
identity.” You have this buffet of tools right now. And it’s now your
choice to design this each and every single way in a way where this
feels good for you. This could be 5 or 10 minutes. This could be an
hour. This could be alternating the time every single day. You get to do
this on your terms in a way where it feels really good for you. Just
make sure this happens each and every single day. Now that you’re coming
to the completion of this Quest, you get to become an ultimate
manifestor, but I promise you, these superpowers are like anything else.
They need practice, right? You need to go deeper into them and embody
them and play with them, and then you will hit a point where you step
into mastery with them, and you notice that your manifestations are
showing up faster and faster and faster and with even more ease and
grace because you’re going into mastery with these manifestation tools.
So for your first piece of soul work, I want to hear from you. What do
you commit to on a daily basis after this Quest? What will your daily
manifestation ritual look like? What tools are you going to use? Maybe
you share into the group a specific list of tools that you’re going to
focus on for the next week, the next month. However this works for you
to express this and create this and ground into this is perfect. Then
for the second layer of soul work, I want you to do your very first
manifestation ritual. This is where you’re free now. You’re not
following the exact soul pieces of this Quest, unless you, of course,
choose to keep that structure. But this is where, either tonight or
tomorrow morning, you get to wake up and say “Okay, I’m going to do my
manifestation ritual. How does this get to look for me right now?” And
whatever you do, I want you to share this in the Tribe, and let us know
what did this look like? How did you make this sacred and beautiful and
powerful and amazing? Maybe this was five minutes quickly to focus on
your vision right before you jumped in with the kids. Maybe you set up a
beautiful hour, and you set some candles and put some incense on, and
you made it a beautiful stunning ceremonial space because that’s what
felt aligned and important to you. However it looks for you, however you
want to do it, you get to do this on your terms, exactly how you like
it. But I want to see it. I want to celebrate it. I want to see it not
only in the Tribe, but I have a challenge for you. Especially if you’ve
been someone who’s been hanging out in this Quest and posting in the
Tribe a little bit, I have a challenge for you: to post either a photo
or a video or a short little snapshot of your manifestation ritual, and
your challenge is to post this on social media. That means in public.
That means where other people can see it, right? And I want you to share
some or all of your manifestation ritual, and it might just be one
photo, and you might just say I’m celebrating that I did my
manifestation ritual today. I want you to use the hashtag
#manifestationritual. Tag me in this. Tag Mindvalley in this. I want to
see this. I want to share this. Mindvalley wants to see this. They want
to share it as well. We want to see what does this look like? And this
is such an important piece for you to be witnessed in as you step into
truly being an ultimate manifestor, as you step into owning mastery
around all of these tools and going deeper and deeper with them in your
daily life. So I’m so excited to see your Facebook post, to see your
Instagram story, to see your video. I can’t wait actually to celebrate
you in this. Make sure you post in the Tribe as well as usual, but your
big challenge for today is to share this and be witnessed out there in
social media, #manifestationritual. Let’s anchor in these rituals
together. If you follow me on social media, you’ll see that I share all
of my manifestation rituals all the time using the same tools that we’ve
been going into in this exact Quest. I love you so much, and make sure
you tune in for the final lesson because we are finishing this off
strong, and we have a powerful activation that is going to anchor and
solidify and accelerate everything in for you. I love you so much, and
I’ll see you on the final lesson.

====================

LESSON 27: Lock In Your Committed Future

<v ->Welcome back to the final lesson in this manifestation Quest. I am
so proud of you, and I’m so happy that you’re here, and you’re showing
up, and you stayed true to your commitments. This is massive. How you do
one thing is how you do everything, and if you are showing up in your
life as you’ve shown up in this Quest, then I know your life is going to
continue to get more and more and more magical. Today, we are
celebrating. We’re celebrating that you’re here; we’re celebrating all
of the deep work that you have done, and it’s really important that you
allow yourself to celebrate. Just like we talked about the power of
gratitude, the power of celebration is equally important. Celebration
itself is a manifestation tool because it gets you in the state of
calling in more of what you are celebrating. So it’s really important
that you celebrate the big wins when it comes to your manifestations,
but also the microwins. Maybe your full Quest manifestation has already
manifested, and you’re celebrating that, but maybe also you’re on your
path to that now, and you’re celebrating the micromanifestations, the
shifts within you, you are celebrating that you are now changed,
different, upgraded, and you know your manifestation is coming. Maybe
there are other surprise manifestations that have showed up, that have
delighted you and surprised you and allowed you to remember how magical
manifestation really is. Maybe you are celebrating how different you now
are, knowing that you are now embodied in your highest self, knowing
that you are now on your manifestation path. Wherever you are at with
this is absolutely perfect. What counts is are you getting in the energy
of celebration? Remember, it’s not about the destination, but it’s about
the journey and the steps that we get to walk along the way. And you
have taken some huge steps from the inside out during this Quest, and I
know you’ll continue to do this beyond this Quest, starting with your
manifestation ritual every single day. The energy of celebration brings
in more of what you desire, so you’ve got to make sure that you’re
celebrating daily. This is literally a tool that you can integrate into
your manifestation ritual. This is a tool that you can integrate and
allow yourself to simply celebrate the big things, the small things, and
even the things that are still showing up in your life. So in order to
close out this Quest, we, of course, have a powerful activation. This is
going to be, of course, a closed-eye process, using the energetic
architecture method that will allow you to integrate everything and drop
deeply into the celebration frequency. There’s nothing you need to do to
set this up; we are going to go deep; we’re going to hit on so many
pieces; it’s going to allow you to integrate and assimilate so many of
the shifts and so many of the upgrades that have happened and will
continue to happen, as the magic and the miracles continue to unfold in
your life. So let’s start going deeper into this; you know what to do.
Sit or lie in a comfortable position, allowing yourself to close your
eyes and turn inward right now. That’s right; beautiful. Now from this
place, go ahead and ground into your breath, breathing in love and
gratitude, breathing out anything that doesn’t serve you right now;
beautiful. As you allow yourself to gently lean into your intention,
your intention to activate and integrate all of the pieces of all of the
soul work that you have gone so deep on during this Quest; may they be
activated and integrated and assimilated into your life and into your
reality with ease, with grace, and with flow; good. Go ahead and allow a
red laser beam to shoot down from your tailbone all the way down,
anchoring you, grounding you, solidifying you into place, and
simultaneously allowing a golden laser beam of light to shoot up through
your crown, connecting you right now to your unique soul star, allowing
you to be guided, grounded, present, protected, and supported; heaven on
earth embodied right here, right now. As you surround yourself with a
ball of golden white light; beautiful. Requesting any energies,
vibrations, or frequencies that are not yours and not of the highest
drop, dissolve, and clear out of your system, purifying your field right
now, as you lean even deeper and deeper into your intention. That’s
right. Taking a moment to call in your divine guidance, beings of light
of the highest vibration, divinely assigned to you, divinely assigned to
assisting you with your intention of deeply integrating all of this
powerful work. That’s right; good; beautiful. Now from this place and
this space, go ahead and float up above now. Float up out of your body
and turn your focus and your attention out to your divine future, and
gently begin to float out all the way out, until you float to that exact
moment in time, that moment in time that you know very well now, that
you decree or declare that your larger manifestation be manifested into
your life on or before this specific moment in time, and when you are
there hovering just above this event, just before this event, looking
down on this event, go ahead and look down into that event, and simply
notice what’s going on. Notice how good it feels; notice the frequency
of knowing; notice the gratitude; notice how happy you look and feel.
Notice what you’re saying to yourself in that moment, as you remember
that this manifestation has been anchored, locked, solidified, coded
within your system. It is done; it is done; it is done. That’s right;
beautiful. And from this place, this space of deep knowing and deep
gratitude, from this place and this frequency, gently float back to now,
only as quickly as you can stop and notice all of the events in your
future shift and reevaluate themselves in light of your future larger
manifestation that has been anchored and solidified and grounded into
your future. Notice what is different in your future now; notice what
has shifted in your future now in order to support the full and complete
manifestation of your divine intention, with ease, with grace, and with
flow. That’s right: beautiful. Notice how you constantly are now attuned
to the 80%, going deep into your internal reality, and notice how you
take action on the 20% but from a different frequency; good. Go ahead
and notice out in your future how committed you’ve been to the power of
2%; notice the compounding effect that has happened and rippled through
your life from your divine commitment of choosing to believe just 2%
more in your own capacity, of choosing to take just 2% more aligned
action, of choosing to accelerate your results and watch them compound,
compound, compound. That’s right. Notice how you’ve constantly attuned
yourself to be in a frequency of surrendered manifestation. Notice how
you now, in your future, have the consciousness and awareness to catch,
when you are attempting to control the process, attempting to go into
manufactured manifestation, notice how you catch that, see that,
recalibrate that, and shift and expand and open into a state once again
of surrendered manifestation; good. Continue to float back all the way
back to now, only as quickly as you can stop and notice how you have
constantly realigned to your true authentic vision. Notice how you have
said yes to this vision, spent time with this vision, lived and breathed
and birthed this vision through you. Notice how you are connected to
this vision with such crystal clarity at such a deep layer; that’s it.
And notice how through your connection to this vision, you have
constantly raised your minimum standard, shifted your level of
tolerance; notice how you are no longer willing to tolerate anything
less than the materialization and manifestation of this vision. That’s
right; good. And continue to notice how you gently but constantly expand
your capacity to receive; notice how you’ve been able to allow even more
frequencies and vibrations to come and be anchored into your energetic
field, gently increasing your energetic containers, allowing for your
capacity to hold more of what you desire to be anchored, grounded, and
solidified into your system with ease and with grace, and notice how you
constantly have expanded beyond your energetic limits, opening them up,
expanding them, saying yes to holding more light, holding more
information, so you can be in even greater alignment with your
manifestations. That’s right. Continue to float all the way back to now
only as quickly as you can stop and notice how you constantly have
activated your vision beyond your vision. Notice the layers of expansion
you’ve gone into, as you’ve said yes to your manifestation beyond your
manifestation, and simply go ahead and now notice how you’ve constantly
upgraded your belief system, how you’ve constantly shifted what you
choose to believe about yourself, about manifestation. Notice how you
brought a version of you to the table that truly believes and knows at a
deep level that you are a master manifestor; that’s right. And then
continue to float all the way back to now only as quickly as you can
stop and notice your capacity to dance with your limitations, be human
with your limitations, see, with so much gratitude and curiosity, any
fear and doubt and self-limiting beliefs and stories and worrying about
the “how.” Any of your old limits which came up to the surface in your
future, notice how you now dance with them; notice how you play with
them; notice how you allow yourself to move forward in spite of them.
Take a look at how you chose to alchemize the fear; take a look at how
you chose to release the power self-sabotage used to have over you; take
a look at how you chose to constantly upgrade your belief system, to
bring a more powerful version of you to the table. Take a look at the
work you did in order to release your “how” addiction and come into an
even greater place of surrender. Go ahead and notice how you did the
work to clear resistance from your body, shifting, clearing,
alchemizing, transmuting any microtraumas or larger traumas that were
stuck in your body; go ahead and notice your new connection to your
physical layer of being, and notice how you now listen to your body and
work with it to help shift and clear and upgrade the information within
it. That’s right, good. And go ahead and float back all the way back to
now only as quickly as you can stop and notice how you are constantly
working on your energetic field using your new tools to shift and
upgrade the energetic structures, allowing your energetic field to come
into a constant state of purity, allowing your system to truly become a
vibrational energetic match for what you are looking to call in; notice
those shifts. Notice your recalibrations with your identity, the full
and complete embodiment of your highest self, and go ahead and notice
your newfound connection with your inner child, that little girl or that
little boy within you, and go ahead and simply notice how instead of
being in conflict with them, they’re now on your team; you’re listening
to them; you’re listening to this inner child within you and notice how
you’re now giving them exactly what they need. That’s right; good. And
go ahead and gently float all the way back to now only as quickly as you
can stop and notice how you became a master at releasing old timelines
that no longer served you. Go ahead and notice how you shifted, coded,
and recalibrated your relationship with time, and go ahead and notice
your innate frequency of knowing that you chose to bring to the table in
your day-to-day life. Go ahead and notice the full and complete
embodiment of the frequency of gratitude that you learned how to import
from your future in order for you to activate it and embody it right
here and right now. That’s right. Go ahead and notice your commitment to
the 80%; go ahead and notice the aligned action that you chose to take
in your life from a deep frequency of knowing and a deep frequency of
gratitude. Notice your manifestation rituals that you committed to and
completed each and every single day. Notice how as a master manifestor,
you brought such a powerful epic version of you to the table, and notice
how you chose to show up in your future, integrated, using these tools
for your focus points and your manifestations, all whilst knowing and
remembering it is done; it is done; it is done. That’s right; good. And
continue to gently float all the way back to now, until you are hovering
above now, and before you come down into now, go ahead and take one more
look at your future. Go ahead and see, feel, or know that you are
witnessing all of these moments in time in your future, all the way out
to that exact moment in time where your larger manifestation will be
manifested on or before that specific moment in time, and notice all of
those elements, all of those integrations, all of those upgrades, wow.
Notice how divine your future looks; this is your future; this is the
future you get to say yes to; this is the future that you are absolutely
deserving and worthy of; this is the future of a master manifestor. And
with that deep sense of knowing and remembrance, go ahead and gently
drop down, down into now, back into your body, breathing through your
lungs right now with so much gratitude as every single cell of your
being begins to remember who you are. “I remember who I am. I remember
who I am. I remember who I am. My manifestations are done; they are
done; they are done. I am manifestation. I am manifestation. I am
manifestation.” That’s right. Grounding, anchoring, solidifying all of
this within your system, allowing all of these shifts and upgrades and
tools and layers of transformation to grow roots within your field,
solidifying themselves into place in your consciousness through every
single cell of your being, and requesting that any continued layers of
integration, transformations, shifts, and recalibrations take place and
continue 24 hours a day, seven days a week, until they are fully
stabilized, integrated, actualized, embodied, and complete, and may they
be run at the highest frequency that your system is able to easily
stabilize, integrate, and embody, and may these upgrades take place with
ease, with grace, and with flow. That’s right. Good, taking a deep
moment of gratitude, thanking your guides, always here with you, always
one thought away; thank you so much for showing up, for supporting us
when we know it and when we don’t. We love you; we appreciate you; thank
you. And taking a moment of gratitude for yourself, for the divine
manifestor that you are. Taking a deep moment of gratitude for your own
inner commitment, for being here, for saying yes, for listening to your
soul, for upgrading and shifting at such a deep level for yourself and
your life and your manifestations, and ultimately, so that you can live
your best life ever and truly leave this world a better place. I have so
much love and gratitude for you; I am so proud of you. Thank you so much
for showing up, for doing this work, for doing it on your terms exactly
as it gets to look like for you. I love you; I accept you; I honor you,
and I celebrate you for the divine manifestor that you are. Allowing
yourself to breathe through your heart, coming back into your breath,
back into this beautiful state, recording this state, celebration of
integration, of gratitude, and of manifestation as your natural state.
It is done; it is done; it is done. And when you are ready, you can
gently integrate all of this and begin to open your eyes. Welcome back.
I’m celebrating you so deeply. Thank you so much for being here. Thank
you so much for saying yes. Thank you so much for sticking with this,
even when it got hard, even when it got confusing, even when it felt
like it was too much; here you are; here you are. And I’m so excited to
celebrate you with the Tribe; I’m so excited to celebrate you publicly
as well, in all your greatness, in all your manifestations, in all of
your shifts and upgrades and transformations. Manifestation is a
lifestyle; it’s a way of being, and you’re just getting started. The
real manifestation starts now; the real ceremony starts now; the real
activation starts now after this Quest, after this lesson, after this
piece of soul work. This is the real game we get to now play, and one
thing I know for sure is that the more you say yes to recalibrating
yourself from within, from remembering that you are a master manifestor,
and the more that you say yes to aligning to your own manifestations,
the more we get to change this world together, the happier the world
gets, the more fulfilled the world gets, and the more on purpose we all
get. So I want to hear from you for your piece of soul work that now
follows this activation, what are you celebrating right now? What are
you celebrating after this Quest? I want you to celebrate it in the
group and the Tribe, and I want you to celebrate it publicly ’cause I
want to see it. I want to celebrate you; I want to share your
breakthroughs; I want you to allow yourself to be witnessed in your
celebration, witnessed in your breakthroughs, witnessed in your divine
manifestations. So please, when you do this on social media publicly,
tag me; tag Mindvalley; we want you to be witnessed by the world. One
final piece of soul work before we say goodbye: if you feel called and
if it feels aligned, you can repeat this Quest and start again from
lesson number one, and you can do this focusing on a different piece of
manifestation, or you can do this totally focused on a different area of
your life. You could keep going and going with this and continuously
focus on different areas of your life every time; then I can only
imagine what your life is going to look like. And if you’re doing this,
dive in again; show up fully for this again. If you repeat this Quest, I
promise you, you will hear things that you will swear I didn’t say
before. You will notice things, and you’ll think that Mindvalley’s added
them in. No. You just weren’t ready to hear them; you just hadn’t
unlocked a part of your own consciousness that was ready to receive that
upgrade specifically. I promise you, the second time at least that you
go through this is going to be even more potent and even more powerful
than your first time. So if you’re up for it, let’s go again. I’ll see
you on lesson number one, and if you feel like you also want to breathe
and integrate, because this has been a lot, that’s perfect as well.
Thank you so much for being here; this has been a powerful and potent
journey. Please keep tagging me and celebrating me in your
breakthroughs, in your transformations, in your manifestations. I want
to hear about your magic; I want to hear about your miracles; I want to
see your daily manifestation rituals; let’s share in this together. It
has been an honor and a privilege to be your sister in this journey of
manifestation. I love you. I celebrate you, and whenever we get to hug
each other in person, I’m excited for that moment. I love you so much,
and remember, you absolutely can have it all.

LESSON 27: Meditation - Integrate Everything: Drop Into the Celebration Frequency

- Sit or light in a comfortable position, allowing yourself to close your eyes and turn inward right now. That's right. Beautiful. Now from this place, go ahead and go ground into your breath. Breathing in love and gratitude. Breathing out anything that doesn't serve you right now. Beautiful. As you allow yourself to gently lean into your intention, your intention to activate and integrate all of the pieces of all of the soul work that you have gone so deep on during this quest, may they be activated and integrated and assimilated into your life and into your reality. With ease, with grace and with flow. Good. Go ahead and allow a red laser beam to shoot down from your tailbone all the way down, anchoring you, grounding you, solidifying you into place, and simultaneously allowing a golden laser beam of light to shoot up through your crown. Connecting you right now to your unique soul star, allowing you to be guided, grounded, present, protected, and supported heaven on earth. Embodied right here, right now as you surround yourself with a ball of golden, white, white, beautiful. Requesting any energies, vibrations, or frequencies that are not yours and not of the highest. Drop, dissolve and clear out of your system, purifying your field right now as you lean even deeper and deeper into your intention. That's right. Taking a moment to call in your divine guidance beings of light of the highest vibration divinely assigned to you, divinely assigned to assisting you with your intention of deeply integrating all of this powerful work. That's right. Good. Beautiful. Now from this place and this space, go ahead and float up above now. Float up out of your body and turn your focus and your attention out to your divine future. And gently begin to float out all the way out until you float that exact moment in time, that moment in time that you know very well. Now that you decree or declare that your larger manifestation be manifested into your life on or before this specific moment in time. And when you were there hovering just above this event just before this event, looking down on this event, go ahead and look down into that event and simply notice what's going on. Notice how good it feels. Notice the frequency knowing. Notice the gratitude. Notice how happy you look and feel. Notice what you're saying to yourself in that moment as you remember that this manifestation has been anchored, locked, solidified, coded within your system. It is done. It is done. It is done. That's right. Beautiful. And from this place, this space of deep knowing and deep gratitude from this place and this frequency gently float back to now only as quickly as you can. Stop and notice all of the events in your future shift and reevaluate themselves in light of your future larger manifestation that has been anchored and solidified and grounded into your future. Notice what is different in your future. Now notice what has shifted in your future now in order to support the full and complete manifestation of your divine intention. With ease, with grace and with flow. That's right. Beautiful. Notice how you constantly are now attuned to the 80% going deep into your internal reality and notice how you take action on the 20% but from a different frequency. Good. Go ahead and notice out in your future how committed you've been to the power of 2%. Notice the compounding effect that has happened and rippled through your life from your divine commitment of choosing to believe just 2% more in your own capacity of choosing to take just 2% more aligned action of choosing to accelerate your results and watch them compound. Compound, compound. That's right. Notice how you've constantly attuned yourself to be in a frequency of surrendered manifestation. Notice how you now in your future have the consciousness and awareness to catch when you are attempting to control the process, attempting to go into manufactured manifestation. Notice how you catch that. See that, recalibrate that and shift and expand and open into a state once again of surrendered manifestation. Good. Continue to float back all the way back to now only as quickly as you can. Stop and notice how you have constantly realigned to your true, authentic vision. Notice how you have said yes to this vision. Spent time with this vision. Lift and breathe and and burst this vision through you. Notice how you are connected to this vision with such crystal clarity at such a deep layer. That's it. And notice how through your connection to this vision, you have constantly raised your minimum standard, shifted your level of tolerance. Notice how you are no longer willing to tolerate anything less than the materialization and manifestation of this vision. That's right. Good. And continue to notice how you gently but constantly expand your capacity to receive. Notice how you've been able to allow even more frequencies and vibrations to come and be anchored into your energetic field. Gently increasing your energetic containers, allowing for your capacity to hold more of what you desire to be anchored, grounded and solidified into your system with ease and with grace. And notice how you constantly have expanded beyond your energetic limits. Opening them up, expanding them, saying yes to holding more light, holding more information so you can be in even greater alignment with your manifestations. That's right. Continue to float all the way back to now only as quickly as you can. Stop and notice how you constantly have activated your vision beyond your vision. Notice the layers of expansion you've gone into, as you've said yes to your manifestation beyond your manifestation. And simply go ahead and now notice how you've constantly upgraded your belief system. How you've constantly shifted what you choose to believe about yourself, about manifestation. Notice how you brought a version of you to the table that truly believes and knows at a deep level that you are a master manifester. That's right. And then continue to float all the way back to now only as quickly as you can. Stop and notice your capacity to dance with your limitations. Be human with your limitations. See with so much gratitude and curiosity, any fear and doubt. And and and self-limiting beliefs and stories and worrying about the how any of your old limits which came up to the surface in your future. Notice how you now dance with them. Notice how you play with them. Notice how you allow yourself to move forward in spite of them. Take a look at how you chose to alchemize the fear. Take a look at how you chose to release the power self-sabotage used to have over you. Take a look at how you chose to constantly upgrade your belief system to bring a more powerful version of you to the table. Take a look at the work you did in order to release your how addiction and come into an even greater place of surrender. Go ahead and notice how you did the work to declare resistance from your body. Shifting, clearing, alchemizing, transmuting any microtraumas or larger traumas that were stuck in your body. Go ahead and notice your new connection to your physical layer of being and notice how you now listen to your body and work with it to help shift and clear and upgrade the information within it. That's right. Good. And go ahead and float back all the way back to now. Only as quickly as you can. Stop and notice how you are constantly working on your energetic field. Using your new tools to shift and upgrade the energetic structures, allowing your energetic field to come into a constant state of purity, allowing your system to truly become a vibrational energetic match for what you are looking to call in. Notice those shifts. Notice your recalibrations with your identity, the full and complete embodiment of your highest self. And go ahead and notice your newfound connection with your inner child, that little girl or that little boy within you. And go ahead and simply notice how instead of being in conflict with them, they're now on your team. You are listening to them. You are listening to this inner child within you. And notice how you're now giving them exactly what they need. And that's right. Good. And go ahead and gently float all the way back to now. Only as quickly as you can. Stop and notice how you became a master at releasing old timelines that no longer served you. Go ahead and notice how you shifted, coded and recalibrated your relationship with Thai. And go ahead and notice your innate frequency of knowing that you chose to bring to the table in your day-to-day life. Go ahead and notice the full and complete embodiment of the frequency of gratitude that you learned how to import from your future in order for you to activate it and embody it right here, right now. That's right. Go ahead and notice your commitment to the 80%. Go ahead and notice the aligned action that you chose to take in your life from a deep frequency of knowing and a deep frequency of gratitude. Notice your manifestation rituals that you committed to and completed each and every single day. Notice how as a master manifester, you bought such a powerful epic version of you to the table. And notice how you chose to show up in your future integrated using these tools for your focus points and your manifestations all whilst knowing and remembering it is done. It is done. It is done. And that's right. Good. And continue to gently float all the way back to now until you are hovering above now. And before you come down into now, go ahead and take one more look at your future. Go ahead and see, feel or know that you are witnessing all of these moments in time, in your future, all the way out to that exact moment in time where your larger manifestation will be manifested on or before that specific moment in time. And notice all of those elements, all of those integrations, all of those upgrades. Wow. Notice how divine your future looks. This is your future. This is the future you get to say yes to. This is the future that you are absolutely deserving and worthy of. This is the future of a master manifesto. And with that deep sense of knowing and remembrance, go ahead and gently drop down, down into now back into your body, breathing through your lungs right now with so much gratitude as every single cell of your being begins to remember who you are. I remember who I am. I remember who I'm I remember who I'm, my manifestations are done. They're done. They're done. I am manifestation. I am manifestation. I am manifestation. That's right. Grounding, anchoring, solidifying all of this within your system, allowing all of these shifts and upgrades and tools and layers of transformation to grow roots within your field, solidifying themselves into place in your consciousness through every single cell of your being. Requesting that any continued layers of integration, transformations, shifts and recalibrations take place and continued 24 hours a day, seven days a week until they're fully stabilized, integrated, actualized, embodied, and complete. And may they be run at the highest frequency that your system is able to easily stabilize, integrate, and embody. And may these upgrades take place with ease, with grace and with flow. That's right. Good. Taking a deep moment of gratitude thinking. Your guides always here with you. Always one thought away, away. Thank you so much for showing up, for supporting us when we know it and when we don't. We love you. We appreciate you. Thank you. And taking a moment of gratitude for yourself, for the divine manifester that you are taking a deep moment of gratitude for your own inner commitment, for being here, for saying yes, for listening to your soul, for upgrading and shifting such a deep level for yourself and your life and your manifestations, and ultimately so that you can live your best life ever and truly leave this world a better place. I have so much love and gratitude for you. I am so proud of you. Thank you so much for showing up, for doing this work, for doing it on your terms exactly as it gets to look like for you. I love you. I accept you. I honor you, and I celebrate you for the divine manifesta that you are allowing yourself to breathe through your heart. Coming back into your breath, back into this beautiful state, recording, this state of celebration, of integration, of gratitude, and of manifestation as your natural state. It is done. It is done. It is done. And when you are ready, you can gently integrate all of this and begin to open your eyes.
