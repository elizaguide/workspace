PREPARATION 1: Welcome to the Silva Ultramind System

<v ->Welcome to the Silva Ultramind System. My name is Vishen Lakhiani,
I’m the founder of Mindvalley and if you’ve been using Mindvalley
products for the last decade or so you would probably recognize my name
and recognize my work, but what you may not know is that before I was
the founder of Mindvalley I was a Silva Ultramind instructor. And before
that I was a Silva Ultramind student. You see the Silva method has been
probably the most influential personal growth program in my life and it
influenced me to such a degree that it made me who I am. I am a product
of this product and that’s why the Silva Ultramind System holds such a
beautiful place in my heart. Now if you’ve been in personal growth you
may have heard of The Silva Method. The Silva Method reached the height
of it’s popularity in the 70s and 80s. It was the original personal
growth program in the United States. Jose Silva’s pioneering work in
mind science introduced people to concepts such as the alpha brain wave
level, the theta brain wave level. He proved without a doubt that any
human being can be trained to develop intuition to the point where they
could function psychically at the waking state. Prior to Jose Silva’s
work it was believed that only a few a rare individuals had the gift of
ESP. Jose Silva proved that everyone had it. And even before the word
meditation became trendy, Jose Silva was using his techniques to put
people into relaxed alpha and theta levels of mind. More on that later.
That allowed them to tap into these abilities. The Silva Method grew so
big and so popular in the 70s and 80s that in 1980s there were almost
$100 million worth of Silva tickets sold every single year to seminars
happening all around the world. And the graduates of The Silva Method
now number in the 10s of millions. To understand the power of The Silva
Method I probably have to share with you this story before I come to my
own. I’m sure you’ve heard of the book “Jonathan Livingston Seagull”. It
became one of the classic books in personal growth literature. The book
and it’s author Richard Bach became so popular that the book was
featured on the cover of “Time” magazine, but what people don’t know is
that Richard Bach, the author was having difficulty completing the final
chapters of the book, until he took a Silva Method class. In an
interview with “Harper’s Bazaar” magazine he said this, “that the Silva
Method class”helped him figure out and understand “the closing of that
book.” That book went on the sell millions of copies. It became a
personal growth classic and got featured on “Time” magazine. That is the
power of The Silva Method. Many other graduates including myself have
gone on to do remarkable things using the tools that Jose Silva
developed. Now The Silva Method reached the peak of it’s popularity in
the late 80s and then as Jose got older and eventually passed away in
1999 the method started to die out. The number of classes and seminars
started to dip, but something interesting happened. In around ’95 to ’96
Jose Silva on his death bed created an updated version of The Silva
Method. He called it the Silva Ultramind System. Now this is what
happened next. He wanted to get this updated method out, but there was
an established organization teaching the original Silva Method, the
original program that had been popularized by the hit book “Silva Mind
Control” published in the mid-70s. And the organization was not ready
for Jose’s latest work Silva Ultramind because it would disrupt some of
their regular business, so they decided to not let it out. Jose passed
Silva Ultramind to some of his nephews and close friends and they
decided to create the competing organization called Silva Ultramind. So
you have Silva Method, the original organization and Silva Ultramind.
Now this is where I stepped in. My association with The Silva Method
started in an interesting way. When I was 14 years old a Silva Method
book fell on my head. What happened was my dad never went to university,
he was a self-educated man and had this beautiful white bookshelf in his
room filled with all the books that changed his life. One of which was
The Silva Method book. Now as a kid I was really into sports, so I was
climbing my dad’s bookshelf, this was in the pre-internet days to pick
up a little book on exercise so I could get my exercise routine
together. Accidentally another book fell on my head that was The Silva
Method book. I picked it up, I browsed through a couple of pages, the
cover looked interesting and the book blew my mind, so I read it cover
to cover at the age of 14. That book got me started with meditation. I
would then meditate three times a day for 15 minutes each. Now back then
as a teenager I had serious acne and as you learn later in the course I
used a specific technique in the book to heal that acne. I’d had pimples
on my face. My nickname in high school was Pimple Face for five years.
It shattered my confidence, it didn’t make me feel good about myself,
I’d never been in a date with a girl and these pimples just really were
an unfortunate blow for a teenager with a really fragile sense of
self-esteem. But I read in that Silva book about how Jose Silva had
found that the skin was the organ that was most easy to influence with
the human mind. So I put in place the Silva technique from that book and
thought myself how to heal my skin. For five years I had pimples in five
weeks my acne disappeared for good. My face changed. All of a sudden I
had the confidence to truly step up as a teenager and show up in the
world in a different way and that was my love affair with Silva. That’s
how it really began. I went on to do some really remarkable things
manifesting some really cool dreams, but then when I moved to Michigan
to go to college as a young kid I got caught up in all of those other
things that young people get caught up in. I stopped my meditation
practice, back in the 90s it wasn’t cool to meditate, not as cool as it
is right now. Meditation was the last thing on the mind of an American
college student in the mid-90s and Silva fell by the wayside. And I
graduated into American society in 1999 when I moved to New York to take
a not for profit job. I barely graduated so my grades were not good, so
I didn’t have the best job options and finally it was 2001 that my life
started to collapse. I finally had a decent job, but then September,
11th hit and the company I was working for went bankrupt. I was cast out
on the street. I couldn’t afford rent. I was sleeping on a couch. Worse
I couldn’t afford car insurance and got into an accident and in the Bay
Area you needed a car to get around. And so I was in a broken state and
the only job I could get was a simple job where I had to pick up the
phone and dial lawyers and sell them software. I was a computer engineer
from the University of Michigan. I had this great degree, but here I was
in a miserable economy, in a miserable job trying to sell technology to
lawyers and I knew nothing about sales. And so I would pick up the phone
I’d interrupt the lawyer in the middle of their busy day and I would
hear more “fuck offs” then I would ever expect to hear in my life. I
remember getting on Google it was now around February, March 2002 and I
can’t remember what I typed in, but it was something along the line of
“please help me figure this out” or perhaps it was “why does my life
suck so bad” and I came across Silva Ultramind. It was now 2002 The
Silva Ultramind is a competitor organization to Silva Method run by
different members of his family had started to emerge and they were
having a few classes around the country. There was nothing in the Bay
Area so with the few dollars I had I booked a plane ticket flew to LA
and took the class. Funny thing was I was the only person who showed up
it just wasn’t popular back then. The instructor obviously disappointed
that she had one student ran me through the class in one day. I had a
compressed version of the class. All the beautiful memories of Silva
that I’d practiced as a teenager came back, but now with the advanced
Ultramind techniques. You see the original program was amazing, but now
I was learning the updated program with new ideas, new skills. One of
the key ideas in this updated program was waking psychic functioning.
The fact that you can access altered levels of mind and perceive
information that you otherwise should not have access to. So I finished
a class in LA, flew back to San Francisco and that very next week I
started back on my job. Now I’m an engineer and I approached sales back
then, even though I sucked at it, I approached in an a very empirical
manner. I knew the number of calls I had to book, the number of lawyers
that would tell me to “fuck off” versus who would actually give me a
chance to speak for more than 10 minutes. I knew the number of lawyers I
would close on a sale which was hardly any, but I had these numbers. So
I decided to try the Silva technique. And now back then we would have to
go to the San Francisco Public Library, check out the yellow pages of
the tower tree we were assigned and call every lawyer from A to Z. My
tower tree was San Antonio, Texas. So I opened up the yellow pages for
San Antonio, Texas and I started calling every lawyer, but rather than
call them from A to Z I went to my alpha level of mind, which I learned
in the Silva program and I ran my hands down the phone book and I would
get an impulse of who to call. I called the lawyers for which I had an
impulse and my sales closing rate doubled overnight. So the very next
week I was ecstatic and I decided to use other techniques that I had
learned in the class. Fox example the three scenes technique that you’re
going to learn as well. My sales doubled again. I used other techniques
such as the mental video technique my sales doubled again. In the next
three months I got promoted four times and I was 26 years old and I was
made Vice President of Sales of this company. Even though four months
before I had hardly any experience in sales. Silva completely shifted
the way my mind was functioning. My career exploded. I was sent to New
York on September 11th, 2002, the anniversary of September 11th by my
boss because he wanted me to open up his office in New York on the
anniversary of September 11th, so that he could help contribute to jobs
in the city. I use Silva and I found the perfect office. Again, I used
certain techniques that to program that I would have the most amazing
office space and the space I got was Chelsea Market where today’s
YouTube Studios sit. Another huge success from The Silva Method. I was
guided into this amazing space. For those of you who don’t know Chelsea
Market is one of the most valuable buildings in New York. Google bought
it a few years ago for almost $2.5 billion, but back then in 2002
September I got to use the Silva technique to program that I would have
the most amazing office and it was in Chelsea Market where YouTube
Studio sits today. So my life completely transformed. Now I stayed with
that company for 18 months before I felt this pull. When you do Silva
you’re really tapped in and it said I need to do something of my own. I
needed to leave this company and so I decided to leave and I felt this
pull to become a Silva instructor. I never forgot the fact that when I
attended my first Silva class it had changed my life, it had transformed
my world, but I was the only student there and that disturbed me. Why
didn’t more people know about it? So I became a Silva instructor to
spread the word. As I was teaching Silva Ultramind what happened was
being an engineer, I started building the websites to get people into my
classes. These websites became so successful other instructors came to
me and said, “Can you help me fill my Silva class?” And then the Silva
Ultramind organization came to me and said, “Can you help us sell our
CDs?” and that was the birth of Mindvalley. I cracked the code to
building a personal growth platform that could get millions of people
enrolled in seminars and programs and that is how the Mindvalley today,
the world’s most innovative personal growth company was born. Now I
continued representing Silva Ultramind for several years then the parent
Silva company, Silva Method came to me and I started representing them.
I built up the core programs for The Silva Method. Everything went well
for several years. Mindvalley helped take Silva from being in the red to
becoming in the black again. And Silva helped give me the tools to
channel the ideas to create Mindvalley. It’s now been 15 years since
that time and I was honored when the family of Jose Silva asked me to be
the new face for Silva Ultramind, to give this program an overhaul, to
bring it on to Mindvalley’s platform and to get it out to the world. And
that’s where we are today. So this was your first warm up video. I
wanted to give you the back story to understand how The Silva Method,
Silva Ultramind and Mindvalley all became part of the same thing and how
we are all coming together to take Jose Silva’s profound work and share
it with millions of people everywhere. I’ll see you tomorrow for warm up
two.

PREPARATION 2: About Jose Silva

<v ->“Anything with the name of Jose Silva as the author”has my vote
before I open to page one,” Wayne Dyer. Jose Silva was an incredible
man, and I remember, he was my idol as a teenager, because his book
completely changed my life, but Jose’s story is absolutely fascinating.
I won’t be surprised if it gets made into a movie sometime. Jose Silva
was born in the tiny border town of Laredo. There’s Laredo in Texas, and
Nuevo Laredo on the Mexican border, and this little border town is where
there’s a massive exchange of goods and people between the United States
and Mexico. Jose was really a product of both countries. Now, one day,
while being part of the U.S. Army, Jose Silva was going through a
routine Army mental health checkup, and that’s where he noticed that
there was a psychologist who was assigned to ask him questions. It was
just a routine thing, but he grew fascinated with psychology, and he
started picking up and reading more and more books on psychology. That
led him to study hypnosis, which fascinated him. You see, Jose Silva, as
a side job, was a radio and TV repairman. He had a little shop repairing
radios and televisions in Laredo, Texas. Now he knew, as a repairman for
radios and TVs, that if you take a wire, and you increase the resistance
of that wire, less electricity can flow to it. If you reduce the
resistance of the wire, more electricity flows through the wire. It’s
basic high school physics, right? But understanding psychology and
hypnosis, he started to wonder is there a form of resistance in the
brain? What if we reduced the resistance in the brain? Can our brains
operate more efficiently? Now, the path to reducing that resistance, he
called it programming or centering, so he would use a specific
hypnotherapy script to get people to relax. It was combination of
hypnotherapy that guided meditation, except that back then in the ‘60s
the word guided meditation wasn’t really used, so in his writings he
tends to refer to it as hypnotherapy. Now, he went on further, but the
science of biofeedback had started to become popular. Back then
scientists knew there were four levels of brain frequency: beta, or the
waking level, alpha, or more relaxed level, theta, or slightly sleepier
level, and delta, deep sleep. Jose wondered, “Is the brain moving into
alpha and theta”a way of reducing that resistance?” Now, Jose had 10
kids, and he wanted his kids to do better in school, as most parents
did, so he came up with the brilliant idea of experimenting on his
children, so he made his kids guinea pigs, and he started experimenting
with his kids. Now, I know that sounds bizarre today, but this was the
’60s. Certain things were more acceptable, so Jose Silva would put his
kids into a guided meditation, and then read them important elements
from their school textbooks. He found that they could remember better
when they were in this alpha or slightly relaxed level of mind with
their eyes closed, and then he would ask them questions, and they could
recall better, okay? Now, you’ll find that too. When you learn this
program, you will learn how to go into the alpha level of mind and
increase your reading and your memory speed. Now, we know this today. If
you can move your mind to the alpha level of mind, the relaxed level,
which you will learn in this program, you can remember and retrieve
information faster, so that was what Jose was investigating, but then
something curious happened. He was experimenting with one of his
children. I believe it was his daughter Isabel, and he would ask Isabel
a question from her book. Let’s say it was a history book, and Isabel
would answer, but the curious thing that happened was Isabel started
answering as Jose Silva formulated the question in his mind. Before he
could verbally speak the question, she would answer. In other words, he
might think the question, “Who was the 16th president of the United
States?” But before he could verbally say it, Isabel would answer. This
rattled him. What was going on? He was a devout Christian. He couldn’t
figure out how his daughter was able to so-called read his mind, so he
wrote to Dr. J.B. Rhine of Duke University. J.B. Rhine was the famous
doctor who pioneered research in extrasensory perception, and he asked
J.B. Rhine, he told J.B. Rhine, “I think I figured out a way”to train
children to be intuitive.” J.B. Rhine dismissed it. He said, “No,
intuition is real,”but your daughter was probably intuitive to begin
with.” Jose Silva disagreed, so he trained all his kids. Then he trained
the neighbor’s kids, and then the neighbors started getting fascinating.
What is this man doing to our children? They were scared a little, but
at the same time their kids’ grades were going up, so the neighbors
came, and they said, “Jose, can you teach us how to do this?” So he
started teaching little classes in Laredo, Texas. Now, what he found
that it wasn’t just intuition that was emerging from accessing these
states. People were seeing pain disappear. They were seeing their
happiness levels go up, and there was this one chap who had migraines
for the longest time, and after learning from Jose Silva, his migraines
disappeared. He wrote about it in the local newspaper, and the next
class was completely swamped. The Silva Method was born, and it spread
across America. Soon it was being used by the Chicago White Sox. It was
being used by famous celebrities of the time like opera singer
Marguerite Piazza. It had come into mainstream America, and “The New
York Times,” “The Washington Post” featured articles on the Silva
Method, and that was how the Silva Method was born. Jose went on to
write a book which sold well over a million copies, and the Silva
Method, as it spread globally, ended up graduating some 10 million
students over three to four decades, but the story doesn’t end there.
There was a point in Jose’s research before the Silva Method exploded,
and he found a way to actually turn it into a viable business. When he
found that the work he was doing was so fulfilling, but it wasn’t making
him any money, and he decided that he had to give it up. He had to go
back to just running his radio business. One night, he tells in his
biography, he grew so frustrated that he flung his psychology book
across the room and decided to go to sleep, promising himself that he
would never dabble in this again because he needed to earn a living.
That night he had a weird dream, and he said he saw a figure of the
Mother Mary. Now, Jose was a Christian, and he said he doesn’t think
that it was anything to do with the Mother Mary. It was just his
representation of godliness. In other words, if you were a Buddhist or a
Muslim, you might see your representation, but the funny thing was the
Mother Mary gave him a four-digit number, so he wondered, “What is this
four-digit number?” And the first thought that came to him was, “There
must be a car with that license plate,”and I need to meet the person who
owns that car,” so Jose Silva decided to keep his mind open for any car
in Laredo with that four-digit number. Now, as it happened, he was going
to his radio repair business, and a friend came to him and said, “Hey,
Jose,”I’m about to swing south across the border to Mexico “to pick up
some goods.”You want to come with me?” Jose said, “Sure, I’m not having
a busy day.”I’ll come with you,” so they got in the car together to
drive across the border to Mexico, and as they were driving across the
border to Mexico, Jose told his friend about the four-digit number in
the dream. They went to this shop to buy goods in Mexico, and as Jose
was picking up his goods, his friend called him over, and his friend
said, “Jose, look, they’re selling a lottery ticket here.”Isn’t this the
number that came in your dream?” And it was. Jose bought that lottery
ticket, and he ended up winning $10,000. That gave him the amount of
money he needed to continue his research. $10,000 back then is almost
$50,000 today. That’s a lot of money. It allowed him to go back to his
research, but it also puzzled him. He said, “Look at the weirdness that
happened.”It wasn’t just a dream. “My mind didn’t just give me a
number.”It showed me an image to reinforce “that this was coming from a
higher power.”It then caused a synchronicity to happen “where a friend
came to invite me to Mexico”because that winning lottery number “wasn’t
on the U.S. side; It was in the Mexican side.”Another coincidence
happened “when my friend happened to see the lottery number.” Jose
himself thought it was a car license plate number. All of these strung
together. It was like a ripple, a warping of reality that gave him the
cash infusion needed to take the Silva Method forward, and he realized
he was on to something. Now, this is an important lesson to you. What
you’re going to learn here is not just information downloads. What
you’re going to see is that, and this is harder to explain, but I
experience it time and time again in my life, synchronicities,
coincidences, luck, moving you towards where you need to go. This is the
power of the Silva Method, and this is what this program is going to
take you through. Jose developed this process from 1953 to 1999. That’s
almost 50 years of refinement and fine-tuning. He was a guy who never
stopped. He continuously refined the program. The work that you’re
getting emerged shortly before he died, so this is his highest-level
work, Silva Ultramind, and he tested these ideas on millions of people.
Every word you hear in this program was put there for a reason by Jose
Silva. In this program you’re going to go through not just lectures, but
you’re going to go through programming scripts where Jose Silva’s words,
read by me, are going to program your mind with different abilities.
Every word in that script is there for a reason, and the results are
powerful. This program doesn’t just shape you at a cognitive outer brain
level. You’re going deep into your subconscious and shaping you at a
subconscious level. That is where the power of Silva lies. A lot of
people talk about meditation. A lot of people talk about visualization.
This was the most structured meditation process I’ve ever learned. This
provided me with some of the ideas I used to develop my later 6-Phase
Meditation, which is used by so many elite sports people and performers.
The Silva Method is also the most structured method I’ve ever found to
develop intuition and to apply this in day-to-day live. What you’re
going to learn here is truly one of the most powerful programs ever
developed in the entire field of personal growth, so thank you for
joining me for the second warmup video, and I’ll see you tomorrow for
warmup three.

====================

PREPARATION 3: The Quest Design

<v ->What you’re going to learn here is a form of meditation that’s
different from any other forms of meditation. If you look at meditation,
there is passive meditation and active, or sometimes called dynamic
meditation. Passive meditation is about introspection. Active meditation
is using that introspection to go out there and shake the world and
rattle the world and move towards your goals. Both are important. Silva
is active meditation. You are never told to clear your mind. In the
words of Mindvalley teacher Emily Fletcher, “Asking someone to clear
their mind during meditation”is like asking someone to stop their heart
from beating.” In Silva, you don’t clear your mind, you let whatever
thoughts come to you and you channel those thoughts to what’s making a
better world. If you have a problem, you turn that problem into a
project to resolve. It could be a problem at work that you want to
resolve, it could be a family or a health problem you want to resolve.
You turn it into a project and you channel your mind to bring that
project into reality by leveraging intuition and your ability to bend
reality. This is what makes Silva so powerful. Think of this as the
concept of The Buddha and The Badass. The Buddha is that part of you
that is your inner spiritual power. But you don’t just want to be The
Buddha. This is not India thousands of years ago. We live in the modern
world, we have careers, we have jobs, we have missions, we have things
we need to bring to the world. The Badass is that part of you that isn’t
going to just live in today’s world, it’s going to make that world
better. You have to converge The Buddha and The Badass into one. That’s
what Silva Ultramind teaches you. Now, the course is going to go through
an interesting structure. There are going to be lectures where you’re
going to learn some powerful advanced techniques and principles of
personal growth, and then you’re going to go through programming where
you will be programmed or your mind will be programmed at a deep level
of meditation to bring out new abilities of intuition, of manifesting,
of deep relaxation. So there are 10 programming modules in this program.
We’ll go lecture, programming, lecture, programming, lecture,
programming, over a span of around a month. Now, the 10 programming
modules are broken into two types, there are centering exercises and
projection exercises. Centering exercises are designed to make you go
deep into a deep state of relaxation. Projection exercises are a whole
different thing. They’re designed to help you project your
consciousness, your awareness, across time and space to perceive
information that would otherwise be unknown to you. The five projection
exercises look like this. You’re going to start by projecting yourself
into the living room of your home. Fairly easy. You’re going to imagine
the living room of your home and Jose’s script, read by me, is going to
guide you through a series of different practices to do in your relaxed
meditative state. You’re then going to project into something a little
bit more complex, into different types of metals. Then, into something
even more complex, a plant. Then, into animal life. Then, into a human
being who needs healing. That final projection is where you learn to
perceive abnormalities of health in other human beings and to apply
healing on other human beings. That is one of the most powerful uses of
intuition to receive information. And then, using your mind to shift,
and then, reality, in this case, to get healing. It’s going to be a
fascinating journey. Now, traditional Mindvalley programs happen over
around a month in 20 minutes per day. This program, because of the
nature of the projection exercises and because I wanted to stay true to
Jose Silva’s work and his scripts, sometimes might go on to 30 minutes.
Okay, so be prepared to spend a little bit more time, but know that when
you come out of these projection exercises, you are going to feel so
magnified, so refreshed, you can go back to work and do more in less
time. So it’s actually buying you time. There’s an old saying that
practice makes perfect. I don’t believe that. You can meditate for years
and you can still be a sloppy meditator. What you’re going to learn here
is a perfect way of practicing, going into deeper levels of mind,
tapping into altered states, leveraging these tools to do remarkable
things in the world. Perfect practice makes perfect. And as you go
through this, you will be transformed consciously as you gain new
knowledge and ideas, but also subconsciously, as these programming
techniques shift the capabilities of your subconscious mind. This is
truly one of the most powerful subconscious programming tools I’ve ever
encountered. Thank you for joining us for Warmup 3. Tomorrow, in Warmup
4, we’re going to go deeper on the concept of brain wave states.

====================

PREPARATION 4: Altered States and Brain Waves

<v ->Welcome to Warmup Four. Today, we’re going to talk about one of the
core principles of the Silva Method, which is the levels of brainwaves.
So today, we call these Altered States. My good friend and Mindvalley
author Steven Kotler says that, “In most of modern society,”we are
trained to exist in one state of consciousness.” And that is the beta or
waking frequency. Now this is actually something you can measure, and
hospitals do this all the time when they hook you up to an EEG machine,
an electroencephalograph. The beta frequency is where your brain is
pulsing at around 14 to 21 cycles per second. This is the frequency that
in the modern world, we are trained to use, but if you actually look at
many indigenous cultures, indigenous cultures do not exist in a
monophasic type of awareness. They exist in polyphasic awareness. In
other words, when you’re polyphasic, you are leveraging different states
of being. For example, I spent some time in the Ecuadorian rainforest
with the Achuar tribe. This is a dream tribe, and we find dream tribes
in many rainforests around the world. The interesting thing about dream
tribes is the Achuar communicate with each other during their dreams.
They wake up at 4:00 a.m., gather around a campfire, and talk about what
messages came to them in their dreams. The Achuar don’t just discuss
their dreams, they communicate through dreams. Two members of the Achuar
may be across the rainforest, they have no telephone, they have no way
of communicating, they were only discovered by the modern world in 1979,
but they’re able to communicate across distance through dreams. It is a
fascinating thing that what’s going on there is that they are tapping
into the delta and theta level frequencies to do this. This is what we
mean by polyphasic. Now what we are learning in modern science is that
when we move to be able to tap into the alpha level of mind, we gain
incredible benefits. Now what is the alpha level of mind? It is the
brainwave frequency that you go into when you meditate. So sometimes
people are confused by meditation. What you’re really doing when you
meditate is you’re slowing down your brainwave frequency from beta,
which is 14 to 21, to alpha, which is seven to 14. That is meditation.
And all the benefits of meditation are coming when you slow down. This
is what Jose Silva was trying to do. In Silva classes, this diagram is
often shared. You will see that the beta frequency which is the center
column, is 14 to 21 cycles per second. This is the physical world,
sight, smell, sound, taste, touch. When you go to the alpha, or what is
called your center, hence the world centering exercise, your brainwaves,
if you were to measure them, are operating at seven to 14. Now your
alpha or your center is the mental world. It’s subjective, it’s ESP.
There is no time or space in your mental world, this could be one of the
reasons why phenomenon like psychic ability is sometimes observed. This
is one of the reasons why Jose Silva saw that number that caused him to
win the lottery. But you can slow down your brainwaves further, you can
slow it down to the theta level, which is four to seven cycles per
second, and theta is associated with strong psychic ability. You can
slow down even further to delta. This is the level of sleep. And delta
is associated with connection to higher intelligence. Now, most people
are asleep at delta, but what you will learn in this program is how to
access not just alpha and theta, but how to go all the way to delta. The
first three exercises of this program are going to guide you into alpha.
The next three exercises are going to guide you to theta, and you will
also learn techniques to do before you go to bed to leverage the delta
level of mind. So, once again, beta is the outer conscious level, alpha
is the inner conscious level, delta is unconscious, but there are ways
to leverage delta to solve problems, and for this you will learn the
technique called the MentalVideo Technique which is the most important
technique in this entire program. That said, know that in 1993, another
brainwave frequency was discovered by researchers at Harvard. It’s
called the gamma frequency, and they observed it studying monks who had
been meditating for decades. Gamma is when your brain is moving above 21
cycles per second, it’s a highly rapid frequency. But today, scientists
are still not fully in agreement on what exactly is going on in gamma,
so for the purpose of this program, we will not be discussing gamma. But
know that brainwave frequencies are far more complex than that specific
approach. What we’re doing here is just a simplification, so you have an
idea of what we’re going to be doing with you in the program as we
reference alpha, theta, and delta. The good thing about Silva is that,
even if you just use the centering exercise and meditate and go to your
center, the range of benefits you get is extraordinary. For example,
check out this curve. This is from Daniel Goleman and Richard J.
Davidson’s book “Altered Traits”. You can see that beginning in the
1970s, research in meditation started taking place, but the research
went up exponentially after the 2010s. Meditation has exploded all
across the world because now science has shown a remarkable area of
research on the benefits you get from meditation. So you will get those
same benefits doing this program, but we’ll go beyond just basic
meditation to teach you active meditation so you can use altered states,
alpha, theta, delta, to shift reality. So you’ve now learned all the
basics to get you started with the Silva Altered Minds System. I can’t
wait to see you on the chosen start date for this program. Get ready for
one of the most incredible journeys of your life, and I thank Silva for
everything I’ve built in life. This was really my starting program in
personal growth, and I don’t mean starting as in basic, it was just so
advanced, it completely blew my mind, and it made me who I am. The fact
that I today get to say I run a company that’s about to go public, the
fact that we have an office that was in Inc Magazine as one of the top
10 most beautiful offices in the world, the fact that I have my own
festivals around the world, and I have a job that makes me so happy
getting out of bed every morning. It’s because all of it started in
here, and I used the Silva method to guide me to making the right
decisions, and then I knew what those decisions were, I was able to use
these tools to shift reality to move me towards these visions. And
you’re going to experience the same. So thank you so much for joining us
here, and I want to ask a small favor of you. If you have taken a Silva
Method class in the past, and you’re now coming here to go further in

Week 1: The Mental Screen, Projection of Consciousness & Intuition

====================

DAY 1: Mastering Posture and Style

-   [Instructor] The greatest discovery of the 19th century was not in
    the realm of the physical sciences that the power of the
    subconscious mind touched by faith. Any individual can tap into an
    eternal reservoir of power that will enable them to overcome any
    problem that may arise. All weaknesses can be overcome bodily
    healing, financial independence, spiritual awakening, prosperity
    beyond your wildest dreams. This is the Super Structure of Happiness
    by William James, welcome to day one. My name is Vishen Lakhiani and
    I’m going to be your guide and your teacher on this 28 day journey
    to take you into the most advanced trainings developed by the
    legendary mind pioneer Jose Silva. Let me just share with you a
    little bit about that quote I read earlier. That quote was by
    William James. Now William James was the guy known as the father of
    American psychology. He was one of the most incredible minds of his
    era but notice what he said, about the power of the subconscious
    mind touched by faith. Indeed, that is what this program is about.
    What you’re going to be learning in this program is essentially just
    that, how to activate the power of your subconscious mind touch by
    faith to dramatically transform every aspect of your life. Now let’s
    talk about meditation. Is this a meditation program? The answer is
    yes and no. You see, one of the things you’re going to rapidly learn
    in this training is that there are two types of meditation. Silva
    called what he was teaching, “Dynamic Meditation”, and remember when
    Silva started teaching this in the 50s and the 60s, meditation
    wasn’t a thing. In America it was viewed as something from the east.
    It was viewed as weird or taboo. Today, as of last year according to
    the book, “Altered Traits”, 44% of American Fortune 100 companies
    offer meditation training to their employees, but back then, in the
    50s and 60s meditation was just too bizarre a topic for Silva to
    associate himself with. So this is a meditation program, but the
    style of meditation that you’re going to learn is extremely
    different. Juan Silva, Jose’s brother, called this “Dynamic
    Meditation”. You see, it’s not about clearing your mind. It’s not
    about focusing on your breath, rather, it’s about using your mind to
    deliberately look at problems that you might be experiencing in life
    and make those problems disappear, and it’s about using your mind to
    create new evolutions of your life so you can make the planet better
    off for every living creature. This is the essence of dynamic
    meditation. What you are learning is essentially a style of
    meditation that originated in the West on the Texas, Mexican border.
    So there is ancient Indian meditation ancient Chinese meditation,
    and then I guess you could call this Tex Max meditation, but I’m
    kidding of course, this meditation is one of the most powerful tools
    you can apply to the modern western world, because we no longer live
    in an era where we have the time to sit under a tree or a cave and
    become a hermit. We live in an era of smartphones, of incredible
    technology that permeates our world. We live in a world where we
    have a focus we have a mission, we have a career, we have a job and
    all of us are busy beyond belief. Dynamic meditation is not a style
    that tells you to spend countless hours in endless introspection,
    rather, it’s about embracing this busy creative world we are in,
    embracing the idea that you have a job, that you are a mom or a dad,
    that you have a busy social life and using your inner states to
    magnify your joy, your bliss, your freedom in all of these different
    structures of your life. It makes you better at work. It doesn’t
    distract from your work. It makes you better at your relationships
    without taking time away. Dynamic meditation is different from
    passive meditation. It’s not just about going within, rather, it’s
    about going within to use these spiritual forces within us to help
    us mold, heal and craft our outer world it makes you better at your
    job. It unleashes your intuition so you have more inspiration and
    creative ability in your work. It allows you to solve problems
    rapidly. So your world, your career, your relationship, your family,
    your life becomes more joyful, more blissful and more aligned with
    your biggest dreams for yourself. So this is the difference between
    passive meditation and dynamic meditation. Now Emily Fletcher, the
    meditation teacher on Mindvalley puts it this way. The point of
    meditation is not to get good at meditation. The point of meditation
    is to get good at life. Please remember this because what you’re
    going to learn in this program is not about getting you better at
    meditation, it’s about getting you better at being you, at life, and
    so the tools here are not going to ask you to shut down your
    thoughts or focus on your heartbeat or your breathing, rather,
    you’re going to pick every thought that might be a thought that
    excites you, maybe a goal or a vision or a thought that disturbs you
    a problem or a stress in your life, and you’re going to do something
    with that. You’re going to heal the problems and stresses and you’re
    going to magnify the vision so you move faster towards them. This is
    how dynamic meditation is different. Many entrepreneurs, people who
    are highly creative, who have an active mind, who have not been able
    to meditate through passive techniques or just given up out of
    boredom say that this is the style of meditation that resonates with
    them most. So let’s get you prepared. Now, I want you to just sit in
    your chair or wherever you are right now and just pay attention to
    your body. What do you feel? Odds are If you’re like most people, as
    soon as I ask you to sit still and pay attention to your body you’re
    going to start feeling a little bit uncomfortable. There’ll be that
    little thing on your shirt that kind of annoys you, there might be
    an itch. Well, the good news is when it comes to dynamic meditation
    you do not have to sit still. This is what I love about the Silva
    program. If you have an itch, go ahead and scratch the damn thing.
    Even if you are in the midst of the centering exercise which I’m
    about to lead you through feel free to move your hands, to move your
    legs around, to scratch and itch, to change your posture midstream,
    it is not going to break your meditation. Now some of you, as I
    guide you through the meditation exercises, might fall asleep. What
    I want you to do if you fall asleep is firstly don’t beat yourself
    up about it, but the next time you do the exercise create more of a
    sense of discomfort. You see, when you fall asleep what’s happening
    is your brain is going too deep it’s going into the theta level of
    mind and you’ve not been trained to stay awake at theta yet. You
    will before the end of this course, but when you start, you might
    not be. So as you get the theta level of mind, what often happens is
    your neck drops and you drift off to sleep. There’s a very simple
    solution and that is to create a mild form of discomfort. So if
    you’re meditating definitely don’t try meditating flat on your back.
    You might sit up straight, by creating that mild sense of discomfort
    and not being too relaxed you prevent yourself from falling asleep.
    This is also why some people meditate cross-legged, sitting
    cross-legged is not the most comfortable position, but that mild
    sense of discomfort keeps you awake. So it’s really simple, if you
    are falling asleep, don’t judge yourself. Don’t label yourself as a
    person who falls asleep during meditation. Instead, just create a
    mild sense of discomfort. Cross your feet, put your hands in a
    different position, maybe sit up straight. That mild sense of
    discomfort will balance out the depth and the sleepiness that might
    hit you, if you go into deep theta levels of mind and boom, the
    problem is solved. So as you go through this program I want you to
    not think of any problem as a problem. Any type of problem is going
    to be considered a project for you to solve. You keep falling
    asleep, don’t worry about that. Do not label yourself as sleepy,
    rather go, “Okay, that’s a problem. I’m going to solve it by
    adjusting my posture to create a mild sense of discomfort like
    Vishen said so I stay awake.” This is going to be a powerful
    attitude to have throughout this entire program. So as we go to day
    one what’s going to happen now is I’m going to guide you through the
    first meditation of this program, and it’s called “The Short
    Relaxation Exercise.” Let me tell you what’s going to happen in this
    meditation. As we get started with this meditation please note that
    the alpha beats will be playing to help guide your brain to the
    right frequency to enter your center level. Firstly, we’re going to
    establish a trigger. Have you ever seen those hypnosis shows where
    the hypnotist hypnotizes a person and then implants a trigger? Like
    when he says the word “Kawabunga” they’re going to think they are a
    ninja turtle, for example right? Well that’s implanting a trigger in
    your subconscious, we’re going to implant a trigger in you, but you
    are not going to be in a hypnotized state. You’re going to be fully
    awake. It’s just that true repetition, this trigger is going to
    start meaning something in your subconscious and every time you
    follow this trigger you will rapidly go to deep alpha levels of
    mind. Now the first time you do this I will have to guide you into
    alpha and that process may take as long as 10 minutes, but by the
    time you’re done on day 28 you’ll be able to sync to alpha in less
    than 30 seconds. Think about how powerful that’s going to be. So the
    trigger is this. You’re going to see the number three, three times,
    then the number two, three times, then the number one, three times.
    Think of it as the three, two, one trigger. So I’m going to ask you
    to visualize the number three, three times. Now have you ever seen
    those all movies that start with a countdown? You could see the
    number three on a giant movie screen with that spinning dial three,
    three, three, or you could see it in bright neon lights, or you
    could see maybe your baby daughter holding up a piece of paper with
    the number three written in crayons. It doesn’t matter how you see
    it, it is the symbolism of the number three that’s going to be the
    first part of this trigger. So you’re going to see the number three,
    three times and that is going to get your body to relax physically
    meaning bodily relaxation. Then you’re going to see the number two,
    three times. That’s going to help your mind relax and then you’re
    going to see the number one, three times and that is going to get
    you to your alpha level or your center, the center frequency where
    all the magic in front of Silva is going to be taking place. First
    thing we are going to do in the short relaxation exercise is
    establish the trigger. Now I’m going to start by establishing the
    trigger three, three, three, the first part of the trigger and then
    teaching your body how to relax physically. So after we have you see
    the number three, three times I’m going to guide you on a head to
    toe relaxation. This is going to take around seven to eight minutes
    and by the end of it, you are going to feel so relaxed. Some of you
    might not even feel your feet. This is normal, and it simply means
    that you’ve hit a state of incredible relaxation. This state is
    remarkable for your body because all stress melts away. I’m then
    going to implant the two, two, two trigger and take you to a place
    of mental relaxation. I’m going to ask you to imagine a beautiful
    place where you just feel relaxed. It could be a field, it could be
    a mountaintop it could be a forest, it could be a beach, but it’s
    someplace where you feel safe and relax, that signifies mental
    relaxation. I’m then going to give you the one, one, one countdown
    and that’s going to get you to your center. We’ll then spend a few
    minutes at your center and we’ll come right back up. So being able
    to dip into your center frequency and then come right back up is a
    skill and it’s a skill that you can learn rapidly. As we go through
    this program we’re going to be programming this into you. So the
    first time you do it if you’ve never meditated before, it will take
    10 minutes, but as we get better at this, by day 28 you’ll be able
    to get here in 30 seconds using the three, two, one trigger. Now, at
    the end of the exercise, I’m going to count you awake and we are
    going to do a one to five count up so that you awake. So three to
    one gets you to your alpha level, one to five makes you wide awake
    again, so you can go back to whatever amazing life you lead. Okay,
    so now let’s get started with the short relaxation exercise.
    Remember the rules, find the comfortable position, but not too
    comfortable that you fall asleep. Sit up straight, feel free to
    cross your legs or not and put your hands wherever you feel
    comfortable. Every time we talk about meditation people tend to
    bring back images of saints or sages, and you know what? You can
    follow that style if it means something to you, but you can also
    simply sit in the chair with your arms on your knees as what I’m
    doing right now. The choice is yours. This is a mental state, not a
    physical state. So at this point, you want to make sure that you’re
    not going to be interrupted for at least 15 minutes, and we will
    begin.

====================

DAY 1 - MEDITATION: The short relaxation exercise

- Welcome to this short relaxation exercise, from the Silva Method read by Vishen Lakhiani. We will start his exercise with the three, two, one method. Find a comfortable position, close your eyes. Take a deep breath and while exhaling, mentally repeat and visualize the number three, three times. You are now at level three, a level for physical relaxation where you can learn to relax from head to toe, in a matter of seconds. To help you learn to relax physically at level three, I'm going to direct your attention to different parts of your body. Concentrate your sense of awareness on your scalp. The skin that covers your head. You will be detect a fine vibration, a tingling sensation, a feeling of warmth caused by circulation. Now release and completely relax all tensions and ligament pressures from this part of your head and place it in a deep state of relaxation that will grow deeper as we continue. Concentrate your sense of awareness on your forehead. The skin that covers your forehead. You will detect a fine vibration, a tingling sensation, a feeling of warmth caused by circulation. Release and completely relax all tensions and ligament pressures from your forehead, and place it in a deep state of relaxation that will grow deeper as we continue. Concentrate your sense of awareness on your eyelids and the tissues surrounding your eyes. Detect a fine vibration, a tingling sensation a feeling of warmth caused by circulation. Now release and completely relax all tensions and ligament pressures from this part of your head and place it in deep state of relaxation that will go deeper as we continue. Concentrate your sense of awareness on your face. Now release and completely relax all tensions, ligament pressures from your face and place it in a deep state of relaxation that will go deeper as we continue. Concentrate on the outer portion of your throat, the skin covering your throat area. Release and completely relax your throat and place it in a deep state of relaxation that will go deeper as we continue. Concentrate within the throat area. Release and relax the area within your throat and place it in a deep state of relaxation that will go deeper as we continue. Concentrate on your shoulders. Feel the skin and the vibration of the skin, covering this part of your body. Relax and release all tensions and ligament pressures from your shoulders and let your shoulders relax and go deeper and deeper as we continue. Concentrate on your chest. Feel the clothing in contact with this part of your body. Relax all tensions and ligament pressures from your chest. Place it in a deep state of relaxation. Concentrate within the chest area, relax all organs , relax all breaths, relax all tissues including the cells themselves. Close down the function in a rhythmic healthy manner. Concentrate on your abdomen, feel the clothing in contact with this part of your body. Relax all tensions and ligament pressures and place your abdomen in a deep state of relaxation. Concentrate within the abdominal area, relax all organs, all glands, all tissues including the cells themselves. Close down the function in a rhythmic healthy manner. Concentrate on your thighs, feel your clothing in contact with this part of your body. Feel the skin and the vibration of the skin covering your thighs. Relax all tensions and ligament pressures and place your thighs in a deep state of relaxation. Go deeper and deeper every time. Sense the vibration at the bones within the thighs. By now, these vibrations should be easily detectable. Concentrate on your knees, relax all tensions and ligament pressures and place your knees in a deep state of relaxation. Concentrate on your calves. Relax all tensions and ligament pressures and place your calves in a deep state of relaxation. To enter a deeper, healthier level of mind concentrate on your toes. Enter a deeper healthier level of mind. To enter a healthier, deeper level of mind concentrate on the soles of your feet. Enter a deeper healthier level of mind. To enter a deeper, healthier level of mind concentrate on the heels of your feet. Enter a deeper, healthier level of mind. You are now at a deeper, healthier level of mind, deeper than before. This is your physical relaxation level three. To enter the mental relaxation level two, mentally repeat and visualize the level two, several times. You are now at level two, a deeper level than three. Level two is for mental relaxation where noises will not distract you. Instead noises will help you to relax mentally more and more. To further that relaxation at level two, visualize tranquil and passive scenes. Walking through the woods, being in a beautiful park. A day out fishing, whatever is a tranquil and passive scene for you. Imagine a blue sky, an occasional white cloud. Birds singing in the distance. Hear birds singing in the distance. To now go to your center, mentally repeat and visualize number one, several times. You are now at level one. A deeper healthier level of mind where you can function from your center. To help you enter an even deeper healthier level of mind, I'm going to count from 10 to one. On each descending number, you will feel yourself going deeper, and you will enter a deeper healthier level of mind. 10, nine, feel going deeper. Eight, seven, six, deeper and deeper. Five, four, three deeper and deeper. Two, one. You're now at a deeper healthier level of mind, deeper than before. You may enter a deeper, healthier level of mind by simply relaxing your eyelids. Relax your eyelids. Feel how relaxed they are. Allow this feeling of relaxation to flow slowly downward throughout your body, all the way down to your toes. It is a wonderful feeling to be deeply relaxed, a very healthy state of being. The following are beneficial statements, that may occasionally repeat one of these levels of mind. Repeat mentally after me, my increasing mental faculties are for serving humanity better. Every day in every way, I'm getting better, better and better. Positive thoughts, bring me benefits and advantages I desire. Every time you function at these levels of mind you receive beneficial effects physically and mentally. You may use these levels of mind, to help yourself physically and mentally. You may use these levels of the mind to help your loved ones, physically and mentally. You may use these levels of the mind, to help any human being who needs help, physical and mental. You will never use these levels of the mind to harm any human being. If this be your intention, you will not be able to function within these levels of the mind. You will also use these levels of the mind in a constructive, creative manner. For all that is good, honest, pure and positive. And this is so. In a moment, I'm going to count from one to five and cause a sound with my fingers. At that moment you will open your eyes, be wide awake, feeling fine and in perfect health. Feeling better than before. You will have no ill effects whatsoever in your head no headache, no ill effects whatsoever in your hearing. No buzzing in your ears. No ill effects whatsoever in your vision and eyesight. Vision, eye site and hearing, in through every time you function at these levels of the mind. One, two, coming out slowly now. Three, at the count of five, you will open your eyes be wide awake, feeling fine and in perfect health, feeling better than before. Feeling the way you feel, when you have slept the right amount, of revitalizing, refreshing, relaxing, healthy, wonderful sleep. Four, five, eyes open. Wide awake, feeling fine and in perfect health. Feeling better than before. This concludes the short relaxation exercise.

====================

DAY 2: Tap into Alpha with the Centering Exercise

<v ->Welcome to day two. What you’re going to experience today is one of
the highlights of the Silva Program, this is called The Centering
Exercise. So, on the first day, I took you through, what is called, a
short relaxation exercise, that took roughly around 15 minutes. And we
programmed within you the 3-2-1 Method. Here in day two, we’re going to
start in the same way. When you get to the Alpha Level, we’re going to
spend around 10 minutes at that level, programming your mind with
unique, beneficial, ingenious statements, designed by Jose Silva to
activate different abilities within your mind and your body. Now, Jose
Silva was extremely meticulous about the wording and the design of these
statements. Keep in mind that as the head of the Silva Method, before he
passed away in 1999, he had trained over a million people. And so he
knew exactly, what word patterns worked. And what you’re going to be
experiencing, in The Centering Exercise, is a series of what Jose
called, Programming Statements, to bring out new abilities in you. This
is powerful stuff. Listening to these statements, when you’re at a deep
level of mine almost has a hypnotic command on you. It will help
activate your intuition, activate positive thoughts, activate a better
and more wholesome sense of self. All of this, while you are fully awake
and conscious. This is an important bit, you are not going to be
hypnotized. You will be able to hear exactly what I’m saying. The
control is in your hands. And I’m going to explain to you, the
statements that we’re going to use, so there are no surprises. So, we’re
going to start with 3-3-3, and I’m going to guide you in a full body
relaxation. Then we’re going to go on to 2-2-2, I’m going to guide you
into mental relaxation. And then 1-1-1, and you’re going to be relaxed
and enter your Alpha Level. But that’s where we’re now going to add
another dimension. To ensure that you go deeper into Alpha, we are now
going to do a 10 to 1, Deepening Countdown. So, this is an add on that
you can do, to go even deeper. I’m simply going to count backwards from
10 to one. And as I count backwards, you’re going to feel yourself going
deeper and deeper into an Alpha Level of mind. As this is happening,
you’ll hear the Alpha Sound in the background, gently guiding your brain
frequency to the Alpha Level. The next thing we are going to do, is
program on you the best time to practice. Now, if you listen to the
wording that I’m going to use, you will see that we’re not deciding when
and how you practice, we’re simply offering Jose’s advice. This is what
you’re going to hear me say when you’re in a deep state of meditation.
I’m going to program to you that the best time to practice the countdown
deepening exercise is in the morning. when you wake up. I’m going to
recommend to you that the second best time to practice is at night,
before you go to sleep. And I’m going to recommend to you that five
minutes of practice is good, 10 minutes is very good, 15 minutes is
excellent. Practicing once a day is good, twice a day is very good,
three times a day is excellent. So, if you think about it, you could
practice for five minutes, once a day. Or you could practice this for 15
minutes, three times a day. Now, the exercise we’re doing right now is
close to 30 minutes. But as you get better and better and better at
Silva, you’ll be able to go deep into your Center Level in a mere
seconds. Focus on whatever problem you want to solve or whatever vision
of your life you want to create, and then come out, in 15 minutes flat.
When I was working on several major projects, in my life, I would do
this, three times a day for 15 minutes each and the results were
dramatic. But I’ve also had incredible success in life, doing this once
a day for five minutes. So, we’re going to program this into you and you
will decide what ratio is best for you. But there’s no pressure here to
dedicate hours a day in meditation. Now, let’s go on to the second
thing, we’re going to be programming into you. We’re going to program
into you Genius Statements and Beneficial Statements. They sound
something like this, “My increasing mental faculties”are for serving
humanity better.” “Everyday, in every way,”I’m getting better, better
and better.” “Positive thoughts bring me benefits”and advantages I
desire.” And this one, “I have full control and complete dominion”over
my sensing faculties “at this level of mind”and any other level,
including the outer conscious level.” So, all of these are what you
would call positive statements that you can repeat to yourself while
you’re at the center level. And you can design your own. But when you
repeat these statements to yourself, at the center level, they have a
profound impact on your subconscious. And these statements become true.
Now, this is where things are going to get a little bit weird. But I
want you to have an open mind. Now, the next thing Jose Silva designed
is a way to program into you, the faculties of ESP, or what he called
External Sensory Projection. The ability to project your consciousness
across time and distance to retrieve information that you can use to
benefit humanity. For example, “I’m now learning to attune my
intelligence”by developing my sensing faculties “and to project them to
any point or place”on any planet within the solar system, “any solar
system within the galaxy,”and any galaxy within the universe, “so as to
be aware of any actions taking place”if this is necessary and beneficial
for humanity.” For your convenience, I’ve pasted these statements below
this video, so you can read them and you know exactly what is being
programmed into your mind. And then we’re going to program into you,
what Jose Silva calls Post-Effect Statements. These are ways you’re
going to feel when you come out of the meditation. Here’s an example,
“Every time you function that these levels of mind,”you will receive
beneficial effects, “physically and mentally.” “You may use these levels
of mind”to help your loved ones, physically and mentally.” “You will
never use these levels of mind”to harm any human being. “If this be your
intention,”you will not be able to function “within these levels of
mind.” Again, these Post-Effect Statements are pasted below this video,
so you can view them, easily at your convenience, and you know exactly
what is being programmed into you. I’m then going to bring you out with
the one to five count up and you are done for today. So, at this point,
I want you to get ready to go into The Centering Exercise. Budget, 30
minutes for this. But know, that you are going to emerge from this, so
awake, so feeling wonderful, that you can do this in the morning before
you go to work, and you’re going to have an incredible day at work. But
as you’re doing this, make sure that you have quiet and solitude and
you’re not going to be interrupted and you’re in a comfortable place.
Let’s get ready to begin.

DAY 2 - MEDITATION: The silva centering exercise

Vishen Lakhiani:
The Silva Centering Exercise, read by Vishen Lakhiani. We will start this exercise with the 3-2-1 method. Find a comfortable position, close your eyes, take a deep breath, and while exhaling, mentally repeat and visualize a number three three times.
You are at level three, the level for physical relaxation, where you can learn to relax from hip to toe in a matter of seconds. To help you learn to relax physically at level three, I am going to direct your attention to different parts of your body.
Concentrate your sense of awareness on your scalp, the skin that covers your head. You will detect a fine vibration, a tingling sensation, a feeling of warmth caused by circulation. Now release and completely relax all tensions and ligament pressures from this part of your head and place it in a deep state of relaxation that will grow deeper as we continue.
Concentrate your sense of awareness on your forehead, the skin that covers your forehead. You will detect a fine vibration, a tingling sensation, a feeling of warmth caused by circulation. Now release and completely relax all tensions and ligament pressures from this part of your head and place it in a deep state of relaxation that will grow deeper as we continue.
Concentrate your sense of awareness on your eyelids and the tissue surrounding your eyes. You will detect a fine vibration, a tingling sensation, a feeling of warmth caused by circulation. Now release and completely relax all tensions and ligament pressures from this part of your head and place it in a deep state of relaxation that will grow deeper as we continue.
Concentrate your sense of awareness on your face, the skin covering your cheeks. You will detect a fine vibration, a tingling sensation, a feeling of warmth caused by circulation. Now release and completely relax all tensions and ligament pressures from this part of your head and place it in a deep state of relaxation that will grow deeper as we continue.
Concentrate on the outer portion of your throat, the skin covering your throat area. You will detect a fine vibration, a tingling sensation, a feeling of warmth caused by circulation. Now release and completely relax all tensions and ligament pressures from this part of your body and place it in a deep state of relaxation that will grow deeper as we continue.
Concentrate within the throat area and relax all tensions and ligament pressures from this part of your body and place it in a deep state of relaxation going deeper and deeper every time.
Concentrate on your shoulders. Feel your clothing in contact with your body. Feel the skin and the vibration of the skin covering this part of your body. Relax all tensions and ligament pressures and place your shoulders in a deep state of relaxation going deeper and deeper every time.
Concentrate on your chest. Feel your clothing in contact with this part of your body. Feel the skin and the vibration of your skin covering your chest. Relax all tensions and ligament pressures and place your chest in a deep state of relaxation going deeper and deeper every time.
Concentrate within the chest area. Relax all organs. Relax all glands. Relax all tissues including the cells themselves, and cause them to function in a rhythmic healthy manner.
Concentrate on your abdomen. Feel the clothing in contact with this part of your body. Feel the skin and the vibration of the skin covering your abdomen. Relax all tensions and ligament pressures and place your abdomen in a deep state of relaxation going deeper and deeper every time.
Concentrate within the abdominal area. Relax all organs. Relax all glands. Relax all tissues including the cells themselves, and cause them to function in a rhythmic healthy manner.
Concentrate on your thighs. Feel your clothing in contact with this part of your body. Feel the skin and the vibration of your skin covering your thighs. Relax all tensions and ligament pressures and place your thighs in a deep state of relaxation, going deeper and deeper every time. Sense the vibration at the bones within the thighs. By now, these vibrations should be easily detectable.
Concentrate on your knees. Feel the skin and the vibration of your skin covering the knees. Relax all tensions and ligament pressures and place your knees in a deep state of relaxation going deeper and deeper every time.
Concentrate on your calves. Feel the skin and the vibration of the skin covering your calves. Relax all tensions and ligament pressures and place these parts of your body in a deep state of relaxation, going deeper and deeper every time.
To enter a deeper, healthier level of mind, concentrate on your toes. Enter a deeper, healthier level of mind. To enter a deeper, healthier level of mind, concentrate on the soles of your feet. Enter a deeper, healthier level of mind. To enter a deeper, healthier level of mind, concentrate on the heels of your feet. Enter a deeper, healthier level of mind.
Now, cause your feet to feel as though they do not belong to your body. Feel your feet as though they do not belong to your body. Your feet feel as though they do not belong to your body. Your feet, ankles, calves, and knees feel as though they do not belong to your body. Your feet, ankles, calves, knees, thighs, waist, shoulders, arms and hands feel as though they do not belong to your body. You are now at a deeper, healthier level of mind, deeper than before.
This is your physical relaxation level three. Whenever you mentally repeat and visualize the number three, your body will relax as completely as you are now and more so every time you practice.
To enter mental relaxation level two, mentally repeat and visualize the number two three times, and you are at level two, a deeper level than three. Level two is for mental relaxation where noises will not distract you. Instead, noises will help you relax mentally more and more. To help you learn to relax mentally at level two, I'm going to call your attention to different passive scenes. Visualizing any scene that makes you tranquil and passive will help you relax mentally.
Your being at a beach on a nice summer day may be a tranquil and passive scene for you. A day out fishing may be a tranquil and passive scene for you. A tranquil and passive scene for you may be a walk through the woods on a beautiful summer day when the breeze is just right, where there are tall shade trees, beautiful flowers, a very blue sky and occasional white cloud, birds singing in the distance, even squirrels playing on tree limbs. Hear birds singing in the distance.
This is mental relaxation level two, where noises will not distract you. To enhance mental relaxation at level two, practice visualizing tranquil and passive scenes.
To go to your center, mentally repeat and visualize the number one several times. You are now at level one, a deeper, healthier level of mind where you can function from your center. To enter deeper, healthier levels of mind, practice with the countdown deepening exercise. To deepen, count downward from 25 to one or from 50 to one or from 100 to one. When you reached a count of one, you will have reached a deeper, healthier level of mind, deeper than before. You will always have full control and complete dominion over your faculties and senses at all levels of mind, including the outer conscious level.
The best time to practice the countdown deepening exercise is in the morning when you wake up. Remain in bed at least five minutes practicing the countdown deepening exercise. The second best time to practice is at night when you are ready to retire. The third best time to practice is at noon after lunch. Five minutes of practice is good. 10 minutes is very good. 15 minutes is excellent. To practice once a day is good. Twice a day is very good. Three times a day is excellent. If you have a health problem, practice for 15 minutes three times a day.
To help you enter a deeper, healthier level of mind, I'm going to count from 10 to one. On each descending number, you will feel yourself going deeper and you will enter a deeper, healthier level of mind. 10, nine. Feel going deeper. Eight, seven, six. Deeper and deeper. Five, four, three. Deeper and deeper. Two, one. You are now at a deeper, healthier level of mind, deeper than before.
You may enter a deeper, healthier level of mind by simply relaxing your eyelids. Relax your eyelids. Feel how relaxed they are. Allow this feeling of relaxation to flow slowly downward throughout your body, all the way down to your toes. It is a wonderful feeling to be deeply relaxed, a very healthy state of being.
To help you enter a deeper, healthier level of mind, I'm going to count from one to three and cause a sound with my fingers. At that moment, you will project yourself mentally to your ideal place of relaxation. I will then stop talking to you, and when you next hear my voice, in your mind, one hour of time will have elapsed at this level of mind. In reality, my voice will come back in 30 seconds. My voice will not startle you. You will take a deep breath, relax, and go deeper. Within this 30 seconds of actual time, your body and mind will experience an hour of deep relaxation. One, two, three. Project yourself mentally to your ideal place of relaxation until you hear my again. Relax.
Relax. Take a deep breath and as you exhale, relax and go deeper. You will continue to listen to my voice. You will continue to follow the instructions at this level of the mind and any other level, including the outer conscious level. This is for your benefit. You desire it and it is so.
Whenever you hear me mention the word relax, all unnecessary movements and activities of your body, brain, and mind will cease immediately and you will become completely passive and relax physically and mentally. I may bring you out of this level or a deeper level than this by counting to you from one to five. At the count to five, you will open your eyes. You will be wide awake, feeling fine and in perfect health.
The difference between genius mentality and lay mentality is that geniuses use more of their mind and use them in a special manner. You will learn to use more of your mind and to use it in a special manner.
The following are beneficial statements that you may occasionally repeat while at these levels of the mind. Repeat mentally after me. My increasing mental faculties are for serving humanity better. Every day, in every way, I am getting better, better and better. Positive thoughts bring me benefits and advantages I desire. I have full control and complete dominion over my sensing faculties at this level of mind and any other level, including the outer conscious level, and this is so.
Effective sensory projection statements for success. I am now learning to attune my intelligence by developing my sensing faculties and to project them to any point or place on this planet so as to be aware of any actions taking place, if this is necessary and beneficial for humanity. I am now learning to attune my intelligence by developing my sense of faculties and to project them to any point or place on any planet within the solar system, any solar system within the galaxy and any galaxy within the universe so as to be aware of any actions taking place, if this is necessary and beneficial for humanity.
I am now learning to attune my intelligence by developing my sense of faculties and to project them to the different matter kingdoms, the inanimate matter kingdom, any of its levels and depths, the animate matter kingdom with reproductive intelligence, plot life and animal life, any of its levels and depths, and the animate matter kingdom with reproductive intelligence and awareness of existence, the human body and mind kingdom, any of its levels and depths.
I am now learning to detect abnormalities whenever such abnormalities exist within any kingdom of any level and any depth, if this is necessary and beneficial for humanity. I am now learning to apply corrective measures and to bring back the normalcy, any abnormality found within any kingdom, any level, and any depth, if this is necessary and beneficial for humanity. Negative thoughts and negative suggestions have no influence over me at any level of the mind.
In a moment, I'm going to count from one to five and cause a sound with my fingers. At that moment, you will open your eyes, be wide awake, feeling fine and in perfect health, feeling better than before. You will have no ill effects whatsoever in your head, no headache, no ill effects whatsoever in your hearing, no buzzing in your ears, no ill effects whatsoever in your vision and eyesight. Vision, eyesight and hearing improve every time you function at these levels of mind.
One, two. Coming out slowly now. Three. At the count of five, you will open your eyes, be wide awake, feeling fine and in perfect health, feeling better than before, feeling the way you feel when you've had the right amount of revitalizing, refreshing, relaxing, healthy, wonderful sleep. Four, five. Eyes open, wide awake, feeling fine and in perfect health, feeling better than before.
This concludes the Silva Centering Exercise.

DAY 3: E.S.P. & the Mental Screen

<v ->A genius is someone who has discovered how to increase the
intensity of thought to a point where they can freely communicate with
sources of knowledge not available through the ordinary rate of thought.
Napoleon Hill. I love that line by Napoleon Hill. Silva’s research found
that when we can sync into our alpha level and tap into our mind, we
become a source for creativity, for intuition, for ideas. Throughout
history there’ve been so many stories of men and woman who have tapped
into this level to create remarkable discoveries and ideas. Elias Howe
was the inventor of the sewing machine and as legend has it, he was
facing this intractable problem of how to design the needle of the
sewing machine. One day he had a dream where he found himself surrounded
by cannibals. He was put in a giant pot and these cannibals were waving
spears at him and he noticed something curious. At the tip of every
spear was a hole. This dream gave him the insight to design the sewing
machine so that the hole where the thread goes through is not at the end
of the needle but at the tip of the needle and that is how modern sewing
machines work today. Now Elias Howe wasn’t the only one. There have been
so many stories of singers, of artists who have had incredible ideas
come to them through intuitive ideas. Robbie Williams, the famous singer
in an interview spoke about how the inspiration for his favorite song,
Better Man came to him one day while he felt as if he was communicating
with the essence of the spirit of John Lennon. This again, is a form
intuition. Now intuition used to be something taboo. Today, intuition is
being introduced in companies around the world as a way to boost
creativity and inspiration. We don’t know how it works but we know that
it works. Now when I talk about intuition or ESP, I am not talking about
road side psychics that get tourists to pay them money to see a
perceived future. Those are inevitably scams. What we are talking about
is a natural human ability to be able to acquire knowledge, ideas,
insights that seem to come from something other than our physical body
and the knowledge that we have in our brain. In a recent survey of
scientists, 16% believed that ESP is an established fact and 45% believe
that it is a likely possibility and ESP is becoming an asset in
businesses. Professor John Michalski of the New York College of
Engineering did a groundbreaking study on ESP or intuition and CEO
performance. So he tested a group of CEO’s and he found that CEO’s who
scored the highest in terms of intuitive ability also had the highest
correlation with successful profit growth of their companies. He
published this work in a book called Executive ESP and it was
groundbreaking. Now in our Silva community, we also have some incredible
stories of Silva graduates who have applied intuition in remarkable
ways. I bet you that you’ve heard of this famous book, Jonathan
Livingston Seagull. The book Jonathan Livingston Seagull which is a
book, which is essentially on personal growth in the form of a narrative
tail about a seagull trying to learn how to fly became such a publishing
phenomenon that Time Magazine featured it on the cover but here’s the
crazy thing about the book. The author Richard Bach wrote in an
interview on Harper’s Bazaar Magazine that as he was writing the book,
he got stuck on the last chapter and he couldn’t figure out how to
complete the book, the insight for that completion, for that last
chapter came to him when he was at a Silva seminar. Being able to get to
the center level of mind, access the alpha level, allowed he ideas to
flow and Jonathan Livingston Seagull became one of the greatest books of
the century to the point where it was featured on Time Magazine. So how
does ESP work? The fact is, we don’t know but we don’t have to know how
something works to know that it is real. Think about the sun. For 1,000s
upon 1,000s of years human beings were using the sun for navigation, for
heat, for warmth, for light but human beings didn’t know what the sun
was. Some thought it was the Egyptian God Ra sailing across the sky.
Other civilizations thought it was a giant orb of fire. It’s only in the
last 100 years that we understood that the sun is a giant mass of helium
and hydrogen atoms going through a thermal nuclear reaction. We only
figured that out in the last 100 years but it didn’t stop humanity from
using the sun since the dawn of civilization so we know intuition is
real. We can’t explain it. I bet you future generations might be able to
but right now it doesn’t stop us from being able to use it. The great
physicist Nassim Haramein simply said “Spirituality is nothing more than
physics that we have yet to find the equation for.” So keep that in mind
if you have any form of skepticism on intuition. Now in Silva, you’re
going to learn unique ways to bring out your intuition and I want to
teach you one of the most powerful tools, it’s called the mental screen
but first let me talk about a definition that you’re going to hear
throughout this program. So Jose Silva said that when you are creating
something, you’re using imagination. If you’re visualizing that dream
house or that dream career that’s imagination. When you’re receiving
information that’s visualization. If he says visualize the person you
are attempting to heal, what you are seeing is that individual and some
of that information is going to come to you through intuition. For
example, if that person that you’re seeking to heal might be suffering
from a depression, your subconscious mind might let you know by showing
dark clouds around the persons head. That is visualization. So
visualization is receiving just like the ears are for listening.
Imagination is putting out just like the mouth is for speaking words. So
we’re going to use visualization to receive and imagination to put out
and we’re going to do this using a framework called the mental screen.
So the mental screen is how you’re going to visualize and you’re going
to imagine and I’m going to teach you how to use the mental screen as a
tool within your mind when you’re at the alpha and theta levels of mind.
This is what the mental screen looks like. At this point I want you to
imagine as if you’re facing a giant television screen. Jose said imagine
this giant television screen as big as you can see, edge to edge is at
least six feet in front of you. So six feet in front of you. So, can you
see that giant screen yet? Now we come to the second part. Jose was
extremely specific about this, this giant TV screen elevated 20 degrees
above the line of horizon. When you elevate it 20 degrees, what’s going
on is that your eyeballs are shifting up ever so slightly and studies
have shown that when you move your eyeballs up 20 degrees with your eyes
closed it stimulates alpha activity in your brain, so it becomes easier
for you to get relaxed. So once you have this giant screen in front of
you, remember, at least six feet out, 20 degrees above the line of
horizon, this is where you’re going to receive information through
visualization and send out information through imagination. What we’re
going to do now is I’m going to guide you into a simple exercise. This
is going to be a rapid fire meditation. I’m going to take you down using
the three, two, one method in a fast way. I’m going to ask you to see
your mental screen and on that mental screen you’re going to spend a few
minutes, one to two, to three minutes projecting and seeing a goal that
matters to you. So first, let’s think about the goal you want to work
on. It could be a relationship goal, maybe you want to be in a
beautiful, incredible relationship that lights you up, it could be the
goal for a new home, it could be the goal for what you want your career
to look like. At this point, choose something and when you’re choosing a
goal, choose a goal three years out. There’s a reason I ask you to do
this. Bill Gates reputedly said we often overestimate what we can do in
one year but underestimate what we can do in three years. So think about
a goal three years out and stretch it a bit. What would that ideal
relationship or that ideal job or that ideal house or that ideal body
look like. You’re going to imagine that on your mental screen. I’m going
to give you a minute to choose and think about the goal that you’re
going to visualize. Fantastic. You now have some idea of what you’re
going to be focusing on. Now keep in mind that what you’re learning here
is simply how to use the mental screen. When it comes to goals three
years out, in the next few days we’re going to refine these techniques
and make it better and better and better and you’re going to learn the
next level technique which is called the three scenes technique, also
using the mental screen but more advanced than what we’re going to start
with today. So first, let me take you to the alpha level of mind using
the three, two, one countdown, you’re going to see your mental screen,
you’re going to project onto it that thing that you want to visualize
and I’m going to teach you a simple technique I call image streaming to
make your visualization more accurate and more real. It’s super easy and
you will instantly get it. I’m then going to count you up and this
entire process will take roughly seven to 10 minutes. So let’s get
started. Find a comfortable position and we’re going to begin with the
three, two, one countdown. This is going to be a faster version of the
countdown. We will not do the full head to toe relaxation because you’ve
already been programmed to feel your body relax with the imagery of the
three, three, three. Ready to begin? Find a comfortable position. Close
your eyes. Relax. I want you to bring to mind the number three, three
times. Three, three, three. Feel your body relax. Now bring to mind the
number two, three times. Two, two, two. Feel your mind relax. Now bring
to mind the number one, three times one, one, one. You are now at your
alpha level of mind. In front of you, six feet ahead of you, 20 degrees
above the line of horizon, see your mental screen. Your mental screen
should be as large as possible, almost filling your entire line of
vision. You could see it as a giant TV screen or you could imagine that
it’s a giant cinema screen in your favorite movie theater. On this
mental screen, I want you to start visualizing your chosen goal three
years ahead. See yourself. See other people you’re with. Bring in as
much color as you can. Magnify the color. Pay attention to how you feel
in this image. What feelings are within you? Joy? Bliss? Happiness?
Drive? See color, pay attention to the feelings and emotions that come
out. If you have difficulty seeing in full color, I’m going to teach you
a simple and powerful technique called image streaming to the imagery
more real. Describe to yourself mentally what you’re seeing. As you
describe what you’re seeing, you will find that the image will become
more vivid and more real. This in turn, will give you more to describe
thus making the image even more real. This cyclical approach will make
your image more and more visible, real, colorful thus giving you more to
describe. So for example, if you are imagining yourself driving a car,
your dream car, tell yourself what the steering wheel looks like. Is it
leather? Is it a black shiny plastic? As you describe it, notice how the
image becomes more real thus giving you more to describe, this is image
streaming. So in your mental screen describe what you see mentally and
observe as what you describe makes the image more vivid, more real, more
colorful. Describe your clothing. Describe what you’re walking in.
Describe the people you’re with, all mentally. I will give you some
moments of silence to do this on your own. See colors. Feel emotions.
And if you have difficulty visualizing, describe what you’re seeing and
watch as it becomes more vivid and more real. I will give you 30 more
seconds. You are now done visualizing this ideal future. I’m now going
to count you up. At the count of five you’ll be wide awake feeling fine
and in perfect health. One, two, three, ready to be wide awake in
perfect health, four, five. Eyes open, wide awake in perfect health,
feeling better than before. So what you just did was learnt a new mental
tool called the mental screen and you learned image streaming to make
the visualization and the imagination on the screen more and more vivid.
We’re going to be coming back to this tool in subsequent lessons and
you’re going to see just how powerful the mental screen can be for you
as a tool for not just intuition but for healing and for visualizing
your magnificent future. I’ll see you tomorrow.

====================

DAY 3 - MEDITATION: The mental screen technique

Speaker 1:
Find a comfortable position. Close your eyes. Relax. I want you to bring to mind the number three three times. Three, three, three. Feel your body relax. Now bring to mind the number two three times. Two, two, two. Feel your mind relax. Now bring to mind the number one three times. One, one, one. You are now at your alpha level of mind.
In front of you, six feet ahead of you, 20 degrees above the line of horizon, see your mental screen. Your mental screen should be as large as possible, almost filling your entire line of vision. You could see it as a giant TV screen, or you could imagine that it's a giant cinema screen in your favorite movie theater.
On this mental screen, I want you to start visualizing your chosen goal three years ahead. See yourself. See other people you are with. Bring in as much color as you can. Magnify the color. Pay attention to how you feel in this image. What feelings are within you? Joy, bliss, happiness, drive? See color. Pay attention to the feelings and emotions that come up.
If you have difficulty seeing in full color, I'm going to teach you a simple and powerful technique called image creaming to make the imagery more real. Describe to yourself mentally what you are seeing. As you describe what you are seeing, you will find that the image will become more vivid and more real. This in turn will give you more to describe, thus making the image even more real. This cyclical approach will make your image more and more visible, real, colorful, thus giving you more to describe.
So for example, if you are imagining yourself driving a car, your dream car, tell yourself what the steering wheel looks like. Is it leather? Is it a black, shiny plastic? As you describe it, notice how the image becomes more real, thus giving you more to describe. This is image creaming. So in your mental screen, describe what you see mentally and observe as what you describe makes the image more vivid, more real, more colorful. Describe your clothing. Describe what you are walking on. Describe the people you are with, all mentally. I will give you some moments of silence to do this on your own.
See colors, feel emotions, and if you have difficulty visualizing, describe what you're seeing and watch as it becomes more vivid and more real. I will give you 30 more seconds.
You are now done visualizing this ideal future. I'm now going to count you up. At the count of five, you'll be wide awake feeling fine and in perfect health. One, two, three, ready to be wide awake in perfect health. Four, five. Eyes open, wide awake in perfect health, feeling better than before.

====================

DAY 4: The Mental Video Technique: Enlist Higher Intelligence to Solve Problems

-   Welcome to day four. This is one of the most interesting days of the
    program, but I’m going to ask that you have an open mind. When I
    first heard about the technique that I’m going to be teaching you
    today, the mental video technique, I told myself, “Nah, this is not
    going to work. This just seems a little bit out there.” But Jose
    Silva knew what he was doing. He created this technique on his
    deathbed before he passed away. He created this technique and said
    and suggested to his family and his instructors that this was the
    most powerful technique that he had developed. Now, this was after
    some three to four decades of teaching people mind training. So I
    trust he knew what he was talking about. The technique that you’re
    going to learn today is that technique, and it’s called the mental
    video technique. Okay. So some backstory. Jose Silva believed that
    when you project something onto your mental screen, you create that
    thing in reality. You’re influencing reality. This has now been
    popularized through movies like “The Secret” and concepts such as
    thoughts create reality. But Jose started teaching this in the
    1960s. But after a while, it began to dawn on him that not
    everything that we want to create is actually what’s right for us.
    Sometimes our soul or a higher power has a greater meaning for us.
    It has an alternate journey for us to go on, or something that we
    need to experience. And when we try to force creation, we might
    actually take ourselves away from a soul path. So there’s a part of
    creation that has to do with what you intend, and there’s a part of
    creation that has to do with what your soul wants you to experience.
    Now, the mental video technique is a beautiful technique designed to
    help bring you solutions and answers in situations where you don’t
    necessarily know what is the right path. So here’s an example. Let’s
    say you are really determined to enroll and be accepted into a
    certain university. So you are absolutely determined to get into
    Yale University. Around 12 years ago, when I was a Silva instructor,
    I remember a mom coming to me and bringing this up as a specific
    problem. She was attending the class with her daughter, and she
    said, “My daughter really wants to get into Yale. Can she use the
    mental screen to visualize herself getting into Yale?” And I said,
    “Well, maybe. But what if your daughter’s soul is not meant to go to
    Yale? What if the future business partner of your daughter or that
    man she might fall in love with is in a different campus in a
    different university? Rather than try to force Yale, why not use the
    mental video technique to ask that your daughter ends up at the
    right university for her and for the full evolution of her soul?” So
    you see, it’s not about forcing, it’s about aligning. Forcing is
    creative visualization. Aligning is where you trust it. You don’t
    have all the answers, >and that the goals that you may think are
    right for you may not really be what you need. So you are going to a
    higher power to engineer that the right outcomes come to you so that
    you experience a full expression of your soul. This is the mental
    video technique. And it’s a lot about surrender and release and
    tuning in. Now, the mental video technique is based on Jose’s
    philosophy that we are not alone. What he means by this is that we
    have access to a higher power that’s guiding us and has a plan for
    us. And this plan is an alignment with our soul. And you are using
    the mental video to communicate with this higher power. So here’s
    how the technique works. It starts with knowing what problem in your
    life you are seeking to resolve. So remember, the concept of turning
    a problem into a project. You don’t think of it as a problem.
    Rather, you think of it as something to resolve, to fix. For
    example, when you go to Ikea and you buy furniture and you
    disassemble your furniture and it’s in multiple pieces, you don’t
    go, “Damn you, Ikea.” You know that you are going to reassemble that
    furniture with that ridiculously small Swedish widget that they’ve
    given you and turn that disassembled furniture into a fully
    functional table or bookcase or chair. You have turned a problem
    into a project. Jose is really asking you to view the problems and
    challenges in life in the same way, Ikea furniture ready to be
    assembled. So that attitude is essential to this exercise. So at
    this point, I want you to think about a specific problem that you
    might be facing. Perhaps it’s something at work. You’ve hit a glass
    ceiling and you can’t break through. Perhaps it’s a relationship
    problem. You have a relationship that just isn’t fulfilling, and you
    don’t know whether to stay or leave. Perhaps it’s a health problem.
    You’re trying to lose weight, or you’re trying to find the right
    solution to an illness, but you don’t know which doctor or procedure
    to look into. So at this point, pick a problem in your life that
    you’re prepared to turn into a project to resolve where you don’t
    know what the right answer might be. Now, this is how we are going
    to do the mental video technique. The mental video technique is done
    in two phases: first in the morning and once at night. And the
    reason the technique is done this way is because in the mental video
    technique, you’re going to be accessing delta-level frequency.
    Modern scientists, long after Jose Silva, studying the brain, and
    I’ve been to many of these facilities, have suggested to me that
    when you are at the delta level, or the level of sleep, that is the
    level of creation. That is where you are able to create and tap into
    higher sources of energy. Their observations are so similar to what
    Jose Silva seemed to intuitively know in the 1990s when he designed
    this technique. So the first part of this technique is done before
    you go to bed. You choose the problem that you want to turn into a
    project and resolve, and you sit down. Don’t go into your alpha
    level. At beta, with your eyes open, create a little video of that
    problem, a video that shows the problem as if you’re demonstrating
    it to your higher power. Imagine as if there was a guy filming a
    video off this problem. It could be the glass ceiling at work, it
    could be the unfulfilling relationship, but see it as a little mini
    movie, almost a minute or two long. So you’re going to see the
    problem once with your eyes open. You’re then going to close your
    eyes and review that same video again, still at beta. So you’re not
    going to the alpha level. You’re not doing the three-to-one
    countdown. You’re reviewing it at beta with your eyes closed. So
    you’ve now seen the problem as a video twice fully awake at beta,
    eyes open, then eyes closed. You’re then going to put it aside and
    go about your day. Now, that same day, at night, before you go to
    bed, this is what you’re going to do. You are going to sit up in bed
    and review the problem for the third time, this time at the alpha
    level. So you’re going to do the three-to-one countdown. You’re
    going to again see that video of that problem a minute to two
    minutes at the alpha level with your eyes closed. But this time
    there’s going to be a shift. You’re going to imagine after you’ve
    reviewed that video that you are passing it up to higher
    intelligence for higher intelligence to take care of it and resolve.
    Now, how you pass it up is up to you. Use any symbolism that
    matters. You could imagine as if you are burning that problem onto a
    CD, ejecting it from a CD player, and handing it up to higher
    intelligence. It’s even okay to move your hand in this way. Whatever
    you choose, it’s up to you. But the next thing you’re going to do is
    on your mental screen, you’re going to see the final result. You’re
    going to see the problem as fully resolved. You’re going to see the
    solution unfolding for you in a step-by-step manner to whatever
    clarity you know. For example, if it’s that relationship that you
    might want to end, you might see that relationship ending in a
    step-by-step manner in whatever way matters to you. Now, why step by
    step? Well, you don’t want the relationship to end with negativity
    or drama or pain. You know that you might want it to end
    consciously, so see that. You might want it to end where the two of
    you still stay friends, so see that. If it’s about breaking through
    a glass ceiling, you might want to ensure that you find a new way to
    succeed at your career in the most blissful, comfortable way, not
    where you have to break your back working 100-hour weeks. So you’re
    going to see it unfold in a step-by-step manner with all the
    preconditions that you would like to see as this problem is
    resolved. And after you’ve created that video, you’re going to hand
    that up to higher intelligence. Now, after you’re done, you’re not
    going to do the count-up. You’re simply going to lie in bed and go
    straight to sleep. And Jose says, over the next three days, look for
    any indication that the problem is starting to resolve itself and
    think of the problem in the past tense. In other words, think of the
    problem as if it’s already been resolved. So this is a truly
    powerful technique. And when I’ve used it in my life, amazing things
    have happened. The first time I used this technique was when I was
    trying to decide if I should have quit my job to start my dream
    company Mindvalley, which is what I run today, or if I should have
    stayed at my job. I was succeeding remarkably well at the Silicon
    Valley company I was working for. I was a vice president, I was
    crushing it at the job, I was making great money, and I loved my
    teammates. But at a certain point, I felt unfulfilled. I knew I
    needed to do something else. I’d started teaching Silva on the side,
    and I wanted to take my Silva business forward in a deeper, bigger
    way. Problem is, when I called my boss and I said, “Hey, I love
    everything you’ve done for me, but I think we need to part ways,” he
    immediately threw a wrench in my plans: He raised my salary
    significantly. But I decided to try the mental video technique to
    fully understand if I should stay or if I should leave. So I tried
    the technique. In a short amount of time, almost 24 hours later, I
    received a phone call from the co-founder of the company. The
    co-founder was not the same boss I’d spoken to. He was the boss’
    partner. And he shared some devastating news with me. He shared that
    he and my boss were about to split, and he warned me. He said, “This
    company’s going to go through some hard times. You shouldn’t be
    staying. You’re a smart kid. Go and do your own thing.” Now, it was
    interesting that he called me to tick me off like that. That was the
    answer I needed. I decided I shouldn’t stay and I should leave to
    start my dream company and become a Silva instructor. So I did, and
    everything in my life changed as a result of that. Now, the funny
    thing is, the company, if I had stayed with it, that company
    collapsed that year. I went on to start my new idea, which went on
    to become Mindvalley. And today, I couldn’t be happier. So the
    mental video actually came to my aid when I came to that fork in the
    road and I didn’t know what was right to me. But I got the answer
    through that phone call. And this is a very important nuance. Jose
    Silva said, “When you ask for help using the mental video technique,
    the universe will give you a sign. And it’ll be so clear that you
    know what you need to do.” Now, he also says that it’s not always
    going to work. If, within three days, you don’t see the sign, do the
    mental video technique again. So don’t do it every day for the same
    problem. You can do it every day for different problems, but give a
    space of about three days. You don’t want to keep bothering the
    universe with the same thing. You don’t want to be that annoying kid
    at the back of the car going, “Are we there yet? Are we there yet?
    Are we there yet? Mom, are we there yet?” Just ask once, relax, look
    over three days, and see if the sign comes to you. If not, do it
    again. Okay, so we’re going to do a mental video today, and we’re
    going to come back to this technique three days from now. And you
    can do it for the same situation, or you can do it for a different
    situation if situation number one gets resolved in the next three
    days. So let’s get ready to practice the mental video technique. And
    again, the instructions are below this video. So you can read this
    to familiarize yourself with the instructions. But overall, this
    technique is extremely easy. But keep in mind there are two parts
    for it. We’re going to do the first part now, and then you’re going
    to stop and you’re going to play the second half of this video to do
    the second part just before you go to bed. So at this point, you
    should have chosen the problem that you want to resolve. And
    remember, this is ideally a problem where you don’t know what the
    right answer is. So with your eyes open, I want you to create a
    simple, short video of the problem. You’re going to see your mental
    screen in front of you with your eyes open. and imagine that video
    playing. Again, imagine a filmmaker is filming that problem in your
    life. What would you see? Who would you include in that video? Make
    it as vivid, as colorful. Bring in special effects if you want. Just
    make that video fully represent that problem as if this video is
    going to help inform higher intelligence of what it is in your life
    that you need to resolve. Go ahead and do that now. I’m going to
    give you two minutes. Now you’re going to replay that video in your
    mind again at beta or waking, but this time with your eyes closed,
    I’m going to give you 90 seconds. Fantastic. Now hold onto that
    image. If it’s time for bed, you’re going to continue playing this
    track and you’re going to go straight to sleep after this track. If
    it’s not time for bed, pause here and come back to me just before
    you go to bed. Okay, so now we come to the second half of the mental
    video technique. If you’re watching this video, ideally you’re in
    bed. And as soon as this video ends and I guide you through the
    mental video, you are going to go directly to sleep. You are not
    going to have fun with your partner. You’re not going to go on your
    mobile phone. This video is meant to be done just before you go to
    bed because we are going to teach you how to use the delta frequency
    of mind, which you only access when you’re asleep. Okay, so you’ve
    seen the problem in the daytime. Now I’m going to guide you to the
    alpha level of mind using the three-to-one technique, and you’re
    going to play that same mental video of the problem. Then, after
    you’re done, you’re going to send it to higher intelligence. You’re
    then, on your mental screen, going to play a mental video of the
    solution the way you want it to unfold. And when you’re done, you’re
    going to send that up to higher intelligence, and then you’re going
    to lie back in your bed and go straight to sleep. Cool? Let’s begin.
    I’m going to count from three to one to guide you to your alpha
    level of mind. Three, three, three. You’re now at a state of
    physical relaxation. Two, two, two. You are now mentally relaxed.
    One, one, one. You are now at the alpha level of mind. See your
    mental screen at least six feet in front of you, 20 degrees of above
    the line of horizon. On this mental screen, replay for the third
    time a video of the problem you are seeking to resolve. I’m going to
    give you 90 seconds. Observe the video, make it as vivid and
    colorful as you can. Now slowly wrap up that video. Now imagine as
    if you are sending this video to higher intelligence. Send it up to
    higher intelligence in any way you like. Now, on your mental screen,
    you are going to play a video of the solution. See every aspect of
    the solution step by step in a way you would like it to resolve. If
    you don’t know completely how any aspect of it resolved, leave that
    open for higher intelligence to figure out. Show in this video the
    steps that you know you want to experience. As you visualize the
    solution, pay attention to the positive feelings that you are seeing
    and feeling. The problem is no longer there. It has been fully
    resolved. See how other people have benefited. See how amazing you
    feel. See colors. Bring in all your senses. See colors. It helps to
    see how other people are benefiting from this solution too. As you
    are done with this mental video of the solution, send it up to
    higher intelligence. And now I want you to gently go to bed. Turn
    off this app, set your alarm if you must, and lay down on your
    pillow and go to sleep, trusting that while you’re asleep, your
    higher mind will be working with higher intelligence to resolve this
    problem. Good night, and I’ll see you tomorrow.

====================

DAY 5: Projection into Your Home

<v ->Today’s going to be one of the most exciting, intriguing, bizarre
days of your training. And the reason is because today, we start
training you to project your awareness across time and space. There are
many names for this. In addition to ESP, some people call this remote
viewing, and Silva developed one of the most effective ways to train
people to project awareness across time and space to retrieve
information that you can use for good. So, as I explained before in the
warmup exercises, this program is divided into two different types of
immersive exercises that get you to access altered states of mind. The
first, our centering exercises, that get you trained with going deep
into alpha and theta. The second is what we call projection exercises.
Projection exercises are designed to train you to become functionally
psychic. And we’re going to be doing five project exercises in this
program, the first is projecting to your home. The second is projecting
into metals. The third is projecting into a leaf. The fourth is into an
animal or a pet, and the fifth is into the anatomy of a human being, so
you can learn the tools of what are sometimes called psychic healing.
Today we’re going to start with the first projection exercise,
projecting into a home. <v ->So, I’m going to orient you to what you’re
going to experience as I guide you through this exercise that will take
roughly 30 to 35 minutes. So, as we begin this exercise, we’re going to
start in the usual way, it’s going to be the head to toe relaxation.
Three, three, three, followed by two, two, two followed by one, one, one
to get you boom to your center. We’re then going to read out to you a
couple of laws of programming to orient you to the five laws that Jose
Silva said are the laws of programming reality or programming your mind.
These laws are nonnegotiable guides on how you’re going to use the new
found powers that are going to be unlocked in you through the Silva
training. The first law is really simple. Do unto others only what you
want others to do unto you, the golden rule. The second is that whatever
solution you program must help to make this planet a better place to
live. The third, it must benefit everybody concerned, you cannot be
selfish about the solution you request. The fourth is it must help at
least two or more people. So what this means is that whenever you’re
programming something, you want to see more than just you benefiting.
For example, if you’re programing to heal back pain, see how your child
or your grandchild can benefit by you being able to play with them free
of back pain. The fifth law is it must be within the possibility area.
In short, you can’t bend the laws of physics. Now the next thing we’re
going to do is I’m going to program into you at this deep state of
meditation principles to keep in mind when programming. So these are
really simple, and you’re going to start using these principles in this
projection exercise. Two things to keep in mind, the first is objective
physical communication takes place in the beta left-brain dimension
using the objective, physical senses. The hearing is used for
perception, the voice is used for transmission. So we use our hearing to
perceive, our voice to transmit. Subjective, spiritual communication
takes place at your center, the alpha, right-brain dimension by using
the spiritual senses. Visualization is used for perception, and
imagination is used for transmission. Remember the difference between
visualization and imagination. The next thing is, in the objective,
physical dimension, the past is behind us, the present is our present
position, the future is ahead of us. But in the subjective, spiritual
dimension, what Jose Silva found is that the past is to your right, the
present is where you are, and the future is to your left. Now he figured
this out when he was hypnotizing people, when he would make someone
regress to the past, they would move to their right, when he would make
someone progress to the future, they would move to their left, so we’re
going to use this nuance of past to future in our spiritual dimension
for certain forms of programming. We’ll be coming to that later. And
now, we come to the exact projection exercise. So this is what is going
to happen. First, we’re going to count down, three, two, one. I’m going
to guide you into a complete head to toe relaxation, and then I’m going
to ask you to visualize, and imagine as if you’re standing in front of
your home. Now you may be doing this meditation in your home, that’s
perfectly fine. You’re going to explore your home with your spiritual
senses. You’re going to start by standing outside of your home, whether
it’s a house or it’s an apartment block. You’re then going to scan your
home from top to bottom, left to right, as if you’re reading the pages
of a book. And you’re going to make that image as vivid as possible.
You’re then going to reach out with your objective hand, and it’s okay
for you to raise your hand during meditation, in fact we encourage that.
Don’t feel like you need to sit still, raise your objective hand,
imagine yourself turning the doorknob or waiving your access card and
walking into your home. Once you’re in your home, you’re going to enter
the living room, and you’re going to pick a wall, any wall, that is your
most significant wall. For me, it’s the wall on which my TV hangs.
You’re going to observe this wall, and again, scan the wall from left to
right, observing everything on the wall. We’re then going to change the
color of the wall. You’re going to imagine the wall red, green, blue, I
will snap my fingers to help you change the color. Then, we’re going to
do something weird folks. I’m going to ask you to imagine as if you can
walk into the wall, you’re going to step into the wall, and visualize
what being inside the wall would look like. Imagine you were pure
energy, and you could go inside the wall. And when you’re inside the
wall, using the tools of visualization, you’re going to test for four
things. You’re first going to test for touch, and I ask you to imagine
knocking inside the wall, what sound do you hear back? You’re then going
to test the light intensity and color. If you could see inside the wall,
what color is the fabric in the material of the wall? Then, you’re going
to test for temperature. Does it feel warm, does it feel cold? And
finally, you’re going to test for odor. What do you smell? Now notice
what we’re doing here. We’re bringing in all your psychic senses through
the tools of visualization to perceive information. Now, keep in mind
that I’m going to guide you through these tests through snapping, so
wait for me to snap. Now here’s a very important thing. We are not all
visual. Some of us, our dominant senses are not sight, but it might be
sound or hearing, which is why we’re bringing in all the senses, we want
to train you to perceive information through all your senses. At this
point, you’re going to step out of the wall, and you’re going to imagine
a chair, and you’re going to imagine the chair floating in front of the
wall, and you’re going to change the color of the wall with that chair
floating in front of the wall. Now, notice what we’re doing here.
Training you to become better and better at your mental screen. We’re
training you to see the chair floating in front of the wall, that’s
perceiving things in 3D. We’re training you to change the color of the
wall, that’s getting you trained to use color in your imagination and
visualization. And now, we’re going to train you to go deeper with your
tools of imagination. I’m going to as you to see a watermelon levitating
in front of the wall. I’m going to ask you to slice that watermelon, and
imagine what it looks like inside. You’re then going to change that
watermelon to become a lemon, an orange, a banana, a carrot, a head of
lettuce, and then, I’m going to program the MentalVideo technique. Now
you’ll notice me say, “Everything you see here becomes a point of
reference.” What this means is that as you go through this exercise,
every little nuance, from the wall changing color, or being able to see
a fruit in full vivid 3D becomes a point of reference for your mind on
how powerful it can visualize, and every time you visualize going
forward, things will become more and more colorful, real, and 3D. These
are what we mean by points of reference. Now at this point, you have a
choice. If you have enough time budgeted out, you can do the exercise
now. Again, you’ll need 30 to 35 minutes. If not, you can stop the video
here, go to work or whatever else you need to do, and come back and do
this exercise today before you go to bed. Let’s get started with the
exercise. <v ->Congratulations, you have finished the projection to home
exercise. What I recommend you do is take out a journal and write down
some of the insights, some of the experience, journal your thoughts, if
you have time. And I will see you in the next chapter.

====================

DAY 5 - MEDITATION: Projection to home

- We will start this exercise with the three to one method. Find a comfortable position, close your eyes, take a deep breath. And while exhaling mentally repeat and visualize the number three, three times. To help you learn to relax physically at level three, I'm going to direct your attention to different parts of your body. Relax your scalp. Relax your forehead. Relax your eyes. Relax your face. Relax your throat. Relax your shoulders. Relax your chest externally, and internally. Relax your abdominal area, externally and internally. Relax your thighs. Relax your knees. Relax your calves. Relax your feet. You are now at a deeper, healthier level of mind, deeper than before. This is your physical relaxation level three. Whenever you mentally repeat and visualize the number three, your body will relax as completely as you are now. And more so every time you practice. To enter mental relaxation level two, take a deep breath and while exhaling, mentally repeat and visualize the number two, three times. And you're at level two, a deeper level than three. Level two is for mental relaxation where noises will not distract you. Instead noises will help you to relax mentally, more and more. To improve mental relaxation at level two, practice visualizing tranquil and passive scenes. Take another deep breath. And while exhaling mentally repeat and visualize number one, three times. You are now at level one, a deeper, healthier level of mind where you can function from your center. To help you into a deeper, healthier level of mind, I'm going to count from 10 to one. On each descending number, you will feel yourself going deeper and you will enter a deeper, healthier level of mind. 10, nine, feel going deeper, eight, seven, six, deeper and deeper, five, four, three, deeper and deeper. Two, one. You're now at deeper, healthier level of mind, deeper than before. It is a wonderful feeling to be deeply relaxed. A very healthy state of being. Affective sensory projection statements for success. I'm now learning to attune my intelligence by developing my sensing faculties and to project them to any point or place on this planet, so as to be aware of any actions taking place if this is necessary and beneficial for humanity. I am now learning to attune my intelligence by developing my sense and faculties and to project them to any point or place on any planet within the solar system. Any solar system within the galaxy and any galaxy within the universe so as to be aware of any actions taking place, if this is necessary, and beneficial for humanity. I'm now learning to attune my intelligence by developing my sensing faculties and to project them to the different matter kingdoms. The inanimate matter kingdom, any of its levels and depths, the animate matter kingdom, with reproductive intelligence, plant life, and animal life, any of its levels and depths, and the animate matter kingdom with reproductive intelligence and an awareness of existence. The human body and mind kingdom, any of its levels and depths. I am now learning to detect abnormalities whenever such abnormalities exist within any kingdom, any level, and any depth, if this is necessary, and beneficial for humanity. I'm now learning to apply corrective measures and to bring back to normalcy any abnormality found within any kingdom, any level, and any depth, if this is necessary, and beneficial for humanity. Negative thoughts and negative suggestions have no influence over me at any level of the mind. The following laws are to be considered when programming. You should do to others only what you like others to do to you. The solution must help to make this planet a better place to live. It must be best for everybody concerned. It must help at least two or more persons. It must be within the possibility area. The following principles apply to program. Objective physical communication takes place in the beta, left brain dimension using the objective physical senses. The hearing is used for perception and the voices used for transmission. Subjective, spiritual communication takes place at your center, the alpha, right brain dimension by using the spiritual senses. Visualization is used for perception, and imagination is used for transmission. In the objective physical dimension, the past is behind us. The present is a present position and the future is ahead of us. In the subjective spiritual dimension, the past is to your right, the present is centered straight ahead, and the future is to your left. We will now impress new information for your benefit, the mental screen. To locate your mental screen, begin with your eyes closed. Turn slightly upward from the horizontal plane of sight, at an angle of approximately 20 degrees. The area that you perceive with your mind is your mental screen. Without using your eyelids as screens, sense your mental screen to be out away from your body. To improve the use of your mental screen, project images or mental pictures onto the screen, especially images having color. Concentrate on mentally sensing and visualizing true color. We will now program effective sensory for your success. We will program information through the use of mental projection. We will establish subjective points of reference at the imaginative dimension, the subjective dimension at different levels and depths. In a moment, I'm going to count from one to three and cause the sound but my fingers. At that time, you will imagine yourself to be standing about 30 feet in front of your home. You will study the outer appearance of your home scanning the scene. You will start at the top left of the scene and go from left to right just as you do when reading the page of a book. You will then go to the left side of the screen again but a little lower than before. You will continue going a little lower each time until you reach the ground level. I will now count from one to three and cause a sound with my fingers so that you may imagine projecting yourself to the front of your home. One, two, three. Project yourself mentally to the front of your home, standing about 30 feet from it. Begin scanning the scene at the upper left hand corner going slowly from left to right, lower each time until you reach the ground level. You will go slowly and stop to study anything that attracts your intelligence while scanning. Such as the roof, windows, window frames, doors, study anything that attracts you. Begin by studying the roof of your home. What material is it made of? What color is it? Continue studying everything that attracts you until you reach the ground level. Concentrate on colors. Take your time. Study colors. Take you time. Study colors. Scan the ground level. Now focus your attention on the front door and concentrate on the doorknob or handle. Gently move close to the door, close enough to touch the door handle. Expect the door handle to appear to increase in size as you get closer. Mentally touch the doorknob or handle. Open the door. Mentally enter your home, closing the door behind you. Mentally walk towards your living room. Once you have entered your living room, stand at the center facing any wall you choose. We will refer to this wall as the selected wall. You have been here before. You have been here during daylight hours. You've been here during nighttime with the lights turned on, and the lights turned off. I'm going to count from one to three. At the count of three, it will be daytime. One, two, three. It is now daytime. You're standing at the center of your living room facing the wall that you selected. You have been here before. You know how much light enters this room during the day and you recognize what is in front of you, what is behind you. You know what is to your left. What is your right. At the count of three we will change the scene to nighttime with the house lights turned on. One ,two, three. The scene has changed to nighttime and you are still standing in the middle of the living room facing the selected wall. You have been here before. You know what is in front of you, what is behind you, what is to your left, and what is your right. At the count of three, the lights will go out. One, two, three. The lights are out and you're standing in darkness facing the selected wall. Although the living room looks dark, you still know what is in front of you, what is behind you, what is to your left, and what is to your right. At this time, concentrate on the wall before you, the wall that you selected. You can sense it being a certain distance away and you know what is on the wall. You also know the color of the wall. Use your memory, your knowing, your sensing to make a study of the wall that you selected. Scan this wall as you did the front of your home, beginning at the upper left corner and going from left to right, a little lower each time until you reach the floor level. Study everything that attracts you. Pictures, curtains and furniture, especially concentrate on objects that contain color. Take your time. Study colors. Take your time. Study colors. Now mentally walk towards the selected wall and stand close enough to touch it. At the count of three, you will objectively raise your hand to touch the wall. One, two, three. Objectively stretch out your arm, raise your hand and with the palm of your hand, touch the wall. Use your imagination to sense the wall is being smooth or rough, cold or warm. Whatever you perceive with your imagination at this dimension, you can use as a point of reference in the future. At the count of three, you will imagine projecting yourself subjectively within the wall. One, two, three. You are now within the wall. You may return your hand to rest on your lap. At this time, we will conduct four tests subjectively. First we will test for light intensity and color. Our second test is for temperature. The third test is for odor. And the fourth, for solidity of material by reflected sound. At the count of three, we will test for light, its intensity and color. One, two, three. Subjectively tests the light intensity and color. How much light do you sense? What color do you sense? Whatever you perceive with your imagination at this dimension, you can use as a point of reference in the future. At the count of three test for temperature. One, two, three. Subjectively test for temperature. Is there a difference in temperature between the inside and the outside of the wall? Whatever you perceive with your imagination at this dimension, you can use as a point of reference in the future. At the count of three, test for odor. One, two, three. Subjectively test for odor. Is there a difference in odor between the inside and the outside of the wall? Whatever you perceive with your imagination at this dimension you can use as a point of reference in the future. At the count of three, test for solidity of material by knocking on the inside of the wall. One, two, three. Objectively form a fist and knock on the inside of the subjective wall. Objectively go through the motions as you do when you knock on the door. What kind of sound would you expect to hear reflected back to you? How solid would you judge the material to be? Whatever you perceive with your imagination at this dimension, you can use as a point of reference in the future. At the count of three, you will come out of the wall and be just a few inches away from it. One, two, three. You are out of the wall just a few inches away. Now at the count of three, you will be at arm's length. One, two, three. You are now at arm's length. At the count of three, you will be at the center of your living room facing the selected wall. One, two, three. You are now at the center of your living room facing the selected wall. You know the color of your living room wall. At the count of three, the color of the wall will change to black. One, two, three. The color of the wall is now black. You can get a true black color by imagining a painter with a can of black paint and a brush in his hand, painting the wall black and about to finish painting it. The selected wall is now all black. At the count of three, it will be red. One, two, three. It is now red. To get a true red color, again imagine the painter about to finish painting it red. At the count of three, the wall will be green. One, two, three. The wall is now green. Imagine it green. At the count of three, the wall will be blue. One, two, three. The wall is now blue. Imagine it blue. At the count of three, the wall will be violet. One, two, three. The wall is now violet. Imagine it violet. We will change the color back to blue. Back to green. Back to red. Back to black. We will now mentally examine the chair, selecting any chair we wish. Mentally push it against the black wall. From your position in the center of the living room facing the selected wall, mentally lift the chair about 20 degrees above the horizontal plane of sight in the area of your mental screen. We will examine the chair studying its material. the upholstery, if it is upholstered, and how it is attached to the chair. And the color of the chair. Now mentally turn the chair towards the left. Now away from you. Now towards the right. Now facing you. Whatever you perceive with your imagination at this dimension you can use as a point of reference in the future. At the count of three, the color of the wall will change to its actual color. One, two, three. The wall is now its actual color. Again, study the chair. How does it stand out against the background? Whatever you perceive with your imagination at this dimension, you can use as a point of reference in the future. At the count of three, the color of the wall will change to red. One, two, three. The wall is now red. Study the chair. How does it stand out against the red background? Whatever you perceive with your imagination at this dimension, you can use as a point of reference in the future. At the count of three, the color of the wall will change to green. One, two, three. The wall is now green. Study the chair. How does it stand out against a green background? Whatever you perceive with your imagination at this dimension, you can use as a point of reference in the future. At the count of three, the color of the wall will change the blue. One, two, three. The wall is now blue. Study the chair. How does it stand out against the blue background. Whatever you perceive with your imagination at this dimension, you can use as a point of reference in the future. The color of the wall will now change back to green. Back to red. Back to the natural color. Back to black. At the count of three, the chair will disappear from the scene. One, two, three. The chair has disappeared from the scene. The wall is now black. At the count of three, we will mentally bring into the scene a watermelon. It will be up against the wall at the height where we have the chair. One, two, three. Study the watermelon. Use your knowing, your memory, your sensing. Above all use your imagination to study the watermelon. Observe how the green stands out against the black background. At the count of three, the watermelon will be cut in half. One, two, three. The watermelon is now cut in half and you can visualize how the red portion of the watermelon line the black seeds stands out against the white inner line and the green of the outside. As you mentally bring the two halves slowly towards you, notice how they appear to increase in size. Examine the various colors. The red, the white, the black and the green from only a few inches away. Now imagine the odor and taste of watermelon. Whatever you perceive with your imagination at this dimension you can use as a point of reference in the future. At the count of three, the watermelon will be near the wall. One, two, three. The watermelon is now near the wall. At the count of three, the two halves will come together. One, two, three. Now at the count of three, the watermelon will disappear from the scene. One, two, three. The watermelon has disappeared from the scene. At the count of three, a lemon will appear at the same level near the wall. One, two, three. A lemon appears in a fluorescent yellow color that stands out against the black of the wall. Bring the lemon closer to you noticing how it appears to increase in size as it approaches. Stop the approaching lemon when it is only a few inches away and examine its color. Now imagine the odor and taste of a lemon. Whatever you perceive with your imagination at this dimension, you can use as a point of reference in the future. At the count of three, the lemon will be near the wall. One, two, three. The lemon is now near the wall, a little higher than the horizontal level of sight. At the count of three, the lemon will disappear from the scene. One, two, three. The lemon has disappeared from the scene. At the count of three, an orange will appear. One, two, three. An orange has appeared on the scene. Observe the color at a distance. Now bring the orange closer. Again observing the color. Now imagine the odor and taste of an orange. Whatever you perceive with your imagination at this dimension, you can use as a point of reference in the future. At the count of three, the orange will be near the wall. One, two, three. The orange is now near the wall. At the count of three, the orange will disappear from the scene. One, two, three. The orange has disappeared from the scene. At the count of three, three bananas will appear. One, two, three. Three bananas have appeared. Study the color from far and near. Now imagine the odor and taste of bananas. Whatever you perceive with your imagination at this dimension, you can use as a point of reference in the future. At the count of three, the bananas will be near the wall. One, two, three. Now at the count of three, the bananas will disappear from the scene. One, two, three. The bananas have disappeared from the scene. At the count of three, three carrots will appear. One, two, three. Three carrots have appeared. Study the color from far and near. Now imagine the odor and taste of carrots. Whatever you perceive with your imagination at this dimension, you can use as point of reference in the future. At the count of three, the carrots will be near the wall. One, two, three. Now at the count of three, the carrots will disappear from the scene. One, two, three. The carrots have disappeared from the scene. At the count of three, a fresh and crisp head of lettuce will appear. One, two, three. A head of lettuce has appeared. Study the color from far. Now bring it closer and study the color from a distance of about 12 inches. Whatever you perceive with your imagination at this dimension, you can use as a point of reference in the future. At the count of three, the head of lettuce will be near the wall. One, two, three. Now at the count of three, the head of lettuce will disappear from the scene. One, two, three. The head of lettuce has disappeared from the scene. Whatever you perceive with your imagination at this dimension, you can use as a point of reference in the future. It is now an accomplished fact that subjective points of reference have been established at the imaginated dimension and the subjective dimension at different levels and different depths. To function at these levels and to use these points of reference, all you need is to have a sincere desire to solve problems. Programming a technique, the mental video technique that you can use for problem solving. Whenever you decide to use the mental video technique proceed in the following manner. At beta, with your eyes open, mentally create with visualization, a mental video of a problem or the existing situation. Include everything that belongs to the animate matter kingdom. Animate matter means everything that contains life. After you've completed the mental video of the problem, use visualization to review it at beta with your eyes closed. Later, when you are in bed and ready to go to sleep, go to your center with the three to one method. Once you are at your center, review the mental video that you created of the problem, or the existing situation when you are at beta level. After you have reviewed the problem, mentally convert the problem into a project. Then create with imagination, a mental video of the solution. The mental video of the solution should contain a step by step procedure of how you desire the project to be resolved. After both of the mental videos have been completed, go to sleep with the intention of delivering the mental video to your tutor while you sleep. Take for granted that the delivery will be made. During the next three days, look for indications that point to the solution. Every time you think of the project, think of the solution that you created in the mental video in a past tense sense. You've practiced entering deep, healthy levels of mind. In your next session, you will enter a deeper, healthier level of mind faster and easier than this time. Every time you function at these levels of the mind and at these points of reference, you will receive beneficial effects physically and mentally. You may use these levels of the mind and these points of reference to help yourself physically and mentally. You may use these levels of the mind and these points of reference to help your loved ones physically and mentally. You may use these levels of the mind and these points of reference to help any human being who needs help physically and mentally. You will never use these levels of the mind or these points of reference to harm any human being. If this be your intention, you will not be able to function within these levels of the mind, nor will you be able to use these points of reference. You will always use these levels of the mind and these points of reference in a constructive, creative manner, for all that is good, honest, pure, clean and positive. And this is so. You will continue to strive to take part in constructive and creative activities to make this a better world to live in, so that when we move on, we should have left behind a better world for those who follow. You will consider the whole of humanity depending on their ages as fathers or mothers, brothers or sisters, sons or daughters. You are superior human being. You have greater understanding, compassion, and patience with others. In a moment, I'm going to count from one to five and cause a sound with my fingers. At that moment, you will open your eyes, be wide awake, feeling fine and in perfect health, feeling better than before. You will have no ill effects whatsoever in your head, no headache, no ill effects whatsoever in your hearing, no buzzing in your ears, no ill effects whatsoever in your vision and eyesight. Vision, eyesight and hearing improve every time you function at these levels of mind. One, two, coming up slowly now. Three. At the count of five, you will open your eyes be wide awake, feeling fine in perfect health, feeling better than before. Feeling the way you feel when you've slept the right amount of revitalizing, refreshing, relaxing, healthy, wonderful sleep. Four, five. Eyes open, wide awake feeling fine and in perfect health, feeling better than before. This concludes the projection to home exercise.

DAY 6: Centering Exercise 2

<v ->Welcome to day six. Today you’re going to be doing, the second
Centering Exercise. Now, you’ve done this exercise before. There will be
a tiny nuance, this time. I’m going to read to you what Jose Silva
called, Posts-Effect Standards. These are things that we are programming
into you, to feel, after you come out of this exercise. Everything else
is exactly the same, as a previous Centering Exercise. So, this is
what’s new and what you’re going to hear. And you will see a list of
these statements below this video. I’m going to program into you the
following sentences, “Every time you function at these levels of
mind,”you will receive beneficial effects “physically and mentally.”
“You may use these levels of mind”to help yourself, physically and
mentally.” “You may use these levels of mind”to help your loved ones,
physically and mentally.” “You may use these levels of mind”to help any
human being who needs help, “physically and mentally.” “You will never
use these levels of mind”to harm any human being.” “If this be your
intention,”you will not be able to function “within these levels of
mind.” “You will always use these levels of mind”in a constructive,
creative manner “for all that is good, honest, pure, clean and
positive.”And this is so.” “You will continue to strive”to take part in
constructive and creative activities, “to make this a better world to
live in,”so that when we move on, we shall have left behind “a better
world for those who follow.”You will consider the whole of humanity,
“depending on their ages, as fathers or mothers,”brothers or sisters,
sons or daughters. “You are a superior human being,”you have greater
understanding, compassion “and patience with others.” So, if you
listened carefully, you’ll notice that what Jose Silva is teaching you
to do is to really be, a person who is Other-Centered. In other words, a
person who is focused on healing and helping the world. Jose was aware
that these tools of mind, these powers that we can program ourselves to
use, can be used for selfish reasons or can be used for good. And he was
adamant about training people to use it for good. And this is why the
sense of being Other-Centered is so important. I want to pull in some
philosophies and ideas from other fellow Mindvalley teachers, who you
will find in the Mindvalley platform. The first is Neale Donald Walsch.
Neale has a program in our platform called Awakening The Species. And
one of the key ideas he shares is that, as we truly awaken, we start to
understand that we must make our lives about serving other people. “Your
life.” Says Neale, “Is not about you,”rather your life should be “about
the lives of everyone you touch.” Ken Wilber, the legendary philosopher
and also a teacher on the Mindvalley platform, explains it this way, he
says, “As we evolve as human beings,”we move from different levels of
consciousness.” Right at the bottom, is what he calls Egocentrism.
Egocentrism is where, you live your life just for yourself. Egocentrism
is found in about 1% of the human population. And it’s a very dangerous
way of living the world. People who operate at level of consciousness,
have no qualms against hurting someone else, to get what they want.
“Most people.” Says Ken, “70% of the world operate”at a slightly higher
level of consciousness, “called ethnocentrism.” And this is what it
looks like, it means that you’re compassionate, you’re kind, but in your
programming, you’re compassionate and kind towards people who fit your
idea of your religion, your national border or people who look like you.
So, you might be completely compassionate and kind to your neighbors,
but refugees, oh no, you don’t want those strange looking people moving
into your neighborhood. Now, we’re not saying that’s bad, that is 70% of
the world. But compassion and kindness, like a muscle, can be trained.
Ken says, “A level to move up to, is World Centrism.” World Centrism is
where, you extend your compassion and kindness to all people, of the
world. And so, you’re not just kind or compassionate to people of your
religion, you’re respectful, kind, compassionate to all religions, to
all people, to all nationalities. You don’t have any hangups towards
people who might be gay, or people who might be of a different religion,
or towards your son or daughter marrying someone who looks completely
different, that is World Centrism. Roughly 30% of the world is at the
World Centric level. And more and more of humanity, particularly younger
generations, are moving there, because our world and our humanity is
getting more and more connected. But there is a level above that,
Kosmocentrism. And perhaps that’s what Jose Silva meant, when he said,
“Our job is to create paradise on earth.” And perhaps that’s what he was
thinking when he embedded this line, in the programming statement, that
you’re about to experience in the Centering Exercise, “You will continue
to strive to make this world”a better place to live in “so that when we
move on, we would have left behind”a better world, for those who
follow.” That is Kosmocentrism. You’re not just compassionate and kind,
to people, in the world today, you’re thinking longterm, you’re thinking
multiple generations down. Things like global warming, bother you,
because you care, not just about the world today, but the world, future
generations will inhabit. Now, with that lesson from Neale Donald Walsch
and Ken Wilber, fellow philosophers and contemporaries of Jose Silva,
let’s go into the Centering Exercise. Find a comfortable position, relax
and we will begin. And when you’re done, you can choose to go about the
rest of your day and I will see you in the next lesson.

====================

DAY 7: The Compass & The Rocket

<v ->In this lesson, I’m going to share with you a powerful concept that
really makes Silva different from so many other programs out there. I
call this the compass and the rocket. See, in our modern world, we are
trained to set goals and then rocket towards these goals, to try to move
rapidly towards our goals. But the problem is this, very often when
you’re setting goals, these goals are not coming from you. These goals
are coming from the programming, of what I call the culturescape. The
tangled web of beliefs, rituals, ideas, programming from the society
around you. True goals don’t come from outside programming, true goals
come from within. So before you rocket towards your goals, it is
important to be able to access your compass and understand in what
direction you need to be rocketing towards. Tools that give you this
compass are tools of intuition and introspection. They help you question
the tendencies of the outside world and understand what is truly aligned
with your path. What makes all of us so different, is that it’s not
about raw goal setting, it’s not even about the law of attraction, or
manifesting with your mind. It’s primarily about aligning your compass,
listening to that intuitive impulse and understanding why you’re here,
what experiences your soul seeks to have, and in what direction you need
to move. And only when you have the compass, pointing in the right
direction, through techniques like the MentalVideo technique, do you
then rocket towards your goal. That’s what makes Silva different. Which
is why as part of this training, we spend so much time getting you to
fine tune your tendencies of intuition and teaching you techniques, that
help you find the right compass direction, such as the MentalVideo
technique. So today, it’s been three days since we last did the
MentalVideo technique. Ask yourself in the last three days, have you
noticed the answer to the thing you programmed for? Has that answer come
to you? Was it clear? If you’ve got an answer or feeled you have an
insight, or feeled that that problem is no longer a problem, go on and
choose another aspect of your life, that you want to apply the
MentalVideo to. If you did not get the right answer, and you feel that
problem persist, that’s perfectly okay. You get to repeat that same
MentalVideo today. You have the freedom to change the video a little
bit, to change what you’re asking for. That’s perfectly fine. But you
essentially going to apply the MentalVideo, to the same problem from
three days ago. So you get to decide, choose now if you want to apply
the MentalVideo, to a new problem or challenge to resolve that, or to
reapply to the earlier problem that you did three days ago. I’m going to
give you 60 seconds to decide and think about how you’re going to apply
the MentalVideo. And now, we’ll get started with the MentalVideo
technique. So again remember, there are two phases to this technique.
The first phase is at the waking data level. You going to create a video
first with your eyes open, and then replay that video with your eyes
closed. The second phase is done before you go to bed.

====================

Week 2: Theta Brainwaves and Waking Psychic Ability

====================

DAY 8: Harness Your Natural Intuitive Ability

<v ->Today we’re going to talk about intuition. So when we think about
intuition, we think about insights coming to us as visions. But what I
want you to understand is that while most people taking this program,
most of us have vision as a dominant sense, close to 50 plus percent of
the population, there are many of us whose dominant sense is not vision,
but touch or hearing or taste and you can receive intuitive ideas
through other senses too. So for example, if you are receiving intuitive
ideas primarily through visions such as imagery you get during a dream
or so on. That is sometimes called clairvoyance. But there are people
who are clairsentient, and they feel in their body their intuitive
impulses. Healers who are clairsentient, as they are healing you, they
might feel your pain as an impulse or an itch in their body. And then
there’s clairaudience. Clairaudience is when you hear your insight. Now,
whatever way your intuition comes to you is unique to you. And you may
get intuition in multiple forms. But I want to give you an idea of how
you might experience this. You might experience clairvoyance as you are
practicing the Silva method, when you are looking at your mental screen,
and you are attempting to heal someone. You might see, as I said before,
depression as a dark cloud around someone’s face. You might sense that
they have arthritis because when you look at their skeletal system, you
see tiny white powder. Now that’s not really what arthritis looks like,
but your subconscious mind speaks to you through symbolism. And so
arthritis is often seen as a white powdery type substance on the human
joint. That is sensory perception through clairvoyance. Now, here’s what
clairsentience might feel like. You feel clairsentience when you walk
into a room, and if that room is a joyous place, you might feel lighter
or giddy with excitement, but if there’s a negative energy in that room,
you might feel a nervousness or butterflies in your stomach. When we
talk about feelings in your gut, that’s often clairsentience. It’s an
actual sensation that something is right or something is off.
Clairaudience is one of the most interesting ones. I experienced this
shortly after training with Silva. What happened was I was driving a car
down a highway. And it must’ve been 2005 or 2006, I don’t remember the
exact year, but The Eyed Peas’ song, Humps came on the radio. Now if
you’ve heard the song, Humps, it is not a masterpiece of lyrics. The
lyrics are weird and repetitive, but the song is really good. And as I
was listening to the song, the lyrics caught my attention. I was trying
to understand what on earth Fergie meant by the lyrics she was saying.
And I took my mind off the road. All of a sudden, I heard a voice. I
don’t know where that voice came from. But the voice said, “Focus on the
road.” And it stern and it was sharp. I immediately knew what to do. I
got my mind off the lyrics of My Humps, and I focused on the road. And
just then, a car on my right got rear ended by a truck that was
traveling too fast. That car flipped in the air and landed directly in
front of me. And I had just enough time to veer out of the way, avoiding
a collision. Now, what was that sound? I was driving alone. There was no
one next to me. I don’t know to this day where that voice came from, but
I know it was clairaudience. It was a voice preventing me from a car
collision. So that’s how intuition can come into your life. It can come
true multimodalities, and that’s okay. Now in our next exercise
tomorrow, we’re going to start going further with training you on
intuition. And this time we’re going to look at discernment. We’re going
to have you project your awareness into different types of metal. We’re
going to train you to improve your capabilities, to visualize and to
imagine by comparing the differences between four types of metal;
aluminum, stainless steel, copper and brass. For each of these metals,
you’re going to pay attention to tiny differences; temperature, odor.
Now why are we doing this? Because we are training all of your senses of
perception at the spiritual plane. So for today, your homework is to
gather four pieces of metal and to study them in preparation for
tomorrow. If you want to go further today, you’re welcome to listen to
the short relaxation, but that’s not required. Today, what I want you to
do is to find these four pieces of metal. And we’ve made them really
easy. The first metal is copper. So copper is what you will find in
electric cable. It’s shiny, it’s sort of golden in its color, and it’s
quite soft, especially if you play with copper wires. Lincoln pennies,
if you live in the United States, Lincoln pennies were made of copper
from 1962 to 1982. After 1982 they changed it to primarily zinc, but for
two decades it was made of copper. So if you have a stash of Lincoln
pennies somewhere, look for coins between ’62 and ’82, and that’s 95%
copper. The next metal is brass. Brass is what door knobs are often made
of. It’s a shiny metal. While copper has a very distinctive odor, try
sniffing a Lincoln penny, one between ’62 and ’82. Brass is a little bit
more odorless and it’s really shiny. It’s also softer and it feels a
little bit different from copper. The third metal is really easy to get
your hands on. That’s stainless steel. Stainless steel is what cutlery
is made of. Stainless steel is practically everywhere. So just go to
your kitchen and odds are you will find a stainless steel piece of
cutlery. And the final metal is aluminum. Go to your kitchen and grab a
bunch of aluminum foil and just mash it up into a ball and use that as
your reference point for aluminum. Now for each of these four metals,
you’re going to study them in four dimensions. And this is something
we’re going to start doing today, and you may do it again tomorrow
before the projection exercise, just to refine the points of reference.
But for each of these metals, you’re going to study the following four
things. First, you’re going to hold it up, and you’re going to look at
light intensity and color. How does the light intensity and color of a
copper coin or a copper wire seem different from a brass door knob? Then
you’re going to study odor. Sniff the metals. What odor do you detect?
Then you’re going to study temperature. How do these metals feel in
terms of temperature? And finally, you’re going to study the thickness
of these metals. As you touch them with your fingertips and your nails,
do they feel hard or soft? You see tomorrow when we do this exercise,
you’re imagine this, if you’re tiny and you vented a giant building made
of each of these particular pieces of metal. And within this giant mass
of metal, you’re once again going to be looking at light intensity and
color, odor, temperature, and what sounds you hear when you knock on the
metal. So that’s it for today’s lesson. Go ahead and try to assemble
these four pieces of metal for tomorrow. And again, if you have time and
you want to go further, feel free to do the short relaxation exercise or
the centering exercise. You will find them available in the resources
section of this program. I’ll see you tomorrow.

====================

DAY 9: Projection to Metals

<v ->Today we’re go to a second projection exercise where you’ll be
projecting your consciousness into distinct types of metals. This is a
important exercise because not only are you going to be developing
points of references and fine tuning your visualization and imagination
ability, but you’re also going to learn how to develop intuitive ability
that’s called psychometry which, according to Jose Silva, is the idea
that you can hold an object, perhaps an object belonging to a loved one,
such as a ring or a watch, and perceive information related to questions
you ask. This can be a useful way to train your natural intuition. To
get you there, we’re going to start by having you project your awareness
to four different types of metal, and the four metals that you should
have selected yesterday are going to be stainless steel, copper, brass,
and aluminum. For each of these metals, you are going to study them in
terms of light intensity and color, what they look like essentially,
temperature, odor, you’re going to hold it to your nose and imagine what
smells you get, and finally, texture, how thick, how hard are they. Now
I’m going to guide you through the entire process, so you are not alone.
In this exercise, I’m also going to program to you the rules for
psychometry. How, as an intuitive, you can hold an object and perceive
information. Tomorrow, you’ll be given an exercise on psychometry. Today
is about fine tuning your consciousness to access material objects. Now,
they’ll be one unique difference as you go through this particular
exercise. We will now graduate you from the alpha sound to the theta
sound. Listen to the alpha sound again. Now listen to the theta sound.
You will see it’s half the speed. That’s because the theta sound is
designed to lower your brainwave frequencies from the alpha level, seven
to 14 cycles per second, to the theta level, four to seven cycles per
second. You are now training to get to theta and to stay awake. This is
a deeper level of mind, and it is at the theta level that intuition is
enhanced. You are now going to learn to function at the theta level. So,
let’s get started with this exercise. I want you to budget 30 to 35
minutes, and here’s how it’s going to work. You’re going to imagine as
if the piece of metal that you’ve been studying is in your hand, and I’m
going to ask you to objectively bring your hand, that means in your real
world, you’re not meditating with your hand down, you’re holding your
hand up and objectively bringing that piece of metal onto your forehead.
Now you don’t have to actually be holding the metal, keep the metal
aside. You’re imagining you’re holding the metal, but you’re moving your
physical hand to your forehead, and as you touch your forehead, you’re
imagining as if you have entered this metal, and this metal is as large
as a giant building, and that’s where we’re going to conduct the test.
And then, you’re going to imagine yourself coming out, and we will wrap
up the exercise. During this exercise you will hear some of the usual,
conditioning and positive statements that you heard in pervious
exercises, so there’ll be no surprises there. Let’s get ready to begin.
At this point, find a comfortable position, and we’re about to start.

====================

DAY 9 - MEDITATION: Projection to metals

- The Silva Ultramind Projection into Metals Exercise. We will start this exercise with the three, two, one method. Find a comfortable position, close your eyes, take a deep breath, and while exhaling, mentally repeat and visualize the number three, three times. To help you learn to relax physically at level three, I'm going to direct your attention to different parts of your body. Relax your scalp, relax your forehead, relax your eyes, relax your face, relax your throat, relax your shoulders, relax your chest externally and internally, relax your abdominal area externally and internally, relax your thighs, relax your knees, relax your calves, relax your feet. You are now at a deeper, healthier level of mind, deeper than before. This is your physical relaxation level three. Whenever you mentally repeat and visualized the number three, your body will relax as completely as you are now, and more so every time you practice. To enter mental relaxation level two, take a deep breath, and while exhaling, mentally repeat and visualize the number two, three times, and you're at level to a deeper level than three. Level two was for mental relaxation, when noises will not distract you, Instead, noises will help you to relax mentally more and more. To improve mental relaxation at level two, practice visualizing tranquil and passive scenes. Take another deep prep, and while exhaling, mentally repeat and visualize number one, three times. You are now at level one, a deeper, healthier level of mind, where you can function from your center. To help you enter a deeper, healthier level of mind, I'm going to count from 10 to one. On each descending number, you will feel yourself going deeper and you will enter a deeper, healthier level of mind. Ten, nine, feel going deeper, eight, seven, six, deeper and deeper, five, four, three, deeper and deeper, two, one. You're now at a deeper, healthier level of mind, deeper than before. It is a wonderful feeling to be deeply relaxed, a very healthy state of being. Effective sensory projection statements for success. I'm now learning to attune my intelligence by developing my sensing faculties and to project them to any point or place on this planet so as to be aware of any actions taking place, if this is necessary and beneficial for humanity. I am now learning to attune my intelligence by developing my sensing faculties and to project them to any point or place on any planet within the solar system, any solar system within the galaxy, and any galaxy within the universe, so as to be aware of any actions taking place, if this is necessary and beneficial for humanity. I am now learning to attune my intelligence by developing my sensing faculties and to project them to the different matter kingdoms, the inanimate matter kingdom, any of its levels and depths, the animate matter kingdom with reproductive intelligence, plant life and animal life, any of its levels and depths, and the animate matter kingdom with reproductive intelligence and an awareness of existence, the human body and mind kingdom, any of its little send depths. I am now learning to detect abnormalities whenever such abnormalities exist within any kingdom, any level and any depth, if this is necessary and beneficial for humanity. I'm now learning to apply corrective measures and to bring back to normalcy any abnormality found within any kingdom, any level and any depth, if this is necessary and beneficial for humanity. Negative thoughts and negative suggestions have no influence over me at any level of the mind. The following are laws to be considered when programming. You should do to others only what you like others to do to you. The solution must have to make this planet a better place to live, it must be the best for everybody concerned, it must help at least two or more persons, it must be within the possibility area. The following principles apply to programming. Objective physical communication takes place at the beta left brain dimension using the objective physical census. The hearing is used for perception and the voice is used for transmission. Subjective spiritual communication takes place at your center, the alpha right brain dimension by using the spiritual senses. Visualization as use for perception and imagination is used for transmission. In the objective physical dimension, the past is behind us, the present is our present position and the future is ahead of us. In the subjective spiritual dimension, the past is to your right, the present is sent it straight ahead, and the future is to your left. We will now program effective sensory projection for your success and program information with the use of mental projection for your benefit. We will establish subjective points of reference at the inanimate matter kingdom at different levels and depths for stainless steel, copper, brass and aluminum. In a moment, I'm going to count from one to three, and course a sound with my fingers. At that time, you will project yourself mentally to your living room in your home, and imagine yourself standing in the center facing the selected wall. One, two, three. You are now standing in the center of your living room, facing the selected wall. At the count of three, you'll extend your arm objectively and visualized a piece of stainless steel. One, two, three. Extend your arm objectively and visualized a piece of stainless steel. Mentally sense the piece of stainless steel and relive and objectively repeat all the movements made previously. Bring it closer and closer to your forehead. Mentally observed the steel, a few inches away. Now allow it to touch your forehead and mentally project yourself into the stainless steel. You are now within the piece of stainless steel. You may return your hand to rest on your lap. If you imagine the piece of stainless steel to be just big enough for you to fit in, then you will not go very deeply inside. But if you imagine the piece of steel as big as this room, then you can go further within. If you will imagine this piece of steel to the us large as a massive building and feel your size and contrast with it, then you can go still further within using the depth that this dimension of mind offers. Whenever you need to increase the illimination or amount or size of anything, just snap the fingers of your right hand slightly and expect the change to take place. For decrease or return anything back to its original state, snap the fingers of your left hand slightly and expect the change to take place. Whatever you perceive with your imagination at this dimension, you can use as a point of reference in the future. At this time, we are going to subjectively conduct four tests. The first test will be for light intensity and color. One, two, three. Sense the intensity and color of light within the stainless steel, whatever you perceive with your imagination at this dimension, you can use as a point of reference in the future. At the of three, we will test for temperature. One, two, three. Sense the temperature within the stainless steel. Whatever you perceive with your imagination at this dimension, you can use as a point of reference in the future. At the count of three, we will test for odor. One, two, three. Sense the odor within the stainless steel. Whatever you perceive with your imagination at this dimension, you can use as a point of reference in the future. At the count of three, we will test the solidity of material by knocking on the stainless steel. One, two, three. Objectively form a fist, and go through the motions of knocking on the stainless steel as you do on a wall. What kind of sound do you subjectively here? Whatever you perceive with your imagination at this dimension, you can use as a point of reference in the future. At the count of three, you will objectively touch your forehead. One, two, three. Touch your forehead. You are now coming out of the stainless steel. Objectively extend your arm and allow the imaginary piece of steel to float in space by itself at a level a little higher than the horizontal plane or level of sight. You'll return your hand to rest on your lap. How does the piece of stainless steel stand out against the natural color of the wall? Keep the piece of stainless steel rotating in your imagination. Keep it moving, keep it dynamic. At the count of three the color of the wall will change to red. One, two, three. The wall is now red. Keep the piece of steel rotating, noticing how it stands out against a red background. At the count of three, the color of the wall will change the green. One, two, three. The wall is now green. Notice how the piece of rotating steel stands out against the green background. At the count of three, the color of the wall will change to blue. One, two, three. The wall is now blue. Notice how the piece of rotating steel stands out against the blue background. The color of the wall will change back to green. Back to red. Back to the actual color off the wall. Now the piece of stainless steel will disappear from the scene. The piece of stainless steel has disappeared from the scene. At the count of three, we will play back the impressions made with copper. One, two, three. Extend your arm objectively, mentally play back the previous impressions made, with copper. Repeat every movement. Bring your hand closer and closer. Now, touch your forehead and mentally project yourself into the piece of copper. In your imagination, you are now within the piece of copper, any depth of this level you desire. You may return your hand to rest on your lap. Remember to use your finger snapping controls, to increase in decrease as necessary. At the count of three we'll conduct a first test. One, two, three. Sense the intensity and color of light within copper. How does the light within copper compare with that of stainless steel? Whatever you perceive with your imagination at this dimension, you can use as a point of reference in the future. At the count of three, test for temperature. One, two, three. Sense the temperature within copper. How does the temperature of copper compare with that of stainless steel?

How does the odor of copper compare with that of stainless steel? Whatever you perceive with your imagination at this dimension, you can use as a point of reference in the future. At the count of three, test for solidity of material. One, two, three. Objectively form a fist and knock on copper. How does the imagined sound of copper compare with that of stainless steel? Whatever you perceive with your imagination at this dimension you can use as a point of reference in the future. At the count of three, touch your forehead to come out of the piece of copper. One, two, three. Touch your forehead, you are now coming out of the copper. Extend your arm and hold the piece of copper at arm's length. Now allow the piece of copper to float in space using as a background, the natural color of your living room wall. Keep the piece of copper rotating. You can return your hand to rest on your lap. At the count of three, the color of the wall will change the red. One, two, three. The wall is now red. How does this piece of copper stand out against a red background?

Now the piece of copper will disappear from the scene. The piece of copper has disappeared from the scene. At the count of three, we'll visualized the piece of brass. One, two three. Extend your arm objectively and visualized the piece of brass reliving all your previous movements as you bring your hand closer and closer. Now touch your forehead and mentally project yourself into the brass. You are now within the brass at any depth or level you desire. You may return your hand to rest on your lap. At the count of three, we will conducted first test. One, two, three. Sense the intensity and color of light within brass. How does the light within brass compare with that of copper and stainless steel? Whatever you perceive with your imagination at this dimension, you can use as a point of reference in the future.

At the count of three, the color of the wall will change to blue. One, two, three. The wall is now blue. How does the piece of aluminum stand out against the blue background? How does this compare with brass, copper and stainless steel? Keep the piece of aluminum rotating. The color of the wall will now change back to green. Back to red. Back to the actual color of the wall. Now the piece of aluminum will disappear from the scene. The piece of aluminum has disappeared from the scene. Whatever you perceive with your imagination at this dimension, you can use as points of reference in the future. It is now an accomplished fact that the subjective points of reference have been established at the inanimate matter kingdom at different levels and different depths. To function at these levels and to use these points of reference, all you need is to have a sincere desire to solve problems. Your mind will automatically seek out these points of reference, where you will perceive and become aware of information you can use to solve such problems and this is so. We will now impress information for your benefit. How do you psychometry, a technique that you can use to detect information. First, select an object that has been in the possession of the person about whom you desire to detect information, and hold this object in your left hand. Then enter your level with the three, two, one method. Once at your level, determine what information you are seeking. For instance, is the information that you desire is physical, mental or emotional. Relax, and start thinking about the person who previously had this object in their possession. You may ask any kind of question you desire about this person. Then clear your mind for a moment of time, and start thinking again to detect the answer. When you have a sincere desire to detect this information, because you needed to improve conditions on the planet in some manner, your mind will automatically adjusted to the specific level where you will be accurate and correct. Programming technique, the mental video technique that you can use for problem solving. Whenever you need to solve a problem with the mental video technique, enter level one with the three, two, one method, when you are in bed and ready to go to sleep. Once you are at level one, review the mental video that you created off the problem at beta. After you have reviewed the problem, mentally convert the problem into a project, then create with imagination a mental video of the solution. The mental video of the solution should contain a step by step procedure of how you desire the project to be resolved. After both of the metal videos have been completed, go to sleep with the intention of delivering the mental videos to your higher intelligence while you sleep. Take for granted that the delivery will be made. During the next three days, look for indications that pointed the solution. Every time you think of the project, think of the solution that you created in the mental video in a past tense sense. You have practiced entering deep, healthy levels of mind. In your next session, you will enter a deeper, healthier level of mind, faster and easier than this time. Every time you function at these levels of mind and at these points of reference, you'll receive beneficial effects physically and mentally. You may use these levels of the mind and these points of reference to help yourself physically and mentally. You may use these levels of the mind and these points of reference to help your loved ones physically and mentally. You may use these levels of the mind and these points of reference to help any human being who needs help physically and mentally. You will never use these levels of the mind or these points of reference to harm any human being. If this be your intention, you will not be able to function within these levels of the mind, nor will you be able to use these points of reference. You will always use these levels of the mind and these points of reference in a constructive creative manner for all that is good, honest, pure, clean and positive, and this is so. In a moment, I'm going to count from one to five, and course a sound with my fingers. At that moment, you will open your eyes, be wide awake, feeling fine and in perfect health, feeling better than before. You will have no ill effects whatsoever in your head. No headache, no ill effects whatsoever in your hearing, no buzzing in your ears, no ill effects whatsoever in your vision and eye sight. Vision, eyesight and hearing improve every time you function at these levels of mind. One, two, coming out slowly now, three, at the count of five, you will open your eyes, be wide awake, feeling fine and in perfect health, feeling better than before, feeling the way you feel when you've slept the right amount of revitalizing, refreshing, relaxing, healthy, wonderful sleep, four, five. Eyes open, wide awake, feeling fine and in perfect health, feeling better than before. This concludes the projection into metals exercise for the Silva Ultramind System.

====================

DAY 10: The Three Scenes Technique

<v ->At this point, you’ve gone through some formidable mental training,
your mind is already shifting, your belief structures are shifting, your
ability to perceive information and to project information has gone
through a significant upgrade. Now, today we’re going to teach you a new
technique. This is called The Three Scenes Technique. You’ve already
learned how to create a mental screen. You’ve learned the mental video
technique, which helps you make better decisions and helps you tap into
higher intelligence at the delta level to solve problems in life. What
you’re going to learn today is The Three Scenes Technique. Now, this is
actually a smaller technique, and it’s used for smaller challenges, but
it can be extremely useful. You use The Three Scenes Technique to
reprogram your beliefs and to solve problems where you know exactly what
you want. So again, remember, when you have an intractable problem, and
you don’t really know what is the right way to resolve it, use the
mental video technique, you’re calling on higher intelligence, but you
can have a quick problem that you want to resolve and you know what you
want, you’re going to use the three scenes technique, which you can do
in three to five minutes. And today, you’re going to learn this
technique. So, here are some applications for the three scenes
technique. I’ll start with this story. The three scenes technique is
remarkably useful for retraining your mind and creating new habits.
Habits can be programmed into your mind more easily when you’re at the
alpha level of mind. When I first started teaching Silva, I learned of a
Silva student who lived in Texas. His name was Jason and he was addicted
to Coca Cola. I kid you not, Coca Cola can be highly addictive. And
Jason had to consume two giant 1.5 liter bottles of Coke every single
day. Now, Coke is filled with so much sugar and it’s filled with so many
chemicals, which we today know are just downright awful for the human
body, no human being should be putting Coke in your body at all. But
Coke is highly addictive and they are advertising blatantly lies to the
public, getting people hooked, associating their drink and their brand
with emotion. So, Jason had started putting on weight and he knew he
needed to do something to curb this Coke addiction. So, Jason had signed
up for the Silva Ultra Mind lecture, and he learned about this three
scenes technique. So, this is what he did, right? Now, in the three
scenes technique, you’re reprogramming your mind. It starts with the
mental screen, but what you’re going to do is you’re going to use time
orientation to program your subconscious on how you want your future to
unfold. So, you start with the mental screen directly in front of you,
20 degrees above the line of horizon, at least six feet in front of you.
Big, beautiful, bold. And in the first scene of the three scenes
technique, you’re going to see the current situation. So, Jason would
see himself drinking two liters of Coke every single day. Now, as you
see that current situation, you want to exaggerate it, you want to make
it almost ridiculously humorous, weird, or awful. You want to exaggerate
the pain. So, Jason might see himself guzzling Coke, showering himself
in Coca Cola. He might see himself gaining weight like a balloon. He
might see his wife disgusted at how he looks. He’s exaggerating the
pain. But the next thing you do is you’re going to move that screen 15
degrees to the left. Remember, at the subconscious, spiritual dimension,
the left represents the future. So, you’re moving that screen 15 degrees
to the left. And in this screen, you are seeing an action that you can
take to change the situation. So, Jason knew that the action was really
simple, cut down on consuming Coke. So, in the second scene, he saw
himself making a promise to his wife that he would go from two bottles a
day to one bottle a day. That said, that was an easy promise to fulfill,
much easier than going completely off that dangerous substance. So, he
went from two bottles to one bottle. And then, he moves to scene another
15 degrees to the left. This is the final scene, the third scene. This
is why it’s called the three scenes technique. And in that final scene,
a further 15 degrees to the left, Jason saw the end result. He no longer
drank Coke. At lunch, at dinner, he’d be drinking a glass of sparkling
water, he no longer need sugar for energy, he is in an incredible
relationship with his wife. She’s so proud of him, and all of those
changes have happened. He might further see himself walking through a
grocery store, seeing Coke and feeling a sense of disgust at how awful
that drink is. Now, this is what actually happened in Jason’s life, he’d
had this addiction for years. In two weeks, he completely went off Coca
Cola. He could no longer stand that drink, and it only took two weeks.
Now, he did this using the three scenes technique, which you’re about to
learn. Again, first scene, you see the current situation, you exaggerate
it. Move it 15 degrees to the left, and what you’re now going to see is
you taking some action to improve the condition. You move it another 15
degrees to the left, and you see the final result. Now, this technique
is done over several days, but every day when you do it, you’re going to
upgrade the first scene to reflect any changes that have taken place.
So, by the time Jason got to day five or six, he was able to cut down
from one bottle to half a bottle. So, in that first scene, he would no
longer see himself consuming and chugging two bottles of coke, he would
see half a bottle. As he got today 12 and 13, he only needed half a
glass of Coca Cola a day. So, in that first scene, he would see himself
consuming this half a glass of coke, but still feeling sick and
disgusting for putting that substance in his body. So, you keep fine
tuning and reflecting that first scene to show the current situation as
the situation improves. Now, you can use this exercise for healing. You
can use it for habit shifting. You can use it for manifesting. But it
works the same way. Three scenes, and you’re gently moving the scene 15
degrees from the front of you towards your left. The three scenes is
essentially an advanced tactic for creative visualization. And there are
so many studies that show that creative visualization can have a
profound impact on your life, and your body, and your health, and
healing. This is so much more powerful because you’re using the three
scenes concept, so you’re programming your mind in the right way, but
also because you’re doing it at alpha and theta levels of mind. As
you’re going deeper into your center, the effects that this has on
reprogramming your brain is so much more powerful. Habits that you’ve
been trying to kick for a long time, you’re suddenly able to reprogram
because of this technique. I’ve received thousands of stories from
students who have used this technique for multiple healings. There was a
guy who used this to reverse his eyesight. He went from needing glasses
to having 2020 vision. There was a woman who used this to heal psoriasis
of her skin. There were people who used this to break through a glass
ceiling in their career and become super performance at work. There were
others who used this to improve and enhance their dating life and their
love life. You choose how you’re going to use this technique, but the
practice is always the same, three scenes. Now, the action can be
symbolic. For example, let’s say you’re trying to heal an illness and
the doctor has given you medication, Jose Silva, by the way says always
see your doctor. Never try to use this technique to replace modern
medicine. Use it together with modern medicine. So, let’s say you have a
cold and you’re trying to recover from that cold. First scene, you might
see yourself with the sniffles, but exaggerate it. See yourself sneezing
all over the place. Second scene, the doctor’s given you some
medication. Imagine yourself taking that medication but exaggerate it.
Imagine that that medication is like a magic pill, as it goes into your
body, it radiates light and heals your body. Final scene, see yourself
breathing well, no allergies, no sniffles, no cold, no flu. So, you can
do this in multiple ways, but play with it. Use symbolism, use
exaggeration, bring in full color, bring in all your senses, bring in
emotions. Here are some studies that show how powerful creative
visualization can be. There was an experiment done on Soviet athletes at
the Winter Olympics at Lake Placid. So, the athletes experimented with
four different ways of training. Model A was 100% physical training.
Model B was 75% physical, 25% mental rehearsal. Model C was 50/50. And
model D, get this, was 25% real world physical training, 75% mental
rehearsal. When their improvements were measured, it was shown that the
group with the highest improvements was Group D, the one that spent 75%
of their training mental. In another famous study by Australian
psychologist, Alan Richardson, on basketball players, he divided players
into three groups. Group A practiced for 20 minutes a day. Group B had
no practice. And Group C practiced mentally for 20 minutes a day. Can
you guess which group performed best? The first group, the one that
practiced physically on the court, saw a 25% improvement. Group B, that
didn’t practice at all, saw no improvement. Now here’s the funny thing,
Group C that practiced basketball sitting on a chair with mental
visualization, saw a 24% improvement, just 1% less than Group A. Mental
visualization has an incredible impact on your body and your
performance. And when you apply it at the alpha level, using the three
scenes technique, you magnify that result. So, today we’re going to
practice the three scenes technique. At this point, I want you to pick a
problem where you know clearly what the problem is and what that end
result should be. It could be a habit that you want to shed. It could be
a healing that you want to experience. It could be improving your
performance at work or at sports. It could be improving your
relationship with someone. Pick a problem that you want to turn into a
project now. I’m going to give you 60 seconds. I’m now going to guide
you into using the three scenes technique. Sit down, find a comfortable
position. Close your eyes. And I want you to now see the number three,
three times. Three, three, three. You’re now experiencing physical
relaxation. Now, see the number two three times. Two, two, two. You’re
now mentally relaxed. Now, see the number one, three times. One, one,
one. You’re now at your center. Directly in front of you, you see your
mental screen. Project onto your mental screen the problem that you’re
seeking to resolve. See that problem, feel the pain. I want you to now,
as I snap my fingers, make the color brighter and more vivid. One, two,
three, , color is brighter and more vivid. I want you to now feel the
emotions of this problem. Feel the negative emotions that you want to
remove from your life, feel the pain. Feel the regret, feel the
suffering. Exaggerate the problem to magnify the emotion. By seeing the
problem and feeling the pain, you’re creating greater desire within you
to heal the situation. Exaggerate the pain. See how the problem is
affecting other people in your life. And feel how it’s preventing you
from truly being the best version of you you can be so you can give your
gifts to the world. Exarate the problem. Feel the pain. Now, stop . I
want you to move your mental screen 15 degrees to the left. And now see
yourself taking some action to resolve this problem. See yourself taking
any baby step towards resolving the problem. Perhaps you’re looking at
starting a business. A baby step might be registering a domain name.
Maybe you’re looking at improving your emotional status. A baby step
might be meditating every single day. Or maybe you’re looking at
improving your relationship with someone. A baby step might be being
courageous enough to have that first difficult conversation. As you see
yourself taking the baby steps and taking some action towards resolving
the situation, see the colors getting brighter and more vivid. See other
senses involved. What do you hear? What do you smell? Where are you? Who
is around you? What do you feel as you’re taking this baby step? And
now, as I snap my fingers, you’re going to move to the third scene,
again 15 degrees to the left. One, two, three . Now, in this third
scene, see the problem having resolved itself. Feel the emotions and the
feelings, knowing that this problem is gone. How do you feel? How are
you celebrating? See how the resolution of this problem is helping other
people. Which other lives are getting better because this problem has
been healed? See color. Feel emotion. Keep the visualization bright and
bold. Feel the joy, a feeling of victory, a feeling of success, knowing
that this problem is no more and that the solution is now your new
reality. In later lessons, we will go into more intricacies of this
particular technique. And we will go into further ways to use this
technique for specific things, such as healing. At the count of five,
you will now come out. You will be wide awake, feeling fine and in
perfect health, feeling better than before. One, two, three, ready to
come out, four, five , eyes open, wide awake, feeling fine and in
perfect health, feeling better than before. Congratulations, you’ve now
learned the three scenes technique. Tomorrow, we’ll go into further
nuances of this three scenes technique, and tomorrow, you’ll be applying
this technique once more for the same problem or a different problem.
I’ll see you then.

====================

DAY 11: When to Use Each Technique

<v ->Welcome to day 11. Today we’re going to deeper in the Three Scenes
Technique. So you’re pretty used to Three Scenes Technique to work on
the problem, now I’m going to go deeper in explaining the nuances of
this technique plus some updated philosophies and research since the
time Jose Silva first created this technique. one of our teachers here
in Mind Valley is the Reverend Michael Beckwith. Michael Beckwith was a
teacher in the hit film, The Secret and around 15 years after that movie
came out I met up with Beckwith at a Mind Valley event in Portugal and I
asked him about the law of attraction. You see, when people think about
the Three Scenes Technique what they often believe is going on is that
they are using the law of attraction to pull to them the reality that
they want but that day in Portugal as I had breakfast with Michael, he
actually said you know Vishen, the law of attraction is incomplete, the
universe doesn’t give you what you want, the universe rather gives you
who you are. He says don’t think about the law of attraction, rather
think about the law of resonance, the universe will resonate with who
you are and as I thought about what Beckwith said, it started to occur
to me I’d been teaching Silva for many years and what made the Three
Scenes Technique truly work was not so much that you had your thoughts
focused on what you want, rather the Three Scenes Technique was changing
your identity of who you are. In the example yesterday of that guy who
used the technique to give up his Coca-Cola addiction, in the technique
he was rewiring his identity as someone who needed Coca-Cola and sugar
to someone who was healthy and enjoyed consuming water. It was the
identity shift but that identity shift is causing a ripple in reality,
bending reality to use my terminology to make the universe reflect on
who you are. So when you apply the Three Scenes Technique you’re
fundamentally changing your sense of identity, you’re rewiring beliefs,
you’re removing bad habits but you’re doing it by reprogramming your
mind the way you reprogram a computer to change your identity of who you
truly are, that is perhaps why this technique works. So remember, don’t
think law of attraction, think law of resonance. Now there are
implications here on how you use the technique. If you think law of
attraction, you might assume that you want to use the Three Scenes
Technique for as long as possible every single day focused on a
particular problem to project but that’s not actually the case, as you
start learning how to use this technique to rapidly shift your identity,
you often only need to do it once, do it once and when you step out of
your center and you go forth into the world as long as you feel the
right attitudes and beliefs, as long as you think of the problem in the
past tense sense, as long as you feel the problem is resolved your
identity has shifted, that problem is no longer in your life and you
will see the resolution occur fast but if you do the technique and then
you get off your meditation cushion or your bed and you go in the world
and you’re asking yourself, did it really work? Did it really work? That
means you haven’t truly shifted your identity, it hasn’t therefore
worked. So you probably want to do it a second time that day or a third
time but don’t measure your practice by how often you’re doing the Three
Scenes Technique because that’s not about repeated one thing, rather
measure your practice by how you feel when you step out of the Three
Scenes Technique and if you feel good, if you can think of the problem
in the past tense sense your identity has shifted, you effectively
become a new you minus the problem and that’s when the universe will
reflect that new reality. So today we’re going to go into the Three
Scenes Technique with this new nuance of understanding and I’m going to
show you how to apply the technique on a day-to-day basis because that’s
where magic happens. You do not want to use the Silva techniques only
when you have a difficult problem, all of us, if we have a career, if we
have a life, if we have a family, have day-to-day projects that matter
to us. It may be something as simple as going out on a weekend with your
children and having the most amazing time but your responsible for that
as the adult or it may be showing up at work and leading a project or
delivering a solution and doing it in the most effective way, these are
perfect opportunities to apply the Three Scenes Technique. I like to
apply the technique in the morning when I wake up. I sit in my space of
meditation, I do the three, two, one countdown exercise, I go deep and
then what I do is, I think about what I need to accomplish that day and
I pick the biggest item, it may be a project, it may be solving an
engineering problem, it may be a meeting I have to run or a speech I
need to give or a chapter of my book I need to write and I apply the
Three Scenes Technique to turn that problem into a project and to see it
resolving itself in the most elegant and beautiful way and then as I
show up that day, I find that the day seems to go magically well, almost
as if it’s been blessed. So you’re going to do the same thing. Today if
you’re listening to this meditation before you start your day I want you
to think of your biggest task for today or if you’re listening to this
before going to bed, I want you to think of your biggest task for
tomorrow. I’m going to give you 30 seconds. Now with that task in mind,
we’re going to apply the Three Scenes Technique to take this project and
make it unfold in the most beautiful way. I’m going to guide you into
your center, this time rather than just do the three, two, one
technique, we’re also going to do the 10 to one deepening exercise and
once you’re at your center, we’re going to apply the Three Scenes
Technique to your biggest project of the day. Let’s get started. Find a
comfortable position, relax, close your eyes. I want you to now see the
number three, three times. Three. Three. Three. You’re now physically
relaxed. Now see the number two, three times. Two. Two. Two. You’re now
in a state of mental relaxation. Now see the number one, three times.
One. One. One. You’re now at your center. To allow you to go deeper I’m
going to count from 10 to one. At each descending number you will go
deeper and deeper. 10, nine, eight, going deeper, seven, six, five,
deeper and deeper, three, two, one. You’re now at a deep level of mind.
Bring to mind a problem that you wish to turn into a project and see
resolved in the most beautiful way possible. On your mental screen in
it’s current position directly in front of you, see the current reality
where the problem exist or the situation that you’re aiming for has yet
to be created, feel the pain, see full colors. Feel the sense of boredom
or frustration or pain or whatever negative feeling you’re associating
with the problem that you wish to eliminate. See how other people are
effected by this problem. See their frustration. Exaggerate the pain,
make it almost comical, funny or weird. Now, move your mental screen 15
degrees to the left and on your mental screen, see yourself taking some
action to resolve the problem. It could be a tiny baby step but see
yourself taking some action. As you take this action, think of the
problem as turning into a project. A project that you have the
capabilities to resolve. See other people involved and how you taking
this action is starting to benefit other people. If resolving this
problem involves for example, holding a meeting at work, see that
meeting happening and going perfectly well. If it’s you taking some
decisive action on your own, see yourself taking that action, what are
doing? How are you feeling? Make the image bigger. Make the colors more
vivid. Feel emotions. Now move the scene 15 degrees to the left and see
the final result. Feel the joy, the sense of victory, the happiness
knowing that this problem is now resolved. See other people benefiting.
How are your loved ones, your colleagues, other people around you
benefiting because this problem is no longer so. See the final solution
creating joy and happiness for everyone involved. Make it brighter. Make
the colors more vivid. Feel emotion. See other people and see how lit up
they are. As you wrap up, you may use a positive statement such as let
this or something better happen. Focus on the emotions, feel the
emotions inside you. Imagine how you would feel after having resolved
this problem. And you can now close the scene. I’m now going to bring
you out of your center by counting from one to five. One, two, three,
ready to come out, feeling wide awake, feeling better than before, four,
five, eyes open, wide awake, feeling better than before. You are now
done with the Three Scenes Technique. As you go forth in your
day-to-day, think of the problem in the past tense sense and act and
function as if the solution is already happening and I’ll see you
tomorrow.

====================

DAY 12: Centering Exercise 3

<v ->Welcome to day 12. Today, you’re going to do the third Centering
Exercise, you’re almost at the midpoint of this program. So
congratulations. Every time you do these centering exercises, you are
training your mind to go deeper, and to stay at deeper levels of mind.
This centering exercise is going to be done with the theta sound, so
you’re going to go even deeper. And while alpha is an amazing state for
wellness, for inspiration, when you get to theta, what often happens and
what scientists are observing is that creativity, insight and intuition
flows even better Theta however, it can be a hard state to stay in, some
people fall asleep. Some people go to theta and pull back out to alpha.
We’re going to play the theta sound because you’re learning to go into
deeper and deeper levels of mind, from alpha to theta while staying
awake and fully conscious. So, congratulations for coming this far. And
we’re going to now begin with the centering exercise. After you’re done
with the centering exercise, if you so feel like it, and if you have
time today, I encourage you to do the mental video technique. It’s now
been three days since your last mental video. So feel free to do the
mental video technique and to make it easy for you, after the centering
exercise, I’m going to leave a recording of me guiding you through the
mental video on the same chapter, but that is purely optional and up to
you. For now, let’s get started with the third centering exercise.

====================

DAY 13: Develop Psychometry to Read Objects by Touching Them

<v ->Welcome to day 13. Today is the day where you’re going to
experiment with a concept called psychometry. Psychometry essentially
means this it’s being able to take an object by someone in this case,
say a watch to be able to hold that in the palm of your hand and get
intuitive impulses on that person. Only impulses that that person’s soul
wants you to know so that you can help heal them or help them in life.
You can never access information that you’re not meant to know. But this
is called psychometry and it’s been happening for countless years across
multiple cultures. Shamans, sages, mystics have used this ability with
their hands to feel objects and receive information. We cannot fully
explain how it works, but we know it does work. I’ve seen amazing things
happen in Silva classes during the psychometry session. Basically it
works like this. Everyone in the class at the end of day one is paired
up. So you have groups of two, one person takes turn being the psychic,
the other takes turn being the orientologist or guide. Now the guide
will take an object. It could be a watch, it could be a ring but it’s
typically an object that they’ve had with them for a while. They wrap it
up in paper, the psychic goes to their level and when the psychic is
ready, the psychic says I’m ready and holds out their hand, the
orientologist or guide, places the object wrapped in paper in the
psychic’s hand. The psychic of course can’t see the object it’s wrapped
in paper. But the psychic then has to at their Alpha level say whatever
images or thoughts come to mind. So at that class in Menlo park in one
session, the psychic said, I see white clouds and a blue sky. And I feel
as if I’m floating in between these white clouds in this blue sky, when
that person opened the object, it was an airline ticket. How cool is
that? Another one was even more interesting. The psychic said, I simply
see the number eight. I can’t understand it. I simply see the number
eight. The object when it was unwrapped was a key chain with an eight
ball on it. And yet another session, the psychic didn’t see anything at
all. The psychic simply heard the phrase break back, break back. It
turned out that the object was a ring that had belonged to the brother
of the guy who was working with that psychic. And that brother had
broken his back in a gym injury several months before. So that’s how
psychometry works. Now, it sounds like a parlor trick, right? I don’t
expect you to be going through life, asking people to hand you objects
and you attempting to read them. The only reason for doing this at the
Silva class is so that students understand early on how powerful their
minds can be. Now, not everyone is going to have success when you’re
doing in a large group at a Silva class. What we find is that typically
50% of people have some sort of success. But remember, if you don’t have
success the first time, you can try it again and you can try it again.
As we go further in this program, you will learn how to use psychometry
and how to use a more advanced technique called casework in which we’ll
come to around day 21 to really fine tune your psychic ability so that
you have waking psychic ability. This means on a day to day level, as
you’re just walking through life, you get intuitive impulses. Here’s an
example of waking psychic ability. I was in a trip in Egypt and I was
walking by myself and I was about to cross a bridge on the River Nile.
All of a sudden I heard an impulse and I can’t describe whether it was a
voice or it was like a thought that hit me and it said turn around. So I
turned around and immediately, I bumped into an Egyptian man and he
smiled at me and said, where are you from? I told him where I was from.
And he’s like, wow, that’s a very beautiful country. Would you like to
join me for dinner? I joined this man for dinner and it turned out he
was an archeologist looking to find the spot for Alexander the Great’s
tomb now I’m a big history fan, a big Alexander the Great history buff.
So I had such an incredible dinner. And so waking psychic ability was
just that it was an impulse telling me to turn around and these impulses
start coming into your life, and sometimes it may lead to an interesting
dinner, sometimes it may lead to something bigger, a new product or new
service that you might come up with for your business. So you never know
that you want to train waking psychic ability because it ends up being
this incredible benevolent guide that helps you in life. So here’s how
you’re going to do psychometry. The first step is you have to find a
partner who you trust. It could be a spouse, it could be a family
member. Tell someone about this program and ask them if they’re willing
to participate with you in this simple exercise. They have to be honest,
they have to be non-judgmental and they have to be supportive of you. So
pick someone that’s a dear friend. Now this person is going to meet you
at your home or you’re going to go to their home and they’re going to
find an object and they’re going to wrap it in paper. An ideal object
might be a watch, it might be a bracelet. It might be a ring, but an
object is going to be wrapped in paper. Those objects are the best
because they’ve been in touch with your friend. But it could be any
object, even a family heirloom. Now what you’re going to do is they’re
going to hold on to that object while you relax and go to your center.
You’re going to enter your center with the three, two, one method. And
when you’re ready, you’re going to hold out your hand and simply say,
I’m ready. They’re going to place the object in your hand. Once you have
the object in your hand, you’re going to relax and desire to detect
information about the object or the person who had the object. So you
want to pick something that you’re not obviously going to know. If it’s
a friend, you might know a lot of information about them. So try to
detect information about the object itself. Where might your friend have
acquired it? What was the significance of the object? Who had the object
before it was passed to your friend? Who gave it to your friend? If the
object is someone that you don’t know, so your friend is handing you an
object that might belong to their friend or their spouse. And you don’t
necessarily know that person you could choose to detect information on
that person. What did they look like? What is their gender? Their age,
color, complexion, type of hair? Now, whatever ideas come to you, speak
it out. If you see blackness, just say blackness. If you hear a sound as
desires of sounds such as break back, just say it. If you see something
completely odd, like the number eight, just speak it out. What tends to
happen, is that intuition is like guessing, feels as if you’re guessing.
Often the first impulse that comes to your mind is the most accurate
one. If you have to think about it, you’re bringing in your logical
mind. Now, psychometry is such a basic skill that an untrained person
can be accurate enough one out of five times. If you are trained, you
can be accurate up to four out of five times. In terms of how you
describe a person or how you describe their living space or how you
describe the object, make sure your friend is supportive. If you have a
hit, your friend should congratulate you and go great, that’s accurate,
I have that information. If it’s a miss, your friend should be gentle,
your friend shouldn’t say, Oh, you messed up again. Your friend should
simply say, I don’t have that information continue, or that information
is incorrect, but please continue, be gentle. Now you can take this to
an advanced level. If your friend is also a Silva graduate, they could
do this. As you are at your level, they would also go to their level and
using thought transference they would attempt to project consciousness
to you, information to you in terms of what you are meant to detect.
They might visualize the person who owned the object and attempt to send
that image to you. And when you’re done, if your friend is a Silva
graduate, you want them to read this out to you. I’m going to paste this
paragraph below. It’s a beautiful statement that helps lock in your
intuitive ability. The statement is, whenever you have a sincere desire
to detect information, because you need the information to improve
conditions on the planet, your mind will automatically adjust to the
specific level where you will be accurate and correct. And this is so.
Thank you, you may count yourself out now. That’s it, so have fun with
this technique today. Don’t be hard on yourself if you don’t get a hit,
but if you do get a hit, remember it and embrace it. What Silva found is
that you can train yourself to become more and more accurate. Every time
you get a hit, the next time you do the exercise, start by expressing
gratitude for your hit. That’s the key, express gratitude and celebrate
your hits and you will become more and more accurate. So go ahead and
try this out with a friend today, go and make that phone call or contact
your friend and see if someone’s willing to meet you and try this out
with you. And after you’re done, feel free to share what you experienced
in our online community. Tomorrow, we’re going to go deeper into
intuitive training. So if you don’t get hits today, don’t worry about
it. This is just a trial. Tomorrow we’re going to go deeper into
intuitive training, and you’re going to learn to project your awareness
into plant matter. So what I want you to do today is to identify two
leaves, go out into the garden if you have one or to go to a park and
get two leaves which are different, pluck it from the tree, okay? Don’t
worry, you’re not going to be judged for plucking a leaf from a tree.
Pluck it from the tree and keep it with you. Tomorrow, we’re going to
work with these two, distinct leaves to train your mind, to work with
plant consciousness. I’ll see you tomorrow.

====================

DAY 14: Projection into Plant Matter

<v ->Welcome to day 14. Today is going to be an exciting day because
you’re going to start learning how to apply your consciousness to
healing. And you’re now going to learn how to project your consciousness
to living organisms. We’re going to start with two leaves. And if you’ve
done your homework, right, you’ve picked two distinct, meaning different
leaves from two different plants. Today, you’re going to study those
leaves and you’re going to project your awareness into those leaves to
observe the nuances and the difference between these two types of
leaves. This is a precursor to learning how to apply your consciousness
not just to plants, but to animals and other human beings to offer
healing and to offer an energy boost. It is fascinating how our mind can
connect to other life. Now this is an experiment we did here, in our
office in Mindvalley. Today we’re going to get started with projecting
your awareness into plants. So I want you now to hold up the two leaves
that you collected. For each leaf, gently look at it, and I’m going to
give you a minute with each leaf. I want you to observe the following
properties of the leaf. We will start with the first leaf. As you
observe the leaf, hold it up against the light. What is the light,
intensity and color that you observe? Is the leaf translucent? Is it
thick? How does it reflect light? What type of green does it have? Now
go on to odor, gently with your fingernail, make a tiny cut in the leaf.
Hold it up to your nose, what do you smell? Do you smell anything? Does
the leaf have an unusual scent? As you make that cut, what happens to
the leaf? Is there a liquid that comes out? Now I want you to feel the
leaf. Flick it with your finger, is it tense? Is it springy? Is it
harder or supple? Now hold the leaf on your cheek, what temperature do
you feel? Now we’re going to repeat the same process for the second
leaf, comparing it to the first leaf. Hold up the second leaf and
observe the light intensity and color. Compare it to the first leaf.
What differences do you see? Observe the shades of green, the colors on
the leaf. Next, make a tiny cut on the leaf with your fingernail. Hold
it up to your nose. What do you smell? Bend the leaf. How thick does it
feel? Is it soft? How does that compare to the first leaf? Now hold the
leaf to your cheek. What temperature do you feel? How does that compare
to the first leaf? As you do this, you’re establishing points of
reference which you’re going to bring back into use when you go into
this projection exercise. So here’s how the exercise is going to work.
I’m going to be guiding you through this exercise shortly. You’re going
to imagine yourself observing a tree, going through the process of
blooming, it’s going to start with a tree with leaves on it. You’re then
going to see a flower bloom. In your mind, you’re going to imagine as if
you can objectively reach out raising your real hand in the process and
plucking a leaf or a flower. You’re going to imagine smelling it to
observe the odor. You’re going to observe how it feels to your physical
touch, how it feels temperature wise, and you’re going to observe that
tree go through the different aspects of growth. As time moves on, the
tree will have blossoms then go to full bloom, then unripen fruit, then
fruit, then ripened fruit. It doesn’t matter what fruit you choose,
choose an apple or an orange or whatever fruit you’re most familiar
with. Then you’re going to imagine yourself back in your living room,
and you’re going to study the first leaf and the second leaf against the
changing colors of your selected wall. Observing light, temperature,
odor and solidity. You’ve done this exercise before, by projecting into
different types of metals and projecting to your living room. You’re
well trained in this exercise. This is the third projection exercise and
you’re going to do incredibly well. And this exercise is a precursor to
helping you learn how to apply consciousness to healing life forms. So
let’s get started.

====================

DAY 14 - MEDITATION: Projection to plants

- This is the Silva projection exercise, projection into trees and into leaves. We will start this exercise with the three to one method. Find a comfortable position, close your eyes, take a deep breath, and while exhaling, mentally repeat and visualize the number three, three times. To help you learn to relax at level three, I'm going to direct your attention to different parts of your body. Relax your skull. Relax your forehead. Relax your eyes. Relax your face. Relax your throat. Relax your shoulders. Relax your chest externally and internally. Relax your abdominal area externally and internally. Relax your thighs. Relax your knees. Relax your calves. Relax your feet. You're now at a deeper, healthier level of mind deeper than before. This is your physical relaxation level three. Whenever you mentally repeat and visualize the number three, your body will relax as completely as you are now, and more so every time you practice. To enter mental relaxation level two, take a deep breath and while exhaling, mentally repeat and visualize the number two three times, and you are at level two, a deeper level than three. Level two is for mental relaxation when noises will not distract you. Instead, noises will help you to relax mentally more and more. To improve mental relaxation at level two, practice visualizing tranquil and passive scenes. Take another deep breath and while exhaling, mentally repeat and visualize number one three times. You are now at level one, a deeper, healthier level of mind where you can function from your center. To help you enter a deeper, healthier level of mind, I'm going to count from 10 to one. On each descending number, you will feel yourself going deeper, and you will enter a deeper, healthier level of mind. 10, nine. Feel going deeper. Eight, seven, six, deeper and deeper. Five, four, three, deeper and deeper. Two, one. You are now at a deeper, healthier level of mind, deeper than before. It is a wonderful feeling to be deeply relaxed, a very healthy state of being. Effective sensory projection statements for success. I am now learning to attune my intelligence by developing my sensing faculties and to project them to any point or place on this planet so as to be aware of any actions taking place, if this is necessary and beneficial for humanity. I am now learning to attune my intelligence by developing my sensing faculties and to project them to any point or place on any planet within the solar system, any solar system within the galaxy, and any galaxy within the universe so as to be aware of any actions taking place, if this is necessary and beneficial for humanity. I am now learning to attune my intelligence by developing my sensing faculties and to project them to the different matter kingdoms: the inanimate matter kingdom, any of its levels and depths; the animate matter kingdom with reproductive intelligence, plant life, and animal life, any of its levels and depths; and the animate matter kingdom with reproductive intelligence and an awareness of existence; the human body and mind kingdom, any of its levels and depths. I am now learning to detect abnormalities whenever such abnormalities exist within any kingdom, any level, and any depth, if this is necessary and beneficial for humanity. I am now learning to apply corrective measures and to bring back to normalcy any abnormality found within any kingdom, any level, and any depth, if this is necessary and beneficial for humanity. Negative thoughts and negative suggestions have no influence over me at any level of the mind. The following laws are to be considered when programming: You should do to others only what you like others to do to you. The solution must help to make this planet a better place to live. It must be best for everybody concerned. It must help at least two or more persons. It must be within the possibility area. The following principles apply to programming. Objective physical communication takes place at the beta left brain dimension using the objective physical senses. The hearing is used for perception, and the voice is used for transmission. Subjective spiritual communication takes place at your center, the alpha right brain dimension, by using the spiritual senses. Visualization is used for perception, and imagination is used for transmission. In the objective physical dimension, the past is behind us, the present is our present position, and the future is ahead of us. In the subjective spiritual dimension, the past is to your right, the present is centered straight ahead, and the future is to your left. We will now continue programming effective sensory projection for your success, and program information with the use of mental projection for your benefit. We will establish subjective points of reference by projecting into the animate matter kingdom with reproductive intelligence into the plant life kingdom, becoming aware of different levels and different depths. Our present project is projection to a fruit tree during seasonal change, and a study of the leaves and fruit. In a moment, I'm going to count from one to three and cause a sound with my fingers. At that time, you will project yourself mentally to be standing next to a fruit tree that has blossoms before bearing fruit. One, two, three. You're now standing right next to a fruit tree that has only leaves. At the count of three, you will objectively extend your arm and reach out to cut off a leaf. One, two, three. Objectively extend your arm, reach out and cut off a leaf. Now mentally crush the leaf with your fingers. Bring it to your nostrils and mentally impress the odor. Whatever you perceive with your imagination at this dimension you can use as a point of reference in the future. Time is moving on. The blossoms are beginning to appear. The tree is now in full bloom. At the count of three, you will objectively reach out and cut off a blossom. One, two, three. Objectively reach out and cut off a blossom. Crush it with your fingers. Bring it to your nostrils and mentally make an impression. Whatever you perceive with your imagination at this dimension you can use as a point of reference in the future. Time is moving on. Blossoms are falling off. The tree now has very small unripened fruit. At the count of three, you will reach out and cut off a small unripened fruit. One, two, three. Reach out and cut off a small unripened fruit. Crush it with your fingers. Bring it to your nostrils and mentally make an impression. Whatever you perceive with your imagination at this dimension you can use as a point of reference in the future. Time is moving on. The fruit is growing. It is now fully grown but unripened. At the count of three, you will reach out and cut off a fully grown unripened fruit. One, two, three. Reach out and cut off a fully grown unripened fruit. Break the skin. Bring it to your nostrils and mentally make an impression. Whatever you perceive with your imagination at this dimension you can use as a point of reference in the future. Time is moving on. The fruit is ripening. It is now ripe. At the count of three, you will reach out and count off a ripened fruit. One, two, three. Reach out and cut off a ripened fruit. Break the skin, bring it to your nostrils, and mentally make an impression. Whatever you perceive with your imagination at this dimension you can use as a point of reference in the future. Now at the count of three, the tree will disappear and you will mentally project yourself to your living room. One, two, three. Mentally protect yourself to the center of your living room facing the selected wall. You're now at the center of your living room facing your selected wall. We will now replay the objective impressions of the leaves and also establish subjective points of reference. At the count three, you will visualize the first leaf. One, two, three. Extend your arm objectively and visualize the first leaf. Mentally sense the leaf. Bring it closer and closer to your forehead. Now touch your forehead and mentally project yourself into the leaf. You are now within the first leaf. You may return your hand to rest on your lap. At the count of three, test for light. One, two, three. Sense the intensity and color of light within the leaf. How does the light within the leaf compare with the light within aluminum, brass, copper, and stainless steel? Whatever you perceive with your imagination at this dimension you can use as a point of reference in the future. At the count of three, test for temperature. One, two, three. Sense the temperature within the leaf. How does this compare with the temperature of aluminum, brass, copper, and stainless steel? Whatever you perceive with your imagination at this dimension you can use as a point of reference in the future. At the count of three, test for odor. One, two, three. Sense the odor within the leaf. How does this compare with the odor of aluminum, brass, copper, and stainless steel? Whatever you perceive with your imagination at this dimension you can use as a point of reference in the future. At the count of three, test for solidity of material. One, two, three. Objectively form a fist and knock on the inside of the leaf. How does this reflected sound compare with the reflected sound of aluminum, brass, copper, and stainless steel? Whatever you perceive with your imagination at this dimension you can use as a point of reference in the future. At the count of three, touch your forehead to come out of the leaf. One, two, three. Touch your forehead, you are now coming out of the leaf. Extend your arm and mentally hold the leaf at arm's length. Now allow the leaf to float in space using the selected wall of your living room as a background. Keep the leaf rotating. You may return your hand to rest on your lap. At the count of three, the color of the wall will change to red. One, two, three. How does the leaf stand out against the red background? How does this compare with aluminum, brass, copper, and stainless steel? Keep the leaf rotating. At the count of three, the color of the wall will change to green. One, two, three. How does the leaf stand out against the green background? How does this compare with aluminum, brass, copper, and stainless steel? Keep the leaf rotating. At the count of three, the color of the wall will change to blue. One, two, three. How does the leaf stand out against the blue background? How does this compare to aluminum, brass, copper, and stainless steel? Keep the leaf rotating. The color of the wall will change back to green. Back to red. Back to the actual color of the wall. Now the first leaf will disappear from the scene. The first leaf has disappeared from the scene. At the count of three, we will visualize the second leaf. One, two, three. Extend your arm objectively and visualize the second leaf. Mentally sense this leaf as you bring it closer and closer towards your forehead. Now touch your forehead and mentally project yourself into the leaf. You are now within the leaf. You may return your hand to rest on your lap. At the count of three, test for light. One, two, three. Sense the intensity and color of light within the second leaf. How does the light within this leaf compare with the light within the first leaf? Whatever you perceive with your imagination at this dimension you can use as a point of reference in the future. At the count of three, test for temperature. One, two, three. Sense the temperature within the leaf. How does this compare with the temperature within the first leaf? Whatever you perceive with your imagination at this dimension you can use as a point of reference in the future. At the count of three, test for odor. One, two, three. Sense the odor within the same leaf. How does this compare with the odor of the other leaf? Whatever you perceive with your imagination at this dimension you can use as a point of reference in the future. At the count of three, test for solidity of material. One, two, three. Objectively form a fist and knock on the inside of the second leaf. How does the sound compare with the sound of the first leaf? Whatever you perceive with your imagination at this dimension you can use as a point of reference in the future. At the count of three, touch your forehead and come out of the leaf. One, two, three. Touch your forehead, you are now coming out of the leaf. Extend your arm and mentally hold the leaf at arm's length, allowing it to float in space against the background of your selected wall. Keep the leaf rotating. You may return your hand to rest on your lap. At the count of three, the color of the wall will change to red. One, two, three. How does the second leaf stand out against the red background? How does this compare with the first leaf? Keep the second leaf rotating. At the count of three, the color of the wall will change to green. One, two, three. How does the leaf stand out against the green background? How does this compare with the first leaf? Keep the second leaf rotating. The color of the wall will now change to blue. One, two, three. How does the leaf stand out against the blue background? How does this compare with the first leaf? Keep the second leaf rotating. The color of the wall will change back to green , back to red , back to the actual color of the wall. The second leaf will now disappear from the scene. The second leaf has now disappeared. Whatever you perceive with your imagination at this dimension you can use as a point of reference in the future. It is now an accomplished fact that subjective points of reference have been established in the animate matter kingdom with reproductive intelligence, the plant life kingdom at different levels and different depths. To function at these levels and to use these points of reference, all you need is a sincere desire to solve problems. Your mind will automatically seek out these points of reference where you will receive and become aware of information you can use to solve such problems, and this is so. Programming a technique, the MentalVideo technique that you can use for problem solving. Whenever you need to solve a problem with the MentalVideo technique, enter level one with the three-to-one method when you are in bed and ready to go to sleep. Once you are at your level, review the MentalVideo that you created of the problem at beta. After you have reviewed the problem, mentally convert the problem into a project, then create with imagination a MentalVideo of the solution. The MentalVideo of the solution should contain a step-by-step procedure of how you desire the project to be resolved. After both of the MentalVideos have been completed, go to sleep with the intention of delivering the MentalVideos to your tutor while you sleep. Take for granted that the delivery will be made. During the next three days, look for indications that point to the solution. Every time you think of the project, think of the solution that you created in the MentalVideo in a past tense sense. You have practiced entering deep, healthy levels of mind. In your next session, you will enter a deeper, healthier level of mind faster and easier than this time. Every time you function at these levels of mind and at these points of reference, you will receive beneficial affects physically and mentally. You may use these levels of mind and these points of reference to help yourself physically and mentally. You may use these levels of the mind and these points of reference to help your loved ones physically and mentally. You may use these levels of the mind and these points of reference to help any human being who needs help physically and mentally. You will never use these levels of mind or these points of reference to harm any human being. If this be your intention, you will not be able to function within these levels of mind, nor will you be able to use these points of reference. You will always use these levels of mind and these points of reference in a constructive, creative manner for all that is good, honest, pure, clean, and positive, and this is so. In a moment, I'm going to count from one to five and cause a sound with my fingers. At that moment, you will open your eyes, be wide awake, feeling fine and in perfect health, feeling better than before. You will have no ill effects whatsoever in your head, no headache, no ill effects whatsoever in your hearing, no buzzing in your ears, no ill effects whatsoever in your vision and eyesight. Vision, eyesight, and hearing improve every time you function at these levels of mind. One, two, coming out slowly now, three. At the count of five, you will open your eyes, be wide awake, feeling fine and in perfect health, feeling better than before, feeling the way you feel when you have slept the right amount of revitalizing, refreshing, relaxing, healthy, wonderful sleep. Four, five. Eyes open, wide awake feeling fine and in perfect health, feeling better than before.

Week 3: Manifesting & Healing

====================

DAY 15: Cultivate a Burning Desire to Manifest Your Dreams

<v ->If your desires are strong enough, you will appear to possess
superhuman powers to achieve. You’re now in part two of our program,
everything that you learned so far, if you were to take the Silva
Seminar would have been delivered to you in eight hours on the first
day. Now we’re going to the content that was typically delivered on the
second day. So these seminars typically happened on a Saturday and a
Sunday, you finished Saturday stretched out over almost two weeks, if
you decided to stretch it out that way. Some of you may have done it in
one shot over one or two days, that’s great too. But now we come to part
two of the seminar. Part two is about refinement, but before I get
there, let me tell you and summarize what you’ve learned so far. First,
you’ve learned the different brainwave states. You’ve learned how to
access altered states of mind, starting with alpha, going deeper, then
theta, you’ve even learned through the MentalVideo Technique to access
the elusive delta frequency and how to apply it to doing more in solving
problems in life. You’ve learned how to project your awareness across
time and space to gather information that might otherwise be unknown to
you so you can make better decisions in life. And speaking of decisions,
you’ve learned how to apply the MentalVideo Technique to solve
situations that seem too difficult for you to solve on your own. You’ve
learned how to access higher intelligence to help you resolve these
difficult situations. And for smaller day-to-day scenarios, you’ve
learned how to apply the Three Scenes Technique. So all of these have
given you a powerful toolkit to access alternate states of being so you
can truly relax, you can tap into creativity. And you’ve learned these
two powerful tools, the MentalVideo Technique and the Three Scenes
Technique that is going to fundamentally change the way you show up in
life. So what we’re going to do today is show you how to refine the
results that you’re getting from these techniques. Jose Silva said that,
“To apply the MentalVideo”or the Three Scenes Technique in your life,
“there three ingredients that you need to have.” He called these
ingredients, desire, belief and expectancy, DBE. Desire means having a
true burning desire for the outcome or for that problem to be resolved.
Belief means believing that it can be resolved, believing that it is in
the field of human possibility. And expectancy is the best one.
Expectancy is where you are so confident that it’s going to be resolved,
that you basically just expect it to happen. When you bridge all of
these together, remarkable things start to happen. Today we’re going to
focus on the first ingredient, desire, and in our next lesson we’ll
focus on belief and expectancy. The power of desire is best encapsulated
in this beautiful quote by Napoleon Hill. “When it comes to desire, it’s
important to cultivate”a burning desire for the outcome that you’re
seeking.” To cultivate a burning desire means to not flip flop on what
you want. Think about this, if your mind is truly bringing you
everything it’s focused on. Think about how often we flip flop and
confuse the mind. We might decide that we want to have a vacation in The
Bahamas, but then a few weeks later we read about bad weather there,
maybe there was some strong winds and we go, “You know, maybe it’s not
too safe,”maybe I want to have a vacation in Thailand instead.” As we
flip our minds this way, what happens is what is often coming towards us
moves away. Think about this scenario, you’re in a restaurant, and you
show up and you ask the waiter for a menu, and the way that gives you a
menu and says, “These are all the amazing things you can order today.”
And you tell the way that, “You know, I think I’d like to have some
pizza.” So the waiter says, “No problem, I’m going to go talk”to the
chef, we’ll be coming back with your pizza.” The waiter rushes off and
talks to the chef. The chef goes, “Wonderful, going to make the pizza.”
He starts making the dough, he starts putting on the pasta and the
mozzarella. And then out back in the restaurant, you call the waiter
again and you say, “Waiter, you know, actually I’m feeling kind of
full.”Maybe, really what I want is tomato soup.” The waiter goes, “No
problem, I’m going to cancel the pizza,”I’m going to get you tomato
soup.” He goes again to talk to the chef. The chef goes, “No worries,
tossing the dough aside,”let me make some tomato soup.” And you call the
waiter again, “Waiter you know,”maybe not tomato soup, “maybe I’ll just
have some spaghetti, something light.” And the waiter goes, “No
worries,”done with the tomato soup.” He goes back to tell the chef, the
chef pulls out the tomato soup, and starts boiling spaghetti. Now, think
about that scenario and how absurd it is. No one would go to a
restaurant and be flip flopping on their orders that much, but we do
that in life. Think about the scenario in the following way. Your order
is your desire, is your goal. The waiter is your subconscious. The chef
is your higher intelligence or your higher power or God or whatever is
bringing to you your burning desire. Think about how often you change
the order that you put out for the goals in your life, and think about
what this might be doing. Remember, when we’re attempting to manifest
something that is a time-gap, there needs to be a time-gap, otherwise,
every thought instantly will manifest. You think elephant and boom,
you’re crushed by a giant elephant. The time-gap, according to
philosophers like Esther Hicks, gives you the opportunity to refine, but
many of us rather than refine our desire, rather than decide, all right?
We’re going to go to The Bahamas, and maybe I want to have this type of
hotel and this type of travel adventure, we completely flip our desire,
we change our mind over and over and over again. So the trick to the
burning desire is to think carefully about what you want, to write it
down, to put it on a vision board, and to focus on that thing and make
it clearer and clearer and clearer, and to stay with it. This is what it
means to have burning desire. When you have burning desire, you are
motivated to wake up every day and practice the Three Scenes Technique.
You are motivated to find you your MentalVideo Technique. You’re
motivated to think and dream about the object or the outcome that you
want to attract in your life. A few years ago I was teaching a Silva
class in New York, and a wonderful lady came to me, and she said,
“Vishen, can you teach me”to apply the Three Scenes Technique “to become
a better typist?” And I said, “Well, that’s a strange request.”Why would
you want to be a better typist?” And she said, “Well, I’m a data entry
clerk,”and I get paid by the hour “based on the number of data cards I
dept to produce.” Now, keep in mind this was 2005, so the way data entry
work was quite different from the way it works today. So this wonderful
data entry typist said, “Can I use the Three Scenes Technique”to speed
up my rate of typing out these cards?” And I said, “Well, yes you
can,”but let me ask you a question. “Why do you want to be a faster
typist?” So she explained to me that the more forms she could fill out,
the more she would get paid. So I said, “Great, let’s ask the next
question.”Why do you want to get paid more?” She said, “Well, I want to
get paid more”because I want to grow my savings.” And I said, “Great,
why do you want to grow your savings?” She goes, “I want to grow my
savings,”because I want to move to a new home in Brooklyn.” I said,
“Great, why do you want to move”to a new home in Brooklyn?” And that’s
when the true desire came out. She said, “Look, Vishen, my mom lives in
Detroit,”and Detroit is a really rundown city, “it’s ranked bottom
50”out of the 50 biggest cities in America. “And Detroit isn’t safe, and
I worry about my mom”because she lives by herself. “I want to move to
this beautiful apartment”so my mom can come and move with me.” I asked
her the followup question, “That’s wonderful, now you’re getting
somewhere.”Why do you want your mom to move in with you?” And she goes,
“Well, my mom and I,”we have this beautiful legacy and family “that goes
all the way back to the civil war.”And when you went to our apartment in
Detroit, “it’s filled with so many mementos and antiques,”I want to move
all of this with my mom, “live in this beautiful new apartment in
Brooklyn”and decorate this apartment with all our family heirlooms,
“because I want to be a mother someday,”and when my daughter grows up,
“I want her to remember our family legacy.” And I said, “Bingo, that’s
exactly it,”that’s your true desire. “Now tell me again, did you really
want to waste”all your time trying to be a faster typist?” So you see,
when you understand your true desire, the desire that comes after asking
yourself, why do I want this? So I can get that, so I can get that, so I
can get that, it is on the last so, it’s on the picture you paint that
really lights you up, that is your true desire, and that is what you
want to focus on. That is what you want to apply the MentalVideo or the
Three Scenes Technique to. And when you do that, what you will find is
that the outcome you are seeking will come to you much faster. Maybe for
this young lady it wasn’t about being a faster typist, maybe there might
be other opportunities, other jobs, maybe even her own business that
might arise to get her to that ideal scenario with the apartment and her
mother and the family heirlooms. You must seek your end goal, that is an
important thing. Now, if you pay attention to that typist, all the other
stuff she was talking about in between, the faster typist, the bigger
paycheck, the highest savings, those are means goals, they are a mean to
an end. The end goal was that beautiful vision that when she spoke
about, it totally let her up. You want to identify your end goals, and
before we are done today, I’m going to teach you a technique to do so.
Now, let’s go back to desire for a moment. So the first rule of desire
is to know the difference between means goals, the mean to an end, and
the end goal. It is the end goal that you really want to focus on. Now,
the second rule of desire is to know the difference between wanting and
immature wanting. This concept comes from Mindvalley author Michael
Beckwith, the spiritual teacher at the Agape Spiritual Center. So
Michael Beckwith say something extremely similar to Jose Silva, he says
that so many of us have what he calls immature wants. It’s wanting based
on what the world is telling us we need. And often these goals are not
really the goals of your soul, they are the goals of your politicians,
media, advertising, the culturescape, they are goals that tells you that
you must have two cars and a garage, that you must get married and have
2.5 kids and own your own home, there’s nothing wrong with that, but any
of these goals are coming because we are blindly following what society
is telling us to do. In reality, true wanting is when you listen to your
soul, true wanting is when you paint a picture that is arising from the
desires emerging from within you, When you practice the MentalVideo
Technique and you ask for a problem to be resolved with help from higher
intelligence, that is true wanting. it is the compass pointing you in
the right direction. Don Miguel Ruiz, the Mexican author and
contemporary of Jose Silva explained it to me this way. I sat down with
Don Miguel Ruiz once and I asked him, “Don, what does the word toltec
mean?”Your books like “Mastery of love” “talk about toltec wisdom.” And
Don Miguel Ruiz said, “Vishen, to be a toltec means”to be an artist, the
toltecs were artists, “the problem with so many people is,”they do not
paint a masterpiece for their own life, “rather they go through, like a
human photocopy machine.”They decide that they want this and this and
this, “but these are nothing more than photocopies”of other people’s
lives.” You want to be the artists of your own life, that is what is
meant to be a toltec. You want to paint the most beautiful picture you
can. You want to decide where the reds go, and where the yellow goes,
and where are you going to put the whites and the blacks. You want to
decide what this picture is going to look like, and you want to make it
unique to you. So by becoming an artist of your own life, you are
avoiding immature wanting and going to true wanting. That is the key. So
now, I want to teach you a technique to help you identify your true
desires or your true wants. Because the better you identify your true
desires, the more you’re going to be lit up about them, the more you’re
going to be obsessed with thinking about them and focusing on them, and
the more you’re going to start to believe, and the faster they’re going
to come to you. So, to identify your true desires, the technique I’m
going to teach you is called, the Three Most Important Questions. Now,
if you’ve been a Mindvalley student for a long time, you’ve probably
done this technique. I invented this technique in 2012, and it took off
all around the world. The American Management Association tweeted it to
all its members, it’s been done by close to a million people at this
point, including in high schools in India and Mexico, and in large
corporations. And the Three Most Important Questions technique is really
simple, you’re going to ask yourself three questions, and the entire
technique will take no more than nine minutes. I’m going to play for you
a simple video that helps you understand this technique. I released this
video on social media a few months back, and watching this simple short
video will help you understand the nuances of this technique. I’m then
going to guide you into this exercise, we’re going to do a fast
streamlined version of it, and this is going to take only six minutes.
What you will need is a paper and a journal. So, watch this video and
you’ll be hearing from me. So now that you know the difference between a
means goal and an end goal, the question remains, how do you make sure
you’re pursuing the right end goals? Well, I’ve found that these three
questions help. All end goals fall into three categories, and then you
ask yourself these three important questions, you end up identifying the
right end goals for you in each category. The model is really simple.
The first category is experiences, let me tell you why. C.S. Lewis said,
“You do not have a soul,”you are a soul, what you have is a body.” What
this implies is that we are souls here having a human experience, and
one of the most beautiful things about this human experience, it’s
things such as falling in love, traveling a new city, creating something
new, doing those things that create that heart pounding feeling of joy
and happiness, these are beautiful end goal categories that you want to
put on your Three Most Important Questions sheet. Now, the second
category is growth. Really it’s asking yourself to have all of these
beautiful experiences from the travel, to the people I want to meet, to
the environments I want to live in. Who do I have to be? Who is that man
or woman I have to evolve into? And this is where you start listing how
you want to grow. I think one of the things that we are here to do is to
grow ourselves as human beings. So in this category, you ask yourself,
“How do I want to growth in terms of my skills,”in terms of my career,
in terms of my abilities? “How do I want to take care of my body?”So I
have great energy, “and I’m able to do things even as I get older.”How
do I cultivate and grow my mind, so that I can enjoy “all of the amazing
opportunities here on planet earth?” Growth is that second category.
Then we go to the third category. The third category is contribution. I
once heard the Dalai Lama say this, “If you want to be happy, learn can
make people happy.” And this is really what contribution is about. If
you believe we’re all on this planet together, why not help each other
grow, help each other have beautiful experiences. And the way we do this
is through the third category, contribution. Contribution is where you
make a list of how you want to give to your family, to your community,
to the company you work for, that’s a company that’s contributing in a
good way to the world. Your contribution could be a blog post you write
that inspires people, it could be volunteer work, it could be a work of
art that beautifies the planet, there are many ways to contribute, but I
think we all agree that contribution is one of the surest parts to
happiness. Interestingly, in Tony Robbins hit TED Talk, which is one of
the most watched TED Talks ever. He talks about how all of us have two
great spiritual needs, right? The need to grow and the need to
contribute. He says, if you aren’t growing, if you aren’t contributing,
then you might be happy, but you will never be fulfilled. So again, the
Three Most Important Questions are, what beautiful human experiences do
I want to feel in my life? How do I want to grow as a human being? And
how do I want to contribute? And you can see how each leads into the
other. So, here’s how the exercise works. You take out a piece of paper,
you’re going to make three columns on the paper, and I’m going to take
you through a timed journey where you’re going to write down your
answers to the pre questions I’m going to ask you. Before we get there,
I’d like to share with you just a brief glimpse of why this exercise is
so important. Now something mysterious happens when you start putting
down your goals and your visions on the Three Most Important Questions
sheet. Very often what I’ve seen is that, situations, opportunities
emerge in people’s lives that allow them to check off multiple items on
their sheet. One person I’m proud to talk about is Ronan Diego. So
Ronan’s sheet looks something like that, and if you were to look at the
sheet and the items I highlighted, you could see that this is a man who
really loves inspiring others and having a healthy body and learning
about health. Interestingly, about a few months after Ronan’s sheet, he
ended up taking part in the Viper Challenge, a really grueling race with
20,000 other competitors. Ronan ended up coming out number one, and
through that, not only that he helped develop this body of his dreams,
this fitness level that he’s always aspired to, but inspiring others to
do the same. Jason Campbell is another friend of mine, on his sheet,
when I looked at it, I could see that there was a lot of ideas on the
sheet about becoming a world class speaker, being a team builder, a
manager, teaching entrepreneurship and sales. So Jason one day happened
to be at A-Fest, and a major speaker who had to speak fell sick, and all
of a sudden we had a 20 minute slot on stage and no speaker. Now, I knew
Jason was a good speaker, but I didn’t know if he was A-Fest level, but
he came to me and said, “Vishen, I promise you,”put me on that stage and
magic will happen.” And something in my gut said, “Trust him.” I put
Jason on stage, and he was voted best speaker. He checked off a large
number of items in his Three Most Important Questions, and also got to
speak about sales and entrepreneurship and really inspire the crowd.
Luminita Saviuc was a blogger who worked at Mindvalley, her Three Most
Important Questions were a lot about inspiring others, being a personal
growth teacher, even being an author. Strangely Luminita while it
Mindvalley wrote a blog post called “15 Things To Give Up To Be Fappy.”
Nothing happened for the first couple of months, but about six months
later, a group of people started sharing that on Facebook and it took
off. Within a few months, it became the single most shared personal
growth article in the history of Facebook, with 1.2 million people
sharing this on their timeline. Luminita got an offer from Penguin
Books, and her book is now out. She managed to strike off multiple ideas
of the Three Most Important Questions from inspiring others to being a
personal growth teacher, to writing a book, to being an author. Amir
Ahmad joined Mindvalley as a 22 year old, he was an intern when he
joined me at our team retreat and did this exercise, and I guess being
young, he had no idea just what his limitations were, so he put down
some pretty fancy things, he wanted a bestselling book, he wanted to
speak at Ivy League Universities, he wanted to be on television. Four
years later, Amir was 26, he wrote a book called “My Islam,”How
fundamentalism stole my mind and doubt freed my soul.” It was about how
the digital revolution was shaking up the Middle East. Amir’s book ended
up being selected by Foreign Policy Magazine as one of the top 25 must
read books of 2013. And before he knew it, Amir was being invited to
speak at Ivy League Universities, sharing the stage at the Oslo Freedom
Forum, being on television shows, being invited to speak at companies
like Google, he became well known in his field because of that book. All
of these people, whether it was fitness or becoming an author or
speaking on stage, attained incredible things in their life. A lot of it
started with a dream in their head, a vision for a life based on what
were their end goals, end goals that really, really fueled them and made
them happy. And this is what you’re going to experience as well. One of
the best things about this exercise, is that it works beautifully in
groups. At Mindvalley, all our employees do the exercise, the Three Most
Important Questions, and then we take every one sheet and we stick it on
a giant wall, so people can go to this wall, look at other people’s
goals and figure out, “How can we help each other?” We try to create a
culture where as much as possible individuals are not just chasing their
own end goals, but helping other people attain theirs too. One example
is Marianne. Marianne wanted to hike in Nepal, she went to a giant wall
of Three Most Important Questions. She saw others who had written down
Nepal on their sheet, connected with them, and together four people
ended up on a beautiful hike in Nepal for seven days. It was one of the
most beautiful moments of their life, and all of them got to strike off
multiple items of their three most important question list. See, there
is no monopoly on dreams, it’s beautiful to be able to come up with
ideas for your Three Most Important Questions, and then to share these
ideas with people or to see other people’s sheets. And when you see
something you like, you can go, “Aha, I want to add that too.” There is
no monopoly on dreams. So whether it’s schools or it’s within your
organization, there are so many ways you can use the Three Most
Important Questions to help not just craft a beautiful life for
yourself, but help others create their beautiful life. It’s a beautiful
exercise, not just for the individual but for teams, for schools, for
groups. Great, so I hope you got the point of that video. Now, here’s
what I want you to do. Take out a piece of paper and draw two lines on
the paper. So your paper is basically going to have three columns. The
first column is going to say experiences. The second column is going to
say group. And the third column is going to say contribution. So the
three things that truly light us up as beings are experiences. Every
spiritual philosopher says that we are souls having a human experience.
So we can experience this planet in the best way possible. So in the
first question, you’re simply going to make a list of all the
experiences you want in your life. Here are examples of experiences you
might want, it could be something like skydiving, it could be doing a
three week trip across Europe with a loved one. It could be becoming a
mom or a dad and waking up and being able to hold your baby in your
arms. It could be starting a business and taking on that incredible role
where you have to deliver a beautiful product or service to the world.
It could be writing a book, or it could be painting a picture. It could
be the experience of falling in love. These are all examples of
experiences that speak right to your soul. Now, in the second column,
you’re going to make a list of how you want to grow, and you’re going to
tie it to the first column. You’re going to ask yourself to be the
matter woman with all of these amazing experiences. How do I need to
grow? So for example, if you put down that you want to have the
experience of traveling across Europe with your loved one. Well, how
might you need to grow? Maybe you want to study the basics of a European
language. Maybe you want to save up a little so you can spend three
weeks traveling across Europe. Ask yourself, “How do I need to grow to
be the man or woman”who can have this list of experiences?” When you’re
done with that column, you’re going to go to the third column, and the
third column is contribution. You’re simply going to ask yourself, “If I
were the man of woman with all of these experiences,”who has grown in
this remarkable way, “how then can I contribute to the world?” Remember
Jose Silva’s message of thinking about contribution. Ask yourself, “How
can I give that to other people?”How can I be a better leader? “How can
I volunteer my time, maybe my money?” Now, when it comes to
contribution, it’s not just about starting a social cause or donating to
a charity. Your work could be a contribution, you could be working at an
incredible company, releasing a good product to the world, the work you
do there is a form of contribution. Contribution can also come from
setting a desire to be a better mom or a better dad or a better uncle or
a better son. You choose, you’re going to make a list of how you’re
going to contribute. At this point, I want you to pull out a piece of
paper, and I’m going to give you six minutes to do this exercise. If
you’ve done this exercise before, you can skip this. And if you want to
go further in the Three Most Important Questions, know that there are
tons of resources out there on the web, I deliberately released this
technique on the web, so as many people as possible could get access to
it. So if you have free time when you want to go deeper, just Google,
Three Most Important Questions fishing. Now, let’s get started with your
list. We’re going to start with the first column experiences. I’m going
to give you two minutes. Write down as fast as you can, the that you
seek to have in this life. And remember this tip, Jose Silva says that,
“Often what is coming from our soul feels”like a guest and it happens
fast.” Don’t overthink this, the first thoughts that come to you are
often the right and most accurate thoughts. You may begin now.
Congratulations, you’ve finished the first column. Now we’ll go to the
second column, growth. I’m going to give you two minutes, write down as
it emerges all the ways you seek to grow, begin now. Congratulations,
you’ve finished on growth. Now we’re going to go to contribution. Write
down in two minutes, all the ways you feel a calling to contribute to
the world. Begin now. Congratulations, you’ve now finished the Three
Most Important Questions and you should have a piece of paper that looks
something like this. We love this exercise so much that across our
office in Mindvalley, every single person does this exercise and we
stick everyone’s three MIQ on a giant pinboard. You can do this exercise
with your teams as well. Imagine how powerful it is when you and your
team or your family know each other’s deepest desires, think about how
you can contribute to other people. So this is a really great exercise
that you can introduce, not just in your life, but in the lives of the
company you work for, and even within your family. I suggest you take
this piece of paper and you stick it on your wall, and every single day
as you’re practicing the Three Scenes Technique or the MentalVideo
Technique, you pick an item from this list and you go deep and focus on
it. That’s it for today’s lesson, I’ll see you tomorrow.

====================

DAY 16: The Power of Belief & Expectancy

<v ->The human mind is a spark of the almighty consciousness of God. I
could show you that whatever your powerful mind believes very intensely
would instantly come to pass. Paramhansa Yogananda. I love that line by
Yogananda. Yogananda, in his book, Autobiography of a Yogi, suggests
that the human mind has such a powerful capacity to shape the world. And
he tells so many incredible stories about how his mind did that.
Interestingly enough, the book Autobiography of a Yogi became Steve Jobs
favorite book. When Steve Jobs was at his death bed, and Walter Isaacson
interviewed him for Jobs’ biography, Isaacson asked Jobs, what books do
you carry on your iPad? And Steve Jobs showed that the one book he
carried was Autobiography of a Yogi. So, many remarkable people across
the world seem to believe in this idea, including Steve Jobs. Steve Jobs
in his famous Stanford commencement address said listen to your heart
and intuition. They somehow already know who you want to become. Isn’t
that beautiful? It so aligns with the spiritual philosophies of Jose
Silva. I’ve come to believe that many of the greatest people in the
world, who are able to pull off incredible things, were utilizing these
tools. Steve Jobs of course was such a fan of Yogananda that at his
funeral, every single guest who came went away with Yogananda’s book.
And Jobs of course went on to build Apple, the first global trillion
dollar company. So while these ideas are not spoken about publicly,
among people who are performing at the peak of their potential. Many of
them are utilizing these ideas. Yesterday, you learned about desire.
Today you’re going to learn about belief and expectancy. Belief is a
very powerful tool. When you believe that you can move towards a goal,
when you believe that something is possible for you, you seem to draw
upon superhuman abilities to make it so. We don’t fully understand why
it works, but we know that belief is a powerful ingredient. Now I
learned about belief the hard way. When I first picked up my first Silva
book I was 14 years old, and I read that book, Silva Mind Control, it
was a copy belonging to my father written in 1977. It was probably the
early 90s when I first picked up that book. I was fascinated by the
story of a nun, Sister Barbara Burns, who, using the Silva technique,
healed her eyesight. Sister Barbara Burns was almost legally blind, and
she said that by going to a center and repeating and creating a positive
statement that said essentially this, every time I blink my eyes, my
vision gets better, better and better. She went over the course of one
year from being legally blind and requiring thick glasses to being able
to see in 20/20 vision. Now I had problems with my eyesight. My power
was minus 700, myopia, which means that without my glasses, I couldn’t
recognize someone this far ahead, it was really bad. I was captivated by
the story of Barbara Burns, and I thought well, I want to try this as
well. But in my 14 year old mind, I hadn’t really fully trained my
faculties of belief. And so, for two years, practicing Silva, I would
dabble with trying to heal my eyesight and I got absolutely nowhere. I
didn’t stop though, I didn’t give up. I started reading every book by
Jose Silva I could find, and in one of Jose Silva’s books, I came across
a line that really struck me. That line said, don’t jump the gun. And I
realized what Silva meant. He was saying look, don’t try to heal
something so massive before you have a tiny victory and you’ve built up
your reservoir of faith and belief. Think of believe as a glass. You
could have a glass that’s really full, that’s awesome, that’s your
reservoir of faith, or belief. Or you could have a glass that only has a
little bit of water. To heal something like eyesight, I needed a lot
more in that reservoir. I didn’t have that. So what Jose was essentially
saying is don’t jump the gun. Start with something small, build up your
belief, and then tackle bigger, and bigger, and bigger things. So, I
decided that I was doing it wrong. I was trying something beyond my
scope of belief. So what would be a smaller outcome I could attempt to
influence with my mind that might help me build up my reservoir? Well,
reading Jose Silva’s work, I came across an interesting story. It was a
story of how Jose would bring up people at the front of a seminar and
then hypnotize them and to prove the power of belief, he would hypnotize
them to believe that his marker was a red hot poker. He would take it,
apply it to their skin, move the marker away, and a burn bubble would
form because under hypnosis they believed that that marker was a red hot
poker. Now Jose wasn’t a sadist, he wouldn’t stop there, he would then
tell them that he could heal that bubble with the touch of his hand. He
would put his hand on the bubble, and the burn bubble would disappear
instantly. Jose went on to describe in that book that the skin is the
organ that is easiest to influence with the mind, and that gave me a
clue. Why was I trying to heal my eyesight? I had other issues. I had
really bad skin. At that point, I was 17 years old, I was a teenager,
and I was going through the worst pimple breakouts. And it was really
affecting my self esteem. In high school, the other kids called me
pimple face, and I hated that. And so, I decided to apply the Silva
method to heal my skin. So I did the three scenes technique, and I
followed Jose’s advice on how to apply for healing. You will learn that
in upcoming lessons. I’d had serious acne for five years. My mother had
taken me to dermatologists, I’d had injections in my skin, I’d put on
various creams, nothing had resolved it. But in five weeks using the
three scenes technique, my pimples slowly disappeared, and five weeks
from the time I started, I had clear skin and it lasted. My confidence
grew, I stopped being bullied at school, and that built up my reservoir
of belief. That gave me enough juice to tackle bigger, and bigger, and
bigger things. So the moral here is your beliefs will determine your
reality, but don’t try to rush it. Don’t try to heal cancer before you
can heal your dandruff. Start with something small, build up your
reservoir of faith and belief, and then tackle bigger things. It’s a
form of training. So again, don’t try to immediately try to use the
three scenes technique to become a millionaire. Try to start with maybe
saving 20 grand in your bank account, something that’s believable. And
as you do that, gradually grow and grow and grow the scope of your goals
and what you’re aiming for. But you must train your belief system. Now
how do you know that your belief system is on point? How do you know
that what you’re focusing on aligns with your capacity to believe? Well,
that brings us to the third part. Remember, it’s desire, belief, and the
third part is expectancy. Expectancy means when you step out of your
meditation, you just know the results are coming towards you. In other
words, you walk and you live your life expecting the end-result.
Expectancy too is a powerful force. We spoke about Steve Jobs. Let me
give you another person who prior to Jobs built the biggest company in
America. His name was Sam Walton, and if you read his biography, there’s
a beautiful line by Sam. Sam Walton said this, I always expect good
things to happen. Thinking like that often turned into a self-fulfilling
prophecy. What Sam Walton was saying is that living life, he always
expected the best. It’s as if he felt he was blessed by the universe,
and he went on of course to start the biggest company of his generation,
Wal-mart. Expectancy is a powerful force. The question is though, why?
Remember, in an earlier lesson, I shared the concept of the law of
resonance. It’s not the law of attraction that brings the reality you
want to you, it’s the law of resonance. So says Michael Beckwith. In
other words, you will not get the outcome you want by doing the three
scenes technique over and over and over and over and over again. You get
the outcome you want if you do it once, you step out of your meditation
and you expect it to happen. Often if you’re doing it over and over and
over and over again you’re doubting that it’s going to happen to you.
And that means you don’t expect it to happen. Now when you don’t expect
it to happen, the law of resonance can’t kick in. Because remember, the
universe won’t give you what you’re excessively focused on, the universe
give you what you are. If you’ve used the three scenes technique to heal
your body like Sister Barbara Burns, to tell yourself and to fully
believe that your vision is getting better and better every time you
blink your eyes, and then as you step forth in the world, you expect it
to happen, your vision will get better. In my case, I expected to have
better skin. My skin got better. But it came not just because of
applying the three scenes technique, but the after effect, when I
stepped out of that meditation, I walked, I talked, I started expecting
the result. What does expectancy feel like? Let me give you an example.
Let’s say a friend asks you to lend him 1000 bucks. So you lend your
friend 1000 bucks and he promises to return the money to you in seven
days. Now seven days elapse and you haven’t gotten your money back.
Then, two weeks elapse, still no word from your friend. A month goes by,
your friend has now blocked you on his phone, he’s just not answering
your calls. You’re frustrated, you feel cheated, you are fundamentally
upset, this guy owes you money and he’s hiding from you. Now three
months later, you get a message from him and he’s come across a change
of heart. He says, you know, I was a total jerk. I should never have
done that to you. You were a good friend. I was going through a
financial hard time, I couldn’t return the money, but I’ve now resolved
that situation, so I’ve sent you a check for 1000 dollars plus interest.
This is the FedEx tracking number. You can expect the check soon, the
check is in the mail. All of a sudden, you find that you feel
differently about your friend, right? How would you feel? You’d probably
find that you’re no longer frustrated, you’re no longer angry, your
friend has apologized and the check is in the mail and you have the
FedEx tracking number and a picture of the check. Your feelings towards
your friend would have immediately changed. You know the money is on its
way. That is expectancy. You know the check is in the mail. That is the
nuance feeling you want to have after you emerge out of doing a Silva
session. After you’ve done a three scenes technique, or a MentalVideo
technique, when you step into the world, when you get off your
meditation cushion, you must have the feeling that the check is in the
mail. And what you’ve just programmed for is coming to you. That is the
power of expectancy. Just like belief, you train that bit by bit by
starting with easier things, things that you know you can easily create
and building up your reservoir of faith. So this is your exercise for
today. Today and everyday going forward, I want you to do the following
exercise. This exercise is designed to build your belief system and
build up your levels of expectancy. I want you to pay attention to how
the universe is starting to respond to you. I want you to create a
journal, and this journal is going to be called The Magic I Witnessed
Today. This particular exercise comes from a spiritual teacher by the
name of Barry Morguelan, brilliant man who has been mentoring me for
quite a while now, and this exercise has changed my life. Again, it’s
called The Magic I Witnessed Today. Every night before going to bed, I
want you to have this journal in your bedside drawer. And before going
to bed, simply write down any bit of magic that you witnessed, any
coincidence or synchronicity. The more you pay attention to the magic,
the more you write down the synchronicities, the more you will see
synchronicities happen. And you will often notice that these
coincidences and synchronicities will start getting bigger and bigger
and bigger. With my life it’s gotten crazy. I will think about something
and instantly I will meet the right person to help that thing come into
my life and it’s such a wonderful state of being, but you can train
yourself to get there. Anybody can, we are all made of the same stuff.
So yes, Steve Jobs, Sam Walton, and the teachers I’ve quoted, and you
are made of that same essence. It’s just a function of your mindset and
your training and your desire, belief and expectancy. So go ahead and
start right now. I’m going to give you a minute. Write down the magic
you witnessed today, or the previous day, or the day before that. Go
back as much as you can. Make a list, and starting today, maintain this
as a journal. I’m going to give you a minute. So you see how easy that
is? Now if you feel compelled, go ahead and share this magic list with
the community. If you have time today, go ahead and continue doing
either the short relaxation exercise or the centering exercise, whatever
you have time for. See you tomorrow.

====================

DAY 17: Centering Exercise 4

<v ->Welcome to day 17. Today, you’re going to do nothing more than the
Centering Exercise. This is the fourth Centering Exercise that’s part of
this program. I want you to pay attention to how your body feels, to pay
close attention to the words and my voice and to go really deep.
Congratulations, you’ve come really, really far. In addition to the
Centering Exercise, don’t forget your three most important questions,
let’s make sure that that is on your wall somewhere. Don’t stick it in a
drawer. Put it somewhere where you can easily see it. And remember
tonight, before you go to bed, write down in your journal the magic you
witnessed today, and I want you to continue that every day. So let’s
begin with the Centering Exercise. As you do it for the fourth time, you
will notice that you should easily be able to go even deeper, even more
easily. And if you did fall asleep the last time, don’t worry about
that, just remember, create some sense of discomfort, sit up straight,
or cross your legs, or put your hands in a slightly awkward position, a
tiny sense of discomfort to keep you awake. Now, we’ll begin.

====================

DAY 18: How to Accelerate Healing with Your Mind

<v ->Welcome to day 18. At this point in the program, we’re going to be
going on to healing. Healing is one of the most powerful aspects of the
Silva Method. Did you know when Jose originally started teaching this
protocol, he couldn’t publicly speak about ESP. Remember, this was the
60s. So in the early New York Times articles about the Silva Method, it
was labeled a Biofeedback seminar. Jose Silva was smart. Calling it a
Biofeedback seminar would bring in these busy executives and Wall Street
types. Biofeedback was a hot trend back then, they would hook up your
finger to devices that would measure your relaxation response by
measuring something called galvanic skin resistance or the resistance of
your skin, the more relaxed you are basically the higher your skin
resistance. And so this Biofeedback would allow these stressed out
executives to relax but by day two, Jose Silva would have them been
performing psychic healing intuition on each other. It was a really
interesting trick, but this is how the Silva Method spread. Healing
became one of the most powerful tools of this program. In fact, Silva
Method exploded when an article appeared in a newspaper where the writer
who wrote this article spoke about how he had had migraine headaches for
the longest time, and after taking a Silva class, his migraines
disappeared. Jose Silva when he was telling his story said “that
following the publication of this article his next seminar was swamped,
absolutely swamped.” And that’s what you’re going to learn to do now.
You’re going to learn how to apply Silva to healing. Famous doctors have
already started applying Silva to their patients. The most popular of
which is Dr. O. Carl Simonton. Dr. Carl Simonton, who sadly has passed
away at this point, and his wife started the Simonton and Research
Center and what they wanted to do is see how concepts such as the three
scenes technique could be applied to cancer. There’s evidence that
creative visualization when applied to illnesses can cause powerful
healing effects. And today, scientists are discovering that these
healing effects are more significant than ever imagined. So, O.Carl
Simonton took Silva techniques he called it Imagery therapy, and he
applied it to cancer patients. This is what his study found. He started
with 159 patients who were given 12 months to live. These patients were
asked to apply Imagery therapy, which simply means visualizing their
body’s healing. And remember they were given 12 months to live but four
years later, 63 were alive, 14 showed no more signs of cancer, 12 had
signs of cancer regressing and 17 were stable. And the average survival
time for the entire group was 24.4 months double what doctor had
initially predicted. So the mind does have a profound impact on the
body. O. Carl Simonton went on to say about the Silva system, “it is the
single most powerful tool I have to offer patients.” Stephanie Simonton
went on to say, at a Silva convention, “it is up to us to use the
technique that all of you who have had the Silva course have learned and
to use it regularly.” Now, when it comes to healing, your desire, belief
and expectancy are equally important. I want you at this point to think
about some aspect of your health that you want to make better. It could
be your fitness level, it could be moving from pre diabetes to post
diabetes, it could be hair loss, it could be bad eyesight, it could be a
poor back and I’m going to show you how to apply Silva to heal yourself.
The first thing I want you to understand is that it must come with a
burning desire. So when you choose whatever aspect of yourself you want
to apply healing for, make sure that you understand why you want to be
healed. Could you want to get rid of your back pain, not just for your
own health, but so you have a better time playing with your
grandchildren? Do you want better eyesight so you can play a better game
of sports? Do you want to overcome hair loss so that you feel more
confident showing up in the world? What would these things look like for
you? It starts with developing that burning desire. Before you start
your healing, in your journal, I want you to write down Why, why do you
want to be healed? And remember, Silva said “programming works best when
two or more people benefit.” So don’t just write down why you’re going
to be better, write down how if you’re healed, your family is going to
be better off your company is going to be better off, you are better
able to give your gifts to the world, making the world better off. This
is your grand purpose. Write that down, before we begin. I’m going to
give you a minute to choose the aspect of your health that you want to
heal, and to write down your grand purpose as to why you want this
healing. You now have magnified your desire. Now let’s talk about
beliefs when it comes to healing. Our beliefs play an incredible impact
on our body. Remember that story of how Silva could hypnotize someone,
put a marker to their skin and cause a burn bubble to form, it is
amazing how beliefs impact our healing. Now, if you thought that story
was amazing, listen to this story. In the 1950s, a new drug for healing
lymph node cancer came to market. That drug was called Krebiozen. It
received sensational reviews from the American Medical Association and
the FDA. And one of the doctors involved in testing this drug was
remarkable doctor by the name of Bruno Klopfer. Klopfer had a patient
called Mr. Wright and Mr. Wright was suffering from severe lymph node
cancer. All across his body were these giant tumors, these bumps and
Klopfer believed that Mr. Wright was facing the end of his life. Now
Mr. Wright learned that Bruno Klopfer was associated with the testing of
this drug Krebiozen and begged Bruno to give him an injection of it.
Now, Bruno knew that the drug was untested. He knew that there was no
hard evidence that this drug actually work. But because Mr. Wright was
so desperate, on a Friday, Bruno decided to give Mr. Wright an injection
of this drug suspecting that Mr. Wright wouldn’t last the weekend,
because his cancer was that severe. But by Monday, something mysterious
had happened. Mr. Wright was standing up and walking, prior to that he’d
been bedridden. He said, “that his tumors had melted like snowballs on a
hot stove.” There was no medical science that could explain what was
going on. 10 days after Mr. Wright got his treatment of Krebiozen, he
left the hospital. Now this was the crazy thing when he came in, he
could barely breathe, he needed an oxygen mask to breath. 10 days later
after the Krebiozen when he left the hospital, he was able to fly his
plane at 12,000 feet. So Wright remained perfectly fine for about two
months and then articles begin to appear that Krebiozen had not
succeeded the clinical trials. His doubts started to reemerge. Within
days, his cancer reoccurred and he had to be admitted into the hospital
again. So Bruno was mesmerized by what he saw. Obviously, the drug
didn’t actually work. Mr. Wright was actually healing himself, because
of his belief in the power of this drug. Then Bruno decided to play a
trick on Mr. Wright, hoping to help Mr. Wright healed for good. He told
Mr.Wright that in actuality, the dosage he’d been given wasn’t strong
enough, and that he was going to give Mr. Wright a higher dosage. Once
again, Mr. Wright began to heal. All signs of the cancer disappeared,
tumor masses melted, chest fluid disappeared, and Mr. Wright was back to
speed ready to live life again. Here’s the funny thing, Wright remained
completely cancer free for several months until the American Medical
Association published articles showing that Krebiozen had completely
failed the clinical tests. “The drug, said the AMA,”was worthless in its
treatment of cancer.” Mr. Wright saw his faith and belief completely
shattered. The cancer reemerged and he died two days later. Wright story
is tragic but it shows something powerful, when we are fortunate enough
to bypass our disbelief and tap into our inner healing ability, tumors
can literally melt overnight. This story proves that your mind is so
powerful that it can cause mass healing or mass tragedy, in a matter of
days. Once you recognize the power of belief, you start understanding
just how powerful your own mind can be in terms of healing your body. So
today, I’m going to show you how to apply the three scene technique to
healing your body. Tomorrow, we’re going to go deeper and I’m going to
show you how to apply the mental video technique to healing. We’ll start
with the three scene technique. Many of you might be wondering How did
that heal my skin? Well, this is what I did. In the first scene of the
three scenes technique, I would see myself with horrible skin, massively
horrible skin, I would feel the pain, I would feel the agony, I would
exaggerate a bit. In the second scene, 15 degrees to the left, I would
see myself taking some action to heal my skin. Now, there are two forms
of visualization you can do in the second scene. One is healing
symbolism. Your subconscious mind speaks in terms of symbolism. So
create some form of symbolism to signify healing. In my case, what I did
was I visualized myself looking up at the sky, grabbing sky as if the
essence of the sky could be a powerful healing cream. Putting that on my
skin and the sun’s rays shining down on my face. The sky cream merging
with my skin, and my skin becoming new and healed. Now the visualization
itself doesn’t matter. It’s the symbolism, your subconscious understands
symbolism. You can create any type of symbolism you want to apply to
healing. If it’s arthritis, you could imagine yourself with a tiny
vacuum sucking up the Arthritis powder. If it’s depression, you could
imagine yourself with orange crayon coloring over the dark clouds of
depression, with bright yellow to symbolize joy. You create whatever
symbolism you want for healing. And of course, in the third scene, you
see yourself fully healed. And you see other people benefiting from this
as well. Jose Silva says, “that if you have a severe illness that you
need healed, you want to practice the three scenes technique three times
a day for at least five minutes each time.” So when I was healing myself
of my skin issue, I practiced three times a day for roughly five minutes
each time. That wasn’t too difficult. That was only 15 minutes a day.
But at the end of five weeks, I had completely rid myself off pimples.
So this ability is in all of us. All you have to do is create desire,
belief and expectancy. Expectancy is that the bit after you’ve done your
healing, you want to be able to step forward into the world knowing that
a healing is about to take place. If you have doubts, if you question
yourself, you are going to override expectancy, dragging out the time it
takes to heal. You heard the story of Mr. Wright and Bruno Klopfer, and
how belief and expectancy can have such a profound impact on your
health. So make sure as you’re doing this, you’re building up your
reservoir of faith and start with something easy. Build up that
reservoir, then try to tackle bigger and bigger things. So remember, you
wrote down something that you wanted to heal, you’re now going to look
at that desire, and we’re going to apply the belief test. Do you believe
this is possible? Or do you believe you need more training? Mentally
answer this. If you believe without a doubt that you can heal this,
we’re ready to go to the third step. If you don’t pick something
smaller. I’ll give you 30 seconds. Great! So now, you’re going to come
to the third part, you’ve selected an aspect of your health that you
want to heal. It’s something you desire. It’s something you believe is
possible right now with your current trading. Now you’re going to apply
the three scenes technique to take you through this healing. And
remember, when you step out of this technique, you must be in a state of
positive expectancy. This technique will only take five to seven
minutes. You can go longer if you’re doing this on your own, but I’m
going to go guide you through this for five to seven minutes. And I want
you to think about various forms of symbolism you can use to speak to
your subconscious mind to create this healing. As you’re thinking of
this, I’m going to give you examples. Let’s say it is a bone injury. You
might imagine that you have special superglue that you can apply to your
bone fracture to make it heal. Maybe it’s a muscle sprain. You might
imagine that you have the ability to shine a healing light from your
hand to apply it over that muscle to heal the muscle sprain and the
pain. Maybe it’s a cold, you might imagine along with your regular
medicine that you are be able to send golden light into your throat and
your lungs and see that light heal your body. It doesn’t matter what
symbolism you use, you will create this. And as we go deeper into this
program, you will learn even more tools of healing. But today, take
something small as I teach you the process. Now let’s get started. I
want you to close your eyes, find a comfortable position and I’m going
to count you down from three to one. Three three, three. Feel your body
physically relax. Two, two, two. Feel your mind, relax. One, one, one.
You’re now at your center. For healing, I recommend you do a further 10
to one deepening exercise. As I count gently downwards from 10 to one,
you will feel yourself going deeper. 10, nine, eight, deeper and deeper.
Seven, six, five, deeper and deeper. Four, three, two, one. You’re now
at a deep level of mind, ready to apply the three scenes technique to
healing. At this time, see your mental screen in front of you, at least
six feet out in front of you, at least 20 degrees above the line of
horizon. See the pain, the frustration of this particular aspect of your
biology that needs healing. See the pain that it’s causing you. See the
discomfort. Maybe it’s physical, maybe it’s psychological. Maybe this
aspect of your biology hurts your confidence, or your belief in
yourself. See how this illness or injury might be negatively impacting
people around you and preventing you from fully showing up as your soul
desires. I will give you a minute to exaggerate and imagine the pain. We
now go to the second scene. On the second scene 15 degrees to the left,
see yourself taking some action to create healing. If you’ve seen a
doctor, bring in to play the doctor’s solution. Maybe it’s pill, maybe
it’s a form of surgery. See that pill or surgery working even better,
than the doctors suggested it would. Never apply this technique to
replace modern western medicine. Always apply together with your
doctor’s advice. So you might see yourself popping the pill that the
doctor has given you. Radiant white healing light bursting from this
pill within your body, accelerating the healing. You might also see
yourself being able to emanate light with your hands. You could put your
hand on the part of your body that needs healing, and imagine this light
flowing to you. As you do this on the second scene, feel free to even
ask your angels or your guides to support you in this healing. I will
give you a minute. We now move to the third scene. In this third scene,
see yourself fully healed. See yourself living life free of this injury,
free of this illness, free of this pain. Feel the emotions that emerge.
See yourself joyful and happy. And see how this healing is allowing you
to show up as your best self in the world and see how it’s benefiting
other people too. I will give you a minute. You’re now done. Trust that
this healing is already happening as I count you up into waking state
consciousness. One, two, three, ready to wake up feeling perfectly
healthy, feeling better than before. Four, five, eyes open, wide awake
feeling fine and in perfect health, feeling better than before.
Congratulations. You’ve just learned how to apply the three scenes
technique to healing. Remember if this is a serious illness, do this
three times a day for around five minutes minimum each. Tomorrow we will
continue with even more advanced ideas on healing. I will see you then.

====================

DAY 19: Healing Applied

<v ->Welcome back, today we’re going to go deeper into healing. This
time we’re going to talk about how to apply the MentalVideo technique.
And I’ll help you understand the nuance between applying the 3 scenes
technique versus applying the MentalVideo technique. But first a story,
I want to express to you just how powerful your mind can be when it
comes to healing. Today doctors are discovering that the placebo effect
doesn’t just apply to illnesses that require a fake pill, it can also
apply to surgery. The story that appeared in the New York times about Dr
J.B. Moseley is fascinating. This is what happened. The New York times
published an incredible story about a doctor by the name of J.B. Mosley
who wanted to see if the placebo effect worked for illnesses that
required surgery. Now, if you’re unfamiliar with the placebo effect it’s
an observation that doctors have made that certain patients heal when
given fake pills. They’re given a pill that’s essentially a placebo that
might mean nothing more than sugar water and their illness disappeared.
Now, Dr. JB Moseley who was a surgeon wanted to see if this applied for
illnesses that require surgery, the illness he picked was arthritis of
the knee. So at a veterans center he asked for 10 veterans, military
veterans, men who had served in a war who were suffering from severe
knee arthritis. He got his 10 patients and that’s when the experiment
began. Now only two patients got the actual surgery to heal arthritis of
the knee, eight patients got what is called a placebo surgery. In other
words, they were put under anesthesia and Dr. Mosley made tiny incisions
in their knee then patched it up so that when they came out of surgery,
they could see the cuts in their knee, they could feel that little bit
of pain and as far as they were led to believe they had surgery. A few
weeks later, all the patients were observed and this was the remarkable
thing, every single patient recovered and healed from arthritis of the
knee. Today that surgery is called into question. Was that surgery even
necessary or could patients be trained to heal their own arthritis of
the knee? Beliefs play a massive role in healing, so as you can see your
mind’s ability to heal your body is so much greater than we could ever
imagine. But the funny thing is sometimes the healing doesn’t
necessarily come from the way we expect. Those patients expected healing
to come from knee surgery, in actuality the healing came directly from
their mind. Eight out of 10 of them never had that surgery. When it
comes to healing sometimes the solution is more unexpected than you
might think. This is where the MentalVideo technique comes in. So
remember I shared with you my story, I was trying to heal my eyesight
and failed miserably until I decided to try with a smaller goal, healing
my skin. Now people wrote in to ask me did you ever successfully heal
your eyesight? The answer was yes but not in a way you’d expect. I no
longer wear glasses, what happened was I started doing the MentalVideo
technique to heal my eyesight. I wanted to find out what was the best
way to get 2020 vision. Was it applying Silva to heal it naturally,
which I knew still might take me several months maybe a year plus or was
there another solution? When I applied to MentalVideo technique within
three months something interesting happened, I had moved from New York
to Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia and there in Malaysia I saw an ad for a new
type of surgery called IntraLase LASIK. I met with the surgeon, met with
the doctor they had a wonderful 12 month payment plan and I decided to
sign up for the surgery. My eyesight was healed I no longer needed
glasses and it happened after a half an hour surgery and then two days
of recovery. So did I have to go and apply the 3 scenes technique for a
year? No, I applied the MentalVideo technique asking higher intelligence
to put me to whatever was the best way to heal and sometimes that
healing is modern medicine, we fail to recognize that. You do not want
to put yourself in a box and decide that the only acceptable way to heal
is with your mind. There’s no reason for that. Remember the end goal is
being healed. Healing yourself with your mind is a means goal, don’t get
obsessed with that. So you can apply the MentalVideo technique as a
compass to make sure that you’re pointed toward the right way to heal.
The second time this happened was when I turned 40. So when I was in my
late thirties I’d set all of these remarkable goals for myself to be fit
and healthy, I wanted to run a marathon before I turned 40. And then in
2016 I turned 40 in January and I looked at myself in the mirror and I
realized I had failed on all of those goals. I had a dad bod, I was not
in my best shape, I’d stopped going to the gym, I’d been on multiple
diets, but I kept putting the weight back on and these diets ruined by
moods and so I needed something. I applied the MentalVideo technique
asking for an answer. So two weeks later I was at a conference called
Transformational Leadership Council. It’s a group that gets together
every year and it’s a group consisting of America’s top 150 healers and
coaches, I’m part of that group. Now, at that conference I observed a
man getting a unique award. His name was Eric Edmeades and he was
getting an award because Eric had helped various members of this group
lose weight. He had developed a new methodology based on neuroscience,
based on behavioral psychology that over 90 days train someone in their
approach to food. And people were standing up at this conference raving
about how Eric had caused them in their fifties and sixties and
seventies they had tried multiple diets but Eric’s model that he called
WildFit had caused them to transform their health. Now, Eric then got up
after he got the award and he said, “Look I did a special class for
everyone here,”if there are any new members “who want to take part of
this class, I’ll do it again.” So I raised my hand and I signed up, that
was January, 2016. Eric started the class in March. March, April, May.
By the end of May my health had completely transformed. I’d gone from
22% body fat to 15% body fat. My energy levels have shot up and I was
feeling like I was in a different body. You see, the 3 scenes technique
guided me to a right approach. I didn’t have to spend countless hours
applying the 3 scenes technique trying to adjust my body. You see the
MentalVideo technique had put me on the right path. I didn’t have to
spend months applying the 3 scenes technique to fix my bad eating and my
higher than expected body fat percentage. The MentalVideo technique put
me at the right place at the right time to meet the right person to
learn the right protocol so that in three months flat I could transform
the way I was eating. My higher mind knew better the way to get me to my
goal than me trying to figure it out on my own. So the important lesson
here is, when it comes to healing expect the unexpected. Start with the
MentalVideo technique. Yesterday you learned the 3 scenes technique
which is amazing if there’s a direct application a pain in your knee,
bad skin, healing a fracture, getting out of something, speeding up
recovery from surgery. But it’s always good to start with the
MentalVideo technique and program your mind to bring to you the right
person, the right therapy, the right solution, and don’t get locked into
the idea that it has to be alternative healing, modern medical science
is a wonderful thing. Embrace both but trust your higher mind put you on
the right path. So your homework today is to apply MentalVideo technique
to healing. At this point, I want you to think of the part of your body
that you want to heal or the part of your body that you want to improve.
Maybe you simply want to lose weight or get fitter that’s acceptable
too. This time I’m not going to guide you through the process because I
want you to learn to do this on your own so you can do it without my
voice. But I am going to repeat the procedure for you so you fully
understand. You’re going to start with eyes open in the waking state or
the beta level and create a video of the current situation you’re in. Be
sure to exaggerate and feel the pain. Then you’re going to close your
eyes and replay that video, that entire video will take one or two
minutes. Tonight before going to bed, you will not go straight to sleep.
You will sit up in your meditative posture, you will go to the alpha
level of mind and you will replay that video for the third time, seeing
the pain of whatever health frustration you’re having. You’re then going
to send that video up to higher intelligence and you’re going to create
a new video showing the end result, the healthier, fitter, better you.
You’re going to see in that final video how other people are benefiting
too. And when you’re done this will take two or three minutes, you’re
going to send it up to higher intelligence. Waking up the next day you
are going to start paying attention to the magic of the world around
you, the synchronicities and coincidence trusting that the right person,
the right therapy, the right doctor, the right approach is going to come
into your life to help facilitate this transformation of your health.
And if you don’t see an answer or a clue in three days do it again three
days later, but trust that the answer is coming to you. So that’s your
homework for today, I want you to start right now with the first part of
the MentalVideo. I’m going to wrap up this video here and don’t forget
to set your timer so you remember to do it tonight before you go to bed.
I will see you tomorrow.

====================

DAY 20: Projection to Pets

<v ->Welcome back, everyone. You’re about to go through the most
fascinating meditation of this entire program. Every time I’ve trained
this in a live setting, this is the meditation where everybody as their
eyes are closed, you see them completely beam up and smile. So you’ll
get to experience that day, but let me tell you why. Today we’re going
to teach you to project your awareness into a pet. You’re going to
imagine a pet, and if you don’t have a pet, you’re going to pick any
cute adorable animal that actually exists in the real world. No
unicorns. And you’re going to apply healing to this adorable, cute,
wonderful animal. So this is what we’re going to be doing today. It’s
going to be a projection exercise similar to what you did in the first
projection to your living room, and then the second to metals, and then
the third to plant, but this time we’re going to go into a more advanced
creature. We’re going to go from leaves to an animal. So I’m going to
tell you what to expect in this exercise, but at this point, I want you
to choose the animal or the pet that you’re going to project into. Now,
if you have a pet, this is going to be easy. If you don’t have a pet,
think about a neighbor’s pet or a friend’s pet or think about an animal
that you have actually come across or seen in the real world. Now, let
me tell you what you’re about to experience next. Now, this exercise is
going to take anywhere from 25 to 30 minutes. You’re going to start in
the usual way with the three, two, one countdown, head to toe, countdown
deepening, and Jose Silva’s positive statements and beneficial
statement. I’m then going to ask you to on your mental screen see the
face of your pet, and I’m going to ask you to study that face and see it
with as much clarity as you can paying attention to the fur, the eyes,
the nose, the mouth. I’m then going to snap my fingers, and you’re going
to change the color of the screen. At this point, you’ve gained the
ability to do this easily. I’m then going to guide you into a protocol
for healing. Now, this is where you’re actually going to step by step
enter different biological structures of your pet. You’ve seen the face,
now I’m going to snap my fingers and ask you to imagine as is you can
see the skull of your pet, the bone structure level. And then I’m going
to ask you to imagine as if you can reach out and position your pet as
if in 3D, but remember, you’re looking at your pet’s skeletal system, so
you’ll be holding their ribcage. I know this sounds weird, but there’s a
healing methodology and a healingness and you’re about to learn, so bear
with me. You’re going to pretend as if you can move the pet in three
dimension observing the skeletal system. Now, one of the interesting
things that happens when you’re applying intuitive or psychic healing is
that your subconscious mind will tell you when there are injuries. You
might notice a crack or a hairline fracture on the bone. Think of these
as points of reference, areas that your mind is telling you that your
pet needs healing. Then I’m going to ask you to focus your attention the
chest, and I’m going to snap my fingers rapidly, you’re going to observe
the heart, the lungs, the kidney level. And as you go through these
different structures, I’m going to ask you to imagine all of them in
radiant health. You will then take your awareness off your pet and see
your pet from the outside. Meaning you’ve now taken your awareness back
out and you now see your pet all the way from its adorable little face
to its fur and you will end with your pet in radiant health. So this is
a very basic exercise. Following this you will go into projection to the
human anatomy, which is going to be more advanced, but today, we start
with projecting your awareness into a pet. So at this point, you know
what to expect. I want you to find a comfortable position to relax and
we’re about to get started.

====================

DAY 20 - MEDITATION: Projection to pets

- The Silva Ultramind System. Projection exercise number four, projection into a pet. We will start this exercise with the three-to-one method. Find a comfortable position, close your eyes, take a deep breath, and while exhaling, mentally repeat and visualize the number three, three times. To help you learn to relax physically at level three, I'm going to direct your attention to different parts of your body. Relax your scalp, relax your forehead, relax your eyes, relax your face, relax your throat, relax your shoulders, relax your chest externally and internally, relax your abdominal area externally and internally, relax your thighs, relax your knees, relax your calves, relax your feet. You're now at a deeper, healthier level of mind deeper than before. This is your physical relaxation level three. Whenever you mentally repeat and visualize the number three, your body will relax as completely as you are now, and more so every time you practice. To enter mental relaxation level two, take a deep breath, and while exhaling, mentally repeat and visualize the number two, three times. And you are at level two, a deeper level than three. Level two is for mental relaxation where noises will not distract you. Instead, noises will help you to relax mentally more and more. To improve mental relaxation at level two, practice visualizing tranquil and passive scenes. Take another deep breath, and while exhaling, mentally repeat and visualize number one three times. You are now at level one, a deeper, healthier level of mind where you can function from your center. To help you enter into a deeper, healthier level of mind, I'm going to count from 10 to one. On each descending number, you will feel yourself going deeper and you will enter a deeper, healthier level of mind. 10, nine, feel going deeper, eight, seven, six, deeper and deeper, five, four, three, deeper and deeper, two, one. You are now at at deeper, healthier level of mind, deeper than before. It is a wonderful feeling to be deeply relaxed, a very healthy state of being. Effective sensory projection statements for success. I am now learning to attune my intelligence by developing my sensing faculties and to project them to any point or place on this planet, so as to be aware of any actions taking place if this is necessary and beneficial for humanity. I am now learning to attune my intelligence by developing my sensing faculties and to project them to any point or place on any planet within the solar system, any solar system within the galaxy, and any galaxy within the universe, so as to be aware of any actions taking place if this is necessary and beneficial for humanity. I'm now learning to attune my intelligence by developing my sensing faculties and to project them to the different matter kingdoms. The inanimate matter kingdom, any of its levels and depths; the animate matter kingdom with reproductive intelligence, plant life and animal life, any of its levels and depths; and the animate matter kingdom with reproductive intelligence and an awareness of existence; the human body and mind kingdom, any of its levels and depths. I'm now learning to detect abnormalities whenever such abnormalities exist within any kingdom, any level and any depth if this is necessary and beneficial for humanity. I am now learning to apply corrective measures and to bring back to normalcy any abnormality found within any kingdom, any level and any depth if this is necessary and beneficial for humanity. Negative thoughts and negative suggestions have no influence over me at any level of the mind. The following laws are to be considered when programming. You should do to others only what you'd like others to do to you. The solution must help to make this planet a better place to live. It must be best for everyone concerned. It must help at least two or more persons. It must be within the possibility area. The following principles apply to programming. Objective physical communication takes place at your center, the beta left brain dimension, using the objective physical senses. The hearing is used for perception, and the voice is used for transmission. Subjective spiritual communication takes place at the alpha right brain dimension by using the spiritual senses. Visualization is used for perception and imagination is used for transmission. In the objective physical dimension, the past is behind us, the present is our present position, and the future is ahead of us. In the subjective spiritual dimension, the past is to your right, the present is centered straight ahead, and the future is to your left. Anatomy of a pet. We will continue programming effective sensory projections for your success and continue programming information with the use of mental projection for your benefit. We will now establish subjective points of reference in the animate matter kingdom with reproductive intelligence, the animal life kingdom at different levels and different depths, the anatomy of a pet. At the count of three, mentally project yourself to the center of your living room facing your selected wall. One, two, three. You are now standing at the center of your living room facing your selected wall. At the count of three, mentally project your pet onto your mental screen. One, two, three. Now mentally move your pet in front of your mental screen, which is black and used as a background. Your pet is facing you. Notice how the pet stands out against the black screen. Mentally turn your pet to the left, turn the pet away from you, turn the pet to the right. Place the pet facing you. At the count of three, the color of the screen will change to red. One, two, three. The screen is now red. Study your pet. How does the pet stand out against the red background? At the count of three, the color of the screen will change to green. One, two, three. Study the pet against the green background. At the count of three, the color of the screen will change to blue. One, two, three. Now study the pet against the blue background. Whatever you perceive with your imagination at this dimension, you can use as a point of reference in the future. The color of the screen will change back to green, back to red, back to black. Now mentally bring your pet closer, close enough to touch, noticing how the pet appears to become bigger as it gets closer. Now objectively extend your arm and hold the pet by the head, one hand on each side. Study the head from several angles from this outer point of view. Whatever you perceive with your imagination at this dimension, you can use as a point of reference in the future. Observe the eyes, the nose, the ears, the fur or outer covering. Focus your attention on the pet's forehead. At the count of three, we will mentally enter the bone structure level of the kingdom. One, two, three. We're now at the bone structure level. Desire to perceive and imagine the bone or bones. Bring back a memory of when you have seen a skull. Study the pet's skull from several angles. Whatever you perceive with your imagination at this dimension, you can use as a point of reference in the future. Focus your attention on the pet's forehead. At the count of three, we will enter the brain cell level. One, two, three. Desire to perceive and imagine brain cells or brain matter. Bring back a memory when you have seen a brain in a picture or on a chart. Study the brain from several angles. Whatever you perceive with your imagination at this dimension, you can use as a point of reference in the future. At the count of three, we will go back to the bone structure level. One, two, three. Now at the count of three, we will again be at the outer level of this kingdom. One, two, three. We're now at the outer level of this kingdom. Again, observe the eyes, the nose, the ears, the fur or outer covering. Now mentally move the pet a little bit higher and hold it by the rib cage. Objectively place one hand on each side of the rib cage. Now focus your attention on the center of the pet's chest. At the count of three, we will enter the bone structure level. One, two, three. Desire to perceive and imagine the ribs of your pet. Now the spinal column. Study the complete skeletal body. You can raise or lower the skeleton to any position or angle and it will remain in that position or angle. Whatever you perceive with your imagination at this dimension, you can use as a point of reference in the future. Now focus your attention on the chest. At the count of three, we will enter the heart tissue level. One, two, three. Desire to perceive and imagine the heart. Bring back a memory when you have seen a heart. Study the heart from several angles. Whatever you perceive with your imagination at this dimension, you can use as a point of reference in the future. Again, focus your attention on the heart. At the count of three, we will sense the heart transparent. One, two, three. Bring back a memory of having seen a picture of a transparent heart. Imagine what it would look like. Whatever you perceive with your imagination at this dimension, you can use as a point of reference in the future. At the count of three, we will enter the lung tissue level. One, two, three. Desire to perceive and imagine two lungs. Bring back a memory when you have seen pictures of lungs. Study the lungs of this pet from several angles. Whatever you perceive with your imagination at this dimension, you can use as a point of reference in the future. At the count of three, we will enter the kidney tissue level. One, two, three. Desire to perceive and imagine two kidneys. Bring back a memory of having seen kidneys such as in an anatomy book picture or at the meat market. Study your pet's kidneys from several angles. Whatever you perceive with your imagination at this dimension, you can use as points of reference in the future. At the count of three, we will enter the liver tissue level. One, two, three. Desire to perceive and imagine a liver. Study your pet's liver from several angles. Whatever you perceive with your imagination at this dimension, you can use as a point of reference in the future. At the count of three, we will go back to the kidney level. One, two, three. Back to the lung level. Now back to the heart level. Now back to the skeletal level. Now to the outer level of this dimension. Now mentally place your pet in front of your mental screen. Now mentally turn your pet to the left. Now turn it away from you. Now to your right. Now towards you. Change the color of the screen to red. Change the color of the screen to green. Now change the color to blue. We will change the color of the screen back to green, back to red, back to black. Now imagine your pet in perfect health. Now cause your pet to disappear from the scene. Your pet has now disappeared from the scene. Whatever you perceive with your imagination at this dimension, you can use as a point of reference in the future. It is now an accomplished fact that subjective points of reference have been established at different levels and depths of the animate matter kingdom, the reproductive intelligence, the animal life kingdom. To function at these levels and to use these points of reference, all you need is a sincere desire to solve problems. Your mind will automatically seek out these points of reference where you will perceive and become aware of information that you can use to solve such problems and this is so. Programming a technique, a mental video technique that you can use for problem solving. Whenever you need to solve a problem with the mental video technique, enter level one with the three-to-one method when you are in bed and ready to go to sleep. Once you are at your level, review the mental video that you created of the problem at beta. After you have reviewed the problem, mentally convert the problem into a project, then create with imagination a mental video of the solution. The mental video of the solution should contain a step-by-step procedure of how you desire the project to be resolved. After both of the mental videos have been completed, go to sleep with the intention of delivering the mental videos to your tutor while you sleep. Take for granted that delivery will be made. During the next three days, look for indications that point to the solution. Every time you think of the project, think of the solution that you created in the mental video in a past tense sense. We will now impress and program the three scenes technique, a technique that you can use to help you implement your decisions and the guidance that you receive. When you desire to use the three scenes technique, go to your center with the three-to-one method. Create and project onto your mental screen directly in front of you, using visualization, an image of the existing situation. Recall details of what the situation looks like in the first scene. Make a good study of the existing situation so you are completely aware of all aspects of it. If you have programmed for this project previously, then take into account any changes that have taken place since your most recent programming session. After making a good study of the existing situation, then shift your awareness to your left approximately 15 degrees. In a second scene to the left of the first scene, use imagination to mentally picture yourself taking action and doing something to implement your decisions and to follow your guidance you have received, and imagine the desired changes beginning to take shape. Now in a third scene, another 15 degrees further to your left, use your imagination to create and project an image of the situation to where you desire for it to end up. Imagine many people benefiting. The more people who benefit, the better. Any time in the future when you think of this project, visualize the image that you created of the desired end result in the third scene. You have practiced entering deep, healthy levels of mind. In your next session, you will enter a deeper, healthier level of mind faster and easier than this time. Every time you function at these levels of the mind, you will receive beneficial effects physically and mentally. You may use these levels of the mind and these points of reference to help yourself physically and mentally. You may use these levels of the mind and these points of reference to help your loved ones physically and mentally. You may use these levels of the mind and these points of reference to help any human being who needs help physically and mentally. You will never use these levels of the mind or these points of reference to harm any human being. If this be your intention, you will not be able to function within these levels of the mind, nor will you be able to use these points of reference. You will always use these levels of the mind and these points of reference in a constructive, creative manner for all that is good, honest, pure, clean and positive. And this is so. You will continue to strive to take part in constructive and creative activities to make this a better world to live in, so that when we move on, we shall have left behind a better world for those who follow. You will consider the whole of humanity, depending on their ages, as fathers and mothers, brothers or sisters, sons or daughters. You are a superior human being. You have greater understanding, compassion and patience with others. In a moment, I'm going to count from one to five and cause a sound with my fingers. At that moment, you will open your eyes, be wide awake, feeling fine and in perfect health, feeling better than before. You will have no ill effects whatsoever in your head, no headache, no ill effects whatsoever in your hearing, no buzzing in your ears, no ill effects whatsoever in your vision and eyesight. Vision, eyesight and hearing improve every time you function at these levels of mind. One, two, coming out slowly now, three. At the count of five, you will open your eyes, be wide awake, feeling fine and in perfect health, feeling better than before, feeling the way you feel when you've slept the right amount of revitalizing, refreshing, relaxing, healthy, wonderful sleep. Four, five, eyes open, wide awake, feeling fine and in perfect health, feeling better than before. This concludes the Anatomy of a Pet exercise from the Silva Ultramind System.

DAY 21: Programming Your Mind to Hit Your Biggest Goals

<v ->Today we’re going to talk about goals. But you already know a
little bit about goal setting, so that’s not what I’m going to focus on.
I’m going to focus on two aspects of goal setting that most people don’t
enough attention to. The first is thinking holistically about your
goals, not having goals just in one area, but having goals so you lead a
truly well-rounded life. And the second is going further with your
goals, being bolder and thinking bigger. The reason this is so important
to me is because after teaching Silva for five years, I found,
accidentally, that I was still not really playing at my best. In 2008,
I’d flown to London to teach a Silva class. And I was pretty proud of
myself and I’d flown to London because I had 60 students waiting for me.
I’d been teaching Silva at that point for five years and I was earning a
decent income as a facilitator and an instructor, carrying forth Jose
Silva’s legacy. Now, on the side, because simply teaching Silva didn’t
provide me enough of an income for a full-time job, on the side, I had
an early version of Mindvalley, and back then, we were not the major
company we were today. What I did was I built marketing campaigns and
websites for well-known authors. One of the authors was Bob Proctor. You
know Bob Proctor, he was one of the biggest stars of that movie “The
Secret.” “The Secret” had come out and Bob’s career had blown up. And
because I had helped him with one of his web projects, he invited me for
lunch in London. So there I went and I met Bob. And what happened next
would completely shake my life. I want to play for you this video
talking about that encounter with Bob because Bob made me realize
something. He made me realize that I had within me all of these unique
mental abilities that I’d learned through Silva. But my life was still
at a relatively low level because I’d failed on one thing. I’d failed to
ask to truly play big. I’m going to play for you a video of myself on
stage sharing that story of me meeting Bob Proctor with a live audience
at Mindvalley Live. Okay, so what happens is, for the next five years,
I’m teaching meditation, now I’ve had to move back to Malaysia, right?
Because in America, it’s kind of hard to be an immigrant, it’s very hard
to get a visa. So had to move back to Malaysia, so now we were building
up Mindvalley in Malaysia but we still stayed an American company, even
though I couldn’t get a visa and I moved to Malaysia because I
registered the company in America, America’s been making me pay taxes
for the last 15 years. So now we’re in Malaysia and every three months,
I’m flying to New York and flying to London to teach meditation classes
for small groups of people. Sometimes, there’ll only be 15 people in a
room but I would fly 24 hours to teach that group of 15 people and I was
proud of that, I loved it, I loved seeing my student’s life change.
There wasn’t much money. Imagine, flying all the way from Malaysia to
New york, teaching a class for a weekend, flying back and at the end of
it, you’ve made a grand total of $3,000, right? It’s not much but it
gave me a chance to travel and 3,000 bucks could go far in Malaysia.
Now, one day, this was after “The Secret” had become really big and Bob
Proctor, who was on “The Secret” had become a superstar. Someone
introduced me to Bob Proctor and told him that I was really good at
building websites, so Bob Proctor contracted me to build his website. So
I got to know Bob Proctor, he became an inspiration. And what happened
was, in 2008, now remember, I’d now been teaching meditation for five
years, not much money, I was further in debt than I would be if I’d
never had started Mindvalley and just stuck to a regular job, how many
of you guys know that struggle as a teacher, as a healer, as a coach? So
2008, I’m in London and Bob is finishing a big seminar and it’s
lunchtime and he’s having lunch and he knows I’m there and he’s like,
“Hey, Vishen, come over and just say hi,” during my lunch break, so I
show up and Bob Proctor asks me, by the way, you guys all know who Bob
Proctor is, right? <v ->Yes! <v ->Famous author, so he says, “So what
brings you here?” So I’m really proud of myself, I’m like, “Well, Bob, I
teach this class in meditation”and I’m going to have 40 students in a
room today, “I flew all the way from Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia,”going to be
teaching, “going to be facilitating this Silva Method class,” and Bob
Proctor asks me, “That’s fantastic,”how much are you earning from this
class?” And I go, “Well, I can tell you, Bob,”I’m going to go home with
$5,000 profit, $5,000.” Now, to me, that was a big deal, $5,000 goes
really far in Malaysia, that’s like three months salary. And Bob said,
“Are you kidding me?” And Bob Proctor’s got this really stern face and
this really, really intense voice. It was more like, “Are you kidding
me?” Then he does the Bob Proctor scowl. And I’m like, “No, seriously,
Bob, that’s what I’m doing.”I teach meditation now, “I don’t just build
websites, I can teach.” And Bob says, “Wait, you’re telling me”that you
left your wife, “you left your one year-old baby boy,”to hop on a flight
for 22 hours from Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia “to London, just so you could
touch the lives of 40 people”on a weekend and then travel all the way
back, “I hope you’re going business class.” Then he looks at me and he
goes, “You’re traveling coach, aren’t you?” Then he does that face
again. And then I’m like, “Yeah, I’m traveling coach,”if I travel
business class, I would make no money at all.” And Bob goes, “Vishen,
Vishen, Vishen.” And now he touches his face, so I knew something is
coming. He says, “You really think small.”I would never do what you’re
doing. “You got to dream bigger, son.” And he looked at me with complete
disappointment. And I was pissed off. I’m like, “Screw you, Mr. I’m the
big guy in ‘The Secret’”with your fancy suits “and your awesome voice
and your great smell,”whatever cologne “you’re using.”I like what I do,
I like what I do,” but then I went and I did that class and the next
day, I woke up depressed. And I realized Bob was right. For five years,
I’ve been doing the same thing, touching 20 people, 40 people at a time.
And I was doing like one class every two months, right? And I realized I
had to think bigger. Now, I went to my Facebook and I change the quote
on my Facebook. Facebook has a category where you put your favorite
quote and that’s what I put down. It’s a quote from Bob Proctor, “The
question is not ‘Are you worthy enough “‘to reach your goals,’”the
question is ’Are your goals worthy enough of you?’” It’s now been 10
years, right? I haven’t touched it, that is still the quote you will see
on Vishen Lakhiani’s Facebook. But I put it up and I did something else,
I quit. That was the last time I taught a meditation class, I just quit.
I gathered up completely, 100%, I never did it again because Bob Proctor
was right. I started dreaming bigger and bigger and bigger and every
time I would hit one of those big dreams, I would do the next thing. And
that’s how Mindvalley became a company obsessed with touching a billion
lives. Shifting the course of history. It’s why we set a goal to create
the best learning technology in the world. It’s why we started deciding
that we were going to be so much bigger than just me teaching 20 people
in a room meditation, we wanted to assemble all the greatest teachers on
earth. It’s why we decided to invest in technology and build really cool
learning applications, like Quest. It’s why we launched A-Fest. After I
quit teaching that meditation class, it took me two years to do my next
seminar, but two years later, that next seminar was A-Fest, which is now
one of the hottest tickets in personal growth. We had 250 people and
this time, it was in Costa Rica. And we had incredible speakers come and
share the stage with me. That was how Bob Proctor’s kick in the butt
shifted my life. We went from working from a rundown house to building
what won an award in Inc. Magazine for one of the top ten coolest
workplaces in the world. And we assembled a team of now some 250 people
from 46 countries who moved to Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia to build
everything that Mindvalley develops. It’s actually now 47 ’cause we just
hired someone from Iraq. All of that because as a teacher, somebody
kicked my butt and made me dream bigger. So after my encounter with Bob,
I stopped teaching Silva, but my very next project was a festival called
A-Fest. Now I was no longer teaching just a group of 20 to 20 people in
a small, three star hotel room, I now had a massive transformational
festival with the world’s best minds coming and speaking on my stage in
five star resorts with 300 entrepreneurs applying to attend. And from
there, Mindvalley’s platform emerged. Today I don’t touch 50 people in a
room every single month, I train 100,000 people, new students, every
single month. And of course, in addition to these 100,000 students,
which includes you and people who have enrolled in this program,
although I no longer teach Silva one-on-one, I’ve been able to grow my
reach because I’m now the new face of Silva and I appreciate that and
I’m grateful for the universe for putting me in this opportunity, but it
started by me disrupting my current reality and allowing myself to play
bigger and that’s what I want you to do as well. It will be a shame if
you gain all of these abilities and you continue playing at the same
level you’re at right now. So my question to you is, what can you do to
make your goals bigger? I want you to look back at your three most
important questions and I want you to remember this, very often, we set
our goals based on what we know is possible for us. So we set goals
based on the you that exists today. But what happens when you unlock the
mental video technique, what happens when you find that your Three Cs
technique is allowing you to create magic in the world? You’re a
different person, so you need to go back to your goals, you need to go
back to your three most important questions and expand that. Imagine
that you could do five times as much as you can do now. Imagine that you
could make life flow, you could spark synchronicities, you could tap
into intuition. Look at your three MIQ goals, are they worthy of you?
Remember Bob Proctor’s words. The problem is not that your goals are too
high and you miss them, but that your goals are too low and you hit
them. Your homework today is to write your three MIQ to think bigger,
bolder, and to ask yourself, how can you truly make a dent in the
universe? And if you have that extra time, this is a bonus tip, apply
the MentalVideo technique to ask your soul could how you can play a
bigger role in the world, to help heal and serve the world. Start by
looking at your life right now. In the first video that you’re going to
do at Beta with eyes open, then eyes closed, start by looking at your
life right now. And then when you get to the final video, that you’re
passing up to higher intelligence, see yourself 50 or 100 times bigger
than you are right now. What would that look like? What would it look
like if you could take your life and bless it so that whatever career
you’re in, whatever you’re doing right now, is 100 times bigger, what
would that look like? Just play with that for a moment and pass that up
to your higher consciousness and observe what insights and thoughts
occur to you in the next three days to help you play bigger. I’ll see
you tomorrow.

====================

Week 4: Delta Waves, Higher Guidance & the Mental Video Technique

====================

DAY 22: Centering Exercise 5

<v ->Welcome to day 22. How did it feel, looking at your three most
important questions and elevating your goals? As you come to the end of
this program, you’re going to start seeing just how much you’ve gained,
and how much easier it’s going to be to hit your goals. Joe Vitale, the
author, has a great quote. He says, “A good goal should scare you a
little”and excite you a lot.” I hope you’ve picked goals that excite
you, because excitement creates desire, but they should scare you a
little, because as long as they scare you a little, you know that you’re
playing at the right level. So congratulations on expanding your goal
list. Now, today we’re going to go into the final centering exercise.
This is the fifth time you’re doing the full centering exercise that
trains you to easily access altered states of mind, alpha and theta
level functioning, in an effective way. I want you to find a comfortable
position, relax, listen to my voice and just let yourself sink into this
deep level of mind, and enjoy the experience. This training is not just
about keeping you refreshed and relaxed today, it’s actually training
your brain to go even deeper into altered states, while staying fully
awake, so you can solve problems and apply your mind to create paradise
on earth. Let’s get started.

====================

DAY 23: Orientation to Projection into Human Anatomy

<v ->Day 23, and we’re at the final stretch. What you’re going to be
doing today and tomorrow is learning how to apply consciousness to
healing another human being. This is one of the highlights of the Silva
Program. Here’s what’s going to happen, today I’m going to share with
you a remarkable scientific study by Dr. William Braud, a contemporary
of Jose Silva. They were close friends, and William Braud proved that
even an untrained mind could influence the body of someone else by
simply sending them positive thoughts. More on that in a moment. I’m
then going to give you an idea of the exercise that we will be doing
tomorrow where you will learn as a trained mind how to project your
awareness to another human being. Today is about preparation. Tomorrow
is when you’re going to set aside 35 minutes of quiet time to go deep
and learn how to project your awareness to another human being. Now you
won’t just be observing this other human being for psychic information,
you will learn the tools of psychic healing. So it’s going to be a
really remarkable next two days. Now let’s start with that famous study
by William Braud. We all know that we can heal our own body. It’s the
basis for the placebo effect. But what is the science that says that
your awareness can influence my body and vice versa? Turns out it’s
plenty. William Braud was a scientist. He’s now passed away, but he was
a friend of Jose Silva’s, and he lived in San Antonio and worked at the
San Antonio Mind Science institute. Now Braud was famous for a
remarkable study, and it was a massive study. It involved 37 experiments
studying seven different physiological responses, such as blood pressure
or muscle tremor. It involved 665 sessions, 449 people, 13
experimenters. And the study was essentially this. They would take two
people, one would be a sender, one would be a receiver. The receiver
would be in a room hooked up to these machines measuring different
aspects of their body. The sender would be in another room. Now, at
specific moments in time, the sender would be told to send positive
thoughts and to think of the receiver. Surprisingly, at those exact
moments in time, these seven machines that were hooked up to the
receivers, they started showing changes in the receiver’s body. Their
brain wave states might change, their heart rate might change, their
galvanic skin resistance might change. It was truly remarkable. And it
happened at precisely the time the sender was thinking about the
receiver. Now the curious thing is these senders were not trained
meditators, they were not trained healers, so imagine what a trained
healer can do. Now the question is how powerful would distance healing
actually be? Is it a tiny, tiny, tiny impact on another human being, or
is it an impact that actually makes a massive difference? Turns out it’s
a massive difference. And to understand this, you got to understand the
concept called effect size. When a new drug is being released, doctors
and scientists have to measure the effect size of the drug. Effect sizes
of drugs are measured on a scale of zero to one. A drug with an effect
size of 0.03 means that in a medical emergency of 100 people, say, have
a particular illness, a drug with an effect size of 0.03 would allow
three out of 100 people to recover. A drug with an effect size of 0.3
would allow 30 out of 100 people to recover. Turned out for distance
healing, the effect size is 0.25. Turns out that if there is an illness,
and the effect size of a common medical drug to healing that illness is
0.2, meaning 20 out of 100 people would recover, distance healing has an
effect size of 0.25. Apply that along with the medical drug, and the
healing rate goes up from 20 out of 100 people to 45 out of 100 people.
This is why distance healing can be so effective. You can learn more by
searching for William Braud and downloading some of the scientific
papers if you want to go further. As for now, I’m going to train you on
what we’re going to do tomorrow. So you’re going to pick a person that
you want to apply distance healing to, and it could be a loved one, it
could be a colleague, ideally a person that means something to you,
someone you care about. It doesn’t have to necessarily be someone who is
ill, because what we’re going to do tomorrow is not attempt to
magnificently heal someone, but simply practice with sending your
awareness into someone else’s anatomy so you can study them with the
goal of receiving information that you can use to help them. You cannot
perceive or receive information that they may not want you to know, or
perceive or receive information that you would use for anything less
than the betterment of humanity. You’re going to start by seeing that
person’s space on your Mental Screen. Study the entire impression of
their face, paying close attention to their eyes, their nose, their
mouth. You are then going to imagine as if you can see their skull, and
you’re going to observe their skull level. From the bone structure
level, I’ll ask you to observe their heart. When I snap my fingers, you
will zoom into the heart, and you might imagine the heart to be
transparent so you can observe what is going on in the heart. In psychic
diagnosis, if you want to test out things such as thickening of
arteries, you can imagine as if you’re holding one of their arteries and
you’re bending it. Mentally ask yourself if it feels normal, or if it
feels hard. And if the sensation you get is that it feels hard, it could
mean that this person is showing signs of heart disease. You could also
test for blood pressure. Again, hold an artery and mentally ask yourself
is the blood pressure low, normal, or high? The first impulse that comes
to you is often the most accurate one. You can also test for blood
constituency. Imagine as if you have an imaginary test tube and you dip
that test tube in the blood. Now, with that test tube filled with blood,
ask yourself what you want to study. Is it white blood cell count? Is it
cholesterol? Imagine as if you can shake that test tube and it separates
into two levels, maybe red for regular blood, a yellow level for
cholesterol. Mentally ask yourself, does this signify high, low, or
normal? The first answer that comes to you is usually the correct one.
Then I’m going to snap my fingers and you’re going to observe their
lungs. If that person is a smoker, their lungs, rather than appearing
pink might appear gray or dark. You’re then going to observe the
stomach. Imagine as if you can zoom into that person’s stomach. What do
you see? Injuries, indigestion, any type of stomach problem will be
strikingly apparent to you. Jose Silva said that the human body desires
to be healed, so when you’re observing the other person with the
intention to give them healing, any abnormality will immediately pop out
to you. From the stomach, you’re going to observe the duodenum, the
intestines, the liver, and the kidneys. Then you’re going to zoom out
and see the person from their outer exterior. You will end with sending
them light, energy, blessings, and healings, and that’s what you’re
going to be doing tomorrow. You will also learn some advanced tools, for
example, the time mechanism. If you’re observing someone’s skeletal
structure and you see, say, a break or a fracture, you could ask
yourself, when did that break occur? Imagine as if your left hand is a
clock, and that you can turn time backwards. Imagine as if you can turn
time backwards where one revolution is one year, or 10 years, or one
hour. So you might go back 10 years first and see, is that hairline
fracture still there? It’s not, great. Why don’t you go forward five
years, is it there? Great. Go back a year, go back a year. You found
that it now occurred in 2012. Let’s try to figure out the month. Imagine
each revolution is one month. Go forward or backwards. You get the idea.
That is how detailed a truly remarkable psychic can be pinpointing it
all the way down to the exact month. Now of course, when you see
something like that, you want to use symbolic tools of healing to apply
healing. In the case of a fracture, you might pretend as if you have a
magical glue that you can apply in that hairline fracture, and then
bless with the light of your hands to cause that fracture to heal. Now,
everything you learn here you can apply on your own body. What Silva
found is that sometimes it’s remarkably easy to apply this to another
person because our consciousness wants us to heal. So keep an open mind,
pick the person for tomorrow, and I’ll see you then. For today, continue
any Silva practice you want. Maybe apply the three-scenes technique for
a healing session on yourself, or a MentalVideo before you go to bed, or
go into a centering exercise so you can fully rejuvenate yourself and
feel completely refreshed and healthy and ready for tomorrow. I’ll see
you then.

DAY 24: Projection to Human Anatomy

<v ->Welcome to day 24. This is the final deep altered state immersion
of this program. If you’re taking a silver class, this is where the
final projection exercise happens. Following this, people go into the
actual practice of healing and psychic ability. More on that tomorrow.
Today, you’re going to project your awareness into the human anatomy.
You’ve chosen the person that you want to apply healing to, and I want
to answer a common question. Does this person have to be aware? The
answer is no. Does this person have to be someone who’s given you
consent to heal them? It’s happening at the spiritual level. What I mean
by this is if you’ve chosen someone who, for whatever reason, does not
want to be healed, you will just not have any results. So you don’t have
to actually ask them, it’s happening at a spiritual level. But choose
someone whom you know, is someone you love, you have great intentions
for, loves you, and is part of your close friendship or family. That’s
the best way. You’ve already been programmed to not be able to do harm
to anyone. Remember the words we have used in previous trainings. If you
choose to do harm, you will not be able to function at these levels of
mind. So there’s already a security protocol that’s been enacted at the
spiritual level. So choose someone whom you love. You don’t have to
necessarily tell them what you’re doing because there’s no reason why
anyone would not want to receive spiritual healing. But if you want to
tell them, go ahead. Just know that they are safe and you are safe.
There is a pact that has happened beyond the physical plane. So now,
find a comfortable position and we will begin. Congratulations, you just
finished the most advanced projection in this class. I’m so excited for
just how far you’ve come, and tomorrow we start going into some advanced
concepts called case-working. I’ll see you then.

====================

DAY 24 - MEDITATION: Projection to human anatomy

- This is the Silva Ultramind Projection into Human Anatomy exercise. We will start this exercise with the three to one method. Find a comfortable position, close your eyes, take a deep breath, and while exhaling, mentally repeat and visualize the number three three times. To help you learn to relax physically at level three, I'm going to direct your attention to different parts of your body. Relax your skull, relax your forehead, relax your eyes, relax your face, relax your throat, relax your shoulders, relax your chest externally and internally, relax your abdominal area externally and internally, relax your thighs, relax your knees, relax your calves, relax your feet. You're now at a deeper, healthier level of mind deeper than before. This is your physical relaxation level three. Whenever you mentally repeat and visualize the number three, your body will relax as completely as you are now and more so every time you practice. To help you enter mental relaxation level two, take a deep breath and while exhaling mentally repeat and visualize the number two three times and you are at level two, a deeper level than three. Level two is for mental relaxation where noises will not distract you. Instead, noises will help you to relax mentally more and more. To improve mental relaxation at level two, practice visualizing tranquil and passive scenes. Take another deep breath and while exhaling, mentally repeat and visualize number one three times. You are now at level one, a deeper, healthier level of mind where you can function from your center. To help you enter a deeper, healthier level of mind, I'm going to count from ten to one. On each descending number, you will feel yourself going deeper and you will enter a deeper, healthier level of mind. Ten, nine, feel going deeper, eight, seven, six, deeper and deeper, five, four, three, deeper and deeper, two, one, you are now at a deeper, healthier level of mind, deeper than before. It is a wonderful feeling to be deeply relaxed, a very healthy state of being. Effective Sensory Projection statements for success. I am now learning to attune my intelligence by developing my sensing faculties and to project them to any point or place on this planet so as to be aware of any actions taking place if this is necessary and beneficial for humanity. I am now learning to attune my intelligence by developing my sensing faculties and to project them to any point or place on any planet within the solar system, any solar system within the galaxy and any galaxy within the universe, so as to be aware of any actions taking place if this is necessary and beneficial for humanity. I am now able to attune my intelligence by developing my sensing faculties and to project them to the different matter kingdoms. The inanimate matter kingdom, any of its levels and depths, the animate matter kingdom, with reproductive intelligence, plant life, and animal life, any of its levels and depths, and the animate matter kingdom with reproductive intelligence and an awareness of existence, the human body and mind kingdom, any of its levels and depths. I'm now able to detect abnormalities whenever such abnormalities exist within any kingdom, any level, and any depth if this is necessary and beneficial for humanity. I'm now able to apply corrective measures and to bring back to normalcy any abnormality found within any kingdom, any level, and any depth if this is necessary and beneficial for humanity. Negative thoughts and negative suggestions have no influence over me at any level of the mind. The following laws are to be considered when Programming. You should do to others only what you'd like others to do to you. The solution must help to make this planet a better place to live. It must be the best for everybody concerned. It must help at least two or more persons. It must be within the possibility area. The following principles apply to Programming. Objective physical communication takes place at the Beta left-brain dimension using the objective physical senses. The hearing is used for perception and the voice is used for transmission. Subjective spiritual communication takes place at your center, the Alpha right-brain dimension, by using the spiritual senses. Visualization is used for perception and imagination is used for transmission. In the objective physical dimension, the past is behind us, the present is our present position, and the future is ahead of us. In the subjective spiritual dimension, the past is to your right, the present is centered straight ahead, and the future is to your left. We will now program effective Sensory Projection for your success. We will establish subjective points of reference at the animate matter kingdom, with reproductive intelligence and an awareness of existence. That is, we will program points of reference in the human body and mind kingdom at its different levels and different depths, and we will study the human anatomy from a psychic point of view. At this time, select a relative, a friend, or a person whose face you can remember with the least effort. We will refer to this person as the subject. Now recall the subject's face. At the count of three, you will project the subject onto your Mental Screen. One, two, three. The subject is now on your Mental Screen. Mentally move the subject away from the Mental Screen so the Mental Screen can be used as a background. The color of the screen is black. Now mentally turn the subject's body so its left side is towards you. Now turn the subject's back towards you. Now turn the subject's right side towards you. Now turn the subject to be facing you. Notice how the body of the subject stands out against a black screen. The screen will now change to red. The screen is now red. Notice how your subject stands out against a red screen. The screen will now change to green. The screen is now green. Notice how your subject stands out against a green screen. The screen will now change to blue. The screen is now blue. Notice how your subject stands out against the blue screen. The color of the screen will now change back to green, back to red, back to black. At the count of three, you will mentally bring your subject close enough to touch. One, two, three. The subject is now close enough to touch. At the count of three, you will objectively extend your arm and place your hand, one on each side of the head. One, two, three. Objectively place your hands one on each side of the subject's head, your right hand over the left ear, and your left hand over the subject's right ear. Now study the subject's face, their facial features, their hair, eyes, eyebrows, nose, cheeks, the character of the face. Whatever you perceive with your imagination at this time mentioned you can use as a point of reference in the future. Now, concentrate on your subject's forehead and at the count of three, we will enter the bone structure level within the human kingdom. One, two, three. Desire to detect true visualization or imagination bone. Bring back a memory of bone, its shape, color, and appearance. Now concentrate on the skull of your subject. Study it from several angles, from the left, from the back, from the right. Whatever you perceive with your imagination at this dimension, you can use as a point of reference in the future. Now again, concentrate your attention on the subject's forehead area, and at the count of three we will enter the brain structure level. One, two, three. Desire to detect true visualization or imagination of brain. Recall your previous experience of how a brain looks. Perhaps you have seen pictures of the brain. Study the brain from different angles, desiring to detect the various colors of the brain such as gray in the front part, pink in the mid part, and dark red in the back part. Whatever you perceive with your imagination at this dimension, you can use as a point of reference in the future. When there is brain damage, you will get an impression of black areas or spots. To help in the solution of this problem, erase the dark area or spot and form and project an impression of a healthy brain. And it is so. When you imagine a damaged area, get further impressions of the connecting nerves with which you can then follow to the possible corresponding malfunction of the body. Damaged nerves should impress you as being oval and flat and dark in color. Healthy nerves will appear transparent and roundish. Some nerves, like those in the sensory motor system, cross over from one side of the brain to the opposite side of the body. Concentrate your attention to the front part of the brain again. At the count of three, you will return to the bone structure level. One, two, three. Get an impression of a skull. At the count of three, we will return to the outer level. One, two, three. We are at the outer level. Get an impression of the hair, the face, the eyes, the eyebrows. To test the senses, you can imagine that you are superimposing the subject's head over your own as though you were putting on a helmet. Then you will test your own senses and whatever you feel reflects the condition of your subject. While your subject's head is superimposed over your own, you can ask what kind of problem your subject has. You may ask whether it's psychological or physiological and then clear your mind for a moment of time. Whatever impression comes to you immediately after this will tell you the problem of your subject. You will then concentrate in this particular area. Whatever you perceive with your imagination at this dimension, you can use as a point of reference in the future. Remember whenever you put your subject's head over your own to remove it when you have completed your investigation. Now raise the body, still facing you, and place your hands on each side of the ribcage. Begin concentrating on the center of the chest. At the count of three, we will again enter the bone structure level within the human kingdom. One, two, three. You are now at the bone structure level. Desire to detect through visualization or imagination the skeletal structure of your subject, the ribcage, the spinal column, the arms and legs, the hip bone. We're now able to detect abnormalities at this level, and in the case of arthritis for example, you will detect a powdery substance collecting on the joints of the fingers and sometimes the wrist, elbows, shoulder joints, and even the spinal column. The same substance will be evident in other joints where arthritis might occur, such as the toes, ankles, knees, and hip bones. You will be able to detect fractures old and new. To determine when a fracture took place, use your time mechanism device and go back in time until the perceived fracture disappears and you know when the fracture occurred. Whatever you perceive with your imagination at this dimension, you can use as a point of reference in the future. Now again, concentrate on the chest. At the count of three, we will enter the heart tissue level within the human kingdom. One, two, three. We are now at the heart tissue level. Desire to detect through visualization or imagination your subject's heart. Recall previous impressions and pictures of a heart and recall how it operates. Imagine this heart belongs to your subject. Imagine it from an external point of view. Sense it, know it is there, feel it. Whatever you perceive with your imagination at this dimension, you can use as a point of reference in the future. At the count of three, the heart will become transparent. One, two, three. It is now transparent. Imagine how the valves function. Sometimes you will get the impression of an enlarged heart, or erratic beating, or scar tissue formation, and in some cases malfunctioning valves. Whatever you perceive with your imagination at this dimension, you can use as a point of reference in the future. To test for blood pressure, fold the fingers of your hand around an artery near the heart. Use your imagination to feel the intensity of the pulsations. If you get the impression of strong pulsations, there is high blood pressure. The strength of pulsations can also indicate normal or weak pulsations or pressure. If you get the impression that the artery gives and contracts, that it is flexible, then there is no hardening of the arteries. An impression of no flexibility means hardening of the arteries. To test the blood chemistry, mentally draw a sample of the subject's blood and put it in an imaginary test tube. Then agitate the blood sample and before stopping, decide the purpose of the test. Once you have decided to test for the percentage of white blood cells, or sugar content, or cholesterol, or foreign chemicals, stop agitating the sample, let it settle. You will detect two different colors of blood chemistry. The less dominant color will indicate the substance you are testing. Once you have detected what you are testing for, you will mentally ask yourself whether you are impressed with high, low, or normal content. Then clear your mind for a moment and the first impression you receive is usually the strongest and the right one. You can repeat this operation with the same blood sample for the rest of the tests. Whatever you perceived with your imagination at this dimension, you can use as a point of reference in the future. At the count of three, we will enter the lung tissue level within the human kingdom. One, two, three. Desire to detect through visualization or imagination two lungs as they expand and contract. One lung could be a little larger than the other. This is sometimes normal. You may become aware of occasional lung problems such as fluid at the bottom of the lungs, or of more serious conditions such as infections, tumors, perforations, loss of elasticity, asthma, and other detectable states. Whatever you perceive with your imagination at this dimension, you can use as a point of reference in the future. Sometimes, portions of a lung or the complete lung have to be removed through surgery. When this happens, you will detect a lighter color on the portion of the lung that is being removed, or the complete lung, when removed, may be lighter. Any portion of the body that is being amputated will impress you as being lighter in color than the rest of the body. Once you have found a malfunctioning part of the body, sense it changing back to proper functioning and let this be your final impression. At the count of three, we will enter the stomach tissue level within the human kingdom. One, two, three. Desire to detect through visualization or imagination your subject's stomach. Recall your previous experience for an accurate impression of a stomach. Whatever you perceive with your imagination at this dimension, you can use as a point of reference in the future. Some of the more common problems of the stomach area are ulcers, tumors, obstructions, and the improper balance of gastric juices. In the case of surgery, when a portion of the stomach has been removed, you will get the impression of an entire stomach with the missing part sensed in a lighter shade or color that contrasts with the rest of the stomach. At the count of three, we will enter the level to sense the intestinal tract. One, two, three. Desire to detect through visualization or imagination the intestinal tract as it begins at the outlet of the stomach, the first part of the small intestine called the duodenum. Some of the problems of the intestine are much the same as those of the stomach, and many of these same problems carry over to the large intestine at the lower right side of the trunk of the body where the appendix is located. Whatever you perceive with your imagination at this dimension, you can use as a point of reference in the future. At the count of three, we will concentrate on the pancreas at that particular tissue level. One, two, three. Desire to detect through visualization or imagination the pancreas. It is slightly below and behind the stomach. It is an elongated gland that feeds its digestive juices though a duct in the duodenum. An obstructed duct could prevent the enzymes from entering the duodenum. The pancreas contains islands of cells that produce a hormone called insulin that is released directly into the bloodstream. An impression of black spots or islands on the pancreas could indicate diabetes. Light spots or islands on the pancreas could indicate hypoglycemia. Whatever you perceive with your imagination at this dimension, you can use as a point of reference in the future. A final impression of a properly functioning and healthy pancreas is recommended for better health. At the count of three, we will enter the liver tissue level with the human kingdom. One, two, three. Desire to detect through visualization or imagination the liver. The liver is a little higher than the pancreas and to the right in the person's body. It has been said by psychics that if the liver gives a shiny impression, it is healthy. If dull, a problem exists. There could be one of several things wrong. There could be an enlargement of the liver, tumors, or infections. Whatever you perceive with your imagination at this dimension, you can use as a point of reference in the future. At the count of three, we will enter the gallbladder level within the human kingdom. One, two, three. Desire to detect through visualization or imagination the gallbladder. The gallbladder is attached to the liver. It has a duct that joins the pancreatic duct to form the common duct into the duodenum. Stone formations could exist in the duct of any gland. When you perceive an impression of stone formations in the gallbladder or in any duct, imagine going through the process of crushing the stones into a fine powder with your fingers, and imagine the powder dissolving in the gland's secretion. Your last impression of the gallbladder should be a healthy one with no stone formations. Whatever you perceive with your imagination at this dimension, you can use as a point of reference in the future. At the count of three, we will enter the kidney tissue level within the human kingdom. One, two, three. Desire to detect through visualization or imagination two kidneys. You have seen pictures of kidneys before. Get an impression of them as being solid from an outer point of view. Sometimes one kidney is a little larger than the other, and sometimes one is a little higher, but this could be a normal condition. Whatever you perceive with your imagination at this dimension, you can use as a point of reference in the future. At the count of three, we will perceive the kidneys being transparent. One, two, three. Desire to sense the kidney is transparent. If you detect these filtering systems as processing unequally of differently from each other, then something could be wrong such as an infection. An infection could travel up from the bladder to the kidney or from the kidney to the bladder. Stone formations could also hinder the functioning of a kidney. When this is the case, imagine crushing the stone formation into a fine powder with your fingers, and imagine the powder dissolving in the urine. Whatever you perceive with your imagination at this dimension, you can use as a point of reference in the future. When you get an impression that both kidneys are not functioning quite well but you are not sure why, then compare the subject's kidneys to those of a healthy person who has no kidney problems. The final impression should always be one of health. At the count of three, we will go back to the gallbladder level. One, two, three. To the liver level. To the pancreas level. To the intestinal tract level. The the stomach level. To the lung level. To the heart level. To the skeletal body level. Now back to the outer level. We're now at the outer level of the human kingdom. Here you can study the outer skin by desiring to perceive a true visualization or imagination. You can detect skin problems such as infections, allergies, tumors, injuries, or scars. Whatever you perceive with your imagination at this dimension, you can use as a point of reference in the future. Now project your subject back in front of the screen. Mentally turn the subject's body so the subject's left side faces you. Now turn the subject's back towards you. Now the right side. Now allow the subject to face you. Change the color of the screen to red. Change the color of the screen to green. Now change the color of the screen to blue. The color of the screen will change back to green, back to red, back to black. Now imagine your subject in perfect health. Now cause your subject to disappear from the scene. Your subject has now disappeared from the scene. Whatever you perceive with imagination at this dimension, you can use as points of reference in the future. It is now an accomplished fact that you have established subjective points of reference in the animate matter kingdom, having reproductive intelligence and an awareness of existence, and you understand how these points of reference apply to the human body and mind kingdom at its different levels and different depths. To function at these levels and to use these points of reference, all you need is a sincere desire to solve problems. Your mind will automatically seek out these points of reference where you will perceive and become aware of information you can use to solve problems, and this is so. From this time forward, begin practicing problem cases with one or two others who have finished the program. Each should bring some cases to the practice session, and one will function as a psychic, another as an orientologist who will present the case, a third could function as an observer who takes notes. The three can talk to one another at any time. When you have worked your firsthand cases, notice your overall accuracy, review your points of reference, and your successes. As you work the next-hand cases, continue using the three to one method to enter your clairvoyant level. Again, notice how accurate you are over those ten cases. Review your points of reference and review the special feeling of success that you experience when you are accurate and correct in detecting the problem. When you have worked still another ten cases and you continue to be satisfied with the results, then all you need to do is close your eyes and take one deep breath, and with exhaling you will enter your clairvoyant level. Once you are completely satisfied with your results, you can function with your eyes open when needed. Your desire to function at your clairvoyant level with your eyes open will cause the so-called daydream mechanism to function at your clairvoyant level. From then on, your daydreaming will take place at your clairvoyant level, and to enter it just daydream. At that time, controlled daydreaming will be creative and the true reality. Programming a Technique, the MentalVideo technique that you can use for problem-solving whenever you need to solve a problem with the MentalVideo technique and to level one with the three to one method when you are in bed and ready to go to sleep. Once you're at your level, review the MentalVideo that you created of the problem at Beta. After you have reviewed the problem, mentally convert the problem into a project then create with imagination a MentalVideo of the solution. The MentalVideo of the solution should contain a step-by-step procedure of how you desire the project to be resolved. After both of the MentalVideos have been completed, go to sleep with the intention of delivering the MentalVideos to your tutor while you sleep. Take for granted that the delivery will be made. During the next three days, look for indications that point to the solution. Every time you think of the project, think of the solution that you created in the MentalVideo in a past tense sense. Every time you function at these levels of the mind and at these points of reference, you will receive beneficial effects physically and mentally. You may use these levels of the mind and these points of reference to help yourself physically and mentally. You may use these levels of the mind and these points of reference to help your loved ones physically and mentally. You may use these levels of the mind and these points of reference to help any human being who needs help physically and mentally. You will never use these levels of the mind and these points of reference to harm any human being. If this be your intention, you will not be able to function within these levels of the mind, nor will you be able to use these points of reference. You will always use these levels of the mind and these points of reference in a constructive, creative manner for all that is good, honest, pure, clean, and positive. And this is so. You will continue to strive to take part in constructive and creative activities to make this a better world to live in so that when we move on, we shall have left behind a better world for those who follow. You will consider the whole of humanity depending on their ages as fathers or mothers, brothers or sisters, son or daughters. You are a superior human being. You have greater understanding, compassion, and patience with others. In a moment, I'm going to count from one to five and cause a sound with my fingers. At that moment, you will open your eyes, be wide awake, feeling fine and in perfect health, feeling better than before. You will have no ill effects whatsoever in your head, no headache, no ill effects whatsoever in your hearing, no buzzing in your ears, no ill effects whatsoever in your vision and eyesight. Vision, eyesight, and hearing improve every time you function at these levels of mind. One, two, coming out slowly now, three. At the count of five, you will open your eyes, be wide awake feeling fine and in perfect health, feeling better than before, feeling the way you feel when you have slept the right amount of revitalizing, refreshing, relaxing, healthy, wonderful sleep. Four, five. Eyes open, wide awake, feeling fine and in perfect health, feeling better than before. This concludes the Human Anatomy exercise from Jose Silva's Ultramind System.

====================

DAY 25: Case Working for Healing Others and Building E.S.P.

<v ->Welcome to day 25. Congratulations, you’ve now gone through five
centering exercises, five projection exercises, you’ve learned almost to
the point of mastery, the three scenes technique and the mental video
technique. Now we come to one of the highlights of the Silva seminar. If
you were taking this as an actual two day Silva seminar, this would be
the point where everyone in the seminar room would come together for one
of the most incredible mind blowing exercises in this seminar. If you’ve
been to many personal growth seminars, if you know that some personal
growth seminars end with making you walk on fire or making you bend and
break an arrow on your throat, these are all exercises to show you how
belief, how confidence, how having faith in yourself can truly matter in
the world. In the Silva seminar, it’s no different. We’d like to end
with a bang but how we do it is we get everyone in the room to come
together to do something called case working and case working is a truly
incredible phenomenon. What happens is that people are partnered in
groups of two and I’ve conducted this in rooms with 500 people. Now what
happens is just like in the psychometry exercise that you did on day 13,
one person is the guide and one person is the psychic. Now, the guide
typically has a list of cases with them. This is what a case is. It is
the name, gender, location, and age of a subject who may need healing,
again, name, gender, location and age. So it might say, Mary Claire, 53,
Paris, France, female, that’s it. On the other side of the case is
typically some description of Mary Claire, her health issue, her
personality, what she looks like, these descriptions might say things
such as injury on the left knee due to a fall, hip replacement surgery
10 years ago, gray hair, holding a cane, eyeglasses, radiant
personality. Okay, now, what happens is that the psychic goes into their
alpha or theta level of mind and when the psychic is ready, the psychic
simply says, “I’m ready.” The orientalogist or the guide, then will say
this at the count of three, Mary Claire, age 43, location, Paris,
gender, female will appear on your mental screen, one, two, three and at
that point, the psychic is meant to describe whatever appears on their
mental screen. So, the psychic then will go through the anatomy of Mary
Claire, understand where there might be issues that Mary Claire might be
facing, identify and describe those issues to the best of their ability
and apply healing before that session is done. The entire session may
take three to five minutes, that’s all because I’m going to teach you a
shortcut. You don’t have to go through the full human anatomy
exploration that we did yesterday, that was simply for establishing
points of reference. What you’re going to do here is psychic diagnosis
and psychic healing. And what happens in the Silva classes is that at
first people are maybe a little bit skeptical, it may challenge their
belief system, but every now and then one person will get a hit, and you
will hear noise, and then someone else gets a hit, and then someone else
gets a hit, and by the end of the two to three hour session, people are
just in awe at the hits they’re getting. Now Silva teaches you that
every time you get a hit from a case like this, you want to celebrate
it, express gratitude before you go to your next case. If you have a
miss, ignore it, but if you have a hit, celebrate it. So the guides are
cheering the psychics on, when the psychic has a hit the guide is “Yes,
that’s fantastic, keep going.” Now what is curious is that there’s a
phenomenon called the Magic 50. What Silva found is that as you do more
cases and you celebrate your hits, your psychic ability on your hit rate
get better and better. But for the majority of people, when they hit 50
cases, something unique happens. They develop waking psychic ability.
They develop an intuitive impulse, even in the waking state. It’s no
longer about having to go to alpha and do a three two one countdown. As
I shared in my story, walking the street in Egypt, you get an impulse to
turn around and that happens when you hit the Magic 50. So what you want
to do is now that you’re coming to the end of this program, do whatever
you can to hit the Magic 50. If you have a partner, you’re going to
practice case working with them and I’m going to teach you the
methodology. If you don’t have a partner, we have established a website
built and run by Silva graduates, where Silva graduates around the world
share cases with each other so you can practice. I’ll give you the
address of that website at the end of this video. Here’s how you want to
practice, you can use the website or you can ask a friend or neighbor to
prepare for you three cases. Each case should simply say on one side the
name, age, gender and location of the subject that requires healing. On
the other side, it should describe them, their personality, anything
that gives the psychic information of a hit. So appearances, personality
types, where they work, whatever you can write about this person. Now,
if you have a guide who’s willing to be there with you in person, the
guide can simply stay with you, as you’re going into your level and read
you the cases. The guide would start with the first case, name, age,
gender location. As you go through and describe what you’re seeing, the
guide may prompt you not too much, you don’t want to give anything away,
but the guide may cheer you on, prompt you. If you say something where
the guide doesn’t have information, the guide should not make you feel
bad, but simply say, “I’m sorry, I don’t have information”on that,
please continue.” And then when you’re done with the first case, you go
on to the second and you go on to the third, the entire process may take
15 minutes. After you’re done, reflect on what were your hits, forget
about the misses. Reflect on what were your hits, and the next day, do
it again with different cases. Remember, there’s a website to help you
retrieve cases. Now you’re going to start this exercise today. If you
can find a partner who can prepare cases for you, wonderful. If not,
like I said, I’m going to provide you a website where you can pull out
cases for you to work on. First, a couple of rules. Jose Silva
established seven rules for doing this, it’s important to understand
these rules. Let’s start with the first, we do not diagnose, only
medical people have license to diagnose and heal. We conduct psychic
investigation for detection and correction of abnormalities at a psychic
level, at a distance. So you are not diagnosing in the sense of telling
someone what might be wrong with them. The second rule is this, we do
not perform psychic investigation of a person when that person is
present. Never do that. The reason is because if you get a miss, that
person may believe you. Remember the story of how believing in something
can influence your health. The story of Bruno Bruno Klopfer, the doctor,
and Krebiozen, do not corrupt someone’s belief. Third, we do not give
our own name to be worked on as a case when we are present for the same
reason as above. Fourth, we avoid involvement that blocks our ability to
function. Don’t do this with someone whom you might have a strong
emotional tie to, for example, an ex that you’re still emotionally
attached to. Number five, we do not create problems, we solve problems.
As you’re doing this, your job is obviously to heal. Number six, avoid
talking about negative things when a person is at a deep level. If
you’re a guide and your psychic is going deep to attempt healing, don’t
suddenly bring up politics. And number seven, work on human life before
working on animal life, plant life and inanimate matter. Never neglect
human life. It is recommended that you work on your family every night,
just before going to bed. What this means is every night before going to
bed, Silva recommends that you pick your family or a family member, and
you spend just three to five minutes ensuring that they are in radiant
health. Think about what this can do for the people you love. Now one
more thing, if you’re doing a case on someone, and you certainly notice
that that person, maybe even a family member has a dark spot or a
symbolism that might indicate a disease, don’t assume that that means
that they are sick but you might, one, to encourage them in some cases
to maybe make sure they get a good medical checkup, and that they are
taking care of their health. But never go up to someone and say, “Hey, I
observed you at the psychic level”and your lung is really messed up.”
You do not want to do that but what you might say is “Yeah, I know, I’m
just curious, do you smoke?” You see the difference? You never want to
make someone feel like they are sick but if you seem to detect
information that you think might be accurate, you may want to suggest
that someone goes and has a medical checkup, or takes up a healthy
habit. So today’s video case working, if you have a friend who’s willing
to do this with you, fantastic. If you don’t, here’s the website I want
you to visit. There are several websites created by graduates of the
program. I recommend this one. This website is completely public run so
as you can see, it has some ads on it, it is not the most advanced
website, but we appreciate it because it was created by graduates. The
password is “level” as in entering your alpha level, and it’s best to
choose by most recent. Choose to the three cases and when you click
that, you will see, the name, age, gender and location of three
individuals. Go to the first one, then the second one, then the third
one and when you are done, click the button to show you the results and
gauge how accurate you are. And of course don’t forget, after doing
every individual, don’t forget to send them healing energy. So that is
your assignment today. Now let me give you a tip on how this is going to
work in your head. You’re going to start by doing your three, two, one
countdown. After you’re done, deepen by counting from 10 to one. Now
here you’re doing the rapid three two one countdown, not the centering
exercise, which could take as long as 20 minutes. You’re simply going to
go three. three, three, two, two, two, one, one, one. Then you’re going
to deepen by counting from 10 to one. When you’re had a nice,
comfortable, deep level of mind, you’re going to tell your partner that
you’re ready, and they’re going to read out the first case. Proceed to
describe what you see, then you can come out of your level, and you can
dialogue with your partner, or you can stay there and go straight to the
second case. Every time you hear what is a hit, celebrate that. It’s
okay for your partner to tell you while you’re doing a case that you’ve
made a hit because that will build up your belief and your expectancy in
yourself and you will likely get a second or more hit. Now the question
we often get is when your partner reads out the name, age, gender and
location, how do you begin? Well, here’s a fast way to do it. As soon as
your partner snaps their fingers and say this person is now on your
mental screen, see the person on your mental screen and describe
whatever you see. If the person looks unusually long or unusually short,
it doesn’t matter, describe exactly what you see. Your first
impressions, the ones that feel like guessing are usually the correct
one. Now, you’re going to imagine that you can scan this person’s body
from top to bottom, bottom to up like a radar. Imagine a radar like in
those old submarine movies you’ve seen, scanning from top to bottom,
bottom to up, and every time the radar sweeps the person, you might
notice a dot where they need healing. The dot might be in their elbow,
or their hip or their face or their chest, wherever you notice the dot,
pay attention. After you’ve done maybe five or so sweeps, pay attention
to where the dots appeared. Then one by one, go and explore those areas.
So you don’t need to randomly go through the entire body. Go to the
elbow or the heart area, or the knee, wherever you see those dots and
describe what you see. Don’t worry about getting it right. Focus on
describing what you see, you will automatically start generating hits as
you become more comfortable with this. The process is really easy. Go
ahead and try that now with your partner or use the website that I’ve
given you. Tomorrow, we’ll go deeper in this and we will add more nuance
to this approach. Enjoy yourself and celebrate your hits.

DAY 26: Develop Your Waking Psychic Ability

<v ->Welcome to day 26. So if all has gone well, at this point, you’ve
done at least three cases. Today, you’re going to aim to do another
three or six or nine, however many you can go. Today I’m going to give
you an additional tip to find partners that you can work with, enter our
community that comes with this program. All our students are linked
together in an online community. And maybe ask around if there’s someone
in your vicinity. It is wonderful to be able to form Silva groups where
you can collaborate with other students and work on case working. It is
an incredible way to grow your psychic ability. Now, what do you do if
you tried this yesterday or today and did not get ahead? Well, the thing
to remember is don’t give up. I once met Isabel Silva, Jose’s daughter.
Isabel had a remarkable story. So Jose started training Isabel on
psychic ability at an early age. And Isabel showed incredible talent.
Jose, new that she wasn’t born with these gifts, she had developed these
gifts. Isabel went on to become a medical intuitive at a hospital in
Texas. She worked closely with doctors and when a patient walked in
through the door, she would scan the patient. The doctor would diagnose
the patient, but Isabel would sometimes whisper to the doctor, “You
might want to pay extra attention”to that person’s left hip.” She would
sometimes detect information that the doctors may not automatically know
off. This is what a medical intuitive is, and she had a thriving job at
a hospital. Now, Isabella told me something really interesting. She
shared a story with me. There was a student of the Silva class who was
an Air Force pilot. Let’s call him Jim. Now Jim being an Air Force
pilot, being a top gun, was a guy who aced everything he did. So he was
so disappointed that at the Silva class, he kept getting miss after miss
after miss, other people were getting hits, but Jim kept making misses.
But Jim remembered what Jose Silva said. “Don’t give up, keep
practicing,”soon as you get a first hit, celebrate it, “and more and
more hits will happen.” Jim fortunately, following the Silva class had a
friend who was a nurse at a hospital. His friend who was the nurse would
come sit with him in the car and share with him information that she had
on people who needed healing. So she would mention the name, age, gender
and location. Jim would attempt to detect what abnormalities they might
have with the aim of giving them healing. Now, Jim kept failing and
failing and failing and then, he saw it. He saw a diseased spleen. And
he mentioned, diseased spleen, and he said it was so clear and vivid. He
just knew he was right. The nurse confirmed that he got a hit. Jim
celebrated that hit and something flipped in his mind. He kept getting
hit after hit after hit. Jim got so good at this that he developed
waking psychic ability. He would show up at Silva conferences and just
observing students he would know how they needed support, how they
needed healing. There was one very interesting thing. You see back then
in Silva conferences, Jose Silva did not teach the MentalVideo
technique. This was the early days before MentalVideo. So back then,
Silva graduates would create someone called a tutor or a counselor, an
imaginary advisor who might be a historical figure, or a fictional
character, or a relative who had passed on. An imaginary figure that
they would be able to communicate with when they’re asking for help from
higher intelligence. We don’t use that in this seminar because you’ve
learned the MentalVideo technique to directly talk to higher
intelligence. But back then, people had tutors or imaginary counselors.
Now a curious thing about Jim, the Air Force pilot is that he got so
good at this. As he walked through a Silva class, he could see people’s
imaginary counselors. Isabella told me about an instance where he went
up to a person and he goes, “Oh, I see you’re working with Othello.” And
it was Othello from the Shakespearean place. So it is remarkable what
you can do when you train your mind in this way. This is why the Magic
50 cases are so important. Waking psychic ability is an amazing gift. So
today you want to continue with another three cases. Tomorrow, we’re
further going to refine the approach. Remember, don’t worry about the
misses, celebrate the hits. And every time you celebrate a hit, and you
fill yourself with gratitude and appreciation, you’re going to get more
hits and more hits and more hits. And by the way, do you notice how this
technique parallels the technique that I shared with you in an earlier
lesson on quitting a journal called, “The Magic Eye Eyewitness Today.”
Every time you celebrate the magic you witness today, you will see more
magic happening in your life. Go ahead and practice on more cases today,
as many as you can. At least three and I’ll see you tomorrow.

====================

DAY 27: Refine Your Case Working

<v ->Welcome to day 27. Today you’re going to continue with case working
and refine your skills. This time I’m going to give you another level of
refinement. Now, if you’ve been doing this right, you should be at
around six cases minimum. Maybe you’re at 10 or beyond. Does the
approach change when you get beyond 10 cases? Well, what Silva found is
that case working is such a powerful way of creating the mind that as
you get to 10 and beyond, it seems to activate abilities in you where
you can get to the Alpha and Theta level of mind faster and increase
your accuracy. Now, what this means is that the more cases you do, the
faster you can get to Alpha and the more waking psychic ability you can
generate. Here are the rules. For the first 10 cases when you’re working
with your partner, count down using the three to one method then the 10
to one deepening exercise. By the time you’ve finished 10 cases and
you’re on case 11, you can streamline the approach. Your body and mind
are getting used to this, so now you can go straight to Alpha simply by
doing the deepening countdown, 10 to one. You no longer have to do the
three to one. You can still do that if you have time, but you can
immediately go down to Alpha using 10 to one. Now for cases 21 to 30,
you’ve again fine-tuned your ability. You should be able to get to Alpha
even faster, so this time you don’t even have to go 10 to one. You could
simply count down from three to one. I mean like this. Three, two, one
and you’re there. That’s how fast it can be. When you’ve done 30 cases,
you can enter your clairvoyant level by simply closing your eyes, taking
a deep breath, and exhaling, and then begin working on your case. You’re
training your mind to dip into altered states in faster and faster
amounts of time. Now when you’ve done 40 cases and you’re onto the 41st
case, once again you’re going to shift the process. At that point, you
don’t even need to take a deep breath, nor do you even need to close
your eyes. You can enter your center by simply defocusing your eyes. I’m
doing that right now, and instantly access your intuitive ability. This
can be useful if you’re in a business meeting and you’re trying to tap
into intuition to create and generate an idea but you don’t want people
who are used to the old ways of functioning of the world to think that
you might be taking a quick nap, you know, so you’re learning to train
yourself to go to the Alpha level by simply defocusing your eyes with
your eyes open. It’s a really cool gift in certain circumstances, so for
cased 41 to 50, you’re going to attempt to do it with your eyes open and
defocused, so remember that. You’re not just training yourself to get
hit after hit. You’re training yourself to get hits and to enter your
Alpha and Theta level of mind faster than ever before. This is the part
to waking psychic ability and when you unleash this gift, your whole
world starts to change. You become one of those rare individuals who is
not just blindly setting goals, blindly pushing through in life. You
have an inner guidance mechanism, a compass that ensures that you’re
always working on things which are moving you towards what your soul
needs you to do, and that is an incredible gift to unlock within
yourself. Good luck with today. Continue practicing case working.
Tomorrow we wrap up this program and I’m going to show you what to do
next.

====================

DAY 28: Continuing Past this Program

<v ->Welcome to the final day of this program. I’m excited because
you’ve now unlocked all of these amazing abilities in you. The trick now
is to incorporate this into your daily lifestyle, so that you get better
and better every single day. Now here are some tips, on how to make
Silva part of your life. I started Silva when I was 14 years old, I’m
now 44. So it’s been three decades of Silva practice for me, five years
of which I was a Silva instructor and the results that’s had in my life
has been phenomenal. Here’s what I recommend in terms of incorporating
Silva into your lifestyle. Firstly, enter your level every morning when
you wake up. That’s the best time. The first five minutes when you get
out of bed, you are still in a light, alpha level of mind. So it’s easy
to go deep. So wake up, go brush your teeth, use the bathroom, get back
on your bed, sit down and go into your alpha level. That’s the best time
to meditate. As Jose Silva says, “Meditating first thing in the morning
is best.”Meditating in the evening “before going to bed is second best.”
Now in terms of time under meditation, Jose’s syllabus says, five
minutes a day is good. 10 minutes is very good. 15 minutes is excellent.
And you don’t have to meditate just once a day. Some people do it after
lunch and do it also before going to bed. Silva says in terms of
frequency of going to center. Once a day is good. Twice a day is very
good. 15 minutes a day is excellent. So you could be going to center
once a day for five minutes, or you could be going to the center, three
times a day for 15 minutes, you choose. But as you can see, this as an
extremely small investment of time and it’s easy to do. Well, the first
thing is, relax and go to your center level of mind. What happens when
you do this is that you experience all the benefits of meditation.
Meditation has been shown to give so many beneficial effects to your
body. I don’t need to cover that again. But you will find that when you
go to center in the morning, the way you show up in the day, is going to
be remarkably different. You’re less reactive. You’re more intuitive.
You’re happier. You’re able to deal with complex scenarios and stressful
situations with greater ease. Even five minutes changes the way you show
up in the day. It’s like taking a magic pill that unlocks super powers
within you. But you can go further just being at the alpha level and
theta level has beneficial effects, but go further and apply the Three
Scenes Technique. You can think about goals for your future. Remember,
you have a list of those goals on your three most important questions
list. But you can also look at things that you need to do today. Maybe
it’s give an interview. Maybe it’s close a sales call. Maybe it’s
present something to your team. Maybe it’s conduct a meeting or maybe
it’s continued coding on your new app. Use the Three Scenes Technique to
remove any obstacle to what you’re seeking to do today. So you can look
at tasks for today, but you can also look at task three years into the
future. I recommend you do both, since the Three Scenes Technique is
such a rapid thing to do. Do it once for an outcome you want to
accomplish today. And once for an outcome in the future, that itself can
make an incredible impact on your life. Now the next time, that you may
want to go to center is before you go to bed. Jose Silva suggests that
before we go to bed, we attempt on working on the health of our family
members and our loved ones. So bring the mind, family members, sons,
daughters, brothers, and sisters, scan them and apply energy healing to
them. Don’t underestimate the power you have to influence the healing of
another human being, and then try doing the Mental Video Technique. I’m
sure that every single day, there’s something that you could use
guidance on, that you can apply the mental video. It could be something
small. Maybe a small issue, where you want to help your son or your
daughter. It could be something big. You’re trying to raise funds for a
new startup. Apply the mental video to whatever you need, that’s
furthering your soul’s purpose in the world so you can do good and help
improve humanity, multiple generations down. And you’ll be surprised at
how insightful and how powerful the answers can be. This simple morning
and nighttime practice, will change the way you show up in the world. I
know because I’ve been doing this for 30 years. Congratulations on
completing this program. To make it easy for you to have access to all
of these tools, on the Mindvalley App, we have made all of these
meditations available for you. So here’s the list of meditations that
you can access. You can access the short relaxation exercise and the
centering exercise. If you want to, you can also retake any of the five
projection exercises. And we’ve also made available the alpha sound and
the theta sound for you. You may not need it though, because sometimes
these sounds can be a crutch. This program has been so deep and so
well-structured in terms of creating your mind, that you by now can get
to alpha and theta yourself with a quick countdown. I’ve also made
available for you, a recording of the Mental Video Technique and the
Three Scenes Technique just in case you need that, and you want me to
guide you through it. The techniques are so simple. You should be able
to do it on your own. Many people who finish the online course are
excited about taking the seminar, because at the seminar you go through
another session of reinforcing all of these in your mind, and you also
get to practice with other graduates. It’s an easy way to get to your
magic 50 cases. If you want to learn more about the Silva seminar, go to
mindvalley.com/seminars/silva. Thank you for being part of this program.
Share your results, share your excitement with the community. Don’t
forget to be supportive and welcome new students who join this
community. And you can always connect with fellow graduates in this
community to continue your practice. And most of all, continue
practicing cases. Get to that magic 50 and watch how your life is going
to change. I’m Vishen Lakhiani. It was an honor to be your guide. Thank
you for joining us on this journey.
