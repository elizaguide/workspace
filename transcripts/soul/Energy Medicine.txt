Preparation 1: Welcome To Energy Medicine
--------------------

Hi, welcome. We're really glad you're going to go on this adventure into energy medicine with us. And you're going to find that it not only can change your life to the better and give you more vitality and better health, it's fun. It is really fun. So energy is your life force. It animates every single cell and muscle and fiber in your body. Energy medicine ministers to that life force. When your energies are flowing and in balance, you are healthy and you feel great. When your energies are not imbalanced, or maybe they're blocked. then you don't feel great. Maybe you're tired and you feel vulnerable and depressed. All sorts of things can happen. Even illnesses can come your way. So energy medicine gives you tools to stay happy, healthy, and vital. And I'm Donna Eden and I want to tell you why I am a trustworthy guide for our journey into energy medicine. I come to this because this is what healed me. I had a lot of different ailments growing up, including I was allergic to everything. I had asthma. I got multiple sclerosis at 16. I had a heart attack at 27. And I was told around 29 to pack. pack it in and make arrangements for my daughters that I was raising. And I think that that gave me more impetus than anything else to figure out a way because Western medicine couldn't help me. They all said the same thing, that there is no cure for multiple sclerosis. And they said my organs were breaking down so fast that there was just no way anyone knew how to turn it around. Well, I was fortunate with something in my life. I always saw energy. And so I went home that day and began to play with my energy, literally play with it. And I found that if I put one hand just around my hip bone and the other one at the top of my knee, because that's the part of my legs that didn't walk very well. I sometimes had, for a period of two years, I had many days where I just had a very hard time walking at all and so I would if I put one hand on my hip and one hand on my knee I found it only took three minutes for that energy to connect up and I could feel it and I could see it and I I was elated and I was excited and I knew I absolutely knew I was going to get myself well and from there I just started I just started you know pretending I knew what I was doing and And things began to happen because your body listens to you. These energy systems in your body are so intelligent and they are so responsive to you because we evolved alongside or with our energy. We're energy. And so, of course, your body wants to be in response to you. So that's why I'm going to be a great guide for you. I have figured out the maze in my own body. I had a practice for 23 years where I figured out the maze in other people's bodies. And now I am so honored and grateful and glad. Every superlative I can think of that I get to teach people how to heal themselves or how to work with somebody else's energies. Because you can rely, you can truly rely on your energies to do for you what you need them to do. But you just need to learn this communication with your own energy systems. That's it. And I'm David Feinstein. The way I came into energy medicine was through marriage. And we've been together for almost 40 years. And so I saw Donna right after she healed herself from her multiple sclerosis. That's when we met. And she was just getting into her work then. And I, frankly, was very skeptical about what's going on. I could tell that she was getting good results. People were flocking to her. She was having really exciting classes. People were coming from all over the world to work with her. So I didn't have any question that something interesting was going on but what it was was very questionable to me because i mean as you can see she has some charisma that can help i know that i've actually done studies myself of what makes therapy work and charisma and caring and belief in the method that does a lot towards healing But there was so much more that seemed to be going on that I had to figure it out. And I'm so glad that I did because in my work, it turns out that bringing the energy perspective into it makes it possible to treat serious illnesses like PTSD, like depression, like anxiety much more effectively. So I started incorporating what Donna does into the psychological work and was amazed at how powerful it is, how you can work with energy. that change what's happening in the brain, just in the way that she works with energies that change what's happening in the whole body so that illnesses can be overcome, so that the immune system can be strengthened, so that all the different systems in the body can work more effectively. So I am really happy to be part of this adventure with you where we'll be sharing. So much of what Donna has figured out, not just in the last 23 years, but in the last 40 years, where after her practice was immensely successful, she went on the road to teach the work. And so she's been teaching this for 18 years now in a very systematic way. And you're going to kind of get the benefits of what she's figured out in all these 40 years. Actually, I want to say that I have been teaching since 1977 because I wanted to teach at the same time I was treating people. I wanted them to learn how. And so I also would teach it. But in these last 18 years, it's been almost solely just teaching. If you come along with us, you're going to learn so many wonderful things like how to get your energy back when you lose it, or how to lift yourself up out of despair, how to take stress away, how to take pain away, how to balance your energies so that you really do have vitality and aliveness and you like yourself and your world better. It's just... I mean, it changes everything when you learn energy medicine. So here we go. Let's get started.

Week 1

========================================

LESSON 1 – Energy Medicine for Health & Vitality
--------------------

-[David] So, in order to give you an idea of the dynamism of Energy Medicine, Mindvalley has invited about a dozen people here to be our audience.
And the audience in part is there so that we can do demonstrations with them, so you can see how this works, so you can see Energy Medicine in action.
-[Donna] So, I'm going to demonstrate energy.
And I'm going to invite somebody up in the audience to come on up here who would like to see energy work on you.
Okay, come on up.
Okay.
David, I'm going to move you out of the way.
And tell me your name.
- [Alice] Alice.
- Alice.
Okay.
What I'm going to do with Alice is I'm going to energy test her.
And energy testing is a great biofeedback tool to let you know what's going on in the body.
Well, I'll just talk about it as I do it.
I'm going to have her put her arm up like this with no fist because this is not a muscle test.
I'm checking to see if the energy will go all the way out her arm.
I'm going to push down and she's going to push up.
Okay?
And then… that's it.
What is that about?
Maybe two or three...
Two seconds, a second and a half is a short amount of time but is enough for me to see that I can't push her arm down.
So here's what I'm going to do.
I'm going to move you back a little bit.
Is this going to work?
Okay.
This will work as long as I'm in her auric field, okay?
So I'm going to come down here, just travel up her body to her head and out and around.
And I'll explain what I did in a minute.
Now, do the same thing.
You push up with all your might, but this time, I'm going to use only one finger.
So you'll see that I'm not overpowering her.
And that will happen with every single person in the world because our energies are electromagnetic.
So if you align your energies up with somebody else's, you will move their energy.
Now, what I just did was I traced a meridian backwards so that it took energy out of the flow.
Now, I'm going to come back here, and as long as… again, as long as I'm on the edge of her aura, it will work because her aura is also electromagnetic.
So I'm going to trace from underneath her eyes to the bottom of her cheekbone, up around her face, down through her body, all the way down and off the second toe.
And I want to tell you, I could feel that.
You can really feel that when you do it.
And I'm really pushing now.
So you can see that… I mean, what I did was that time I traced the energy forward and it's like I had a magnet in my hand and her energy just followed and it gave her strength.
And so it's a wonderful thing for everybody to learn how to do that.
Thank you.
- Excellent.
Thank you.
- All right.
Was that understandable to you?
Yes?
- [Woman 1] Yes - Okay.
All right.
How about somebody in the audience come up who might be feeling a little tired or a little off?
Anybody.
Jump up.
Okay, I got her.
She's here.
Okay.
Yes, okay.
So yes.
Okay, yes.
So give us your name.
- [Deborah] Deborah.
- Deborah.
Okay.
Hold your arm up real strong, Deborah, and I'm going to… so she's nice and weak to begin with, okay?
So I'm going to bring you over here and… let me see.
Okay.
Now, I want you just to walk backwards, Deborah.
Okay, stop.
Deborah is very strong going backwards but going forward, Deborah is nice and weak.
And that happens to all of us.
I'm going to move you over.
That happens to all of us when we get tired or if we've taken on too many projects.
Or we're dividing ourselves up between too many things and too many people and you lose your rhythm and your meridians literally flip around and go backwards.
And so when you walk forward, you're not in alignment with your energies anymore.
So that you start losing energy as you move through your day.
That makes sense?
- Yes.
Absolutely.
- Okay.
So, I'm going to show you something.
Now, I want everybody in the audience, in both audiences, to come to their collarbone.
I'll let you do it for yourself.
Come to your collarbone and come to the corner here.
See, if you follow that bone and come to the corner, you'll come to that knob.
Then drop underneath the knob, okay?
And you're on two points.
It's usually a little bit of an indent.
And if you knead it, it hurts a little bit.
Yes?
- Mm-hmm.
- Mm-hmm.
- Mm-hmm.
Oh, yes.
- Okay.
And sometimes, it hurts more on one side than the other side.
And that's because we tend to get lopsided also as we go through our day and have stresses.
So if one side hurts, that's just information.
You want to know that information.
So we're going to massage them both.
Okay.
Now, Deborah, I want you just to walk to the end there, to the rag, and then come back.
Just walk forward, forward.
Walk that way forward, walk to me forward, and we're going to see what happen to you.
Yes.
- Very different.
- Yeah.
That was very good.
Now, I'm going to tell you what happened.
These points are called K27.
They are the 27th point on kidney meridian.
And they flip the meridians around.
It's like...
I mean, it's a wonderful tool that, you know, evolution gave to us.
We have these tools already.
It's not like I figured them out and...
I mean, I made them up or anything like that.
They've been with us since the beginning of time but we lost them somewhere along the way and we're refinding them.
Okay?
- Yes - All right.
So you want to remember this, K27.
You can also...
You know, if you find them and you massage them a little bit, you can also tap them.
And they are a great thing to do.
You know, like if you're going to walking into a situation that you know that you're a little off, boy, immediately.
Your K27.
Thank you so much - Thank you - You're welcome.
Okay.
- Okay.
Now, isn't that interesting?
Why would it be that when Deborah walked forward she was weak but when she walked backwards, why would she be strong?
How could that be?
And it actually shows you something about how the energy body is designed.
The way the energy body is designed is that these pathways that Donna talks about as meridians, using the term from Chinese medicine, there are 14 major energy flows, half of them go up the body, half of them go down the body.
And we are designed so that when we walk, when we run, when swim, when we do the kinds of activities that our ancestors did, it is good for us.
It is like massaging your energy body.
The direction of the flow of the meridians is coordinated with the movement of the muscles so that it has that positive effect.
But nature had a design problem, how to let you know that it's time to rest before you drop.
I mean, nature couldn't send you a text or any email, had to figure out a way to signal to you.
And the way it worked is very interesting.
These 14 meridians have a specific direction that is aligned with your muscles and your anatomy.
But when you reach a certain level of being tired long before you are exhausted, those meridians reverse their direction.
They all go in the opposite direction.
So now, when you walk or do any of your regular activities, you're going against the flow.
You get it?
Now, it's like draining you real fast.
You can override it but it's your body is now telling you it's time to rest.
That's a brilliant system if you live according to your body clock.
You're tired, you rest.
But many of us live according to this kind of clock.
Don't we?
And so what happens is that we're out of rhythm with our bodies, with our energies.
And what Energy Medicine does, many things, but one of the things that it does, is it gives you tools to get your energies into harmony with your lifestyle, get your energies into harmony with your lifestyle.
How great is that?
To be able to manoeuvre what's happening in your body so that it works with the life that you're living.
So it's 3:00, you're at work, you're dragging, you're pushing through, you know that feeling.
And so you find these points.
Let's find them again.
Find your collarbone, come towards the middle, before you reach the center, there are little knobs for most people.
Everybody's anatomy is a little differently, but for most people, there's a little knob at the end before you get to the center, then drop under the knob, and for most people, there's a soft spot.
These are the K27 points.
These are the points that you want to massage.
And these points work when you massage them hard.
Okay?
They don't work if you massage them softly.
These other points that you just hold in Energy Medicine, but these, you massage them really hard, and breath, always breath.
And the standard breath in Energy Medicine is in through your nose and out through your mouth.
And Donna will explain that later.
Breath in through your nose and out through your mouth.
Then you're ready to face your day.
So does that mean now that you know these points that you never have to sleep again?
No, it's not that powerful, but it is powerful and again, it helps you get your energies into harmony with your lifestyle.
- Now, I want to say and show something that I was noticing in this audience in front of us.
I saw three people who weren't shifting that energy very much.
And I think that since you are out there and not in this audience, you might need to know this, because this is important.
Now, I could pick you.
Yes, come on up and I'll show you.
I'm going to move you out of the way.
- And before we do that, I just want to say when Donna said, "I could see," what did that mean?
And what that meant is that Donna, from early childhood, has been able to see the body's energies.
And that is a gift that she has and she always is a little squeamish about me telling people that she has it because she doesn't want to give the message that you have to be able to see energy to be effective with this work.
Because she's created a career around teaching people that don't see energy how to work effectively with their energies.
But for her, it not only is something that she has always been able to see, it's something her mother was able to see.
And what Donna believes is that we all can see energy but very early as infants, we're learning so much and what the culture doesn't reinforce gets lost.
And so that never develops in most people.
But for her and for her siblings who are not in this work, they all three are able to see energy.
Her brother is a redneck, so he doesn't talk about it in bars, but he still sees it.
And they talk about that.
Donna was in her 20s before she realized that everyone didn't see energy.
She thought everyone did.
Her mother did.
Her siblings did.
Of course, how else would you know who to trust than… so much information comes in from saying that.
But it was only when she was feeling herself that she realized that she could use that ability in a healing manner.
So it's been a very interesting journey how she's related to her ability to just see energies but it's very handy in looking over an audience and saying, "Oh, that technique didn't work for you.
Let's figure out why." - Okay.
Thank you.
I really want you to know that you are learning a language.
Energy is the language that your body speaks.
And it's a language that every person in this world can learn and speak.
And when I have been in less advanced technological cultures, many people in those cultures already know it because they were raised with it.
I also want to say what my husband said about me seeing energy.
I have seen people who have...
Who are studying in this for a long time.
Their senses always start opening up.
And maybe it won't be seeing energy but it may be feeling or hearing.
I've known people who can test the energy.
But many people start to see the energy.
So I just...
You reclaim it when you start doing this dance with energy.
Okay.
Now, what we spoke of before and what I demonstrated before was K27, that if you massage them or tap them, they will flip the energies around and go forward and you're in sync with your energy.
But I'm just going to show you, on.
Come on up here and tell everyone your name.
- [Markey] It's Markey.
- Okay, Markey, I'm going to energy test you.
She just walked to the side of the room and it didn't help her.
So when something doesn't work, it doesn't mean that the technique doesn't work.
It may mean that something is blocking it.
Something else is going on or in Markey's case, Markey, did you massage as hard as I do?
- No.
Oh, my God.
- See what you've been doing wrong.
Yeah.
But now watch Markey walk to me.
Yes.
- Oh, yes.
- Okay.
So you remember that.
- I will.
Thank you.
- All right.
Now, we know Markey is strong to begin with, I think.
Okay.
Now, I'm just going to come here and massage this lightly.
And now hold with all your might.
You really have to go deep on K27, okay?
Because it does the opposite.
It's as if you were going against your flow again.
And these are not just for kidney, 27th point on kidney meridian.
It's the juncture point for all the meridians in the whole body.
So you want to be able to really reach them, okay?
- Okay.
- Now, you do it yourself and see if you can get it.
You're on great points but you're not quite on them.
That's a bit of like… let's see, Markey.
Right there.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
Really deep.
That's good.
That's good.
Yes.
All right.
Thank you.
All right.
Now, I'm going to ask.
Is anybody here feeling ungrounded?
Well, all right.
Come on up.
Did you fly here?
- [Woman 2] Yes I flew.
- Where did you fly from?
- Phoenix - Phoenix, Arizona.
So sometimes when you're in a flight, you can get very ungrounded.
You know, you've been off of planet earth for quite some time and you get ungrounded.
So you need some simple tools to get grounded.
I'm going to do a some simple one for you, okay?
I'm going...
Let's see.
You hold your arm real strong.
You're strong.
And I'm going to come down to your second toes and I'm just going to push in on them.
I didn't push hard.
I didn't hurt you but boing.
The reason why that shows up is because what I am testing is stomach meridian.
And it's a meridian that travels from right underneath your eyes and goes all the way down and off your second toe.
It also grounds you into the earth.
Stomach meridian is an earth element, an earth element.
All the meridians belong to the elements.
So stomach belongs to earth and it's an easy one to test whether you are grounded or not.
And you're not.
So we're going to see what we can do to stomach meridian at the other end, the other end of the meridian to see if it'll go down your feet.
So here's what we're going to do.
And anybody out there who needs… I mean, everybody do it.
All right.
We're going to tap your cheekbones and tap it with some pressure.
If you're too kind… it's the same thing like K27.
That's good.
Okay.
And breathe.
Don't forget to breathe.
In through your nose and out through your mouth.
Now, I wonder if you can even tell if you think you are or not.
You think you did it?
- Yeah.
I think I did.
- You look different.
Okay, now, I'm going to come down to your toes again and go boing and see.
Yes.
All right.
That is good.
That is so simple.
Throughout this class, I'm going to show you different things that will ground you.
But that's so simple.
You know, you need to be grounded first.
Some things coming up, and you can just do it as you walk in the door.
You can do all of these things as a part of your life and it will really, really help.
You do look more present.
All right.
The next thing… okay.
I'm going to show you the thing that happens to me periodically and I don't believe I ever get on a stage to teach without doing this one first.
So I want to know.
I can just choose one of you or I can say… I'm going to choose you.
Okay.
And we're going to need a chair too.
But all right.
- [ Woman 3] This one over here.
Yeah, here is this chair, David.
Okay.
I'm just going to put it… you don't get to sit down yet.
All right.
Do we have a book here?
I need a book.
All right.
Is it good?
What I want you to do, first, I'm going to see if you're nice and strong.
Yes, you're strong.
So what I want you to do is just open the book anywhere you want, hold the book with this hand and I'm going to energy test with that hand.
And what I want you to do is read out loud.
- [Woman 4] Silence is the bountiful source of our sensing our self… - That's one finger everybody.
All your might, keep reading.
- …and all creation with newfound clarity and intimacy.
- So that simply...
That is a test.
I mean, anything she would try to do in a linear way, she would lose her energy because her energy is not aligned up with reading for instance.
But we're going to show something fun with you before we fix you.
Okay?
All right, David.
- Yeah.
So what we're demonstrating here is when your energies get scrambled, when they start crossing over in ways that are different from how you're designed, it makes it harder to function at your best.
So we've kind of assumed that that's what's going on with you and we'll show you how to fix it in a little while, but we're going take a detour and the detour is to show how one person's energies impact another person.
And so we're going to need four volunteers from the audience to come up and will...
And come on up.
Okay.
So what I'm going to do is get a baseline.
I'm going to energy test each of you.
And we'll be learning how to do energy testing later in the program.
But for right now, the only two things you need to know are when you're doing energy test, you make sure that the person's arm has not been injured or compromised in any way so you don't hurt it further and so you get an accurate test.
And the second thing is that I'm going to ask you in a moment to put your arm out and to push up as I push down.
So we're going to do that with each of you.
So give me good arm.
And nice and strong, very strong, very strong.
Good.
So everybody's starting out really strong.
Now, tell us your name.
- [Sophie] Sophie.
- Sophie is going to read to you and we're just going to see what happens.
- Sophie, you're just going to face them.
Open the page, anywhere you want and start reading.
Just keep reading out loud so that they can hear.
- One of the ways we enter the delusion of silence is to do it in all ourselves, to put all the effort of our will into trying to make the experience happen or to think that practising… - You wiped them out, Sophie.
- I did.
- Yes, you did.
And that's exactly what happens to all of us.
When our energies have gotten scrambled and we're trying to reach somebody or say something or listen or be present, or whatever it is, you will not be able to convince any of them of anything, right?
- Apparently.
- But that's really important to get that it's also just an energetic.
Like, our energy so affects everybody else's so that if you fix yourself, then you don't even have to fix them.
So we're going to fix you, okay?
And we're going to...
And David?
- Okay.
So the four of you will just kind of scoot over here and you just kind of wait and watch and… - And we do not want you guys to do this exercise, okay?
But all of you, it would be who of you all to do this exercise.
- And you out there at home, this is one of the first exercises that you can do.
It's a little complex but follow Donna.
- So you're going to sit up straight on your chair, maybe on the edge.
It's a little bit easier.
Take the right foot and put over the left knee.
Take the left hand and put it around your ankle.
Take your right hand and put it around the bottom of your feet.
Now, you're going to face forward, you're going to take a deep breath and… - And I'm going to interrupt because sometimes a person cannot get into this position and it happens occasionally that… and so it's nice you have an alternative way to do it.
And Titanya, one of Donna's daughters who is right here on the set with us, and who you will see later is going to do the alternative way of doing it.
So you come here, and so if you can get in this position, follow Donna.
If you can't get into that position, follow Titanya.
- Okay.
So again, cross your hands right here at the ankle, right at your wrists and put one hand around the bottom of your feet, the other around your ankle.
Now, you're going to breath in through your nose and out through your mouth.
And kind of lift your body when you go, go...
And then collapse.
Now, put your leg down, and put your left over your right and your right hand around your ankle.
Left hand around the bottom of your feet and do the same breathing, go...
Now, put your legs down, and now put your fingers together in a kind of cathedral position and put your thumbs to your third eye.
Now, take a deep breath in through your nose, and out through your mouth.
Now, if you let your breath out, bend your fingers into your forehead, push in hard and pull across all the way to the temples and let them go.
Okay, all right.
Now, Sophie, right?
- Yes.
- Sophie.
First, we're going to check you out and see if you can read and not lose your energy.
- Silence is palpable.
It is a kind of subtle substance… - Yes.
You are very strong.
So now the real test, however, is these folks coming back.
We're going to see what your energy does to them now.
And they didn't do the exercise.
So we're going to see if your energy is strong enough to actually make them strong because they were weak.
- You'll read the book.
- Oh, excuse me.
- Okay.
So it will be the same test as before.
And Sophie reads too.
- We think we can find silence by being quiet for a while, going inward, getting back in touch with ourselves, disengaging for a time from all of the pressures and tensions of life.
This limited view… - Okay.
You healed them.
That's a really important thing to grasp, that when you are healed, you heal the people around you because you give out good energy and it doesn't confuse them.
I'm sure everybody has been with, I don't know, in some situation or another where maybe your friend or anybody and you found yourself losing your energy.
That has a lot to do with it because that other person's energy might be scrambled.
So it's really a good one to do whenever you feel like you're not connecting with somebody, or maybe you've got to give a presentation, or maybe you've got to teach a class, whatever.
Do that exercise.
Thank you, Sophie.
- Thank you.
- Okay.
And you, yay, you're all healed.
Okay.
- The name of this exercise is the Wayne Cook posture.
It's named after a man named Wayne Cook whose specialty was to work with stutterers.
And what he found was that this exercise by unscrambling the energies in the brain then allowed him to move forward to use other exercises that would be much more effective and it turns out that that's true for all kinds of energy work.
If you do this, get your energies unscrambled, everything else works better.
We have a number of comments about what you just saw but one of them that I want to emphasize is the way that Titanya showed an alternative that every exercise, every technique that Donna has can be adapted for people that are physically challenged.
And that's very important because a lot of people come to this work for healing and there are so many different kinds of physical challenges that we can't, you know, talk about each one and what the alternatives are.
But if you can get the principle of the exercise, you can figure out a way to do it.
So I just wanted to emphasize that as a bottom line for everything else we do.
And you wanted to say something more.
- And I want… I'm so glad you said that because it is very true.
I have never found a single person, no matter what their condition or ailment, that couldn't find a way to do something.
You can shift it to make it work for you.
So yeah, that was a very good thing to say.
I want to say, that exercise is amazing.
I can't say enough for it.
I grew up very dyslexic.
Both my daughters were dyslexic.
And that is the exercise that really turned things around for me, but more than that, I couldn't make healing really work for me enough until I wasn't scrambled anymore because when you do healing on somebody, you want the energy to hit its mark.
You want the healing energy to really do what you want it to do.
And if a person is scrambled, or maybe their energies are running backwards, whatever it is, you want to straighten that out first because then, the energy will do what you want it to do.
For myself, that's the exercise that I needed to do to overcome multiple sclerosis.
And it was...
I mean, once I did that exercise and started doing that regularly to build a habit in my body so I didn't immediately scramble, everything's changed and I started getting well faster and faster and faster and faster.
- It wasn't like that exercise cured her multiple sclerosis but what it did was it opened a doorway so that then she could work with other energy systems in her body effectively.
It's a very, you know, a serious illness and it takes a lot of sophistication to figure out quite how to work with it but to...
But there are certain basics that you'll be learning in the early parts of this class that are essential.
And one of them is that if your energies are scrambled, then that acts like static that keeps all the rest of the exercises from working as well.
Okay.
Another thing about that demonstration is the way one person's energies affected another.
And that's so critical that we have these energy bodies which we'll talk about more later, that do impact other people.
And so when you're scrambled and you're running a staff meeting or you're giving a talk, or you're teaching a class, that's affecting your performance.
That's affecting the way that other people are going to respond to you.
So if you can get your energies so they're balanced, that is going to impact how you're received.
And we technically live in Ashland, Oregon.
We're on the roads so much that we hardly get home but when we live there regularly, Ashland's a theater town and directors kind of knew about Donna and when a play was heading towards dress rehearsal and the director felt like things are sort of off, they're just not clicking, they would often bring Donna in to spend just an hour with the cast and she would teach them that technique that you just learned and other techniques that were designed to get the cast energies all into harmony and alignment so that they were sending out to the audience an energy that was so positive that even if it was a bad script, no one would notice.
- You know, I want to say something, and I hadn't planned to say but I'm going to say it.
That was the exercise that allowed David and I to survive as a couple because his energy would throw me off in our early days.
I mean, throw me off a lot because he's a different type of energy than I am.
We all know how our mates are often very different than us.
And his energy was very different than mine and he tended to under-stress, actually, go up into his head, and be very clear and concise and be able to say everything clearly.
And I would finally fall apart and start crying, even his being able to stay up in his head would throw me.
I mean, it was...
Clearly, we weren't going to make it and one day, I did that exercise instead of leaving as I was actually thinking I was going to do, and that exercise just suddenly, I was clear.
I wasn't scrambled.
My brain was working.
And I went back to meet him and I had an argument and I beat.
That was the first time I ever won the argument.
And so that was the exercise because I got unscrambled.
So it's really a good one.
You'll find more and more things that that exercise will help you about.
- So Donna has been talking a lot about energy.
That's the name of the course.
What is energy?
That's what kind of stopped me in my early days of trying to understand her work because I understood kinetic energy and I understood electrical energy and I understood thermal energy.
But she was talking about something different.
She was talking about an energy that has intelligence, that has intelligence.
Now, energy just flows, it just moves.
It just...
You press the button there, the light goes on.
It's not like it has intelligence.
But she's talking about a much more subtle kind of energy that's actually been understood by traditional healing and spiritual traditions for thousands and thousands of years in recorded records.
But it's very strange for our culture because we don't know how to measure these energies.
We don't have instruments.
We can measure electrical energy and thermal energy but we don't know how to measure an intelligent energy in the body.
We don't know how to have instruments that can track that intelligence, that can show you how it's working.
But it's turning out that science, western science is coming out very close to the eastern understanding of energy and one of the ways to really recognize that it's been well known how...
We're really largely space.
That's what we're made of.
It's mostly space.
If you take a carbon molecule from the body and you expand it so that the nucleus is the size of a golf ball, the nearest electron is 22 miles away.
All the rest is space.
Now, the electron, that's recognized as energy.
But the nucleus, that's thought of the matter.
That's where the mass is.
But what's happening now is that the scientists are getting more and more sophisticated instruments where they can look at the nature of that, of the protons and neutrons that are in that nucleus and break them down when they go further and further down.
What's the smallest particle, what's the smallest particle?
They get to a point where there are no particles.
These basic particles are made up of energy.
That's all there is.
There are no particles.
There is no matter.
We experiences it as matter.
But another way to think of that is this is a very dense form of energy.
So everything is energy.
And that's what… what Energy Medicine is about is working with some of the energies that are not well known in western thought but that still make a difference because they govern what's happening in your body.
They govern what's happening at the physical plane.
So that's what… so I just wanted to establish that real early.
These energies are actually very complex in the same way that your body has so many different systems.
It's got the cardiovascular system, it's got the respiratory system, it's got the immune system.
Has all these different systems.
Well, there's a different energy governing each of those systems.
There's a different energy that corresponds with each of these systems.
So the energy body is very, very sophisticated kind of system that in western medicine, we don't really think of the energy dimension of all these systems yet if you understand the energy dimension, you can go right to the root of problems, right to the heart of problems because the energy is governing what's happening on the physical.
In this course, we're going to be looking at six different energy systems in depth.
And Donna worked with more than six.
But those of you that watch the free mini course have already been introduced to the five elements.
The five elements are actually one system of the body.
Others that we'll be covering are the meridians which we've already talked about, a system that governs the immune response which is called Triple Warmer, a system called the chakra system well-known in yoga that we'll be talking about.
A system called the radiant circuits and a system called the aura.
So we'll be covering all of those in these three courses.
But we don't want to overwhelm you with too much information because it is a complex map.
And so part of what Donna has done is figured out ways to make these user-friendly.
And one of the ways when we were writing her book, ‘Energy Medicine’, and I would be kind of her consultant in that book, was, I said, "Look, everybody is so busy.
They don't have time to take this on, to make this a major part of their lives.
How can we really...
Is there something, Donna, that we can do in five minutes, that a person can do in five minutes that will really get all other energy systems into a flow, get all other energy systems optimized?" They do it every day because energies run in harlots.
And so if you do something every day, then it really would begin to establish positive energy habits.
At the point where she was writing her book, she'd seen at least 10,000 clients, 90-minute-sessions.
She'd worked with them very deep and she always gave them homework.
And so as the homework exercises, which ones really seemed to work for everyone?
Okay.
So we made a long list.
Now, of those, which are the most powerful?
So we shortlisted those.
Now, of those, can you choose a few of them that people could do in a short little period of time every day, that will get all the energy systems into a flow so they'd really have a positive effect on one another?
And that is what she has called the ‘Daily Energy Routine’.
And that's what she's about to teach you.
And every one of our sessions is going to start with leading you through the daily energy routine and we're going to encourage you to do it every day in between the classes.
But for today, it's going to be not only leading you through it, but she's also going to bring up people from the audience so she can really show you how each of them works.
Okay?
- Okay.
Thank you.
I want to say also that these techniques in the Daily Energy Routine, the more you do them, they build up habits in your body.
And I think it's critical to build up new habits because we live in a world we did not evolve to be in.
We didn't evolve to be in unnatural world.
So every square inch of our atmosphere is filled with man-made electromagnetic energies that your body has to contend with.
And so those energies often throw your energies off.
Or it might be the additives in your food or it might be whatever toxins are in the air.
Those things throw your energies off.
Well, if you can build some new habits with this Daily Energy Routine, your body can counter the energies that are coming in and they learn how to not be affected.
Your body learns not to be so vulnerable to things and can overcome.
So this is really wonderful stuff to learn.
Okay.
So, the first thing I want to do is to have somebody come up.
Come up.
Yeah.
Just any… well, I'm going to take us through all of the different exercises.
But I'm going to have to pick you because I got to pick who needs this.
You.
Now, tell me your name.
- [Yoli] Yoli.
- Yoli.
What a great name, Yoli.
Okay, David, I'd like you to come here and make an X for her to be able to see.
- Look at the X.
- Now, don't look at anything else.
Just keep looking at his X and hold.
Do you notice that you're nice and weak, Yoli?
- Yes, I am.
Okay.
Now, David, make two vertical lines.
Got it?
And you're very strong on two vertical lines.
That's exactly opposite of how it's supposed to be.
The vertical lines should make you weak.
And a crossover should make you strong and the reason why is, when you look, there's energy that crosses right here at your third eye.
And when you align your energies up, they're looking from there to an X.
If you're aligned, you will be strong.
If you aren't, you lose your energy.
Okay.
So we've got to fix that.
Okay.
Now, we're going to show you a simple way.
And come back, David.
I'm going to do it on you but then you're going to do it on the front of you.
Okay?
If everybody would like to, no, I guess not.
Okay.
All right.
So if you have somebody who loves you, who would do this for you, it would be really nice.
If they put their right hand on the shoulder and push in above the shoulder, and then drag across to the opposite hip.
Okay?
Three or four times.
I'm going to come to this side, left over to the other side.
Just get the energy crossing over.
But say you don't have anybody to do this for you, you can do it for yourself.
You take your right hand and put it on your left shoulder, push in hard and drag across the shoulder to the opposite hip.
- Pushing in at the back of the shoulder.
- Okay.
And now on the other side, and then drag it across.
You know, there is a benefit, another benefit other than just crossing the energies over, you will find if you carry a lot of tension in your shoulders, you will find that tension starts to go away and you won't have that tension all there.
That's a good one to do every day.
But now, you're going to face me and David, put the X out there again.
All right.
Healed.
- Thank you.
- Thank you.
Okay.
Now, I want to say just how important that one is to do before any other exercises because it's not going to work if your energy isn't crossed over.
You have less than 50% capacity to heal yourself if your energies are not crossed over.
So that's just to get the ball rolling.
Okay?
So, now, I'm going to show you another technique in the Daily Energy Routine.
And I'm going to put four of them together, which is the four thumbs.
And I think we're going to take Tony who is back here in the back of the room.
And I'm going to demonstrate on him.
Hi, Tony.
- [Tony] Hi.
How are you?
- Oh, good.
Now, you saw one of them.
So the one of thumbing on your cheekbones.
I'll just...
I won't repeat the demonstration for the ones you've seen already but you're going to do it more like right there with a bit of… okay, and breath.
Go.
Then, you're going to… oh gosh, it brings color to your cheeks too.
You're going to drop down.
I'm going to turn you.
Doesn't he look a little better?
Okay.
Now, these K27 points, you can also tap these with your four thumbs.
You're getting everything, you're getting grounded.
You're making sure your energies are going in the right direction.
And now the next one I'm going to demonstrate on you because we haven't had it.
I think it's very interesting that Tony has this right here because...
I'm going to move it out of the way and I want you to put your fingers right there and you hold your arm real strong and don't let me push down.
Okay?
Well, you've got some strength.
Here, I'm going to move it down a little bit.
Okay?
Now.
What that is about that you've got a thymus gland here.
Now, you noticed when he was up a little bit higher, he held his strength.
But when he comes down over where his thymus gland is, he loses it.
And that's because the thymus gland… and this is where his jewelry has been sitting which I think has been giving you energy.
You hold it right there.
Let's see.
Yeah.
That's really good for you.
But say you don't have this necklace.
There is something you can do.
And throughout history, throughout forever, certainly gorillas and Tarzan, you know, they thumb their thymus, right?
You don't have to do it with your full fist like this but you can tap.
You can thumb your thymus.
Yeah.
Just a little bit lower.
Right.
Yeah.
People are a little bit different.
Some people are a little bit here, some are a little bit here.
But find that place that turns on your immune system.
It's really important to keep you well.
Okay?
This is the thymus thumb.
And I noticed...
You breathe in through your nose and out through your mouth.
Okay.
Now, even without your necklace, laying your hands there, hold your…you don't even have to… just hold it.
Okay.
Down a little bit where you were thumbing.
Okay.
So, that, again, it turns on, not just your immune system but it's very good for your whole energy system.
It gives you vitality.
The last one, let's see.
I'm going to energy test you like this.
And again, we're going to share how to do all these energy testing later on.
Hold your arm real strong, okay?
And don't...
Oh, yeah.
No fist, though.
Because this is an energy test, it's not a muscle test.
We want to see if the energy is traveling or not.
Hold your arm real strong.
Pull it to your body, I mean.
That's very, very good.
Now, take this hand and just put it right here underneath your chest.
Hold it real strong.
So he needs some help on that.. on this place, this is called the spleen tap, and it's neurolymphatic reflexes to your spleen system and which also governs your pancreas.
So it's really good for blood sugar.
But if you come here, take both hands, make a three finger notch and just tap right there, on both sides.
And that helps you metabolize anything that might not be good for you.
Whether it's outside your body and you're breathing in, or you have eaten, anything.
It's somebody else's negativity.
It's really good.
And you can tell it, by the way, when you really need it.
You can tell these things.
It's like right now, I'm getting some chill bumps on my arms which I'll tell you something.
Spleen is very, very vulnerable to heat.
And I'm standing here in the heat.
And that literally has started giving me chill bumps.
I'm going to keep going because I know when I need this.
I'll tell you a quick story.
Many years ago, I was going out on a stage in London and there were well over 400 people in the audience.
I didn't know anybody, and I was going out to teach.
And the whole city of London had had the flu.
And I was feeling so good that I didn't get it.
And as I started walking out, I knew I had the flu.
Oh no, I've got two days I'm supposed to teach.
And as I went out, I started tapping, just fast and furiously and everybody was having no idea of what I was doing.
I just...
I could hardly talk.
I felt like very, very nauseated.
And I just kept tapping and I kept tapping until I felt, "Wow, I'm back again, and I feel good again." These are great points.
Now, put your hand there again and let's see if you hold it.
Now, turn it this way, hold it strong, yes.
All right.
Thank you, Tony.
- Okay, thank you.
- Now remember them.
Okay?
- All right.
- Show him how fast it can be done.
- Okay.
Come back here.
So this is… it takes more time when you're demonstrating and talking about why these are good.
But this is all… it doesn't take any time at all.
We're going to do them together.
Tap on your cheekbones, at least one or two deep breaths.
That's enough, come to K27.
Yeah.
At least one deep breath.
And then come to your thymus.
And then to your spleen points and now you're perfect.
Thank you.
- Okay.
Thank you so much.
- Okay.
And now, the cross crawl, okay?
Now, let's see.
I would like somebody who would like to be tested on this who's not been up here yet.
Have you been up here?
Yeah.
Come on over here.
Now, I'm watching you walk and you walk exactly right.
When you walk, you're meant to do a crossover pattern.
But sometimes, when you're dealing with a lot of things...
Hold your arm real strong.
You walked correctly but you're still nice and weak.
So what I want you to do is just hit the opposite knee when you're...
Just to get it going and making sure you're crossing over and breathing.
Perfect.
Okay, that's enough.
Now, hold.
Okay, that's really good.
Now, because you're a woman, I want to show you something.
I want to show you how easily this one can get thrown.
Okay?
Does anybody have a shoulder bag that they brought with them?
Anybody got a shoulder bag?
Oh, good.
We're going to get a shoulder bag, and what you're going to do...
Now, let's see.
You're starting really strong, right?
Now, put the shoulder bag on and just walk around and come back to me.
Yeah.
Doesn't matter however you would.
Okay.
Okay, I guess, walk around and come back to me.
Now, get out of here.
We'll do a dance, okay.
Now, take this shoulder bag off, and you'll see a shoulder bag takes your energies away.
And that's why it's so valuable to do a cross crawl.
I mean, now you're not going to be ready for whatever you're supposed to be doing next.
And as women, we so often wear a shoulder bag.
So when you get to your destination if you've got a shoulder bag on, do a cross crawl and breath.
All right.
And if you are all day long carrying things like that, you probably have gone homolateral, which is that state of being where your energies are not crossing over.
Okay.
That first exercise we did.
So you want to really cross over.
You can reach up here and also… okay, let's see if you've got it down.
All right.
Healed.
Thank you.
Okay.
Now, we did the Wayne Cook posture before.
It's the one where you sit down and you cross everything over on the right leg over on the left and the left over the right and then you put your hands up here.
We're going to do the short method.
You might remember that you have seen children do this.
And that is, if you put your left hand out in front of you, and turn it backwards, and your right hand over that, clasp your fingers and pull them up like this.
I mean, I've seen kids even sleep this way.
And it's an unconscious sort of need to get balanced again.
And so if you just hold like this and breathe in through your nose and out through your mouth.
One more time.
And then bring your hands down to your third eye and do the same breathing.
Now, bend your fingers into your forehead.
Push in hard and pull them across to your temples and let them go.
Now the next one, you're going to just move right into it into the crown pull.
So can I have a volunteer?
Who's going to come up?
Yeah, sure.
Come up.
You're actually perfect.
- [Susan] My name is Susan.
- Susan.
Hi, Susan.
Thank you.
Okay, hold your arm real strong.
All right.
Susan's strong.
So I'm just going to go over the top of her head and see what she's got going in her nagging.
And all this means is, by the way, is...
I mean, it can mean several things.
It could mean that you've gone through a lot in your head, and your head gets crammed.
It gets crammed.
I mean, you're meant to breathe on the suture lines on your head and oxygen is meant to flow through and when that...
I mean, you just cram on your head.
The other thing is if you've got a lot of...
I don't know, your head's gotten overstuffed, you will show that you're weak there too.
So from this place where we were before, where we pushed in and pulled across to our temples, we're going to come to the hairline, and push in and pull out.
And now you don't have to pull out as far but you're going to go across the midline.
Just push in and pull out a bit.
But with some real pressure, pushing in and pulling out.
Pushing in and pulling out.
And keep it up.
And go all the way across the back of your head pushing in and pulling out.
Pushing in and pulling out.
And come all the way to your neck, and push to this...
Push in and pull to the sides until you're finally on your shoulders and then you take a deep breath in, push in on your shoulders, drag them across and land on your heart chakra.
Doesn't that help?
- It does.
- You know, I'll tell you another secret about that.
I'll test you in a minute, but that, if you have any small intestine problems, that's one of the best things you can do for small intestine.
It's like it just helps you digest the food that you've been taking in.
And so I'm going to see.
Yes.
Yay.
Thank you so much, Susan.
- Thank you.
- Okay.
All right.
Now, we have a system in the body called the neurolymphatic reflexes and some people will make it a part of their Daily Energy Routine to do all of the neurolymphatics.
Others want to just choose a few daily.
And I've actually heard people say that they like that better.
Just choose a different one daily.
And start that energy flowing.
But the reflex, the neurolymphatic reflex system governs the circulation of your lymph.
And it doesn't have a pump of its own.
Our hearts have a pump that pump the blood but the only thing that pumps the lymph is either exercise and hard exercise or massaging the points.
That's it.
So it's very easy to massage them.
So I'm going to… we can go through all of them on the front of the body on the front, but you don't need them all.
And then I'll come back to the ones that I tend to go to, okay?
So the first thing, if you take your... oh, I think I need to test somebody.
How about...
Anybody need to be tested here?
Would you like to be tested?
Come on over.
All right.
Hi, what's your name?
- [Angela] Angela.
- Oh, you're Angela.
Hi Angela.
Okay, yes.
For your camera.
No.
Hold your arms strong, Angela.
Hold...
Okay, we get it.
You're kind of strong.
You're kind of weak too.
So I'm going to come right here and you tell me if there's any tenderness there.
- Yeah.
- You can do this on yourself.
Go over there and massage these points.
It's right where you would sew the arm to the body if you were going to stitch.
Okay?
And usually, you don't hurt yourself as much as somebody else coming in with other energy.
Doing it to yourself is a little bit easier.
But why these are so great is because this influence all the others.
Every other neurolymphatic reflex in the body is influenced by this because this is on central meridian.
And central meridian is both a meridian, but it's also something called a radiant circuit that I will explain much more later on.
But that's really good.
I guess enough on this, on this side.
You can do it on this side.
Okay.
So these are really, really good ones to do.
And again, it makes this flow.
The lymph, when it flows, it carries toxins out of the body that you have taken in.
So, it could be stress, it could be different foods you've eaten, whatever.
Okay.
So, let me see if you're strong now.
That's something.
Now, I'm going to give you just a few more.
I want you to touch right there and see if you're strong.
And then you can drop right below it and how about over here on this side?
Hold, and now right here.
Now, where she's touching is right in between the ribs here, right in between the ribs.
And this governs both gall bladder meridian, which governs also the organ and the lungs.
So if you massage right in here, and it doesn't hurt as much.
- No.
I still feel that, though.
- Yeah.
I want to give you one more, okay?
Put your fingers right here on the front.
Hold your arm real strong.
Okay.
This is the...
What is this called?
Sternum.
It's the sternum.
And you want to massage the sternum and it gives you longevity.
So, a massage that you can… like say you're having to be in a race and you're losing your strength and your energy and your vitality, start massaging here and you'll get back.
I used to work with swimmers and racing.
And this is the one that would give them their breath longer so they could go much longer.
Okay.
So, let's see now.
Put your fingers here and test.
Yes.
And right over here where it was.
Yap.
Okay.
And now over here.
All right.
So, you'll see on your chart, you'll see a chart that has all your lymphatics on them.
Thank you.
- Thank you so much.
- Okay.
And I'm going to show you a few more lymphs.
Who else would like to come up?
All right.
Come on.
David, I'm going to want you on this one.
Okay.
Let's see, where do I want to check on you?
I'm going to… we're going to...
Okay.
I want you to put your fingers right there and let me see if you hold your arm.
- Now, what this test is is that you've seen Donna use the energy test before, but this is called the energy localizing.
So when you touch a point, what this is showing is whether the energy is flowing optimally through that point or not.
So, that's why she can get very specific information about the body.
- Now, you tell me, are you very… what's your name?
- [Jill] Jill.
- Jill.
Okay, Jill.
Tell me, Jill, are you very good at bending over and touching the floor and all that stuff?
- I'm okay.
- Let's see.
Let's see how far you can go.
That's pretty good.
So, everybody see where she's at.
Okay?
Now, she's going to do two things.
Again, the lymphatic reflexes affect different organs and different parts in the body.
So small intestine meridian is not just for the small intestines, it's the entire abdominal cavity here.
So if she's going to… you're first going to take your fingers and massage, bend them underneath and massage underneath the ribcage.
And notice if you have any tenderness there.
If you do, it's about your small intestine.
Okay.
Let me see.
Did you get them as good as me?
Almost.
- No, I didn't.
- Okay.
Now, the other place is right in between your legs here.
So, you're going to massage, just push in on the inside of your legs and notice if you're tender.
Anybody tender?
- Yes.
- Okay.
Now, bend over.
It starts making you more and more flexible because it's all these...
These things also govern the muscles and everything else.
So that's a really good one.
These points and on the inside of your legs will just help the energies that are in your whole abdominal area just drain.
Okay.
All right.
Thank you.
Let's do one more on large intestine.
Okay, come on up.
So what I'm going to do, I'm going to bring you over here.
Actually, I want you to hold on to my...
Yeah.
Now, put up your leg like that.
Don't let me push down.
Do you notice I can push your leg down?
Okay.
So, we're going to see if we can get some flowing going in your legs, and help...
This affects your large intestine.
This is your large intestine, neurolymphatic reflexes.
You may not like what's going to happen to you next.
Okay.
I'm going do it for you and then David will… is there any tenderness on them?
- Yes.
- Yes.
So, it's just right on the seam line of your pants to your knees.
Now, I'm going to do it again.
You hold on to me, so I can hold on to something.
Now, David is going to show you how you can do this to make it feel better.
And I'm going to get you on this side first.
So, you want to go in deep, but David, you share this.
- Okay.
So, that's one way to just really do it real hard.
Some people can't tolerate that.
And particularly people that are ill sometimes, it's just too much to get going.
So, there is something called the dental floss technique.
And in the dental floss technique, you actually just use your hands on both sides, like that.
And you just go back and forth, back and forth.
- And so you're just getting small intestine and large intestine.
- You're getting small intestine and large intestine.
And you just go all the way down.
So it doesn't hurt as much, but energetically, it's still getting the effect, okay?
Then on the other side.
- Does it feel better?
- Yeah.
Made me really hot.
- You know, she said it made her really hot.
In another session, we'll explain this much better about Triple Warmer.
But when you do something that releases some energy that really needs to be released, often you can get hot because the energy Triple Warmer holds on, holds on to the old stresses and things.
And when it releases you often get really hot.
I got hot on you just talking to them as well.
I'm wondering.
- Do you want to test her?
- Yes I do.
All right.
Put up your leg again and hold.
That's good.
Thank you.
All right.
- Okay.
There's another way to work these points that...
Particularly these small intestine points and I'll just show that to you because it's very effective.
You put your thumbs out like this and you put your hands like that, and then put your hands in that position so that you have the power, the strength of your legs to push in and you make little circles.
And that way, you can really get that.
And it doesn't hurt as much, does it?
It still might hurt but it doesn't hurt as much as when Donna does it.
Okay?
And that has the same effect.
So we've spent a lot of time on these neurolymphatic points and actually in most people's daily routine, it only is maybe 30 seconds or so, 45 seconds.
- For picking where you want to go.
- Yeah.
So why don't you review it real fast so that people know?
- Okay.
Reviewing real fast.
First, you can massage right here, where the arm comes to the body.
You just do it a few times.
You don't have to do them over and over and over.
And then you can go in between the ribcage here and massage on your...
In between the ribs and that governs lungs and gall bladder.
And then right down in the middle on your sternum is the lungs.
And if they hurt by the way, you need it.
Nobody needs to energy test you.
Let's see where...
How about...
Oh, here's one that I didn't give but if you take your thumbs and go right on your bra line, that's on the right side, you're really affecting liver.
On the left side, you're affecting stomach.
Drop one rib below that, right in line with your breast and that's spleen.
Now, again, if one hurts you, you know that's the one you need.
So this is a real good biofeedback tool to let you know what's happening in your body.
And then small… well, no, I'll go small intestine and blatter.
So I'll do it like David just did, crossing your wrist and just push your legs in and out and small intestine.
And right here.
This is also small intestine under your ribcage.
They really help with your flexibility and letting go a lot of toxins.
And the last one is large intestine down the sides.
Okay.
All right.
- So that's the whole set of them but in your daily routine, you might only do one or two.
And there's actually another reason to do fewer, particularly if you've been ill, is that these points release toxins so that your body can get rid of those toxins.
But it puts them into your lymph system and your blood stream.
So you don't want to do too much, you don't want to overwhelm your system.
So start out with just one or two, and then, what you find over time is they don't hurt as much.
Because you do it, "Oh, that hurt a few days ago, it doesn't hurt now." Then it's time...
Then you've really cleared it, and it's time to move on to the next one.
So you can do those real fully.
- But I really want to repeat what he just said.
Like right now, now I'm way too hot because having done them all, it's like, it almost overloads your system sometime.
It's much better to just do two or three a day.
And then the next day go to some more because it… and it's always good for you, it's going to be good for me.
But you might want to, I don't know, take a little break or something because your body then has to… it's interesting.
I just thought of something.
The one that was sourced on me was spleen and spleen deals with metabolizing.
So I was not, you know, things weren't metabolizing as quick as I wanted to but that gives me information that, "Oh, I really want to massage those points." All right.
How about a demo subject?
Have you been up?
Who hasn't been up?
You haven't been up.
- I was up but… - But with the four, right?
You were with the four, though.
That doesn't count.
Okay.
Now, I'm going to show you the last two on the Daily Energy Routine.
And so I'm going to test you right here.
You hold your arm out like that, fingers like that and don't let me push in, okay?
Okay, try it one more time.
How about on this side?
Hold, boing and boing.
Okay.
So, here's what I want you to do.
Now, this, when we're going to go into much more detail later about this.
But for now, I just want you to know that this meridian that runs up the front of your body is really important for so many reasons.
First of all, it affects everything.
It's these lymphatics right here on your arm or on that meridian, and this, it also is something called a radiant circuit which we'll talk about later.
But this protects you, this energy protects you.
If this energy is running strong in your body, you're just protected from stuff out there that could get you.
Okay?
- I need that.
- So here's what I want you to do, I just want you to just take a deep breath in and draw it up to your body to the bottom lip.
One more time.
This is a great time, by the way, to give an affirmation if you want to say, "I'm beautiful as I can be." Okay, now watch.
It's great.
Okay, yes, yes.
Now, the last one that goes with it, and I'm going to just smash your nose, okay?
Let me have your arm.
Hold your arm real strong.
Okay, this meridian that we just did, it hooks up with another energy meridian that goes up your back and over your head, over your nose to the back of your throat.
When they are hooked up, then you create a feel that goes round your body this way, and it's really important for vitality, for stability, for just being centered and great.
So did you notice?
You lost your energy on that.
Okay.
So you're going to put your finger on your belly button and your other here at the third eye, push both in and pull them up.
This is a great thing to do whenever you're feeling like you are coming apart.
It just hooks you up again.
So at least three breaths.
Okay.
And what that does, boing.
All right.
How are you?
- Thank you, thank you.
- You're welcome, you're welcome.
So, what are you going to remember to do?
- I'm going to remember to come up.
- Zip yourself up.
- Zip yourself up.
- Zip up.
Underneath the lip three or four times.
And I don't need to tap my nose.
- You don't need to tap it.
That's the test.
- Put down one finger on the belly button and one finger on the third eye.
And pull in and out.
- That's good, that's right.
It hooks the energy up at the back of your throat.
So now you have a microscopic… - Microcosmic.
- Microcosmic orbit that goes around your body and it's very protective.
- Thank you.
- And good for your love life.
Okay.
I'm going to show you just how fast you can do that daily routine.
Okay?
So you're just going to start.
You're just going to pull your energy over and cross over and then you're going to do four thumbs.
And now, you're going to cross crawl.
All right.
And now you're going to...
Or you can do the long version, either.
Either version, but...
One more time.
And then bring your thumb down to your third eye, and do the same breathing.
One more time.
Now, bend your fingers into your forehead, drag them across to your temples.
And now you're going to continue on with the crown pull.
You're going to come up here, and pull across, and you're going to push in and pull out just a bit and keep traveling across your head.
Now, I want to say...
Now, I better keep going and then I'll tell you afterwards.
And then come to here.
And next is, now, the neurolymphatic reflexes.
We're going to do just a few since we piled them on earlier.
I'm just going to do right here where your arm stitches to your body.
And let's skip all the way through and just do the lymphatics on the side of the leg.
Again, you can pick just a few each day.
Okay.
And now, now we're going to zip up and then we're going to hook up.
You know, I just cannot say enough for that hookup because it will bring you back to yourself.
If you're feeling off, I'm just going to be honest here, I mean, things will always happen to all of us.
And I'm not great under heat and we're under heat lumps here.
And so I got thrown off a couple of times when I would do them.
And when I did the scrambling, unscrambler, it actually scrambled me further and I thought, "Oh I need to do that a little bit longer.
I need to sit down and do the regular one." But when I got to here, I'm okay again and it doesn't matter that I'm under heat lamps.
Well I guess, not heat lamps.
But that's really important to grasp that whatever you're going through, you can do something for yourself to get your energies back and restore yourself.
Okay?
Thank you.
- Okay.
To review, what have we learned today?
We've really covered a lot of territory, haven't we?
- Yes.
- Okay.
We started out talking about what energy is and looking at how you can affect a person's energy with just moving your hands and… - Yes, and tracing the meridian forward and backwards.
You can… everybody can do that.
Everybody can do that.
- And then we saw how just walking forward or walking backwards really shifts the energy if a person is off.
It will really throw them off.
And we saw how reading can actually convey to the listener what it is that is going on inside the reader's body.
So that was amazing.
- I mean, they may not know it.
The person who is getting read to does not always know what the other person is going through.
They only know that, "Oh, my God, I don't feel good.
I want to get out of here." You know, and so it's really...
I mean, we all affect one another.
- And then we learned all the parts of the Daily Energy Routine.
So that's a lot.
You might want to review the tape.
You might want to go through that a few times but we're going to practice it each week.
We're going to start each session with it.
So you'll get a lot more of that.
But if you are able to really start to use it, I think you'll get more out of the course over the long run.
And in the next class, you're going to review the Daily Energy Routine and then we're going to learn about clearing energies, balancing energies, and grounding yourself, grounding energies.
Now, we've covered a lot of material today and I'm sure that you have many questions about different pieces of it and so, I want to start by asking the people in the audience, in the live audience, to share a few questions with us so we can get you started to think about, "Well, what do I need to understand better?"
====================

LESSON 2 – Questions & Answers for Chapter 1
--------------------
- [David] Okay, so who has questions? - [Interviewer] Okay. So I understand that these are different techniques that you can do to yourself daily. If I were to go for a massage in the morning, would that remove the need for me to do that? Is that already hitting those points, or are these more selective points? - It really depends on your massage therapist. And some therapists really are trained to work within neurolymphatic points. That's part of their training, that's part of what they do, and it's great because they get that energy moving, they get the toxins sort of moved out, and then they use the massage to help those toxins move out. So, that's great. But what you just learned, however, is a very brief way to get that done that you can apply yourself. And you probably don't have a massage every morning, but this you can do every morning or every afternoon. And so it's a really handy way to be able to keep those energies clear. - [Donna] As a matter of fact, this is what I do love from a massage technician. I'm going to bring this chair over. This is my favorite part. So, I really want a massage technician who does some depth because these points on the back are the neurolymphatic reflexes next to your spine. So, if somebody really comes along and massages those points... - Okay, so we're going to do not on the spine, but on either side of the spine, and I'm going to be pushing in with my weight. Because unless the back has been injured, this can take a great deal of pressure. And I'm pushing in, and I'm making little circles with my thumb. So, I'm putting my weight into it and making little circles. All you need to do is about 10 or 15 seconds on each set of points and go down half an inch and... - And you're probably only going six or seven seconds, David. And it works. - And then you... And there is a meridian associated with every one of these points. So you're giving a person a complete meridian balancing by doing this. As Donna pointed out, it's not 10 or 15 seconds. - I love this. These are some of my favorite lymphatics on the body. And so you can train your massage technician to do that for you. - You get all the way down to the sacrum, and then you just smooth it out. So you kind of get the energy that was freed, the toxins that were freed just moving through the lymph system so they can be eliminated. - But it's great. It's real restorative, so that's...yes. - [Male] I wanted to ask about that last technique, when you were working down either side of the spine. Does it have a name? - Yes. It's the spinal flush, spinal flush. - Spinal flush? - Yes. - Thank you. - Okay. - Well, Donna and David, I have another question. If I'm just starting out with a daily energy routine, which you just demonstrated, would I kind of stick to the order you've given, or can I change it depending on how I feel? - That's a really good question. The truth is, you will find that your body wants things in a certain order. That's just what happens to all of us. This is the order that works for most people, but people are different, and your energy is as unique as a thumbprint. And so you want to really honor what your body wants. I find that usually though, this is the order. And just always start with the crossover. - Yeah, the most important part is the crossover and having the Wayne Cook Posture relatively early in it, because those two really do pave the way for all of the other systems to work. After those, the order really doesn't matter that much. - Thank you, thank you. - [Woman 2] I wondered, is this contraindicated for anybody? And then I guess along with that question, if a woman is pregnant or children. - Good questions. Is it contraindicated for anybody? What I have found having had a practice for 23 years before I ever went on the road, there wasn't anybody I couldn't work with. But sometimes lymphatics are too painful for some people, and maybe they have too many toxins in their body, and so they might feel nauseated by the time you're through. So I always, you know, it was... What's the word? I'd try to match it to what the person needs and what I found with pregnancy, no. A pregnant body and the baby inside love it. - [Woman 3] So, I was wondering if there was a way for us to do energy testing on ourselves, if we don't have a partner? - There is a way to energy test for substances without a partner, and we'll be showing you how to do that right after we show you how to energy test with a partner, which is a little more... a little easier to learn, a little more reliable. - So, we're going to show it to you in one of the next classes so that... takes a little longer. - I just thought of another question. I know you said this is a daily energy practice, and probably the morning is the best time. But if you're really rushed in the morning, would it keep you awake if you did it at night, and cause insomnia, or...? - You're real good with questions. I mean, people find it works at different times for different people. Some people, boy, this is it. They're going to do it in the morning to get them going because they're just having a hard time even waking up, and it really helps. Some people though, at 3:00 in the afternoon, when your energy is starting to drag a bit, to do that then it, wow, you've got your energy back again. Some... - This leads us into something that we're going to talk about later, which is that... and we'll talk about it now, which is that we're all very busy, you know. So, one of the questions that we've really had to think about is, how do you get people to use it? You know, because like people come to one of our workshops, and they're all fired up, and all excited. And one of the truths about Donna's system is that, it's unfortunate, but it doesn't work if you don't use it. So how do you get people to use it? So, that's part of why it's so nice to have it packaged in a very short routine that takes only 5, 6, 7, 8 minutes. And then, if you tie it in with something you already do, a routine you already use, then you're much more likely to use it. So if you exercise regularly, or do yoga, or Pilates, or meditate, it's a great warm up or cool down. So you can tie it right in to those. Or, people that... some people are really slow in the morning, and they just... it's just not easy to get going. You can do it in bed. You can do... every week, you can even do the cross crawl in bed. You can do every part of it in bed so that it really gets you going for your day. For other people, we'll use it at the other end of the day. They'll use it right when they get home from work, as a kind of a ritual of transition, okay? The company store has owned me all day, and now I am going home, and the evening is mine, and I'm going to start this way. And some families do it together before they all go off to their computers, you know. It's... - And you can do it in the shower in the morning. - You can, you can. Another thing is some people take baths and showers, you know. So it's not a matter of no pain, no gain. It's a situation where the more relaxed you are, the more effective it's going to be for you. So you are going to find the place where it fits into your life and what we're going to encourage you that are taking the course to do is to experiment with doing it every day, every day between now and the next class. Now, you may not be able to. You can still come back for the next class. We're not the energy police, but we encourage you to do it, to really find out, what does it feel like to go from having a day without attending to your energies in this way versus having a day where you really do attend to them? So it was a good question. Yeah. - [Woman 4] I really love the example when you were zipping up, when you said to create an intention at the same time. And I'm just wondering, would you recommend that maybe you weave intentions and positive thoughts into doing the rest of the work? - You know, that is another good question. I think it always helps, always helps to use your mind and your intention or an affirmation on zipping up. It always helps, for sure. And with this particular one, I mean it really makes that affirmation go in deep. Because you have your chakras here, and it spirals them in. People tell me, I've heard this so many times, that their affirmations that didn't seem to really work for them, really began to work. - Yeah, and it really brings up a very big question, which is does energy follow the mind, or does the mind follow energy? And it actually moves in both directions. But what people kind of over-estimate is how much power the mind has over the energies. So we do all of these things from mind power and the truth is, that if the energies are off, that influences the mind. That makes it really hard. You can't think yourself out of depression, okay? You can do energy techniques that address depression so that then the mood changes, the way of thinking changes. So, we certainly go in both directions. We certainly say use that intention with your zip up, but we also say if the mind isn't quite getting you where you want to go, shift the energies first, then the mind will be much more free to be the effective tool that it is. - In fact, I want to say back when I had my practice, it was a time when Energy Medicine wasn't very popular or known. And so, I'd have somebody come, who just didn't believe it, at all. So their mind was actually going in the other direction. - Was that me? - But once you get the energy moving, it plugs into the mind. And you really become a believer. So I used to love it when I'd have somebody who didn't believe anything was going to happen for them. - [Woman 5] Oh, I am so excited to hear, especially the unscrambling, this would be so awesome to take, as a teacher, into the classroom, and working with the children, with the parents helping with the homework, to do this exercise together. Awesome. - Absolutely. Absolutely. Yeah. I mean, kids get very scrambled or homolateral, which means their energies are not crossing over, so often in the school systems. Just think of all the energies coming at a kid in school. And a big adult teaching them that they aren't real familiar with. I mean, all those things throw a kid off. And if they have any dyslexia at all, boy, Wayne Cook is so important. Thank you. - [Woman 6] If I were to do this everyday and see noticeable improvements over time, would I also be affecting the energy of the people around me or living with me? - Yes! Yes! Yes! - And the same way that you saw with the reading exercise, where the person reading was having an impact on the energies of the people that were listening, it works exactly like that. You get a positive energy field going and it impacts everybody that's around you. - [Woman 7] All right. Donna, why do you breathe in through the nose and out through the mouth? - Oh, good question! Gosh, you guys have great questions. Why you breathe in through the nose and out through the mouth, I first want to say that there are many different ways to breathe. And I know sometimes yoga teachers will ask me that question, and the reason why is because when you breathe in through your nose, you put your tongue up at the top of your mouth... - Spontaneously, it just happens. - And when that happens, you're drawing up central and governing up your... and when you let go, and you put your tongue on the bottom, it makes them start hooking up there in the back, and that's what you want. You want that hook up. - So it's not the only way to breathe in a positive disciplined manner, but it's one that is just so easy to get in the habit of while you're doing the Energy Medicine exercises, and it really supports those exercises. - And if you want to build the habit of the micro-cosmic orbit going around your body, I mean, you do have more vitality with it, and you're clearer and centered in your rhythm again. Okay? - One more question. You know, you zip up the front, why not the back too? - Oh, well you certainly can zip up the back. Governing, for most people they can't reach all the way up, but you can zip it up, and then reach over, and with your mind, hold it until you can reach over and come that way. You sure can. Thank you very much. - [Woman 8] I have a question. You talked about different organs, like large intestine, small intestine, but then you touched places where those organs weren't located. - That's right. - You touched the outside of the leg, but you said large intestine. So, can you explain that? - Yes. Yes. The organ may be very far away from the neurolymphatic reflexes, but it is... let's see. I'm going to answer a question in a way that might surprise you. If you ever could see a baby inside the stomach, and how they're twisted and turned, the organs are very hooked up to the lymphatics. The baby, all the meridians are exactly where the organs are, and they're all twisted up, and so are the lymphatics. And then you stretch out and get bigger and everything, but you are still connected in to those places that you originally had. And so, to massage down here, there is a reflex that makes the energy from your intestines begin to move. And so, it's the same way with all of them. - One thing that really confuses people when they first learn this work is, we talk about spleening, when we're talking about spleen meridian. The spleen meridian goes not only through the spleen, but it also goes through other organs, such as, it goes through the pancreas, but we just name it spleen. So, the meridian and the organ are very different. Interestingly, there are some analogies between them. The spleen meridian has some similar functions to the spleen organ, having to do with metabolism. But don't confuse the two. They're really different. One is an energy pathway, one is an organ. - But the pathway governs the organ.

LESSON 2 – Energy Medicine Live Experience Bonus Call #1: Health and Vitality

Hello everyone and welcome to Energy Medicine live experience call number one. This is the place where you connect with your authors and faculty of your favorite quests. You get to share with your tribe and you get the answers to your most important questions. Tonight is... number one for energy medicine. And this is on health and vitality. We're going to be answering your questions live. So we will be bringing you on live. So make sure if you ask a question that you got your camera turned on and you're in a quiet place to ask your questions and we'll be calling you on. So we are ready to begin. I would love to introduce Julie Lappin and Sarah Owen. So Julie Lappin has been with the energy medicine team for 21 years, she had a personal health transformation in her forties that transformed her life. And she became an energy medicine practitioner because of it. Now, Sarah, I hear Sarah has been training and. living in the same city as Donna, even before she created her courses or her book. So she's actually been studying and working with Donna for over 40 years. So you guys are in for a total treat with these dedicated and experienced energy medicine faculty tonight. Julie, Sarah, welcome to the call. Hello. Hey. So excited to be here. Yeah. Wonderful. Thank you all for taking this class. It's exciting. So Julie and I picked a couple of topics that are near and dear to our hearts and I think will be really relevant and helpful to you as well. I'm going to go first and I'm going to talk about grounding. Yeah. I'd love to see, you can raise your Zoom hand if you know how to do that. It's a little hand down on the bottom of your screen on the right. How many of you feel like you had and maybe continue to have real difficulty with grounding? I don't have difficulty so much anymore, but I sure did to begin with. So what is grounding? Let's get that clear first. So what are we made of? We're made of earth, aren't we? You know, our very cells are made of calcium and magnesium and dirt, right? All the elements, and probably as a little kid, we ate dirt. Anyway, all the elements of the earth and a lot of water. And where do we get our energy from? We get a lot of energy from the food we eat, which is produced by the earth. We also get energy directly from the earth itself, particularly women. Women take in energy primarily through their feet. And it comes up through the legs to the upper body and out into the heavens. If you notice, all the yin meridians run from the feet up the body. Men primarily take in energy from the heavens. And yang energy, yang meridians, runs down the body into the earth. And both men and women do both all the time. And the more efficiently we do that, the more vitality and energy and resilience we have. So I'm going to teach you a little grounding exercise I created for myself because I needed it. And I couldn't always spoon my feet or open my gates, but I could do this. So I'd like you to start putting your feet on the floor. And one thing to notice is, do you not want to put your feet on the floor? I never did. I always wanted to sit Indian style or my feet up on the chair or something. Feet on the floor was like, no, not comfortable, not good. So that's a big clue if you're like that. But humor me for a minute and put your little tootsies on the floor, firmly on the floor. Just kind of settle into that. And notice, you know, there's a solidity under your feet. Maybe that is a little scary even. I know with trauma, people tend to pull their feet up. They don't like to be grounded. They kind of like to float. But the earth is always there. The earth is always supporting us. So feet on the floor. And I'd like you to imagine that deep in the earth is this spiraling vortex of energy, very slow moving, wonderful, deep, stable, nurturing, supportive energy. And this energy spirals counterclockwise. And it very slowly comes up from the core of the earth, through the rock, through the pebbles, through the ground, up through the foundation, maybe the cellar of our house. And it comes up to the soles of our feet. And take a nice slow inhale with me. And as you inhale, imagine or feel that spiral of energy coming up, spiraling through the soles of your feet, spiraling counterclockwise up your legs, up your thighs, entering the tailbone and your lower torso, spiraling up the belly. into the heart, nourishing you, nourishing all your organs, your chakras, your meridians, giving you strength and energy and support. And then spiraling up through the throat and your face and out the top of your head. And it's a constant stream. With each in -breath, you can spiral energy up in through your feet all the way through your body, energizing you, releasing it. And then as you exhale, you can imagine a clockwise spiral coming down through the top of your head, through your face, your neck, bringing in that. Outward moving, confident, young energy coming down your chest, through your belly, through your lower back, your thighs, your calves, out your feet down into the earth. And you've constantly got this spiral happening. You can use your breath, your imagination, just your felt sense. if that felt helpful to you and worked for you. So you can open your eyes, come back to the call. And if you have questions or comments about it, maybe we'll take those in the Q &A that we're going to do later on. But I want to turn this over to Julie with a little segue in that if you're not grounded, guess who takes over for that function for you? triple warmer. Our big survival hero is going to take on working extra hard to keep you grounded at the expense. of your possibly vitality your joy certainly that's not his priority so Julie take it away thank you and triple warmer is near and dear to my heart because I was a triple warmer baby when I first started working with this material really so much of everything that was going on with me was triple warmer based and that is actually true for a lot of people. Donna talked about triple warmer. Triple warmer is our army. It's our fight or flight. It's the part of the immune system that fights bacteria and viruses. It goes out to war, right? The problem, and that's a really good thing. And triple warmer, as Donna said, when she first started the triple warmer segment, Triple warmer's job is to keep us alive. And that is really honorable. The problem is that triple warmer lives in the back brain and it evolves really slow. So it has not evolved with all the incredible changes we have made in the way that we live. There's not one single inch of the earth's atmosphere that isn't filled with man -made. electromagnetic frequencies like cell phone towers and all the electronics that we have um we have changed everything about our food supply and our water and our air quality um we have created i think it's close to 100 000 new chemicals since world war ii now and triple warmer doesn't recognize any of that none of it and triple warmer still comparing what you're experiencing what i'm experiencing it's still comparing it to what happened with three us three or four generations ago it's like oh your great grandmother didn't have to deal with that let's bring out the guns right so what's happened is um over the years triple warmer is more and more just constantly in fight or flight it's constantly pumping out stress chemicals it is constantly pumping out adrenaline and that's where i got my energy from mostly by the time i um was working with donna's material i was an adrenaline baby and i didn't even i didn't even realize it because it was just my norm i didn't know any different so the problem When triple warmer is constantly overcharged, constantly working, constantly on the front lines and pulling up all of the body's resources to the front lines, the problem is that all the other systems struggle because of it. Because all the resources are involved in this fight. So, oops, digestion system. Oh, well, you know, it's just the cost of war. And maybe we'll get back to peace someday. But you know, if you have IBS, oh, well, it's just how that works. If you've got respiratory, if you've got asthma, you know, oh, well, I mean, I had asthma coming into energy medicine. And I was really, it was fascinating to me to find out that 80 % of the time, an asthma attack, interesting. word isn't it as an asthma attack is actually caused by triple warmer not by the lung meridian not by the meridian that actually feeds energy to the lung um i think that a lot of people that my experience being a teacher in this program um people work some with triple warmer and then they think oh i've got that handled trust me you don't have it handled i was I was working with him for, I think, a good two years. And in those two years, by the way, I flipped everything. I didn't have acid reflux anymore. I got rid of my asthma. I used to have allergy shots three times a week. I got to the point where if I felt an allergy, Symptom, just a symptom like a sniffly nose. Come on, I could just hold the back of my head or do one of the other triple warmer spleen balancing techniques and it would go away. Arthritis. I was diagnosed with arthritis when I was 34 and I basically stopped that. So triple warmer is behind so much of what happens in our bodies. And I know that that sounds over simplistic, but the truth is it's because it is so ramped up all the time. And I remember David talking in class one time saying, you know how when you, when you are just completely over. over committed and you have way too much to do in the day and you're just you hit a wall and you're just so tired and you don't know how you can get through everything and you don't know how you're going to finish it all and then you get a second wind and you rally and you get through it all and you finish your day and you're so proud of yourself he said what you've just done is stripped your adrenals of every ounce of chemical that they contain and i was I was in the audience. I actually broke into a cold sweat because I was thinking, oh my God, my entire adult working career has been like that, right? It's been me pushing myself all the time. But I was probably working with Triple Warmer for about two years pretty regularly. I mean, multiple times a day. And one day I was holding the sedating points for Triple Warmer and I felt this amazing, I mean, I had always felt better. after working after balancing triple warming the spleen but this moment was a moment I will always remember because I experienced a calm that I that was so deep I had never I couldn't remember in my adult life experiencing it like that and I thought oh my god this is what it's like to have a balanced triple warmer oh my god think of all the money I wasted on alcohol I was like this is so much better and it's free and no hangover the next morning So triple warmer is near and dear to my heart. I'm just going to, we don't have this in your handout, but this is a super easy way to do to help triple warmer. So while we're talking, while you're listening to questions and answers, just take your ring finger and wrap your hand around it. It doesn't matter which hand, and then just put it at your second chakra. Just rest your hands in your lap and your second chakra. If you're not. uh familiar is just it's below your navel and above your pubic bone and just hold that and notice and but however if there's something else that is a favorite exercise that you've already tried um from the triple warmer segment one of my favorites is is to do Take a three -finger notch and put it at the three -finger notch, by the way. That's thumb index and middle finger. And put it right where your thyroid is, right in that hollow in the neck. And then you can just rest your hand on either cheek, making sure that your fingers are up at your temple because there's a major triple warmer neurovascular there. It's just wonderful to work with triple warmer. Donna had MS. I don't know how many of you know that. She had MS. She nearly died of it. And her doctors told her when she was 27 or 28 to get her affairs in order and figure out who was going to take care of the kids because they didn't think she was going to make it to 30. And she often says that the gift that western medicine gave to her was that they gave up on her because they forced they they forced her it forced her to figure it out energetically but um it and there are a lot there end up being a lot of complications that happen in serious and life -threatening diseases so complications and additional things energetically. But underneath it all, it was all about the imbalance between triple warmer and spleen. And once she got that retrained, because that is our goal in energy medicine, it's retraining the energy habits in our system that are causing what we don't like in our physical reality. So it took her about 27 months to retrain triple warmer. And she always said, Every time I felt triple warmer going off, even if it was every five minutes, I would stop and do something and then tap spleen, you know, to get them balanced. And every time I would hear her say that, because she said it every single class, because everybody always asked her every single class. Every time I heard her say that, I'd think. I wonder what she means. I felt triple warmer going off. But you do. The more you work with it, the more you develop this language between you and your energy system, you do get those signals. For me, I get a hot flash now. I get a burst of heat. And that tells me that triple warmer is going, so yeah, that's how much she worked with triple warmer. She said one month. i thought oh maybe triple warmer is finally is finally retrained because somebody went by her with perfume or flowers or something and that she was so triple warmer reactive she was she was so ptsd ish it you know through triple warmer that smelling smells even good ones could send her to bed for three days in in the early days and so somebody went by with a really strong scent and she didn't react at all and she thought oh my gosh maybe triple warmer is finally becoming retrained and then she said in the next three months one by one all her ms symptoms left they just dropped away um and she's 70 what 76 now she looks and acts and like moves like she's in her 50s and She should look like she's 150 given her health history. So that's the power of energy medicine. Great. Thank you so much, Julie. I would love to open this up now to some questions. So we've got a Q &A box at the bottom of your screen. You can ask your questions there. You can also upvote questions. I'm going to be bringing on several of you live to ask your questions. And we just ask if you come on live, have your camera on and you're in a quiet place so that we can hear you. And also that you just keep your sharing concise and short and just ask one question. I know you have a lot of questions to ask the faculty, but we ask you that you just ask your most important questions. so that we can get to as many people as we can. So first up, I would love to bring on Sandra. Sandra, I'm promoting you to a panelist. You can turn on your microphone and your camera. Welcome to the call. Hi, Sandra. There we go. I think I'm unmuted, or am I? Yes, we can hear you. Okay. I never can tell because it's in my corner. It says mute. Okay, so... My big problem is that I'm kind of working this all on my own, as a lot of people are, and I'm really concerned about being able to tell whether I'm hitting the right points when I'm doing things like the thumps and things like that. You know, am I off that quarter inch that will make it ineffective? How can we tell? Go ahead. Okay. You know, a quarter inch, Sandra, is not going to matter. Not at all. A couple things. One, energy follows intent. So you're intending to suck the thymus and your thymus is getting it. Okay. Two, we have areas of energy. You know, we don't need to be that precise. We're not acupuncturist with a skinny little needle. We've got our little fat fingers and we have plenty of surface area to tap and hold. So, and we're all a little different. You know, my thymus is here, yours might be there. You know, so wherever it feels right to you in the general vicinity, you're good. Okay, cool. I can do that. We all can. I am going to add on to this. Donna has always said that in the beginning, she didn't even like to have diagrams. you know, and pictures of where these things were located. She calls her early handouts. They were like early ransom notes. You know, they had almost nothing in them. And when she taught classes in Ashland in the town where she lived, you can verify this. And by the way, I, I guessed at 40, it's probably longer than that, right? 40 years. So old. in terms of how long she's known Donna Donna used to just say to people she didn't have pictures of points you know she just used to say to them take your whole hand and put it there because she prefers that you learn to feel it you know or to sense it not everybody feels it we all have way different ways of you know intuiting um information but she just actually preferred for people to use their whole hand and then sense in whatever way you sense you get your information then go to where you feel or sense that it's actually happening for you go ahead sir yeah i just want to add on to that What a great question. I thought it was kind of a silly one. No, everybody worries about it. Everybody. A big question is, am I doing it right? I don't want to do it wrong. And you won't hurt yourself. There is no wrong. I learned directly from Donna with no handouts, nothing. And she taught by answering questions. So we went here. We went there. If you wanted to know where something was, I remember kidney moot point. It's on the back near the kidney. She would say, oh, it's over here. So I learned things just by feel. And the acupuncture points, the chakras all have far more electrical energy and electromagnetic energy. Like the acupuncture points have at least 60 times the electromagnetic energy of just a random area on the surface of the body that isn't a point. energy draws energy so it wants to draw your fingers there okay yeah so it's really cool and i heard something on npr yesterday that if you're blind in japan you have free admission to acupuncture school yeah isn't it that's so cool that's awesome because they and donna says and it was in your um yeah it's in in your course the best acupuncturist she ever went to was blind because they feel the energy so it's really about tuning into yourself okay thank you thank you that was such an important question yeah yeah thank you thank you so much sandra next up to the call is barbie hi barbie hi hi hello great um my question in regards to boundaries that um like when you tell people to stop and they won't stop that uh or even children that what can you do in regards to energy boundaries uh well our auric field is our first boundary with the environment so working on the auric field in every way you can and i think you haven't had much about that yet but you will and also you know with children in particular you can teach them and a really simple one is put your arms out so here is your boundary the end of your fingertips and you can do it you know with yarn on the floor is make a circle this is your boundary all the energy in here is you belongs to you all the energy outside you can do a different color yarn or you can do it with imagination with colored bubbles my colored circle belongs to me you need permission to enter thank you i'm also gonna I'm going to add that to me, first of all, there are a lot of different energy imbalances that can help to create that kind of situation. But the first thing is that daily energy routine, right? Because we learn to zip ourselves up. We learn to hook ourselves up. And those particular exercises, help to support our auric boundaries but the bigger picture about the whole daily routine is that as a composite it it starts to change how we relate to stress because it's it's correcting some of the really fundamental energies that we have that keep triple warmer dialed up so As we start changing our relationships to stress, we start thinking better. We start reacting better. We are less reactive to situations. So just calming the stress in our system through the daily routine really makes a difference. And generally speaking, when we start claiming our space more, that That automatically relays itself to the people around us energetically. We don't have to say a thing. A lot of times when we're losing our space and our boundaries, it has to do with our stress levels. It has to do with, and it has to do with conditioning too. But a lot of times you just get a really good running start by doing the daily routine and working with triple warmer and spleen. excellent thanks and when i work on my triple warmer can that help my kids i know sometimes it can help others but not always uh it will if you do energy work in the presence of others it will always help them already if they're in the same room by helping ourselves we help all all those around us yeah excellent thank you because i had a question about headaches that they've been on the temple but i think I heard earlier how it might be related to the triple warmer, because it's like a temple headache, so I think I already got the answer. Yeah, the first thing we do is work with the crown pole, you know, make sure that we just are creating space for all that. I think of the skull plates as being like tectonic plates. If there's too much pressure, they start going, and then the pressure builds up, and bad things happen. so like headaches but um so if the crown pole isn't doing it and if trip these triple warmer exercises are not doing it if it's one -sided it's probably gallbladder meridian but anyway yeah okay okay those are more questions than none yeah sorry thanks you're welcome thank you so much barbie thanks bye and next up is anna hi anna welcome to the call hi there thank you so much i also have a question about how to do it right and in my case it's like how much pressure do we use like for example when we do the you know the spleen and triple warmahawk is it enough to just rest on my body or do i okay Then a follow -up question to that would be like, if I do sedating certain meridian points, then it feels to me that it's often a bit more important to press in a bit harder. Or is it also okay to just put our hand, for example, over the triple warmer spot here and then the other one here? Yes. Pretty much the only points that we use pressure with are the neural lymphatics and the crown pole. The crown pull, you got to use pressure. But the neural lymphatics are the only thing that we use pressure with because those actually will backfire if you hold them too lightly. But all the other points, we just want you resting on that. We just want you bringing the blood back to the skin along with the energy with using the electromagnetic energy in your hands, not pressure. Wonderful. Thank you very much. Thank you so much, Anna. Next up is Makala. Hi, Makala. Welcome to the call. Hello. Thank you. I would like to ask whether there are any recommended exercises for Hashimoto thyroid, irritable bowel syndrome and not absorbing nutrients from the food and joints inflammation. So that along with many, many. other things is classic triple warmer spleen. Yeah. So your mission then is do the daily energy routine and do all the triple warmer spleen exercises. And as Julie talked about, start to notice, oh, I'm feeling a little hot. I'm feeling a little anxious. My energy just went, I'm having an IBS symptoms. And go to your triple warmer spleen exercises, like have them in your back pocket. Hold the back of your head. Hold this fourth finger on your low belly. Smooth behind the ears. Do the triple warmer spleen hug. Because triple warmer is taking energy from all those other systems in order to, in his mind, keep you alive. At the expense of many things. Yeah. so just keep sedating calming triple warmer telling him it's okay and you can use your mind you know there's nothing to be stressed about it's a beautiful day beautiful evening we're doing well here yeah thank you so the good news is it all all of those things are have have one answer that's the good news it makes it easy right yeah The challenge for you is to keep doing it throughout the day. Don't just wait for symptoms. You want to get ahead of it. You want to retrain it. And in this work, remember, persistence pays. Persistence pays. It's a lifestyle. It's not a one -shot deal. Thank you again. Great. Thank you, Mikala. Appreciate it. Next up is Linda. Hi, Linda. Welcome to the call. Unmute, Linda. Good point. Let's see. Linda, are you there? There she is. Hi, Linda. Hi, Linda. Hi. My question has to do with there's all these energies around us that are weakening us, and I know, and I'm probably... based on what you've said already i probably have already you already answered this question is just to work on triple warmer if these energies are weakening us around us or you know beds or glasses or whatever um and i was just wondering what exercises you can do to help alleviate that um everything that we are giving you right now is laying the foundation The daily routine is really important. And you can think of that as, okay, I'm going to do the daily routine just like I eat every day, right? Donna still does the daily routine every day. And then you want to work with triple warmer and spleen. But the ensuing lessons, including the aura, help you to get our systems. working the way we're designed. We are designed to be able to stand strongly in our environment without being buffeted by everything that is out there. So the problem really isn't everything that's out there. The problem is that we haven't been in line with our energetic bodies and realizing, oh, there's work to do in order to bring our energetic, in order to adapt. our energy bodies to be able to handle all these big quick changes that we've made so the problem isn't out what's out there the the the invitation from our energy systems is to heal and retrain what is happening in us so energetically so that we get to that point where we're like the strong um a strong tree swaying in the wind, but not breaking. Does that make sense? Yeah, I get it. It's just to re -teach ourselves as to how to be in this world with all this stuff happening around us. It's about adapting our bodies because we don't get to go back. We don't get to say, oh, we're going to stop the chemicals. We're going to take the cell phone towers down. It's not about that. It's way beyond that. So the incredibly empowering message about Eden, especially Eden Method, energy medicine, is that we can adapt. We can adapt. I'm a perfect example. Sarah is a perfect example. We can adapt. I was a hot mess back in my early 40s, and I'm 67 now. And I know I look 20 years old, 20 some years older, but in many ways I look younger than I did back then. Really kind of the, the crux of the matter is technology has evolved faster than we have. Yeah. And Donna will say, when asked, so what's the point of all this? Why are we doing all this stuff? I don't have time for this. She'll say, you know, it's really helping the body, the nervous system evolve. to catch up to what technology has done and to build resilience in the system. So no matter where we go from here, we're okay. I'm just curious why it affects people more, some people more than others. Yeah. Well, we're different. If you go on to study this work, you'll learn we're different elements or rhythms in Chinese medicine. We're different sensory types. different genetics, different environmental stressors in our upbringing, different thinking patterns. So we all have our strengths and our vulnerabilities based on all that. And we develop different symptoms based on all that. Thank you. All right. Thank you so much, Linda. Next up is Erica. Hi, Erica. I think you already answered my question. Mine was about knowing if you're at the right points when you're doing the neurolymphatic work. And what I understood, if I understood it correctly, was that it's more an area of energy and it's more about the intention of where you're thumping or where you're placing the pressure. Is that right? That's right. And with the neurolymphatics, often there's a sore spot. Yes. So if you feel the sore spot, soreness is a sign of congested energy. And the little saying is, if it's sore, do it more. Okay. That's perfect. So the neuro lymphatics in particular, soreness is your guide. I used to have a massage therapist who did energy work and she would hit a spot and she'd ask a question like. you know, Oh, have you been eating a lot of sugar lately or, or some spots would just be really tender. And I almost jump out of my skin and she'd go, okay, that means we need to do a little bit more work there. Yep. Great. Well, thank you so much. very welcome. Thank you, Erica. Next up is Manon. Manon, welcome to the call. Hi, Manon. I think I got it. Can you hear me? Yeah, you can. All right. I put down my question. It was very, very personal because I had a serious adventure happening a year ago. And my question is, I'm working on healing my eyes. And do you have any suggestions for me on how to repair the damage which was done to my studio? What happened to me? I don't know if they got the question or not. Let's start with this one. So first of all, we do the daily energy routine, right? Because that is our energy foundation. If that is not in place, we have nothing to build on. It's like shaky sand beneath us. And these taps, you know, the stomach taps, part of our four taps, those send energy to the eyes. Stomach is one of the meridians that governs the eyes. Figure eighting. When in doubt, figure eight, that's kind of our go -to. Figure eights make everything stronger. So a good place to start is figure eighting the eyes. The crown pull is wonderful because it makes space. It relaxes all the muscles around the eyes. So those are great places to start. And there's also an eye challenge that is on YouTube. Can you tell me about that? Yeah, it's wonderful. It's a daily routine for the eyes. And if you look on YouTube, Eden Method Daily Eye Challenge, you will find some great eye exercises on there. Simple and powerful. All right. And who's the person who's doing the Daily Eye Challenge on YouTube? Well, Donna has... a youtube on there and then several people are doing a daily i think i just found it okay good all right i'm going to look at this and i see her right there i said donna right there well thank you very much i will give it a go i'm going to add a couple of things that k27 thump also releases energy up through the carotid artery and the kidney meridian um also feeds the eyes the the the main well there are actually six meridians that feed the eyes but the main ones are kidney liver and stomach so you're just with those thumps from the daily routine you're dealing with two of those and then i would also really check the liver your liver neural lymphatic which is under your right breast and just it follows the bra band um under the right breast check that and see if it's real sir all right that would be helpful because i know someone which is actually she i know she's probably under something but she looked at me one day about like a month ago and she says what happened to you it's like you have all kind of black vein all over you and your face and your hands and i said yeah well something happened i got poisoned by people and stuff and and she says yeah it's still in your it's still in your system When you have things that are really serious, serious conditions, this is for everyone who's talked, including, I forget her name, but the one who has IBS and arthritis. If you have anything that's serious, you want to do retrain homilateral. You're homilateral. By definition, you're homilateral. So don't forget to, before you do the other exercises during the day, fix homolateral. The other thing is if you do have a serious condition, you know, this course is going to get you a great foundation, but you may also want to get a session with a, you know, a knowledgeable practitioner because a practitioner can create targeted homework for you. so that you know everything that you're doing besides the daily routine is really targeted for your own specific issues and a lot of us do remote work so so if you don't have somebody in your in your area you know not that yeah but that should not be um uh a problem because most of the remote work now so anyway you've got lots of options but start with the daily routine and those stump points and the neurolymphatics. All right, perfect. Thank you. Thank you so much, Manon. And for our last question of the day, Claudia, welcome to the call. Thank you. Well, I was kind of wondering why triple warmer is not part of the daily routine since we all have those stress issues, right? Or is there any of those exercises actually already for the triple warmer? As a composite, they all help triple warmer to calm down. They address foundational energies that need to be in place in order for the rest of the energy work to work well. If we're not zipped up, if we're vulnerable to, more vulnerable than we should be to energies coming in, triple warmer flips out. It reacts to that. It gets even more reactive. So these energies need to be in place as a foundation in order to create an environment where the work with triple warmer can be more powerful. And because they address those foundational energies, they actually do start to shift how triple warmer is reacting to the world. They start because your stress level starts to reduce. So you would also always start with the short sequence and then do other exercises afterwards, right? Even in our sessions. In our sessions, we always make sure that we correct those foundational energies before going on to anything more targeted. Thank you. And all those exercises, as Julie said, support Turbo Warmer. Good to know. Thank you. Great. Thank you so much, Claudia. Thank you. Before we wrap up this evening, do you have any closing words, Julie or Sarah, to send the students on the next two weeks before our next call? We're so excited that you're here. You are beginning this journey. We love supporting you. We love having more people join us and get excited about this work. And as Donna says, raising the vibration of the planet one person at a time. So thank you for joining our tribe and keep on keeping on. And don't look at this as work. It's really exciting stuff. And it's life changing. It's life empowering. keep a good sense of humor and just keep one foot ahead of the other. Thank you so much, Julie. And thank you so much, Sarah, for your time and all your wisdom on this call. Thank you, Tribe, for all your questions. and being concise. We got to a lot of questions today. We are going to have another call in a couple of weeks. It is in the tribe. If you're wondering where the call time and the links are, and we are going over next time, energy tests and working with pain with the. rest of the energy medicine faculty. So the recording for this call will be available in about a week. And you can find the links in the tribe as well. Also on the Connect app, every event, it also has a link for the recordings. They're available in one week. And we also ask, we love your feedback, getting your feedback for these calls on the Connect app. So I read every personal feedback that you guys put on there. So any improvements, any kind of feedback you would love to give, I love to hear that. as well thank you guys so much for tuning in for this week uh we will be joining next uh in on may 25th for the next call at the same time with more of the energy medicine faculty thank you so much julie and sarah you guys have a wonderful evening and night morning wherever you are and thank you.

LESSON 3 - The Energy Dance
--------------------
Hi, my name is Titanya Dahlin. I'm Donna's eldest daughter. And I have created Energy Medicine Dance out of Energy Medicine to give you a tool so that the body can kind of let go of stress. When you are moving the exercises with music, there is a kind of calm nature that takes place. And so, you body doesn't go into a fight, flight, or freeze response trying to get you well. It's going to be natural in this way. So we're going to do that routine that she just taught you to music. So, I'm going to start in a chair. For those of you who might be disabled, might be in a wheelchair, or might be confined to bed, this is a really good one. So we're going to start in a chair and then we're going to raise up, and I'm going to teach you a little bit more of the routine and dance. Okay. All right. Everybody just get nice and firm, firmly grounded on the earth with your both feet planted on the earth. And we're going to breathe in, and we're going to raise up our hands, and connect our palms, and come down into our heart chakra, with an intention for this session. Something that is just purely for you. Breath in. In through the nose, out through the mouth. Again. ♪ [music] ♪ And one more time. ♪ [music] ♪ We're going to raise up your arms, and open it out. We're going to come into the Wayne Cook, so taking your leg, crossing your hands, and placing them underneath your feet. Breath in, pull up your body, and out. Breath in. And out. And again. ♪ [music] ♪ Open your hands and come over to the other side. Cross your hands, hold your foot. Breathe in. And out. And again. ♪ [music] ♪ One more time. ♪ [music] ♪ Open up your arms. Connect your fingers like a temple, and take them right to your third eye. Breathe in. ♪ [music] ♪ Three times. And now you’re going to bend your fingers and come onto your forehead and open up that energy in your head. And let go. We're going to continue. Connecting up into your head and pull it open, like you're opening up a little egg, so that the light shines out, and the light shines in to your head from the universe. We're going to come all the way around your scalp. All the way down onto the back of your neck. Open up your neck. Let's do it again. And then hang on your shoulders. Dig into your shoulders. And just begin to sway. You know, whenever you sway, it calms the stress in your body and that's why some children just sway when they are listening to electro, or in their class. It's good for you. Let's just take that energy coming down to the heart. We're going to come into our neurolymphatics. So we're going to... Take your thumbs, we're going to just come into the side. This is a way where you can really get some pressure going all the way up, where your arm stitches to your body. And breathe. Don't want to forget to breathe, because you're going to die if you don't breathe.

LESSON 4 – How to Clear, Center, and Ground Your Energies
--------------------
♪ [music] ♪ - [Donna] Hi, and welcome back. We are going to start each class with the daily energy routine. Not explaining it anymore, just going through it so that it begins to build inside of you and you really learn it, okay? - [David] So before you begin, tune into yourself and just find your own inner state right now so you can compare it with how you feel later. So, just notice. Take a breath and notice what it's like to be you from the inside right now. What parts of your body are feeling heavy? Are there parts of your body that are wanting attention? Just notice, and now, let go and give yourself over to this routine. - So the first thing we're going to do is the crossover shoulder pull. We just pull over to the opposite hip, but really push into your shoulders. And again, you have an added benefit here that you can start moving the congested energy off your shoulders. Okay, now we're going to do the four thumps. I'll remind you what we're doing each one for. This is for grounding. It'll ground stomach meridian right down into the earth. And then, K27. It is the junction point for all the meridians in the body, and it flips them around so they go forward. And then your thymus really turns your immune system on, and is very, very helpful in vitality. And your spleen points. By points, I mean acupressure points. They're very, very good for metabolizing, and adapting, and helping you to be your very best, even in difficult times. Okay. Now, the next we're going to do, cross crawl. Everybody, you're going to hit your opposite knee. This just really helps establish a crossover pattern. And, you know, you might know that babies first do not cross over, and babies who do not crawl... - Babies crawl like this. - Yeah. Yeah. Babies who do not crawl have trouble as they've gotten older, because their energies don't automatically cross over. So now, we're going to do the Wayne Cook posture. Okay, here we go. And those of you who can do it, do it like this. And those of you who can't, do it like Titanya. So you're going to... Left leg over your right knee, right hand around your ankle, left hand around the bottom of your feet. You're going to breathe in through your nose, and out through your mouth. - Really stretch upward on the in-breath. - Okay. Other side. And then, you put your hands together, your fingertips together, your thumb to your third eye, and do the same breathing, in through your nose and out through your mouth. - Again, lifting your body on the in-breath. You feel a stretch on the in-breath. - And now, bend your fingers into your forehead, push in hard, and pull across, and let go. Now, we're going to continue on with the crown pull, to the next step. Come to the hairline, push in and pull apart, and then, just continue across the top of your head, pushing in and pulling apart. And go around the back side of your head, pushing in and pulling apart, and notice if there's a place that's tender. It's a place that usually needs neurovasculars, which I will share with you in just a little bit. You come to your neck. Push in and pull to the side. Push in and pull to the side, and then hang on your shoulders. Take a deep breath in. As you let your breath out, come down to your heart chakra. Amen. Okay, we're switching places, David. - Okay. - Because you're next to the fan, and I'm the one who needs it. Okay. Oh, god. All right. Neurolymphatics. Okay. We're just going to choose different ones each day, okay? Although the first one I'm always going to go to right here, at the armpit, and it's on the chest side of the armpit. The way Tanya did it was a very good way, too. She puts her thumbs in here and goes all the way up. Unless you have really short, little arms like me, and it's better to do it like this. Whichever way works. Okay. Now, let's do underneath our rib cage, for small intestine. And you're going to bend your fingers and scoop them up underneath the rib cage, and massage there. Okay. Now, let's do the inside of the leg. - Okay, one way to do it is put your hands like that, and… - And push your legs into your thumbs. - Make little circular motions. - Or not. All right. And then comes… - [Woman] Large intestine. - Okay. Large intestine. All right. Then, you're going to imagine you have a long zipper here, okay? And you're just going to zip yourself up. And again, if you have an affirmation to say, that's the time to say it. Just go... And as was suggested before, governing is a great one to trace. Just go straight up as high as you can, think up to the other one, come up over... Da da! Da da! Okay, and now, we're going to hook up. Now. - So that, again, is the five-minute routine, and some of the benefits are clarity of mind. It gives you more resilience, it gives you better energy, it gives you a way of refreshing yourself, so we hope you use it a lot. And what did you feel after doing it? We started out tuning into how your body was. Tune in again. How do you feel differently? Does your body parts feel like they have a different weight? Is there a different flow of energy? What do you feel inside? - [Woman 2] …Spleen. It's after lunch, right? - Yeah. - And I get sore. I didn't realize how much impact a lunch could make.. - Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Remembering that spleen meridian, it helps you metabolize your lunch. So if any of you feel like you scarfed down a bit too much, these are points to really massage. Anybody else? Anybody notice that that feels good? - [Together] Yes. - What I can promise you is it will only get stronger. It will get stronger and stronger for you, as your body builds up this knowing, and it's really good. Okay. I want to make sure that everybody understands that neurolymphatic reflexes are very different than the lymph system. These are the reflexes to the lymph to help the toxins, the energy move, the lymph to move. And so, it's not harmful to massage them, even if you have an illness or disease, but you do want to take them in small steps. Just small steps. Do three a day or something like that, and then you won't get too many toxins into your body all at the same time. If that does ever happen to you, you know you're going to be okay. Drink some water, just lay down for five minutes, and you'll return. You know, it's like your body really does want to metabolize it fast. You can also tap spleen points afterwards. The other thing is that... If you're working with someone, or you yourself have an autoimmune illness, you really want to be careful not to do too many at a time. Because their body is not used to fighting off other things so much, but it literally will turn and fight their own body. So it's much, much better then to just not do more than two or three. I would like to say also that in this day and age, where we are living in a world that is so much artificial, and so many of the... I mean, every square inch of the atmosphere around us is filled with man-made electromagnetic energies, and the toxins in our food, and the additives, and the air pollutants. I mean, so many things, plus other people's negativities. If something throws you off from a friend who feels negative. So it becomes really crucial on all of the energy techniques, but most definitely with the lymphatics, because we do take things on, and you want to move them out of your body so that you don't get sick. Okay, let's switch, David. I want to be on this other side. Okay. - Okay, so we're going to focus now on the importance of clearing, balancing, and grounding your energies. - Okay, if you start thinking in the vein of... You want each day that you day finishes, you just clear the stuff that comes into your body, or you begin in the morning. Like, if you have bad dreams, or you're tossing and turning, you want to clear yourself, and ground yourself, and make yourself just really ready for the day. So at any time of the day, you can do this, but if you start thinking in that way, that you have control, you have power, you are empowered to do this healing for yourself, it changes your attitude, too. You just know... I mean, it isn't that things can't happen to me, because they do, but I know what to do for them. I know what to do for them, so I'm going to start sharing some things. Let's move these back, David, just to the background. I'd like somebody. Is there anybody here who hasn't been up here on this stage yet? - [Ellen] I guess that's me. Hi. - Hi, Ellen. Okay. Okay, I'm going to energy test you, Ellen. You hold your arm real strong. - Okay. - Okay. Now, Ellen, let's both agree. Are you very strong? - Really strong. - Okay. Bring to mind something that bothers you. Just bring it to mind and… - Okay. - ... Don't tell us what it... You got it? - Mm-hmm. - That is how quick stress hits the body. It is instant, it is automatic, and it's just so important to get this, that what happens is you lose blood from your forebrain. It goes into your body for the fight or flight response. To beat somebody up or run away, and if you do neither, you just keep collecting stress. You keep collecting stress in your body. So, now. Have you ever done this, Ellen? - Yes, - Oh, my God. These are the "oh, my God" points. They're really called neurovasculars. And I'm going to put this chair up back of you. - Okay. - And ask you to sit there. - Okay. - And I want you to just drop into your stress, that thing that you were thinking about, okay? Let me see if you're nice and weak still. Okay. And I'm going to hold these points. Anybody can hold their own, but these are magic points, and I'm ashamed of the world that we haven't been taught this from the beginning. Everybody needs this. It's like, you want to get the blood back up into your forebrain so you can think again. Now, you never know how long you're going to have to hold, because if somebody has a lot of stress going on in their life, they might have accumulated stresses and it's just been a series of blood leaving their forebrain. But it's usually somewhere between 5 minutes and 10, at the max. I have had it go much longer than that. It just depends on how bad the stress is. - Usually, you will feel the difference within three minutes, but sometimes, it actually will take much longer. Donna has a great story about one of the first times that she had a really long one. - Okay, but that wasn't… and I'm just going to stay here on her points until I can really feel the pulses, by the way. I want to feel the pulses beating. So, a long time ago, it was here in San Diego, I was volunteering in every direction I could because... I mean, truly, nobody would hire me in those days. And so, I got myself accepted as a volunteer in a hospital in San Diego, and it was the mental ward. And when I got to the hospital, nobody greeted me, so I just sort of ambled down the hallway, and there was a room that was open, and I walked in. It was like a big dayroom, and gosh, maybe as big as this room here. It was, at least this big. And there was only one woman in there, and she saw me, and she went over and laid down on a daybed. Now, I'm going to interrupt myself to say that I'm starting to feel pulses coming in on her, but I'm just going to keep telling the story until they're really bouncing me off her forehead. And I went over to her, and I said... She put her back to me as she laid down on the couch, and I said, "Would you mind if I held your neurovasculars?" And… - Which was really a great way to make a connection with her, because then, she can feel, oh, she's one of us. - I held her points, and I held them, and I held them. I am sure that was the longest I ever had to hold points, and I don't think since have I ever held somebody's points that long, but it was a good... I'm going to let you relax. A good 45 minutes before this pulsing came in, but when they came in, she took a deep sigh, and she said, "Oh, thank you. My name is so-and-so. What's your name?" And right at that moment, a nurse saw me, and came in, and pulled me out of the room because I wasn't supposed to be there. A second, gotta feel what this is feeling like. You will really start to feel what amazing, abundant movement is in a person's head when you hold neurovasculars. So anyway, I went down to the office with her, and it turned out that she hadn't spoken in two years. And I don't know, probably none of us have ever had that bad of a stress, but we've all had that experience of you're just too out of it, you can't talk. You know, you don't want to. Now, here's what's happening to Ellen. It is really unexpected, but it's good. Usually, you feel a thump, thump, thump. With Ellen, it's likes waves, going woo, woo. Almost like a figure eight, Ellen. So, I think she could even hold these longer, which she could in her seat, but we're going to see what happens to you. Stand up. Again, I think it could be longer, because I wanted it to be stronger, but you should be able to see a difference. We'll see. Think of that same stress, okay? So, I mean... When you can be energy tested and you keep the strength, it's because the blood has gone back up into your forebrain, your body has dissipated a lot of the stress chemicals, and you're in better shape. This is a great thing to do for yourself any old time, thank you. - Now, the fight or flight response is one of nature's great achievements. It kept us alive for millions of years, yet now, it's a real problem because so many of the things that hit us as stressors are no longer a saber-toothed tiger walking into our cave, where we have to have an immediate response that you don't think about. But now, we have these problems like your computer crashes. Okay, it's a big problem, but it's not a problem that is life-threatening, and there's lots of them that happen every week. So what's happening is that your body goes into the fight or flight response, or at least, the early stages of it, sends all these stress chemicals through your body which are real poisons. You know, they're made to get you into action, but if they just sit there, they become poison. So that's a big part of what Energy Medicine is able to counter, is it's able to give you a technique like this so that when you go into stress that is not appropriate to the situation, you can hold it, but also, so that you build your resilience so you don't go into that kind of distress so quickly. So that's what this technique is about, it's interrupting the fight or flight response. And what actually happens is that the blood leaves the forebrain, up to 80% of the blood can leave the forebrain to go into the chest, the arms, the legs, for the fight or flight response. That's a big change. You can't think very clearly when that happens. You do this, these points are reflex points that bring the blood back up into the brain, so it's a winner. - Okay, you may go sit down now, Ellen. - Thank you. - Ellen, could you feel any difference? - Yes. - Yes? - I could, and after a while, a second set of thoughts came in that were very positive. I was having trouble keeping the stressor in there because the solutions were coming in that were kind of antidotes. - Yes. What Ellen said was that yes, she felt a difference. She felt, also, a second set of thoughts came into her mind that were positive, and she was having trouble keeping the negative. That's what will happen to you all, if you... Boy, the next time you're stressed out, hold your points. You can put one hand also in the front and one on the back, or here's another really good way, thumb there and fingers here. But what it does, you will... You know, this is important. We have not changed in a couple of million years in how we handle stress in our bodies. That's amazing. It did not evolve. It stayed the same because everybody quit working with energy. They, you know, running down to get some pharmaceutical medicine, but that will not help our bodies evolve. So if you do this daily, you will start training your body to do that differently, and get rid of the stress build up in your body, and you just might be happier. Because if you've got a lot of stress in your body, it's hard to be free, it's hard to be happy, it's hard to drop out of your head and just relax. So that's my suggestion, everybody practice it. Thank you. Oh, next one. Let's see. The blow out. Here's what I want. I really want to... Is there anybody here who hasn't been up here? - It doesn't matter. - You haven't been up here. Come on up, darling. Okay. Here's what I'm going to do. First, I'm going to see if you're nice and... Oh, tell the audience your name. - [Jessie] I'm Jessie. - Okay. Hold your arm real strong. Oh, she's... And this is what I'm expecting, by the way, everybody to get stronger and stronger with all these exercises. Yeah, okay. Now, I'm going to show you something, though, Jessie. I'm going to pretend something, and I'll explain it afterwards, okay? So, I'm going to pretend you've come to see me, maybe for a session, okay? And I see you on the walk, and I walk down to see you, and I hug you tight. And now, I'm going to test you. Now, see, you would've thought something that positive, that good, would be good for her, but it's not good for any of us when you're already OD'd on your... I mean, everybody has that experience, right? When as somebody was being as loving and attentive to you as they could possibly be, and it just irritated the hell out of you. You know what it's like? It's because you're on... What is it? Overload. You're on overload, and even somebody else's love coming in on it is too much. So we're going to blow this out, okay? Here's what we do. All right. You're going to rub your hands together and shake them off. - Now, the motion's going to be like this, and you're going to send the energy out your hands into the ground, into the floor, not into your neighbor, okay? - Okay, so you put your arms up like this. I guess... Can they stand up? - Yeah, we can stand up. - If you want to do it, you can… - Yeah, just keep your eyes on the camera. - Okay. Okay, nobody stand in front of the camera. Okay. Put your hands like this, make a fist, take a deep breath in, and bring your arms above your head and go... And now, you're going to do two that are slow and deliberate. Go... You open your hands at the bottom, right. One more time. And now, while you're here, just go ahead and zip yourself up, and since this one deals with self-suggestion, lock it at the top so nobody can unlock it on you. You guys can sit down, and I'm going to go through the same pretense. I'm going to pretend you've come to see me. I bet she's blown out a lot of her stuff, she's emptied her stuff. So, here I come. Okay, now she can take in the love. So if... - We call it The Donna Eden Tolerance Procedure. - No... But it is... I mean, if you ever find yourself in that circumstance with somebody that you just... This person is just really doing you in, you know, and they're trying to love you the best they can, do that exercise, the blow out. - Right, and there's a lot more circumstances than that. That one's kind of a cute one for demonstrating, but there's so many times that we're over the top, we're just so full, we've got so much going on, we're doing so much. And it's just so... It seems simplistic that you could just blow it out, but you can. You can just blow that energy out, that's all it takes, and it really changes your chemistry. It changes your energetic, and it changes the chemistry in your body when you release that way. - Yes, thank you, Jessie. - Yes, it does. - And could you feel any difference, Jessie? - Yes. - All right. Okay, so next, grounding is the next one, and there's several different ways to ground, but a really simple, easy one is to put your hands on your hips with your fingers going backwards a little bit. Take a deep breath in and just smooth your hands down your legs, all the way down and off. You know, while we're here, I'm going to throw in something extra while we're here. Everybody put your fingers right here on the inside of your feet and your big toe, and draw your hands all the way up like this, and out at your hips, up the side of the body, and down to the bottom of the body. That's... Yeah, and that's spleen meridian, and tapping it at the end is a good idea because you want your body to really start adapting to that and metabolizing, so it's a really good one to do. Do you want to do it again? Yeah, ground. Everybody ground. You can... Hey, feel in your body whether you really need to take it off your butt cheeks, or on the sides of your hips, or down the front. You decide, but take it down. Take a deep breath in, and you're just going to smooth all the way down your legs. And off, and then come up, spleen meridian. We're tracing spleen meridian up the side and down. All right. - So, grounding's an interesting word. You know, when we think of it, when a person isn't grounded, they're kind of off, they're floating away, they're not really present. But also... In Energy Medicine, it has a very specific meaning. And what grounding means in Energy Medicine is that the energies of your body are interacting with the energies of the earth, in the way that you're built for them to interact, because there is a very clear, definite polarity that happens in your body, that happens in the earth, and that's one of the next things that Donna's going to be talking about is those polarities. - Yes. I'm going to use myself as an example, because it just happened in the last class. I was wearing some shoes I've never worn for anything longer than an hour, max. You know, I'd always take them off and I didn't think about it. You know how you just take some shoes off, you don't want to wear them. Well, I had them on, and those shoes weren't feeling good, and I noticed two things. I knew in that last hour that I wasn't very grounded, and I hurt all the way around my belt flow. Which is something I will be sharing with you later, but the belt flow is an energy that you get disconnected from the top of your body to the bottom of your body, and my feet hurt. And this is really wonderful to share. Where's my little red bag? I need that red bag. I'd like to show this one... Well, I'll say it to myself... No, I'll show it first. I'll show it. Could somebody come up here who thinks that maybe they're not grounded, or shall I pull you up, and...? Come on. Okay, I want you to take your shoes off. - [Woman 3] Okay. - Good shoes. - Okay. - Okay. I want you to just sit there. - Mm-hmm. - And now, the bottom of your feet, if it would sit on the top of my hand, that's a polarity that is supposed to happen that way, because when your foot is reaching south and this is reaching north. So if you... Let's see, I'm going to see if you're strong. Now, I'm going to put that down. Now, I'm going to touch your foot. How about this one? Okay. Now, here's the magic. A spoon is so wonderful. A stainless steel spoon is the spoon you want to use. But whenever... You know, you can carry your spoon with you, yeah, wherever you go, and spoon your feet when it feels like you need it, when your polarities are off, because that's what happened to her. That means with my hand connecting to her, she lost her energy, which was the same thing of the earth. She wouldn't be connecting to the earth right now. So, I'm going to lift this foot. Am I saying it in a clear way that everybody can understand me? - [Woman 4] I think you need to develop it a little more. - Okay. - Why is this happening? - Okay. There are so many things that can happen throughout the day that throws your polarities off. The truth is, every single cell in your body is a miniature battery with a north and south pole, just like a magnet. And ideally, our polarities will always be in sort of the same way, except, at another level, it's always switching a little bit, and then, trying to come back to balance. Well, one of the things that happens is that when your polarities are off, you're not connected to the earth anymore. You can't connect. You can't... You know that extraordinary experience of when you're walking in a park, or walking in lush, lush grass and it feels so good, and you can feel nature. Everybody know that one? You can really feel nature. But if you ever had the experience before, it doesn't feel that way at all. It doesn't feel that way. You're not connected. So if you only had your spoon with you, you can spoon your feet, and suddenly, you will connect. Your polarities will reverse, and they will be in alignment, now, with the earth. In alignment with the earth. I mean, as David said, we are meant to pull up energies from the earth that feed us and nurture us. We're also meant to let go of energies that go into the earth. This is a stainless steel spoon. A silver spoon won't work. No other spoon will work, but stainless steel will because it has an energy attraction to the nerves in your body, and it just pulls the energy from your nerves to connect, and it just flips everything. So, let me see if you... I've already done that, so let's see if you... Now, let me do your foot again. We were going to go buy a patch of grass for people to stand on with those steps, but we instead... Anyway, now you can walk on planet earth and get something from it. Okay. Again, I suppose it was those shoes that I was standing in so long and the shoes didn't, you know, support me, and that I began... I said it already, I began to feel pain around my belt flow. But then, my feet hurt so bad, and I went and sat down and rubbed them, and nothing was happening, and Ellen ran into the kitchen and got me a spoon, and I spooned my feet. And just as I spooned them, I could feel the pain just rolling off my feet. It just rolled off them. Then I went over... And I never did that before. I did the tips of my toes, and it was amazing. It was amazing, so I want to give credit to the stainless steel spoon. Everybody, really remember that it is amazing. We have one of our students who is now a teacher, in her practice, she has a basket of spoons that she hands to everybody when they leave her office. Okay. So now, I would like to show something else. Is there anybody out there who's sitting there who feels like, "Well, we've done all this, and I feel wretched," anybody? Anybody not feeling good at all, and you don't know why? There's nobody out here? I'll have to choose you and say it's you. - [Woman 5] I. - Oh, and you think this is you? - It could be. I'm a little bit tired. - Oh, come on, then. Now, we've done the crossing over from the shoulder, you know, to get the energies crossed over. But say you're really going through something that's very stressful, or maybe you're sick, or it's just emotional. Whatever it is, mental, emotional, physical, and you're doing the daily routine, and it doesn't seem to be doing as well for you as it did at another time. You got to think, "Wow, I may be really homolateral," which means a more entrenched pattern than just crossing over will do. So that's what we're going to... David, I will need you. We're going to check on you, okay? Look at me. Okay. Now, look at… - See, you're going to look at an X. - Hold your arm real strong. You were right. - And you look at two parallel lines. - Okay. Now, she's already done this and we know it's not holding. It got her strong first but it didn't hold. So if something isn't holding, it's a little bit more... You can sit down right there. And everybody in the audience ought to do it with us. Okay, like this. Same side of the body. Pick up the same side. Same arm, same knee, and make sure... Don't just hold your arms up like this. You want to swing them. Okay, stop. Now, look at that. She's strong. That means she's strong on homolateral, which we don't want, because that's not how you walk. So now, we're going to cross over. Breathe, everybody. You get to a point where you know when you're homolateral. Okay. Now, see, this is the one that should make her strong, but it doesn't because she's homolateral, so we've got to trick your brain and go back and forth, okay? So we're going to go back to homolateral. Okay. Stop. Why don't you take a deep breath in? Okay, now cross over. We're going to see how many patterns it takes before you really are strong on the crossover pattern. Okay, stop. Not yet. We're going to do it in another pattern. That, by the way, usually means a more entrenched pattern has steeped into you, so we want to get you over that. Okay. So, back to homolateral, everybody. Okay, stop. Take a... I want to show you something. That was homolateral. She's now weak on the homolateral, which is what we want. So we're going to see if it's strong enough to make you strong on the cross over. Okay, let's see. Not quite. Okay. You got to do a fourth pattern. It usually could take three patterns, and if it's four, it means you've been in this condition for a while. Okay, so back to homolateral. Everything will work better if you get out of homolateral. Everything. You'll be able to think better, you'll be able to move better. Okay, stop. Now, cross over. Okay. All right. Da da! So, four patterns. Now, here's the deal. I'm enjoying watching you energy test back there. Here's the deal. If you're this entrenched into homolateral, it's not going to be suddenly gone from going through this at this one time. It means a habit has set in. A habit has set in, and you're going to need to do this every day for a while to get out of it, okay? And the pattern is you're going to do, I don't know, 10 or 12 homolaterals, which is the same side, and 10 or 12 cross crawl, 10 or 12 homolateral, 10 or 12 cross crawl, and 2 more sets of that, okay? And end with lots of cross crawl. You'll be glad. You'll be glad. Okay. - Well, why is it important for the energies to cross over? - Why is it important for the energies… - Yes. Tell everybody. - Okay. You know, all over your body, you have crossover patterns. It's not just... It's in your energy field out here, out here in your aura, the energy crosses over. In every cell of your body, and so, it is how we evolved. Every energy pattern has crossover energy patterns in them, and if they go straight up and down, you're using at least 50% of your energies, and you can't think as well, and you just might become a couch potato, you know, that kind of thing, so… - And so science understands that energies do cross over in the body, in the way that the right side of the brain controls the left side of the body, left side to right side, and as Donna said, all the way down to the DNA. You see those, helix is the double spiral. And so, when Donna looks at somebody that's healthy and compares them to someone that's not healthy, one of the differences in the energies consistently will be in the healthy person, there will be a lot of crossovers, and they'll be at all levels. They'll be at the large level of the whole body, and they'll be all the way down to the cells. You'll see the energies crossing over in a way that isn't happening in the person that's not well. So this is a really important energy system, and just this simple exercise that you just experienced gets it not only... If you're working with the big energies, the full-body energies, but it gets it down, it goes down to the smaller level so that there are little crossovers all over the body, and this gets them going, as well. And one of the questions that people often ask is, "Well, if you want the energies to cross over, why is it that you don't just do this? Why do you bother to do this, okay? Why do you do that? Doesn't that just give the body the wrong message?" Well, here's what's happening is that your energies are going this way, and so, you're starting off in the flow of your energies. Even though it's not good for you, it's still in the flow that's already happening. So the part of you that's watching up here in your brain is saying, "Okay, whoever's steering knows what they're doing," okay? So that's why it tests strong because it's in harmony with what's wrong, but it's in harmony with it, so you test strong. Then, after a dozen back-and-forths and the part of you that's controlling all this kind of starts to relax, you go in the other direction. Oh, my gosh, what happened? And that part of you is not able to really incorporate that, and that's why you went weak when you did that. So you're going against the flow, but then, you go back and that part of you says, "Okay. Okay, they know what they're doing again. They regained their senses." And then, you test strong, and then, you go back again. And say, "Okay, what's going on?" And so, that part of you starts to get confused and then notices that this feels better than this, and then it allows the energies to start to cross over. It allows the energies to follow the pattern, rather than fight the pattern that you're doing with your body. I'm a clinical psychologist. One of the first things you learn in counseling is that you follow the client before you try to change the client. In hypnosis, it's called pace, pace, lead. You pace the client, so you pace what's happening when you are doing this. That's where the energies are going and that's what you're pacing. And then, after a little while, you lead to a different pattern. So in a very real way here, this exercise is speaking to your body. You are talking to your body in its own language, which is energy, which is movement. So that's why this exercise is so effective, and as Donna was saying, you may have to do it, if it's a pattern... Like, for you, it may not be a pattern. It may be just a product of your flight. But if it's a pattern, it will go back to the old homolateral, unless you do it... What's advised is two or three times a day for a period of time, until it really starts to shift. But it will shift because that's what your body wants. That's what's natural for your body, is those crossovers. - Okay, and I'm going to answer your question in a minute, but I want to say something more. It is everything David just said. It is everything David said, but there's more. Because if you get sick, you're going to be homolateral. Period. And that is for your sake, so that you will rest. So that you won't be out trying to do normal things, and so, the body, in its intelligence, takes away your energy so that you will just recuperate. But an awful lot of people, you know, have something like... Maybe you had cancer or something, and you don't get out of homolateral. The body learns habits too quickly, so it'll begin to hold onto the new habit, and it becomes really imperative that somebody teach you or help you get out of homolateral so that you can actually get well. You can't really get well from a heavy-duty illness unless you are out of homolateral. And homolateral goes in many directions. There's another thing. If you are depressed in any way, you're homolateral. It's just a given. You are homolateral, and everything depresses in your whole body. In your psyche, in your soul, in your spirit. Everything is depressed, so you want to get out of homolateral. - And let me just add to that because homolateral is, as Donna said, it is a brilliant strategy. You know, it's... You remember we learned in the last class how doing these points when you're starting to drab because your energies start to go backwards, so that is your body saying slow down, rest? Well, homolateral is the next level beyond that, but it's doing the same thing. It's demanding that you rest. It makes it even harder to go forward. So what homolateral is, actually, is a brilliant strategy. It's a brilliant strategy to really get your body to tell you it's time to rest, but it's a horrible habit. It's a brilliant strategy, a horrible habit. And the body's energies do form habits, so that if you're in homolateral, it will stay there and you just won't know why is it that I don't have the "get up and go" I used to have. Why is it that I'm depressed? It goes both ways. The negative thinking can cause the energies to go into a homolateral, but if they're in a homolateral state, all the positive thinking in the world is going to have a tough battle to go against those energies unless you can reverse them in a systematic somatic way. That's why as a clinical psychologist, particularly influenced by Donna, I am working so much more with the body as well as the mind, getting those two in harmony. And it's particularly true with depression where if a person's energies are in a homolateral state, all the traditional talk therapy kinds of work that we learned in graduate school just are not very effective, and so we turn to drugs because we know it's the body. But drugs have a lot of costs, and if you're able to do it at the energy level that does what the drugs try to do, so it's a very powerful technique. - Yeah, thank you. I want to say one more thing about drugs, and that is because I used to work with him. We lived in a town where it seems like everybody in the town, half the town were, you know, adult children of alcoholics, or adult children of drug addicts, or whatever. But everybody... It was like a badge of pride to go to AA or one of those things. - Everybody had their 12-step program. - Yeah, everybody had a 12... And so, I worked on an awful lot of people, and one of the things that I found is those people who chose to... Not knowing that they could do anything differently, go on medication. They got to a place where the medication wasn't working anymore, and they were more homolateral than they'd ever been. So it's really important to learn this one. And your question that, "Well, what if I'm at home and I'm doing all this and I'm getting out of homolateral, but I don't need to get out of homolateral, will I put myself back into a homolateral state?" No. One of the wonderful things is the body wants more and more crossover patterns. The more and more crossover patterns that you have, the better and healthier you are and the more vibrant you are, and the better you'll be as you get older. As you get older, you'll like aging. - Yeah. Yeah. So if your energy's crossing over, you do this, it's not going to throw it into the homolateral. And then, when you do the crossover, it kind of bounces it back, so it's… - Yeah, here's another thing, and David said it before. Let me just see. Let me see. David, put the X up. - Okay. - Look at the X. You're nice and strong. Now I'm going to do something. I'm going to go like that. - She just made a little X on her body. - Because... I mean, there are homolateral patterns all over the body, maybe just in an organ, or on a system, or... You know, you want to get out of them, and so you might think that just because you took the big pattern out, you're home free, but you aren't. You want to keep doing it if... Yeah. - So I should've been stronger when you did this. - I mean, if you had gone all the way, if you'd gotten completely out of it. - Right. But this is going to help the little patterns as well as the big ones. - Oh, yeah. It's going to help all the patterns. - As long as you end with this... - [Together] Yes. - Not this. Got it. - And then, pull across your shoulder a lot, okay? - Okay. - Yeah. And one more story is that we lived in Ashland, Oregon. We still consider it our home, we're just never there anymore because we're on the road so much. But when we were there regularly, a number of cardiologists started to refer people to Donna, and these were people that had the same pattern. They had some kind of procedure on their heart, often surgery, and they were then doing the rehabilitation, they were taking their walks and all of that, and they were not getting better. And Ashland's an unusual place in that there are so many alternative and complementary healers in it that the medical community and the alternative community worked together really well. And so, what Donna was able to figure out was that what was happening was that the people that were taking these walks were in homolateral so that their energies are going up and down. They're doing their crossover, and so they're going against their flow with the walks so that it's not helping them. It's exercising their muscles, but it's not helping them get energetically stronger. It's not helping their heart. So simply getting them out of homolateral was all she needed to do for them to be back on the program and benefitting from it, rather than getting worse and worse. - Yeah. That's really important. If you ever see anybody not getting well, boy, just immediately think, "They're probably homolateral." They're probably homolateral, and it will never harm them to teach them the homolateral, getting into the crossover pattern. It'll always help. It'll always help. When you check for homolateral, you normally check with a large X that the person looks to, and then two vertical lines. And if they are strong on vertical lines, they are in a homolateral state. Well, you do the exercise, and you think, "Okay, that did it, and I'm okay," but what happens, especially if you've gone through something, if you're going through some difficulties or lots of stresses, different parts of your body might have homolateral patterns in them, you know, that they're not crossing over. Like somebody... I'll give you an example. I had a client years ago who just... She did her homolateral, cross crawl, and the daily energy routine, and see knew she was in good shape. But she had cancer and she did not know, nor did I, for a while, why wasn't it getting over this when she was not homolateral. And then one day I was just looking at her, and it was so clear to me. She had stomach cancer, and right over the whole stomach area was just energy that was just going up and down, very slow. When you're homolateral, everything slows down, so it wasn't in conjunction with any other energies in the body, and other energies couldn't get in to be healing. So we just started getting her out of homolateral right on her stomach, and then, things turned around. - By doing… - Yeah. This is another thing you can do. If you do homolateral cross crawl, it will work, but you can also take your hand over an area and just do tons and tons of figure eights. Tons and tons of figure eights. - Which have an X in them. Figure eights have an X in them. - Okay. I just want to say, sometimes, when a class has been going on for quite some time, you start noticing people, how they're sitting, and their postures. And the two of you were sitting like this, and every... A lot of people have something crossed, and that is just another way your body's trying to talk to you. It's saying, "Cross me, for God's sakes. Cross me. I need to have my energies crossed." And so, it's the fact... I mean, people don't think ahead of time before they cross. You know, you just find yourself crossing. You're crossing your legs, or crossing your hands, or... You start crossing things, and it's just part of that listening to your body and starting to get sensitive to that. - Okay, so this session's been on clearing, centering, and grounding. And you've learned several new techniques that we hope you'll practice during the week, that first of all, that you'll continue to do the daily energy routine. And also, if nothing else, at least get a stainless steel spoon and spoon your feet to really help with your grounding. We're going to end with one more exercise that's very interesting. - Yes. Now, do I have... - One of Donna's favorites. - Is there anybody, anybody who hasn't been up here yet? Okay, you didn't know what you were walking into. - [Woman 6] No, I did not. - Okay. All right, I'm going to energy test you, and energy testing is just a way to find out what... You're just going to keep facing me, hold the arm out, push up as I push down. All right, you're nice and strong. She's really strong. So, I'm going to touch in a few places. I'm going to lay my finger next to your neck, and I'm going to use one finger. - Whoa. - And now, inside your elbow. That one's better. Inside your wrist. That one goes... Now, I'm only using one finger, so you know I'm not overpowering her. And her belt flow... You're in pretty good shape, but still, you lose some energy. On your knees. Okay, and your ankles. Okay. Now, I'm just going to shake it off for a minute. So an overall test, you can see the difference. There's a difference. Okay, so we're going to fix that. - And where Donna was touching were places that bend. They were joints, but they're all places that bend, because energy, just in the wear and tear of daily life, tends to get stuck there. And that's fine, but we want to get it unstuck because we don't want it to form problems, which is the basis of arthritis and things like that, but it's really easy to get those energies moving, as you'll see. - This is a fabulous exercise. I love this exercise, and I thought I made it up, and I didn't. You know, it's like... What I know is that I have now seen it all over the world, but sometimes, just slightly different, but the same thing. And I think it's probably the oldest recorded exercise on planet earth, and it keeps going on because it works, and so... - She's seen it in Egyptian hieroglyphics... - I have. - ...In the London museum. - So what this is... I want everybody to stand on your feet, and this is connecting heaven and earth. This is a way to move what... Those places where you lost energy is you've got energy congested there. So we're going to move that congested energy out. We're going to rub our hands together and shake them off, and put your hands on your thighs, and take a deep breath in through your nose and out through your mouth. Now, swing your arms together in a kind of prayerful position. Now, you're going to stretch up to the heavens with one hand and flatten that hand, and the other one goes down, and flatten it, look up, hold your breath. And when you're ready, let your breath out and come back down. And up the other side. Now the other side. One more time. And this time, as you let your breath out, you're going to hang over. Just hang over and do two deep breaths here. Now, roll your aura up your body. Just roll it like this. Yeah, roll it all the way up, and then reach up high, and down you go. Now you guys can sit down, and we're going to test you out. Okay. I'm going to lay my finger next to your neck. And now, at your elbow. And at your wrist. And at your waist. And at your knee. And at your ankle. Da da! - Wow. - That's a great one to do if you're ever just starting to get sick. Just starting to get sick. Starting to get a cold, you will nip it in the bud if you do that exercise fast, okay? - Also, in Donna's practice, this is one she would do between clients, just a way to clear out the energies. Clear them out.

====================

LESSON 5 – Questions & Answers for Chapter 2
--------------------
- [David] So we did the energy routine again and then we did various kinds of clearing and balancing and grounding techniques. Do you have any questions? - [Woman] Throughout college and a lot of trainings in a lot of ways, we get told about how men and women experience things differently, sometimes similarly. So, could you touch on any potential gender differences you've seen with grounding techniques? - [Donna] Oh, let's see, with grounding techniques. First of all, many men tend to stay more grounded than women. The energy comes up from the earth for a woman. It comes up from the earth, she rings in more yen energy, energy that is more female. And men's energy tends to go more down so they often carry more power, partly because they're in that stance on the ground they are grounded. I've found that all exercises work for both men and women, however, it is most interesting... I've taught men in classes to see what does it feel like for you to pull the energy up on spleen meridian, for instance, because it's pulling yen energy up. When we work with chakras and some other things, there are ways that men can get more yen energy and women can get more yang. But all of the exercises will work for everybody but, sometimes, because of your gender, you may not like one as much as another. Does that make sense? - Why would, if women are pulling energy up from the earth, why would women be grounded less than men? - Because, let's see. That was a good question. He said, "If women are pulling energy more up from the earth, why wouldn't they be more grounded?" That energy can actually make women go higher up, you know? It's the energy that comes up and you go higher, and it's the energy that comes down that helps you ground. I mean, yeah, if you're going to ground, you don't find yourself going, you know, like that. Okay. - Right. And men, just to be clear, in case there was any confusion, both men and women do both. But men more draw from the heavens, women draw more from the earth in a kind of stereotypical way. Other questions? - [Woman 2] When you were doing the clearing, were you feeling for pulsations in your fingertips or in her forehead? How did you know? - All right. When I held Ellen's neurovascular points to help the blood come back up into the forebrain, what I was feeling for is her beating of the capillary beds. It's not even of the heartbeat. It's the capillary bed's beat. And it's not in your fingers, it's in her head. And you can... the longer you hold some... I really recommend everybody practice this because the longer you hold, you feel not only... and usually you don't feel the pulsing first. You feel, like in Ellen, I really felt waves, like this going. And you being to... I mean you really get your... I mean, it's a mesmerizing thing. It's just such a... So, but then eventually you feel the pulsing and it's her. It was her, pulsing. And when you hold your own, by the way, often you don't pick up pulses. Most people don't pick up pulses. Every now and then somebody does but usually you don't because it is, your own fingertips interfere. And there's an interference and you can't feel your own. But what you'd know, if you were going to hold your own, is that, "Oh, you feel good now. You can stop." - [Man] Donna and David, if your polarity is not aligned with the Earth's polarity, what does that prevent? How is that... if my polarity is not aligned with the Earth's polarity somehow, they're not matched up, what is that hurting? What is that preventing me from having? - Oh, thank you. A very good question and I've got a lot of answers for it. So, one of them is what happened to me at the last class, where, I mean, I literally began to hurt around my waist and my feet hurt so bad. And it was because I was no longer... I couldn't pull up any energy from the earth anymore, anything to support me. You don't feel a part of nature as much if you're not grounded. If you're not grounded, you tend to pick up other people's stuff more, if you're somebody who picks up people's stuff or their negativity, or... It, literally, is a huge figure eight that comes up from the earth and swirls like that and it makes you feel a little, not consciously in a way that your body would sway, but you're in rhythm. You're in rhythm. When the earth can't hold you, and you can move on the earth well, well you're out of your rhythm, you know? Everybody was born in a rhythm or an element. Some cultures call it an element, others, I call it a rhythm. But it's an element, a rhythm. But it's your rhythm. And so, did that make sense? Was I clear enough? - Yes. It sounds like I have difficulty actually drawing energy, helpful energy, from the earth if my polarities are off. - That's right. I think it's one of the reasons why a lot of people go hug a tree because it gives you, I mean, the tree trunk will ground you, too, back into the earth, okay? - Thank you. - You're welcome. I want to say, as we're going around to you, I just want to say that, Titanya over here, we were talking about neurovasculars and how long you hold them and if you feel the pulses. Tanya, several years ago, was forgetting her dreams and she held her points at night, and she began to remember her dreams in the morning. - [Woman 3] So, one question about the homolateral. Can you muscle-test yourself, I mean, or is there a way to know, besides the low vitality I know you mentioned? - Yeah. First, I want to say, really, the best way you can know, is you... what this allows in you is to begin to sense into your own body and what it's trying to say to you. That's the most important thing. And energy testing is the way to get there but, eventually, you get more intuitive. Your sensory systems turn on. All of that. But, I'll tell you what, I don't know if it's tomorrow or I mean the next class, or the next class, whenever it is, I'm going to teach energy testing. And I'll show you how I would do that, okay? - Okay. - Okay. Yes. - [Woman 4] So, on the same topic of homolateral, so with me, when I was up there, you had me look at the cross, and I was strong, and then you crossed. I don't know if it was over my heart or over my stomach and I was weak again. Does that mean that, like, there was something wrong with, maybe, like my heart or my emotional  center? And if you had crossed over my stomach, that means there's something wrong with my stomach or is it not have to do with the body part? - I am so glad you asked that question. All it means is long before anything happens to your physically, it happens in your energy body. If you can handle something in your energy field, it won't happen in your physical body. And so, you can start with things before things happen to you, and you just, it just makes it a lot easier. You can also start when you're really in trouble physically and turn it around. But I know that you travelled. You were travelling a lot and probably wearing yourself out. So it may be that, you know, if you have a couple of good nights sleep, you're going to also be much better. But, if you are staying in homolateral, you want to get out of it.

====================

LESSON 6 – Energy Dance for Clearing, Centering, and Grounding Your Energies
--------------------
Welcome back. Let's move some energy and ground ourselves. Now, remember you can do this standing or you can do it in a chair. So I'm going to demonstrate in the chair and then we'll get up and move some more. So you're going to ground yourself. Put your feet flat on the ground. Feel the earth beneath your feet. We're going to breathe in and connect your palms breathing out coming into your heart chakra. Feeling that essence of your unique self and just feeling gratitude here. ♪ [music] ♪ And you're going to rub your hands and connect them into your thighs, feeling the energy moving down your legs into the earth. Breathe in through your nose and out through your mouth. Let's connect up the energies again. Bring it down to your heart chakra, letting your breath out. Breathe in and connect up to the heavens and down to the earth. Hold your breath and let your breath go and connect heaven and earth into the center of your being. And up again the other way. Release, stretch between the two and then let your breath out. And again reach up to the heavens, down to the earth knowing you stand in between the two. And down. And one more time. Really reaching between the two and now you're going to roll over all the way. Let's make a figure eight underneath our feet for more grounding. And we're going to roll up the energies all the way up and open them out. You're going to take your hands and come to the back and you're going to just take a little bit of a rub into your adrenals, into your kidneys. Really connecting up and then coming all the way down and smoothing down the legs and off the toes, squeezing your toes. Then you're going to take your big toe and come up in the inside of your legs up, breathe, and tap, and sway. Just open it up. You're going to connect on the back of your chair or your hands, come to the front of your chair, open up your lungs. And let go and just cross your energies and come back to your heart. And now, we're going to come up, rub your hands together and you're just going to take your head in the front and the back. Forehead, backhead hug. And you could just be in silence here just breathing into any stress that is coming up in your life and you're just going to just let go knowing that all your energies, all your nerves, all your stresses are becoming calm. And open it up. Open it up and open it up like a lotus and turn your body and open it up like a lotus. All lotuses come from the darkness into the light in order to bloom. Let's take those figure eights that my mother was talking about. Like you're flowing with your life. Open it up. Let's rise up. We're going to take three breaths with a blowout. Think of something you don't want in your life, something you're mad at, something you want to get rid of and blow it out. And again, breathe in and out. And again, and one more time, nice and easy. And zip it up all the way to the heavens. Wooh. Bring it up. Bring it to your mouth. Think of speaking your truth. Touch your forehead and open it up. 05:33 —> Bring figure eights into your body Okay, we're going to do the same thing above, we're going to rub into our kidneys, our adrenals, open it up and squeeze down your legs. Come up the big toe. Let's come up to the thymus. Oh yeah, we're doing the best we can. Think of speaking your truths into the world. Figure eights. All over your energy body. And we're going to cross over, cross crop. Walk all around yourself. Bring it all the way up, reach up into the heavens and figure eights. Get into your own little funky rhythms whatever that is. Figure eights. If you have somebody in the room you can figure eight their energy to you and theirs to you so you can have great communication and relationship. And now, you're going to take little tiny figure eights all over. It connects up all of your systems. I call them fairy flows, you can imagine fairies dancing all around. Bring it up the lotus and turn your body and one more time the other way and let's come back and just connect back into our own selves. Thank you. That's it.

LESSON 7 – Befriend Your Triple Warmer & Spleen Meridians to Relieve Stress
--------------------
- [Donna] Welcome back, everybody. Welcome to this Class 3 of the journey to vitality, Energy Medicine. We're so glad you're back. Today, we're going to be dealing with two meridians especially, Triple Warmer and spleen. I'm going to share as much as I possibly can think of to tell you. Oh, no. We're going to start with the daily energy routine first. Once again, we're just going to do this at the beginning of every class. We're just going to go through it. It's very, very simple. So it becomes like second nature to you. - [David] So before we begin, tune in for a moment and take inventory of your body. Take inventory of how you're feeling inside, so you can compare it with how you feel after you've done this short series of exercises. - Okay? All right. Here we go. We're going to put one hand on the opposite shoulder, push in, and pull across to the opposite hip. Just keep going back and forth. Really grab it at the shoulder, so the energy can really learn to cross over. Now, we're going to do the Four Thumps. All right? Here we go. On the cheekbones, on K-27, the 27th point, on kidney meridian, on the thymus gland, and on the spleen points. Now, we're going to do a cross-crawl. Cross-crawl, making sure that that energy stays crossing over. All right. Now, we're going to do the Wayne Cook Posture. You can follow Titanya here. If you cannot do it like me, put the right foot over the left leg, left hand around the ankles, right hand around the bottom of the feet, and breathe in slowly through your nose and lift yourself up. Then, collapse and going out your mouth. Okay. The other side. We're all going to start unscrambled. Okay. Now, put your fingers together like this and your thumb to the third eye. Breathe in through your nose and out through your mouth. One more time. As you let your breath out, bend your fingers into your forehead. Push in hard, and pull to the side. Now, we're going to continue on doing the Crown Pull. Push in and pull apart, and then come up to the top of the head, push in, and pull apart and keep on trucking. Keep going across the top of your head, around the bend of your head, around the backside of your head. Then, when you get to your neck, press in and pull to the sides. At last, just hang on your shoulders. Then, take a deep breath in. Push your fingers into your shoulders, and just drop them. Okay. All right. We're just going to do these, right here on the side of your chest, between the chest and your arm. Just notice if they hurt. If they hurt, it just says you need it. Let's do the ones right here on our lungs, in between the ribcage, and then right here on the sternum. Underneath the... Right on your bra line, fellas. Then, let's just drop underneath our ribcage. You see how much quicker they go as you start going on. I'm not going to do even the legs, because you've done quite a few. We don't want you to get woozy from moving too many toxins out of your body too fast. Now, we're going to do Zip Up and Hook Up. So you're going to imagine you have a long zipper, and you're going to just zip it up, all the way up and lock it. Then, you're going to hook it up. Throughout the class, if you feel like you're losing it at all, just stop and hook yourself up. Or reach over your shoulder and cross over. Okay? Now, we're going to... Let me have this. I'm going to share with you something really, really valuable, the Meridian Flow Wheel. Inside the outer band are the names of the meridians. You'll see on the outside of those bands are the time of day, like two hours. Like heart is 11:00 a.m. to 1:00 p.m. Then, small intestine is 1:00 to 3:00, and it goes all the way around the wheel like that. Each meridian feeds the next meridian. Like spleen feeds heart, feeds small intestine, and it just keeps going around like that. I'm going to even stop myself and say how important that is that each meridian can feed the next one. Because if it can't feed the next meridian, well then that next meridian doesn't have any juice. Like spleen, there are more heart attacks on spleen time than any other time. It's between 9:00 and 11:00 a.m.in the morning. It's not on heart time, which is 11:00 to 1:00. It isn't. It's because spleen meridian tends to get the weakest of all meridians, which I will explain in a minute. But then, if it's too weak, it doesn't have anything to feed the heart. That's why more heart attacks happen at that time than any other time. Another contender in the times of day that a heart attack can happen is often the opposite, which is gallbladder time at the bottom. There is a definite energy between opposites. - Oh, I was doing heart... - No. I mean heart. Between heart and gallbladder. - Okay. - That that's... Yeah. Between heart and gallbladder. Well, that's true too. That is true too. Between spleen and Triple Warmer, you can have that too, because Triple Warmer keeps sucking the energy away from spleen. The reason why that is, is because triple warmer, it has such an important job. Its job is to save your life. Its job is to make you get out of danger as quickly as you can, the fight or flight response. The problem is we live in a world that it often isn't danger at all. Yet, triple warmer turns on, because it has learned to be on alert for danger. So as David said, if your computer crashes, that is not danger, but Triple Warmer turns on. The problem is it turns on, and the first place it sucks energy from is its opposite, which is spleen meridian. Then, spleen... Then, it keeps taking from everywhere all over the entire chart. The only place it can't take from is the heart. Because if it took from the heart, you would be having heart attacks all day long. I said that kind of fast. Is there confusion? How about the time of days? Okay? The time of day. Every two hours, a different meridian is getting juiced. Every two hours, a different meridian is getting juiced. So spleen meridian should be getting strong at 9:00 to 11:00 in the morning. However, if it's become chronically weak, because Triple Warmer is too stressed out, then spleen can't get that juice. Does that make sense? It's the same way all the way around. In fact, this is a fabulous chart to pay attention to. You can start... Just take a few days, and note what happens to you at these times of the day. Many, many people lose energy between 3:00 and 5:00 p.m. That's bladder time. Well, bladder governs your nervous system and it also sits opposite to the lungs. So when bladder time comes around, which is 3:00 to 5:00 p.m., that is a natural time to take a rest. I mean, we are all meant to have siestas. We don't in our culture. But we are meant to. We are meant to have them, because that's the natural time. The problem is we stay out there, still trying to live a life, and maybe that's the very reason that Triple Warmer is turning on more and more for you. You want to look to see, "Why is Triple Warmer always on alert for me?" I mean, there are so many reasons, but that's one of them, because we don't take a natural nap. Lung, which sits opposite bladder, literally sucks the oxygen away from bladder. So you don't have as much oxygen at that time. It's a very physical time that you are meant to take a nap. Now, there is a relationship between everything that is opposite, and also the flow. David is going to explain the times a little bit. - Yeah. The Meridian Wheel is a really important part of Energy Medicine for understanding the relationships of one meridian to another, to another, to another. It kind of seems abstract when you look at it, but it really tells a lot about how nature operates. If we put the chart aside and just think about ourselves as beings on this Earth, we're beings on this planet, we're energy beings. We have... As Donna said, every cell is a miniature battery with a positive and negative charge. So we are very responsive to the energies around us. Just like you take a magnet and you put it to another magnet, and you see an attraction or repulsion. All the electromagnetic fields around us influence us. They influence us electromagnetically. They influence us through gravitational pulls. If you think of the tides, the moon is having that effect on the Earth. You are 70% water. Is the moon having an effect on you like that? The sun, very, very powerful energy. Our relationship to the sun changes, because we spin around every 24 hours, so we're facing it or we're opposite to it. So those energies are impacting us. Then, we have the fact that the Earth is moving around the sun, so it's impacted in different ways. You're here, wherever you live. You're where you live, where you grew up, and you adjusted to all those energies. You adjusted to them. So your energy systems are working in conjunction with them. Interestingly, you have 12 major meridians, plus Governing and Central are a different system. That's that microcosmic orbit Donna was talking about. The 12 major meridians, they conveniently, for a 24-hour day, you can have 2 hours for each one. It divides up very nicely. So as the Earth spins, a different meridian is getting charged. It's getting the maximum energy because of its relationship to the heavens and Earth. Your body is situated there, so that it's designed that spleen energy comes in at the time that you see on your chart, from 9:00 to 11:00 in the morning. That's when spleen energy is coming in strongest. Now, one of the ways to really understand how this is so important is we've all had the experience of jetlag. What happens with jetlag is that you are brought from one environment where you're totally adjusted to it. You're totally adjusted to the environment. Your body knows that the energy of heart is going to be coming in two hours after the energy of spleen. It's posed for it. It's waiting for it. Everything in your body is adjusted to that. Then, each of the next meridians, every two hours, your body is expecting it and your body is operating as if that's going to happen. That's healthy. That's efficient. That's how brilliantly nature has set this up. But you take yourself away from... Like we happen to be in San Diego right now. You take yourself away from San Diego, and artificially move yourself over to London, and you've gone very fast so that your body is still making this change every two hours. But now, you're in a different relationship to the Earth, to the sun, to the moon. What you're finding in this different relationship is, say, it's spleen time and your body is expecting spleen to get fed, but spleen isn't getting fed. So something is wrong. That throws you off. That's jetlag. Jetlag is not just because of the sleep disturbance. There's that too. But it's because the energy is not doing what it's supposed to do. It's not doing what it's always done. So that, I think, explains why this chart is so important, why it's so valuable. For each of the meridians, when there is a high tide on one, it's the low tide in the other. So when it's 3:00 p.m., it is high tide for bladder, but it is low tide for lung. Everything works in cycles. Everything works in cycles. So you're seeing those cycles right here in this chart. Even though the chart is kind of abstract, if you understand what Donna just said and what I just said, the chart really becomes alive. I'm a fan of the Periodic Table of Elements. I think itâ€™s just nature is so beautiful in the way that you add one proton and it changes the whole element. Then, you add another one and it's very orderly. Well, this is very orderly in that way. I got very excited when I came to understand this chart. - Thank you, David. I just want to say this chart is a magical chart. You really understand that there is an order to all of our energies, and it's thrilling. It's just thrilling. You can start figuring out the maze in your own body. I'll give you an example. Somebody in a class I taught to recently, after we'd been teaching a couple of days, she said... Well, I'd been trying some of the things to take away some pain she always had, and she couldn't do it. But she figured out something on the night before. She figured out that there was a pull, probably from circulation, sex, and stomach. Because at around 7:00 to 9:00 at night, she'd get this awful pain every night, whether she ate or she didn't. She started sedating those energies. When I say "sedating energies," I mean sedating acupressure points that are on Circulation 6, and her pain went away. So it's just a valuable thing. Some people get headaches at certain times of the day. So I'm going to show you some ways to calm Triple Warmer down. I believe one of the most important reasons to learn Energy Medicine is to evolve your body and evolve the way stress acts in your body. Triple Warmer governs that stress, and it has not changed in a couple of million years. I mean, we still act as if it is a major, major danger, when it could be something slight. People have road rage, and people haul off and slug somebody in their family, and it's often just because triple warmer is starting to explode. An awful lot of people try to hold their rage down, their anger down, and then it explodes at inopportune times. I'll just tell you, to give you an idea, when we were in Ashland, Oregon and lived there for a long time, and still consider it home, people... Well, everybody in town at one time or another, it's a small town, took my class just about. I had a couple of judges who took these classes, and both of them said to me at one time or another... Like the first time it happened to me, it was so amazing. The judge calls me up and he said, "Donna, I have this man in front of me who just went berserk, and just beat up his family and a couple of co-workers. I know I can just send him to jail, but everybody says he's such a nice guy. I was thinking, do you think that's a Triple Warmer thing?" "Yep. That's a Triple Warmer thing." So his sentence was to come and learn how to handle his Triple Warmer. Then, I had somebody else from another judge had to come and do that, and it works. It works. So what we want to do is to evolve that energy, that for sure was the energy that kept us alive. I mean, we really want to honor what an amazing energy this is that kept us alive as a species, but now is out of sync with the world we live in. We live in a different kind of world now, and we're not going to be at... I mean, those things still can happen. Somebody can be attacked. But Triple Warmer will turn on in the same ways, regardless of if it's a big stress or a little stress. So I'm going to show you what happens to your body. So I want somebody to come up here. Somebody haven't been up here for a long time? - Okay. Come on. Okay. Hi. Now, I'm going to show you something interesting. I'm going to test spleen meridian, and this is how you test spleen meridian. The arm goes straight down with no fist, the thumb next to your leg, and I'm going to put my hand between her body and her arm. I'm going to pull out, and you hold real strong. Okay? You're not terrible, but you're not great. I should not be able to pull it out. Try it one more time. - [woman 2] Okay. - Okay. Now, it is opposite force, somebody tell me. It is opposite force it is triple warmer. Right. So I'm going to test triple warmer. - Okay. - Okay? You push your arm back, and I'm going to push it towards your body. - Okay. - There's no way I'm going to knock triple warmer down. It is so powerful, and it still carries that mandate to make you safe and fight against anything that comes its way. So I'm going to show you a really interesting thing. Okay? Everybody can do it with us. What I want you to do is lay your fingers sideways across your eyes. - Everybody, watch carefully. - Okay. Now, take a very deep breath in. As you let your breath out, drag your fingers to your temples. Take another deep breath in, and just keep your fingers here. Because you're on some very important points, so these are neurovasculars for triple warmer. Now, take another deep breath in and push your fingers above your ears. Above your ears. Then, as you let your breath out, take your fingers around your ears, down your neck, and hang on your shoulders. Now, take another deep breath in, and let your breath out and drag your hands to your heart chakra. You might want to take one more breath. Okay. Now, I'm going to test spleen again. We know, by the way, I can test Triple Warmer for a long time, it's going to stay strong. It's going to stay strong. We all O.D.'ed on that energy. But I'm going to test spleen and see if you got anything back. - Okay. - Okay. Hold. Yeah. So Triple Warmer... When you do that, that's the Triple Warmer Smoothie, and you're going backwards on Triple Warmer meridian. It releases, so spleen gets some energy. Now, I'm going to take one more person up. I wish I'd have tested two things on you. But I'm going to take somebody else. Why don't you come up here? I'm going to show you something. Hold your arm like that. Okay? I'm going to push it forward, and you don't let me push. No. You hold it down. Okay. You see that... Now, hold your arm like this. Like that. - [woman 3] Like that? - Yeah. - Okay. - And you push against me. So that time I tested heart against Triple Warmer. So now, you just did that exercise. Didn't you? - Mm-hmm. - And it wasn't enough. So we're going to do something a little bit more. Okay? - Okay. - You're going to start here with your feet on the... - This side? - ...other side. Okay. Take your fingers around the ears, and then down the arm and off the fourth finger. Really pull it off the fourth. That's the second. Yeah. That's the fourth. Sorry. I didn't know which one. Now, on the other side. Okay. Go up around. Start really right here in the temple. Then, around the ears, and then off the fourth finger. Fourth finger. Okay. Now, I'm going to see. You hold your arm up, and the more you calm and sedate Triple Warmer, the more the other energies, all the other meridians start collecting their energy back. It's like he releases to them. I always think of him as a "he." - Me too. - Thank you. - You're welcome. Thank you. - Okay. Energy tests are amazing. They were figured out by a man named George Goodheart, who was a kinesiologist of muscles and really worked with muscles, and helped people who were athletes to better perform and also to get over their injuries. He figured out the energy tests. Now, that's his reputation, that he figured it out. But I know that John Thie also did a lot with him, and they worked together. John Thie's father had been in China as a doctor, a Western medical doctor in China. They began to work with the energies and the muscles. The energies and the muscles. They figured, they just were understanding how energy flows and muscles are on different meridians, "What would be the muscle test?" for instance. So it was originally muscle tests with them and not energy tests. But this makes the heart work when you do that test. If you test spleen... Turn around. I'm going to show. No. I'll do it this way. When he... Pull next to your body. He's tensing this muscle. So you can find out the muscles that are being challenged when you energy test. - There are 14 meridians. Each meridian has a different energy test associated with it, based on which muscle the meridian goes through. So what you're testing is whether the muscle is operating at full efficiency. Because it has the energy going through it, then the energy test shows strong. Or if the energy is not going through that meridian, the muscle is not being fed, and so the energy test shows weak. So what you've seen so far are two different energy tests. You've seen the spleen energy test. You actually have seen several. - Yes. - I'm sorry. - Spleen, heart, and Triple Warmer. - What you've seen so far are the spleen energy test, the heart energy test, the Triple Warmer energy test, and also what we've been using is called the "general indicator test," which is designed to get a basic reading on the entire body without looking at specific meridians. - Is that all understood? Okay. Now, it's so important to not let your meridians get sucked away by Triple Warmer, because then you don't have all the energies to handle other things in your body. Or I always think of spleen and Triple Warmer so much, because spleen also governs how happy you are. This sense of just life is pleasant and easy, and it's good, because it's the opposite of that stress of Triple Warmer. It's really part of the Radiant Circuit System, where life is easy and pleasant, and fun, and passionate, and good, and thankful, and all of those things. But if spleen is so weak, then you don't even have the energies for it, so that you can't find the vitality of joy and passion. The other thing is spleen helps metabolize things, whether it's the food you're eating or some negative energy coming from somebody, or pollutants in the sky, or any of those things. Can you metabolize it? Can you metabolize it? If you can't metabolize it, you can get sick. The other thing about spleen is that it helps your body adapt to anything new, and that it becomes a comfort zone and is not a foreign energy in your body. So like if you go to a new country to live and it feels all so foreign, spleen always has a hard time, until you find your rhythm there. So spleen has a lot to do with rhythm. - So the relationship of spleen and triple warmer that you see on the chart is very interesting, because the Triple Warmer is taking so much more energy. Donna mentioned the radiant circuits. I'm just going to talk a little bit about the history of the meridians and how that fits in with Triple Warmer. The history of the meridians is that long, long ago in evolution, there were no meridians. When Donna looks through a microscope at a paramecium, she sees the energy moving like radiant circuits, but not like meridians. Radiant circuits are like hyperlinks. They go wherever they're needed. So in a little organism, that's how that works, because energy does need to be distributed. There needs to be digestion. There needs to be all kinds of activity, even in a paramecium. But it's not so complex that it can't be handled by a sort of hyperlinking arrangement. So those energies are going all over the place as needed. Now, what happens is that as systems get more complicated, that doesn't work as well, because there is many more parts. So what happens is that, for instance, with digestion, the digestive process happens every day, and the hyperlinks need to go over the same pathway. And eventually, it's like, you think of a riverbed on a mountain, because the water goes there... Every day, it cuts a path, and the path it cuts is a meridian. The advantage of the meridian is it doesn't have to figure it out every time. It's there. It's always there. It's routine. It can be counted on. It doesn't depend on what else is going on. It is established in your energy system. So a meridian is much more efficient than a radiant circuit. But the radiant circuit is a lot more flexible than a meridian. So sometimes we've been compared, that she's the radiant circuit, I'm the meridian, in our relationship. Now, where Triple Warmer comes in is very interesting, is that the radiant circuit like in a paramecium that their immune system is based on those energies moving around to keep that organism healthy. The immune system doesn't have a way to fight things off. The way it fights things off is just to be healthier and healthier. So in the sense that it's the deer that is injured or old, or lame, that the lion gets, it's the deer that is really healthy. That's the strategy of the radiant circuits and for keeping your immune system strong, is it keeps all of you strong. Sometimes we talk about the radiant circuit strategy being like the great mom. Imagine Thanksgiving, and the mom is figuring out where everybody, all the uncles and aunts, and who likes who, and who should sit next to who, and who likes this food, and who doesn't like that food, and is making sure all these parts are getting taken care of. That's how the radiant circuits work. Now, one day, one of those radiant circuits went out and found out that if there was a virus attacking, that you could attack the virus back. That's how the Triple Warmer developed, that the Triple Warmer is the great warrior, whereas the radiant circuits are the great mom. The triple warmer keeps you healthy by attacking what is not familiar, by attacking what might be dangerous. So now, as humans, we have this enormously complex body, enormously complex energy system, and Triple Warmer is there to keep you alive, to keep you healthy. It will attack whatever it doesn't recognize. Because if it was good enough for your ancestors, it's good enough for you. You've survived through all these millions of years. So Triple Warmer has a winning strategy. If it's not familiar, then it's not needed. But now, evolution has moved so fast and our environment has changed so fast, that all kinds of things are not familiar. That there are at least 17,000 chemicals in our foods that were not in the foods that our ancestors ate. Every one of those is unfamiliar to triple warmer. So Triple Warmer is always on the alert. "Should I attack it or let it be? Should I attack it or let it be?" Same thing with all the toxins that are in the environment, the toxins that are in the energy systems with cell phones. Even though you all have been kind enough to keep your cell phones off, the signals are still coming in and they're still touching your body. So all that is happening, and Triple Warmer goes a little nuts in our culture. That's why Donna said that working with Triple Warmer is such a big part of Energy Medicine. Because what Triple Warmer needs to do is be caught to not go into overreaction. Because when it does, it is draining us. It is putting toxic chemicals into our body, stress chemicals. It is creating allergies. It is creating autoimmune diseases. All of that is the work of Triple Warmer confused, a confused Triple Warmer. So you can partner with Triple Warmer. You can partner with the Triple Warmer to teach it to calm down, and that's a big piece of Energy Medicine. So the simple exercise that you've already done is one of the ways of giving the message to Triple Warmer, "It's okay. You can relax." It's still going to go into action if there's an emergency. You're not going to calm it down that much. But you can calm it down so that it's not going into this reaction when your child gets a bad grade or frowns at you when you ask her to take out the trash. That's not adaptive for us. But our body doesn't know that. Triple warmer is not about keeping you happy. Triple Warmer is about keeping you alive. It doesn't care if you're happy. Now, I'll say just one more thing about Triple Warmer is that not only is it the immune system, but what is the fight or flight response? It's the same strategy in dealing with the outside environment. If it seems dangerous, you go into a fight mode or a run-away mode, or a freeze mode if that will make you invisible. So you have the same strategy inside called the "immune system," and outside called the "stress response." So triple warmer is really over its head in our environment. So there's a lot we can do to very quickly teach Triple Warmer how to adapt to the world that we live in. Donna is going to give us a few more ways to do that. - Thank you. I want to say that one of the things that we get, autoimmune illnesses, they are basically a Triple Warmer-spleen imbalance. That's what they are. It's like triple warmer does not know what is dangerous anymore, so it's fighting your own body, your own tissue. Like when I got myself well, it was Triple Warmer and spleen I had to work with to get well. Now, I'm not even vulnerable there. That's another thing that happens. If you work with somebody who maybe has had a heart attack or something, and really work with their energies, you will find, and I hear this all the time, they're not even vulnerable to the heart attack anymore, for another heart attack to come along. So it's like we have these cave dweller immune systems here in the 21st century and we've got to change that. We've got to. If you really want to have great lives, you want to change that. It's, of course, critical into the future, because we're not getting less toxins in our environment and in our food. We're getting more. The other thing that's really important to get is that if you think, "Well, if I just do organic food," which of course is better. But if your body has turned off so much on Triple Warmer, I mean, it doesn't matter if it's organic. I mean, I got my sickest from organic vegetables and organic fruits. I couldn't eat anything when I was my most allergic. It was just because Triple Warmer no longer knew. It had gone crazy and nuts inside of me. That's it. That's what I wanted to say. So I want to show... Come here, Marque. Okay. Hi, sweetie pie. Okay. Marque, come here. I'm going to test you on spleen. Okay? You hold your arm real strong and don't let me pull out. Not great. Hold with all your mind. Okay. So she already has gotten some energy back from Triple Warmer. But there's something that you can do to follow that. I suggest, if you guys can move out a little bit from the cameras, you ought to do it. All right. You can do it sitting down, I suppose. Here. You can do it sitting down. Put your hands right here at the bottom of your ribcage, and take a deep breath in and draw your hands up to your armpits. Let your breath out, and move in front of your hip bones, down the inside of your legs, and off the big toe. Now, forward three times from the big toe, up the inside of the legs, go out at the hips, up the side of the ribcage, and down to the bottom of the ribcage. Two more times. We're doing a spleen flush is what we're doing. It's just like backwashing pipes. Now, one more time. Straight up the inside of the leg and out, and now let me see. Okay. Hold. Yes. So that's a really great thing to do. But first, do the Triple Warmer Smoothie, and then do that spleen flush. That's really... Oh, can I say something that you just told me at the break? - Sure. - She said, "I like to throw in whatever anybody else finds out or figures out, or 'yes, that worked'." Can I talk about you? - Sure. - So she's been having AFib, and here's two things that have helped her. One is stretching across the thymus. Just stretching it has really helped the AFib, and what makes it go away is doing the Blowout. - At night or anything, and it just really does it after two or three times. - All right. - And I feel I can sleep. - Yay. Okay, honey. Thank you. - Yeah. So in that flushing spleen, she's going against the flow of the meridian once, and then with the flow three times. That's why she calls it "flushing out," is that it's like changing the oil in your car. So you go against the flow. That takes the energy out of the meridian. With the flow invites and directs energy back into it. - Yeah. I know that that was what I did every single day when I was trying to get well from multiple sclerosis. Every day. But first of all, I didn't know I was going to actually get well from it. I just wanted to get my body stronger, and I knew I was going towards something good. But before I was well in MS, I lost my allergies. All my allergies went away that I could not... Not since I was about two years old had I'd been able to eat fruit or vegetables, which is supposed to be the good thing. But I couldn't eat them. I would wind up just violently ill, and ended up in the hospital a few times from just eating organic string beans. So it doesn't matter when you're so far gone. But I'd also took away my asthma, and I just got stronger and stronger, and stronger, and stronger. So the next thing that you want to do... So the first thing, you always want to think, "Sedate Triple Warmer." "Sedate Triple Warmer." Because you could strengthen spleen, but if it doesn't have enough juice on it, it won't do you much good to flush it. Let me see if I see... Honey, I'm going to show it on you. Can I show you, just so that you don't mind? Okay. Now, I'm going to show you. Hold your arm real strong. Now, flush spleen. Okay. Now, hold. It didn't do a thing. - No. - That simply means Triple Warmer is in control. So she didn't have enough energy on the meridian itself to make a difference when you work it. So then, she can tap. She can do everything. But if Triple Warmer is holding on to so much energy, well that's the problem. So while you're here, let's do this again. Okay? Across your eyes. Take a deep breath in through your nose. Let your breath out and come to your temples. Take a deep breath in and go above your ears. Go back behind your ears, down your neck, and hang on your shoulders. Now, push your fingers in hard and drag them across, and land on your heart chakra. Now, this is really interesting. I'll just tell you what I'm seeing and I'm going to hold your arm real strong. She's much stronger, but she's not strong enough. So I've got to wonder, I want her to... Maybe it's that triple warmer and spleen need to have better communication with each other. Here's one simple one. If you take your right hand and wrap it around, right on your spleen meridian, right on your spleen organ, and then around above your elbows and put it right there. You can sit down. We're going to let you sit that way and see if communication starts. This is spleen and Triple Warmer. So if you just... If you're going to cross your arms anyway, this is a better way to cross. Let me see if anybody else looks like they're wiped out. Who's feeling wiped out? Anybody? How are you doing? - [woman 4] Good. - Good? Okay. - I think. - No. I'm sorry to show you this, but... Hold your arm next to your body and don't let me pull out. Okay. Pull it to your body. Do you see? I shouldn't be able to do that. Now, did you... You flushed spleen and you did this, and all of that. So I'm going to think that for you too it's something about communication. You could do this. Anybody ever find yourself doing this? I mean, your body is talking to you and it's telling you, "You really need to cross this energy over." You're not just crossing it. You've got your thumbs right on the central lymphatics. You've got your fingers on the end of spleen, and you're crossing your energies and you're right over the heart. You sit down too. I want to see how long this is going to take on you too. Okay. Now, you hop up and let me see what's happened. That was maybe two minutes? - Mm-hm. - Now, she's really strong. So you need to get the energies talking to each other. Thank you, honey. Okay. How about anybody else? Anybody else feeling just lousy? Okay. All right. Who hasn't... Somebody come up here. Come on up. Hi, Randy. Okay. I'm going to test you on spleen. You've been doing all the things too? - [Randy] Yeah. - Okay. Hold real strong. Well, you're not perfect. Okay. So you're going to make a three-finger notch, and tap right here. I'd pull you right into about there. Now, for me, that is a bit tender. That's a bit tender. But one of the things I was watching you, Melanie, just because you're sitting right there, is that it didn't matter how much you tapped or did anything. That wasn't getting strong on you. So you look better. Okay. Let's see if that did anything for you. Yes. All right. - Yay. - Your lymph system needed it. Thank you. Okay. Let's see what's happened to you. Now, we'll see. Well, let's see. Hold your arm real strong. I love your shoes. Okay. Hold. All right. So you too, you needed a little communication between them. Thank you. Let's see. What else would I do with Triple Warmer? Okay. Everybody, right now, feel the back of your calves and notice if you have any... Push your fingers into the back. Do you have any tenderness there? If you're unsure, I can come and push it. Okay. Anybody... Some do. Some do. Some do. If you have pain in the back of your calves, it's either always Triple Warmer or it's bladder, because there are some bladder muscles that go up your legs. All right. We're going to try an experiment. Everybody, just recognize how much pain you might have at the back of your legs, on your calves. Who doesn't have an ounce of it? Oh. Really, that's great. Well, Ellen, you work a lot on triple warmer. You do. You do. How about you? You don't have any? You want me to check it out? - [woman 5] Sure. - Come on up here. - Okay. Let me just see. Maybe you don't. You actually... I'm not sure that you do, because your energy looks pretty good back here. Nothing, huh? - What was that? - Yeah. Her energy looks pretty good there. Well, you guys are masters then. You're what we're all evolving towards. All right. But that is really, really, really great. Do you work triple warmer very much? - A lot. - A lot. Okay. Yeah. I got to the point that I didn't have any back there. Every now and then, I will. But I just instantly sedate Triple Warmer, which is to... Well, I'll show you how to do it. Okay? Just sedate Triple Warmer. Just take your hand to the side of the leg, right below the knee. Right there. Let's see. How far down is that? Yeah. Where your middle finger will reach. If you're putting your hand on the knee, your middle finger will reach there. Okay. Put several fingers around it, and you won't make a mistake. Your other hand above your elbow, in line with the fourth finger. You just sit that way and hold those points. - These are acupressure points. When you hold these two points, they're designed to help calm triple warmer. They help take excess energy out of it. So that's what you're doing. - Yes. I should say something else. This is what I did when I went into the room, when I'd gotten so hot, and Triple Warmer governs also body temperatures. So my temperature, I mean, I was just boiling. I just went and laid down, and held these and within three minutes I was normal. So these are great points to do. - She's never been normal before. This is a first. You heard it here. - Okay. You just hold it a little bit longer. Should we ask questions about... This is a good time, while we're holding. - Okay. So again, you've been asking great questions. Now, in this session, we've looked at how the meridians operate and how they relate to one another, and how they relate to the Earth. Then, we moved on to Triple Warmer and somewhat to the radiant circuits, which we'll have a whole session on the radiant circuits. But Triple Warmer and the immune system, and the fight or flight response, any questions about any of that? - Wait. First, before you do that, go to the other side. Okay. Now, move your hand down to the side of the baby toe. Put your other hand right there, in between the fourth and fifth fingers. Now, you're holding acupressure points that, right here, this is triple warmer and this is bladder you're hooking up. The first one was stomach and triple warmer, and these are Triple Warmer and bladder. - Again, the effect is to calm Triple Warmer. - Yes. - That's what these points are designed for. - Do you know, if I was to say that there was one emotion you could have to make Triple Warmer evolve, it's make it feel safe. If it feels safe, then all the stress goes away. Oh, the other side we didn't do. Sorry. The other baby toe and... So one of the things about any time you do those exercises or hold these points, triple warmer feels safe. Triple Warmer feels safe. - [woman 6] May I ask a question? - Yes. - It's actually in alignment with keeping Triple Warmer safe. Are there ever situations where strengthening triple warmer is actually more beneficial for someone than sedating? - Yes. Thank you for that great question. Yes. For instance, if you are going into anaphylactic shock or something like that, you want to strengthen Triple Warmer. You want to say, "You've got all the power now. Go for it." If you're having an asthma attack, strengthen Triple Warmer. I mean, what people give somebody who has an asthma attack, it's adrenaline. Well, Triple Warmer governs the adrenals. You can strengthen them, and it's so good. If somebody is so far out, so in such trouble, whether it's maybe they're very, very sick, well sometimes Triple Warmer thinks that things are so bad it's going to roll you out and you're going to die. But strengthen Triple Warmer then. If a person has gotten that bad, often it'll be fight suddenly will come up. I mean, they've just now gotten so overwhelmed that Triple Warmer is even letting go. If you ever have your adrenals collapse, oh my god, you want to go back and forth on strengthening, actually strengthening a little bit more if they're really collapsed, and then sedating. Because Triple Warmer has just lost all of its juice. So yeah. And a bumblebee sting, yeah. - But that was the less than 1%. Ninety-nine-plus percent of the time, Triple Warmer is overactive and it's really robbing you of vital resources. So almost always it's sedating it. - Yeah. It loves for you to sedate it, because it calms down. It doesn't have... It's like this poor little guy is holding up everything, holding up the world. I thought of something I wanted to say. Wait. Everybody, feel the back of your calves. Did it do anything? Yeah? - Yeah? - Who feels less pain in the back of your calves? - All right. Yay. - Okay. So for those of you out there, we hope you did the experiment as well, and more than half the group showed that they felt less pain in their calves. Next session will be about energy testing. We'll teach you the basics of how to energy test another person using the spleen meridian test, and we'll show you why we choose that test. Then, we'll also show you where you can self-test certain things, and there's other things you can't self-test. But we'll show you as much as we've been able to figure out about self-testing. So between now and the next session, we hope you'll continue to do your daily energy routine. Also, experiment with the Triple Warmer Smoothie, particularly when you're feeling stressed. - Yeah. - I mean, I'm sure that it doesn't happen for most of you, but some of us get some stresses that we feel in our lives. When that happens, just go ahead and do the Triple Warmer Smoothie. - Okay. Just lay across your eyes and come to your temples. Take a deep breath in through your nose and out through your mouth. Then, take a deep breath in to above your ears, down around behind your ears, down your neck, and hang on your shoulders. Take a deep breath in, drag your fingers across your shoulders, and land on your heart chakra. - So it's really simple. It's one that you can remember. It's portable. You can do it wherever you are. Nobody is going to really know what you're doing. Again, the map, it's just very simple. So it's one that we encourage you to experiment with. But first, we have the same treat that we've had after our first two sessions, which is that Titanya is going to lead us in Energy Medicine Dance.

LESSON 8 – Questions & Answers for Chapter 3
--------------------
- [Audience member] I'm wondering what's the relationship between Triple Warmer and the homolinear... - [Woman 1] Homolateral? - Homolateral. Because so, just as an example, I've been struggling with the homolateral thing and a little bit of depression and just not having the fight that I used to have to get up and get out there because part of it being exhausted and needing to rest. So... - Yes. - What's the relationship? - There is a huge relationship. If you're homolateral, Triple Warmer is involved. If Triple Warmer is overactive in your body, often you've got into homolateral, not every time, but you often do. And if you get out of homolateral, Triple Warmer gets a little boost, like, "Huh”, and relax a little bit. So there is a huge relationship between them. And… Okay. -  [Man 1] Okay. - We have one more. - Okay. - Thanks - [Audience member 2] First, an academic question and then more of a personal one. The academic one is, On the Flow ch... - A little closer. - Put it closer. - Closer to you. - Okay. On the Flow chart, it doesn't show how Central and Governing receive fuel. How does that happen? - Thank you. Central and Governing in the middle of your chart is... They are both meridians and they are radian circles. It's part of... I mean, we are evolving and it's moving back and forth between a regular pathway, a meridian pathway, and energies that will go anywhere in your whole body. So, how does it receive? It really receives energy if you're hooked up If you've got that microcosmic orbit going, Central and Governing keep getting fueled, and your spine will stay straight throughout all your life if you keep that up. So you want to... It's just a really, really important one. - Here's the other question. We've talked a lot about physical stress and how to calm Triple Warmer and bolster spleen. What would you do for the stress of an emotional shock? - Okay. It's going to depend. If it's a huge emotional shock, that's Triple Warmer again. But there are emotional shocks that hit both spleen and stomach very strong. Stomach is a worrier, and stomach carries stress of a different kind but it's the worrier, and spleen... Well, stomach and spleen both... Okay, they sit opposite the two meridians on fire. You know, we're not talking so much about elements in here, but spleen and stomach sit together, and Circulation, Sex and Triple Warmer sit together, and... What was your question? - How to recover from an emotional shock. - Oh. Okay. So these four are very involved in any kind of stress. But sometimes an emotional shock... Okay, say you get your heart broken. You're heartbroken. You're in love, and your heart's been broken. Sedate stomach meridian, and it will calm your whole area. Stomach goes right through the heart area, and it just... If you're one of those people who get a heartache... Anybody got heartache? I see one head. Two. Yes. Well, it really lifts it up out of here. It is amazing how it will lift. And stomach is involved in a lot of different kinds of stresses usually not that... Unless you're an earth element who worries every moment of your day, it's going to be Triple Warmer. But if you're that earth element that worries all the time, then it might be stomach for you. The question was: "Well, what happens to Triple Warmer when you maybe have an organ removed or you're going into surgery?" First of all, your body doesn't know you aren't being attacked, even if it's going to save your life, your body doesn't know that. And Triple Warmer freaks out. I used to... Especially when I had my practice, I used to hear so often that somebody, because it was a small town, you knew when things were happening to everybody. And you know, the doctor says, "Oh, the operation was a tremendous success, but the patient died." He was like... The patient died because Triple Warmer has gone nuts and pulled energy away from every other meridian, and they don't have the energy to save your life now. So my own hit is that before anybody goes into a hospital for any kind of operation, somebody should balance all their energies, but make sure Triple Warmer is really, really calm and you're not in homolateral to go into it, because you're going to come out of it homolateral, but you want your energies just really strong inside there. - [Audience member 3] Can you just tell us really quick about points, because you keep talking about points, and I'm really new to this. Are they all over the body, are they in certain places, and why are they where they are? - Thank you. Well, there are many different kinds of points. There are neural lymphatic points that we've talked about that you massage or tap to help the lymph system move the toxins. There are acupressure points, often called acupuncture points, but I really like holding them. I actually think that they work but not every time, but very, very often they will work at least as well as acupuncture to hold the points. That's why you guys were able to take your pain away. - So, you mean like holding them with your fingers... - Holding them with your fingers. - …Instead of putting needles into the points? - Holding them with your fingers. Yes. And... Let's see... What else? And there are... Is that it? Is that the point? - The places on the meridian that have got four times as much energy? - Yes. Thank you. You should talk about that, you scientist, you. But I'm trying to… is that points, yes, points are energy vortexes, and they have... To me, when I see the points, I see light there. They light up for me and they are amazing. I think most people who really get into energy medicine, and it might take a long time, you know? It's just your body learns them well. And well, if you don't see them, you might feel them. You just knew exactly where to go. And... - So what we're really trying to get you to understand is that the energy system can be moved, can be worked with, in part, by understanding that on the surface of the skin are these points. And some of them are acupuncture points that are on the meridians, and they affect the meridians directly. Others are neural-lymphatic points which are the ones that affect the lymph system. There is other points as well, but those are the two that we've really emphasized the most. And then as you get more sophisticated, you realize that, "Oh, these points" that are so convenient to think of as points, that you just find on the map of the body, that they're not really points, at all. Because they're really energy. They're really energy and so an acupuncture point. You might think of Triple Warmer point being right here, Triple Warmer three through point Triple Warmer meridian, but it actually is a bit of energy that sits on that meridian, that's always in that position in that meridian, except it moves, it can move a little bit, depending on what's happening. So that's why if we send someone to an acupuncturist if we make you a referral, we want to send them to an acupuncturist that doesn't just go by the acupuncture maps, but somebody that can really attune themselves to the energies, so that they can go to exactly where that energy is: the locus of that energy. It may be exactly where the point is on the chart, but maybe a little bit different. But that's more advanced than we really want you to get into with this class. For this class, it's a good enough metaphor to think of the points as points. - Oh, I just want to say one thing. This was many years ago. I went to an acupuncturist, I got the best acupuncturist I had ever been to in my life, and it was because he was blind. And he said that in Japan, if you're blind, you get free... - It's one of the routing to acupuncture. - Yes. - People who are blind... - They get free tuition into Acupuncture school. And they are really the best because they have to feel it and know it, and they can't... You know they can't see it, they can't do anything, and they got to feel it. And so, he was just so right on. It was just an amazing thing. And I think that happens a lot to people who get into this work. You start feeling and knowing where things are, and nobody has to... And you'll know after a time, nobody has to energy-test you. You knew. You know? You know because you learned the language.

LESSON 9 – Energy Dance to Relieve Stress & Anxiety
--------------------
Welcome back. Let's calm Triple Warmer and bring out some energy for spleen, and just help balance the two. All right. Just ground your feet into the earth, and we're going to bring up our hands to our heart chakra and keep going up into the heavens. And just connecting it in with the heavens and all the energies around you and your life right now. And as we come down, we're going to wrap our hands around our spleen, and wrap our hands around our elbow, which balances Triple Warmer and spleen. And just rock, and breathe, in through the nose, and out through the mouth. ♪ [music] ♪ And we're going to bring up your hands up into your... Underneath your armpits. And we're just going to rock. Whenever you rock, it's like your mother rocking you as a baby and also calms Triple Warmer. And breathe. ♪ [music] ♪ And now we're going to open it up. ♪ [music] ♪ We're going to our hands over our eyes. Breathe in. And as you breathe out, take it to the temples, and then breathe out. Breathe in, come up around your ears, and come down on your shoulders. Just rock here. And come back into your heart. Let's take it the other way. So we're going to take one hand, Triple Warmer around your ears, down your arms, off the fourth finger and give it a little tweak. And then, your other hands on the temple, around your ears, down your arms and give it a little tweak. Just open it up, and just feel this gratitude in your life, and you're just going to come back to wrapping around the spleen, wrapping it around your elbow. And just think of all the things in your life that you are blessed with. And we're just going to bring it into our heart, bring it up to the heavens and down to the earth, and let go, bringing heaven and earth into the center of your being. And, again, the other way, and out. Again. ♪ [music] ♪ One more time. And roll over, and let's bring it up, spleen, big toe, inside of the legs, up the rib cage, and down. Tap. Give yourself a little hug. Thank you.

LESSON 10 – How to Use Energy Tests to Make Healthy Choices
--------------------
♪ [music] ♪ - [Donna] Welcome back and welcome to all of you, too. This is going to be a wonderful session today. We're going to teach you how to energy test and... well, you'll see the benefits. You'll be able to energy test food and vitamins, maybe jewelry, eyeglasses. We're going to go through all of that. But first, we're going to do what we've done at the beginning of each class. We're going to do the daily energy routine, so it can build a habit in you and you start feeling better, and better, and better, and better and you also start to find out which ones really affect you more, so that it becomes like a language for you. You start understanding what even your body is saying to you. So everybody, on your feet. - [David] And again, take a moment to tune inside and take stock of how you're feeling physically, how you're feeling in your emotions. Just notice and then we'll compare it in a couple of minutes. - Okay, so first, you're going to take your right hand and put it over your left shoulder, push your fingers in hard and drag them across to the opposite hip, and then the other side, and just... And again. And again. One more time. And then the four thumps. Now to K27. And now thump your thymus. And now thump your spleen points. And notice if any of them at all hurt or is sensitive. Okay. And now... - Cross crawl. - …We're going to do a cross crawl. Hit the opposite knee or just cross your body over. - Short Wayne Cook. - Okay, we're going to do a short Wayne Cook today. You know the longer one where you sit down, but we're going to do it this way. You'll put your left hand out in front of you, turn it backwards, take your right hand out in front, clasp your fingers and up underneath. And now take a deep breath in through your nose and out through your mouth. - And if you want to cross your ankles, you can do that as well. Really stretch on the in breath. Stretch out. - One more time. Then release your hands and put your fingertips together and come down to your third eye and do the same breathing. Now, as you release your fingers, put them right into the middle of your forehead. Press in hard, pull all the way to your temples and let them go. Now, you can sit down as we continue, if you want. And now, we're going to continue on with the crown pull. You're going to come up to the hairline, push in hard, and pull to the sides. And then go over the whole top of your head, push in hard, and pull apart just about an inch on each side, and keep on going across the top of your head. And across the back of your head. And then put your hands on your neck and push in and pull to the sides. You have so many meridians on your neck and on the back side, you are separating that energy and it's really good for your meridians. And then hang on your shoulders, take a deep breath in, push your fingers into your shoulders, drag them across the top, and land on your heart chakra. Okay? Now, we've got neurolymphatic reflexes. Neurolymphatic reflexes, we're just going to choose three or four a day. Okay? So you can choose any that are on your diagram. So we're going to come right here to the armpits, so I always tend to do that one because it does touch into every one of your neurolymphatic reflexes. And if you feel sensitive about life right now, these are really good for you and they tend to hurt if you are. We're going to go to the lung and gall bladder points right in between the ribs. And just all the way down and now your full sternum just... And really, massage in with some pressure and notice if you have any tenderness there. If you have tenderness, that is simply your body talking that you need this work. Okay, we're going to do one more. And this, we're going to come up underneath our rib cage and massage underneath the rib cage. Push up underneath. Okay. Now this is zip up and hook up, right? All right. Now if you've got an affirmation, think of your affirmation and just zip it up all the way in and remember it goes right into your chakras beneath. And as it was suggested to me yesterday, go ahead and go up your gall or your governing meridian which is at the tail bone all the way up the spine and think it up to the place that you can reach. And then go up over the head, over the nose, to the top lip, and then hook yourself up. Now you are all set. We're learning and literally, that helps you learn. Doing the daily energy routine really clears your mind, clears your energy, so you can take in new information. So... - We take a moment and tune in again and see if there's any changes from where you were a couple of minutes ago. Who could feel something different? - All right. - Good, good. - All right, anything you want to say or we just know it was different? Oh, yeah. - [Woman] I feel more alive. - All right. - More alive. More alive. - Yes. That is such a good thing to do at that 3:00 in the afternoon slump. It is so good. Yes, what was yours? - [Woman] Much more present. - Much more present. Yeah, it's really good and it will only get better for you the more you do it. Okay, so today, we're going to learn about energy testing and we're going to teach it in two ways. And first, as a sort of general indicator test, which means you can test almost anything, but then when it comes down to something so personal as your food, or your vitamins, or even things that you might put on like your glasses or your jewelry, we're going to test with spleen meridian. Okay? So far, I've been mostly showing the general indicator test because it's a great thing to test with for most things. But when it comes to things that are very personal for you, I think it is far preferable to test with the spleen test because it tests whether food will metabolize in you and whether yes... Or vitamins will metabolize. It is not... Well, I'm going to ask... Angela, you come up here. I'm going to show it while I do this. Okay. Now, here is the general indicator test. So we're going to test vitamins and I'm going to show you the difference between if you test with a general indicator test many, many people use which is a good sort of general test, but it won't tell you whether you're going to metabolize it or not. Okay? So even if it's good for you, if you can't metabolize it, so what? Right, okay. So here's what we're going to do. - If you can't metabolize it, it really becomes a toxin for you. It becomes something your body has to get rid of. - Okay. Okay, so now we're going to test you on vitamin C. Now, I'm going to put that in your hand and you hold your arm real strong. Oh, that's very, very strong. I'm going to put two in your hand and see if that... Still strong. Let's see. And three is too many. - [Angela] Too much. - Okay, so her body says she needs two. She needs two. But turn this way and I put one in your hand and I'm going to test it against spleen. Hold. But she will not metabolize anything, okay? You might need something, your body might really crave it, but if you have a system that isn't breaking it down and metabolizing it, it's just another poison. So it's really important to get it, and probably for you, you had a digestive upset yesterday and so vitamin C is an acid and that's probably why. So even though her body wants vitamin C, she can't break it down. No good. Not right now. All right. - And also these are 1,000 milligrams. It might be that 500 milligrams would work better for you... - I don't care if this happens, let me just see. - ... And it might be the time of day. - Let's see. That's approximately 500. I emptied a capsule and now let's see. Oh, she can take 500. So you can find out how much you need. - Okay. - Okay, you can have it. - Thank you. - You're welcome. - I'll take it. - Okay. Okay. Now, I want to teach you all how to energy test on spleen, okay? Before I do, does anybody have a confusion about that or if you have a question about that? Does everybody understand why I'll be testing vitamin C? Okay, so somebody who has... Have you ever been tested on anything? Come on up here. Okay, hi. - [Rachael] Hello. - Tell us your name. - Rachael. - Rachael. Okay, Rachael, we're going to learn how to test our spleen meridian. So hold your arm straight down the side of your body like this and you pull the arm in as I pull it out. Okay? - So there's going to be three possibilities. One possibility is that it's going to stay strong like steel. Another is that it will be very weak and just move out easily. A third is that it will pull out a little bit and then bounce back. That also counts as strong. And there are several things to remember when you're doing an energy test on spleen meridian. Remember that each of the 14 meridians has its own energy test. This is the one for spleen, extremely valuable one to use. And can I use this arm? - Mm-hmm. - Okay. So one thing that... One beginner's mistake is to jump the gun, okay? So you tell... Like Donna asked her to keep her arm next to her body, so you give the person a signal that you're about to begin. Another is that you want to have your hand open, you don't want to pull around the arm or block the energy, so you want to do that. A third is that even though you can pull for a long time, what you really want to just do is pull for between one and two seconds. That's how fast you will know. So it's not like a long pull. It's like that is enough to know. Like Donna was saying, that you know that the wall is strong. You don't have to push and push against it. You just kind of touch it and you know that it's strong. And within that one and a half seconds, you actually start off slow and increase the pressure so that you're not, again, jumping the gun. So those are all some of the basics that you want to remember. Another is that it's not a test of strength, okay? It's not like you're going to... You're not going to beat the person. This is a case where they're simply finding out how their arm stays, whether it's staying strong or whether it moves. Sometimes guys, in particular, really do treat it like a test to strength and they'll put all their other muscles into it and you'll see them squirming and so you just stay calm, centered, and see whether... And pull out. So those are... Another one is to make sure the elbow stays straight and the elbow bends... - And the fingers are open. - And the fingers are open. So now Donna is going to demonstrate it. - Okay, one more time. Here we go. So you're going to put your arms straight down your body, like that, you hold your arm tight, and I'm going to pull it out. You're fairly strong, but not as strong as we want you to be. - Okay. - So you're going to stay here while everybody else is going to test this too and then we'll go through the things that you can do to strengthen yourself. Okay? - Okay. So if you're out there watching this with somebody, you can do this together just as Donna has shown you. If you don't have a partner, just observe and then grab somebody when they're available and you can replay this part of the video and go through it again, so you'll be able to really get a sense of what it feels like. - Okay, everybody on your feet. And you're going to turn to the person right next door to you, okay? And if you're... Yes, everybody find a partner. Okay, so does everyone have a partner? - [Woman] Yes. - Yes? And I hope that you're able to do this in your home as well and if you do not, then I hope you can come back to this at another time and learn it that way. Okay? Here you go. So you're going to turn the person sideways, decide between the two of you who's going to test first. Make sure that the arm you are testing has not been injured in any way. If it has, you want to move to the other arm. Okay? All right, so you're going to put your hand just slightly above the wrist and keep your hand open, don't clasp it around the wrist, and just pull. Now, here's something interesting. When I was pulling her out, I noticed that her arm went forward a little bit. You know, it's like you just instinctually try to pull against somebody. But I'm not going to get an accurate test unless she keeps her arm completely straight. Okay? Okay, now hold. Okay, here we go. Hold. “Boing”. Okay. Why don't... Before we correct them, do it with the other person. Switch partners. Okay, so now that you've tested your other partner, we're going to correct the weaknesses and see if we can get our bodies shifted into a stronger position in spleen meridian. Okay? Because it's always good to strengthen spleen. So remembering from the last class how spleen sits opposite Triple Warmer on the meridian wheel, and so Triple Warmer... If you're stressed at all, Triple Warmer is taking energy from that meridian, so it always behooves all of us to get stronger and stronger on spleen and your body will be able to metabolize better. It will be able to adapt to things that you wouldn't have imagined and as your body gets stronger, allergies tend to go away. Okay. So, all right. Who is weak? Who is weak? All right, here's what we're going to do. We're all going to do this together. We're all going to do this together even if you were strong. We're going to see what happens to your energy. Okay? So the very first thing we're going to do is we're going to make a three finger notch and just tap on spleen. I'm going to have you tap right there. Okay? It's just straight down from your nipple. And breathe and notice if it hurts or it's tender at all. Okay. Now, retest and see if they're weak or if they're strong and I will explain all of this afterwards. Hold your arm real strong. Oh, you got stronger. You did, you did. You know what you were just tapping are spleen neurolymphatic reflexes and it's the lymph system in spleen meridian. Who got strong here? You got strong, you got stronger, stronger. You got strong, you got stronger, but not strong enough. Okay. And did anybody get weaker? Did anybody stay the same? And you guys were weak to begin with. - [Man] I was strong. - You were strong and you got weak? - No. - Oh, you stayed the same. Okay. - [Woman] Stayed the same. - Stayed the same. Okay. Spleen points, these points, if there is not enough energy on spleen meridian to begin with, because Triple Warmer has been pulling it, then you've got to get some energy on to the spleen to begin with. So we're going to just assume that everybody here and everybody there has some stress in your life. If you have some stress in your life, we're going to remove it. Okay? You're going to rub your hands together and shake it off. And put your hands sideways, your fingers sideways over your eyes. Now take a deep breath in through your nose and as you let your breath out, drag your fingers to your temples. Now, take one deep breath here. Now, another deep breath in as you take your fingers above your ears. Let your breath out as it goes down, then hang on your shoulders. Now take a deep breath in through your nose and as you let your breath out, drag it across your shoulders and land on your heart chakra. Now, test everybody. And what you just did, I will remind you, is you have calmed Triple Warmer down, so it gets the sense that you're safe. You're safe, there is no fight, flight, or freeze response that is needed in this body. You're safe, so it can release energy to other meridians. Okay? So let's see what happened to you. Oh, you were... Oh, let's see. Hold your arm real strong. - [Woman] Stronger than before. - All right, all right. All right, is everybody tested? How's everybody? - [Woman] Much stronger. - [Man] Much stronger. - But you're much stronger, but you're not strong all the way? - No, much stronger. - But you're much, but not all the way? - All the way. - Oh, all the way. Okay, right. All the way, all right. Now, we're going to all do something together because it's good for you. After you've released from Triple Warmer, you want spleen to start getting stronger and stronger on its own, building a habit. Okay? So you're going to rub your hands together and shake them off. Now, we're going to flush spleen meridian, okay? So you're going to start on this side of your rib cage, take a deep breath in, and travel up to your armpits, go in front of your hip bones, down the inside of your legs, and off the big toe. Now forward from the big toe, go up the inside of the legs, flare out, and then up the side of the rib cage and down to the bottom of the rib cage. And two more times, from the inside of the feet and legs, and go up the side and down and shake your hands off every now and then. And then travel up one more time. Ta-dah. Now what I can promise you is that everybody here would be like steel now if you wanted to test. I think everybody would be like steel. We know you are. - Well, go ahead and test that. - Okay, go ahead. Yeah. - And back home, go ahead and test that. - See that everyone is really strong because if you're not like steel, we want to do something about it. Okay. Hold. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay. - Just a reminder, we're using the words spleen and spleen meridian kind of interchangeably, but we're talking about the meridian not the organ. We're testing the meridian, not testing the organ. - However, the meridian travels through the organ and governs the organ, so there is... - So it’ll give you information about the organ, but just have in your mind that you're testing the pathway that moves through the organ, that feeds that organ, that also feeds the... - Yes, the pancreas, yes. Spleen and Triple Warmer govern things like blood sugar imbalances and diabetes and things like that, so... - So that's a very brief introduction to energy testing and I think you'll find energy testing a very valuable tool. It is something that you can certainly use for figuring out whether the food that you're ingesting is in harmony with your body and with what your body needs. You know, there's a diet that is part of our culture that people are always trying to figure out what's right for me, what is going to really feed me well, nourish me, and the truth is that no diet book can tell you that. The truth is that your energies are unique to you and the foods that are going to really be great for you are unique to you. So having a technique like energy testing can do a great deal because let's face it, the energies in your body are based in part on the energies of the food that you eat. So you want to really be nourishing your energies with food that is energetically aligned with your body. So the foods that are energetically aligned with your body are going to be simply better for you than foods that aren't and this is the way to find that out. And it goes beyond food, it goes beyond vitamins. Anything that is close up to your body, has an energy to it. Now, we always move into situations that are energetically off for us and we're designed to bounce right back, but some things are up against us all the time like shoes, for instance. I used to never go shoe shopping without dragging Donna along and it really does make a difference because she can wear the shoes, walk around the store, and it still feels fine, but a mile later, it's not going to feel fine and you can find that out with an energy test right away. Is this shoe energetically aligned with my body or is it in some way cutting off my energies? So I don't bring Donna along anymore because I've got more balls and I just tell the shoes salesman, "I'm going to teach you something. Would you energy test me?” And I show them how to do it and they are often amused and sometimes they take a class. And it's not just shoes. Eyeglasses, for instance, the frames are energetically going to have a different effect on you, one frame from the next. So if you have someone test that because you're wearing that all the time. Another is, well, when we go to buy a bed or a mattress, Donna lies down on it and she stays there for about three minutes and then I energy test her, do the spleen test to see if she's assimilating the energies and it is amazing. She gets stronger and stronger as the beds get more and more expensive. - That is true. - It's true and I don't... Okay, I've made a point to not show her the prices list. "So close your eyes, come over to this one." Another thing is jewelry. People have known for thousands and thousands of years that jewelry can really make their energies shine, but jewelry can also drag your energy down. And so there's a whole science and understanding of crystals and different kinds of metals and how they affect the energies, but again, it's unique. It's unique to you, it's unique to how your body is going to receive that particular metal, that particular crystal, that particular substance. So Donna is going to show us a little bit about how to test jewelry. - Yes, I'm going to test, but I'm going to first say that sometimes a piece of jewelry will be wonderful for you and then it doesn't keep feeling good. Has everybody had that experience of just you got to get something off of you? Well, it could be a couple of things. It could be that the jewelry itself has got... It needs to be cleaned. It could be simply that. And one of the best ways I know is to put jewelry out in dewy grass. That's my favorite way. By morning, that jewelry is so cleansed and it's so good. But there's something else. I'm going to tell you a little story. Many, many years ago, I wore, on my ring finger, on the wedding finger, a ring that had an amethyst in it and it was when I wasn't married. And I would go a little berserk and I didn't know it was the ring. And pretty soon, I was pulling it off, but I was a little weird and then I got… I was going through a divorce, you know, divorce is hard on you so that was... I was really affected by that amethyst. Later, I was teaching a class and I talked to all... What are they? Gemologists, people who gem rocks and stones and the whole class was that. And they said, "Oh, well, of course." You know, that amethyst used to be given to people when they were crazy... No, they knew never to give an amethyst to somebody who was crazy or had real mental problems. So I figured I was just... My stress of divorce was so that really made me nuts and so as time went on, the amethyst was fine for me. So you might change over time, but I'd like to show somebody, Merkey, you have a really nice piece of jewelry on. You want to come up here with that? And we'll see how that tests on you. Oh, I should have said I do want Merkey, but does anybody got a piece of jewelry they wonder about? You do, too. Okay, well, you get ready to come up here after this. Okay, so Merkey, let's... - [Merkey] Take it off? - Yeah, take it off. Now, that hits right... The bottom of this hits right at the top of her thymus. So I'm going to just see. First, I'm going to... You can test this in many ways, by the way. I'm going to test right on her thymus. And now put this piece of jewelry on, Merkey. That's just beautiful. Is that a moon man or what is that? - It's the color of an angel. - Oh, all right. All right. Okay, a Buddha angel. So I'm just going to touch it and touch her. - Oh, my gosh Donna. - It's so good on her. - And I think it's the pearls because they're calming. - It's the pearls. Oh, all right. Pearls are calming. But this is right... Oh, well, the pearls are there too. Okay, thank you, Merkey. Okay, Somebody else was... Wait, I just said... Oh, here you are. Come here. So you're wondering about that. It's very beautiful. - [Woman] Well, I got this at a chakra shop because I knew which one of my chakras was weak and this is what they had recommended to strengthen it. - Okay. I'm going to show you something interesting about it. - Do I need to take off all other jewelry to control? - No, no. No, you don't. Okay, hold. Now, this is weak. I'm going to check your second chakra. It's weak. I'm going to test your third eye. You've got a little bit of that color in all of those three. Now, put it on and we'll see what it does. - Thank you. - Okay. Now, we're going to test the same way that we tested Merkey and it's very strong. That's very strong, and it's very strong. They gave you the right one, they sold you the right one. Okay, thank you. Okay, how about... Oh, I want to... Something occurs to me that you might find interesting. Say you want to test some food when you're in a restaurant, but don't know if the food is going to be good for you. Now, especially this works really well if you know the restaurant food and sort of the vibration of the foods that they cook, but... And Tanya does this a lot. But here's what you do. You're going to test it against small intestine, okay? So once the food comes to you and you say, "Mm-hmm," just put your hand within about an inch of the food. Make sure it's in the auric field of the food and then under the table, nobody knows you're doing this, you're going to pick up your foot, your leg like this. I'm bending my knee at about... What kind of angle is that? - A 45-degree angle. - A 45-degree angle. I'm going to push down. If it flattens like that, it's not good for you. Okay? It's not good for you. If it stays really strong, that's going to be good food for you. Okay? - So, if it flattens, that means I have to eat it, and we pay dinner. - Okay, the reason why this works... First of all, this energy test is on small intestine meridian and small intestine decides whether the food you eat is going to become you or not or whether it's not so good for you. It's the decider. And so this tests small intestine and that might seem strange that that tests small intestine, but muscles all over your body are governed by different meridians and these muscles on the top of your legs here are small intestine. The energy from the small intestine literally goes through this muscle. Okay? So that's the muscle you test. - Okay. So you can test foods, you can test eye glasses, you can test shoes, you can test mattresses, you can test anything that is really going to be part of your life. Now, there's one thing we ask you not to test and that is medication. And there are a variety of reasons why it would not be appropriate to use energy testing at the level that we're teaching it here for testing medication. One of them is very interesting besides the fact that the decision to prescribe a medication is a very complex one that your doctor has figured out, is that you may, for instance, have a kidney problem and the medication really helps with that, but it also causes some side effects and the side effects are much less prominent and less important than the fact that you're getting help with your kidney. But the energy test is going to pick up the side effects, they're going to pick up the energy imbalance. And so it would be really not to your benefit to just not take the medication when it's going to really be helping you. What we do with energy medicine is we figure out what the side effects are and then we work with those, much the way you would work with an allergy, which is beyond what we're teaching right now. But basically, just to give an idea, is that you put the medication into the energy field, into your field and you figure out which meridians use their energy and you strengthen those meridians. So it trains the body to be able to tolerate the medication. But that's way beyond where we are now and also many medications, there's very averse effects to just cut them out. So please, do not use this with medications. Now very sophisticated energy testers can do it with medications. In fact, in Ashland, Oregon, where we lived for so long, there were many doctors that would consult with Donna when there was a tough call regarding medication. And in fact, she was asked to be in the operating room several times by the anesthesiologist where there was a very delicate case and she would test to find out the right anesthesia and the right amount of the anesthesia. So it's not that this can't be used in conjunction with Western pharmacology, but it's not at the level that we're teaching it right now. Okay? So the other thing I want to talk about is, well, how accurate is this? How reliable is this? Can we really trust energy testing? And the truth is it is a technique that's got a scientific basis having to do with the way that the energies move through the muscle that you're testing and it's also got an art part to it and you get better as you practice it. The art part is because there are many things that can influence an energy test. So your mind can influence an energy test. You may really be testing a food that you really want, you're drooling over this food. Your energy is going to go, "Yay, yay, "and it may not... Like Donna has never in almost 40 years, she's never tested weak on a dairy comb. Never. Okay. So maybe that's always good for her, but it's kind of suspect. So the research is very interesting is that there are studies that really confirm the reliability of energy tests and there are studies that say, "No, it's not reliable." We'll have, for instance, take three practitioners, have them test the same person, they get different results whereas other tests, one of my favorites is that they didn't even use humans pressing down, they used a mechanical device, a machine, to press down and they found that when the person said something they believed to be true that would keep their energy strong. It took a lot more pressure to move the arm than if they said something that they believed was not true. So let me just demonstrate that real quickly how that works. Will somebody come up here? Is there anybody? Jill, come on. So I'm going to test you for your baseline, okay? Press up. Okay, Now, say, "My name is Jill." - [Jill] My name is Jill - My name is Susan. - My name is Tabitha. - Okay. Okay. So that's... So my name is Jill. - My name is Jill. - My name is Tabitha. - My name is Tabitha. - Okay, so it's just... You weren't trying to do it differently. It's just the energy shifted when you said something you didn't believe was true. Okay, so thank you. And what was interesting is that that would have happened if it had a human tester or if it had a mechanical tester is what one of the really interesting study showed. So when there's a contradiction in studies, you have to look deeper and when you look deeper, what you find is that there are so many variables in an energy test that part of what we do is we really try to teach people to accommodate for those variables. So one of the ways to do it is to get your mind out of the way. These are ways to improve the accuracy of an energy test so that you are really in a beginner's mind space, that you're really in a curiosity. What is going to happen here, rather than you hope for a particular outcome or you know what's going to happen. So beginner's mind is an important way. Another thing to make an energy test more accurate is there has to be a good attunement between the person being tested and the person doing the test. And a simple way to do that that does both, gets the mind out of the way and attunes you is if you will both take a breath at the same time and then do the test. So let's just demonstrate that. All right, take a breath, and then we do the test. So that does two things. Another thing that sometimes gets in the way is that if you look directly in the eyes of the person being tested, what you're testing sometimes is the relationship or the relationship in that moment, rather than what you think you're testing. So the person being tested can look you in the eye, but you're looking a little bit away when you're testing the person. Another thing that is useful for getting more accurate energy tests is that there are some points that you can hold on the body that actually have the effect of neutralizing your expectations and those points, they're actually where the traditional Chinese headache points are. They're right in the back of the head, right here. Donna calls them the electric points and just holding those points and then doing the test, or I can hold my own points and have her hold her points and do the test. So those are a number of ways that you can make the test more accurate, but you really have to practice this to begin to feel confident about it. It's not something that you just get it from seeing it done and then go out and do it. And also, you want to be asking about... You want to be asking questions that are about the energy that's flowing through the body, asking questions about the energy flowing through the body. So you don't use it as a parlor trip, you don't use it to say, "Okay, should I invest in Apple Corporation." - Oh, yes, I should. - Okay. You're not asking that level of question with it. You may get an answer, but the answer is going to be on the person's beliefs. You often pick up on the person's unconscious beliefs when you're not really focused. But what you're asking is basically, is the energy flowing through the muscle that you're testing? Is the energy flowing through the muscle or is something blocking the energy from flowing through the muscle? Are the shoes blocking the energy? The general indicator test will show you that they're blocking energy anywhere's and then the specific test like spleen tests are showing you for metabolism for the things having to do with spleen meridian. So the next question that comes up is can I self test? And this is a very interesting question because there are some things you can do. - For everybody back home, I've demonstrated already how to energy test vitamins and how much you might need. To just repeat so that it really goes in. Start with one vitamin, start with one and energy test it. And then start with two and see if it still stays strong and then three or four. Suddenly, it will go weak on you and that simply means it's too many. Now, I'm going to show you how to test yourself. Okay? So here, I've got one vitamin C in my hand and what I'm going to do, is I'm going to think of myself as a pendulum, that I am the pendulum, and I'm going to take one vitamin C and I'm going to put it right here at my solar plexus and my hand, my other hand over, I'm going to pull my elbows together and I'm going to take a deep breath in in a moment and when I do, and when I release, I'm going to let go all thoughts. I have no feeling about whether this is going to be good for me or not. So I'm going to go... And what will happen is your body will either fall toward it or fall away. If you fall toward it, you need it. Okay? So that was one, so I'm going to see if two does the same thing. I'm going to go... No, two is too many. I'm falling backwards. You've got to do this for yourself to believe it and to know that it really works. But it really does and I am somebody who... It was critical that I do this correctly and I don't trick myself in any way because when I was so allergic, I really needed to know that I couldn't trick it. So if you can practice this a while, because it's a bit of an art as well as I believe science, but you can get really good at it, really, really good at it. - Now, for beginning, we suggest that you start with testing with a partner because it's easier to control some of the variables. It's easier to get your mind out of the way if the partner is reminding you to get the mind out of the way. But as you go on, for Donna, it's become so natural to do the pendulum test that... - Oh, I'll tell you how natural it is. I mean, I go grocery shopping and I'm going down the aisle and I find myself going like this without even... I'm not even trying. It's like I'm going forward and backwards because my body has gotten so sensitive to that test. - And that's even when she's sober. - So, yeah. - But in the early days for her, when it was so critical because of her multiple sclerosis, to be sure that she was getting accurate tests, she did it differently. - Actually, this was for the allergies more because I didn't have the strength in my arms to do it during multiple sclerosis. But when I was getting rid of my allergies, I got a barbell and I had it on my dresser. And if say I was going to test this food or this vitamin, if it was strong, I could pick that arm right up. If it wasn't, I couldn't pick up the arm. And you know you aren't fooling, you know, a barbell. - It's a more objective test. So what she would do is she would... You have to find a weight that where there is the differential that she can lift it if she's strong and she can't lift it when she goes weak. But you will find that weight and she used to go to barbell stores and kind of try and figure it out. But there's a new technological innovation called the gallon water jug, so you can just fill up the amount that you view the right weight so that you can have that differential. So that's a really good way to begin to learn energy self testing. - Okay. - Okay. - I would like us all, because it looks to me like all you out here in my audience and maybe you at home also could use this. I'm going to... Maybe I'll take one person up. Tanya, come here. Yeah. This is my wonderful daughter, Tanya. I'm going to... Come here, Tanya. Okay, so what I'm going to do is I'm going to test her diaphragm, okay? And hold your arm real strong, Tanya. Now I'm just going to go up like that and I didn't hurt you, though, but you can see the diaphragm... I mean, you've been sitting around much of this day and the diaphragm is meant to open and close like a bellows and when it does, it pumps oxygen to every part of your body. So it's really, really good for you. So here's what you do. You can stand or you can even... Yeah, stand up. And here's what we're going to do. We're going for one hand over our solar plexus, it's right below the diaphragm, and the other hand on top of it, and we're going take a deep breath in. Hold your breath and push your body against your hands. And then let go out of your mouth. And again. And let go. Now one more time. Now before you finish, put your hands on your waist and just pull it forward a few times. That gets your belt flow. Thank you and I'm going to test Tanya. I'm going to go, "Whoop, whoop," and see. Yes. That's really good and I'm going to tell you why that's good. It's good to do that every day because every time you open the diaphragm, it really affects all of the valves and things in your body and so if you... I wish I'd have shown somebody... Is there anybody here who didn't do that exercise? I'll show you real fast. Anybody not? Everybody did it. - [Dondi] I didn't do it. - Oh, come here, Dondi. - Your other daughter. - This is my other daughter. Okay, Dondi, okay. All right, so Dondi, I'm going to check and see. Okay, you're strong on it. - It's really painful. - Well, okay. Okay, I'm going to show something a little different that the diaphragm breath would do. But since you're strong on that, hold your hand right there, she's putting it right on the ileocecal valve, and you hold. Good. And not good, but I had to be able to show this. And this is the Houston valve. Okay. Now I'm going to show another thing. I'm going to... I'm just going to test up in here and I'm going to test here. Okay, everybody in your... You can do it in your seats. Put your hands over the ileocecal valve and the Houston valve and your palms just resting on your hip bones and that's where it is. Now take a deep breath in and push your fingers deep in and pull up. Drop it. One more time. And now just take down one time with your thumbs. Now, okay, let's test you there and test you there. Now, I'm going to... Where else? Where did we do? - Her heart. - [Woman] Heart, yes. Yes and yes. I mean, it makes all the different valves and things and openings open. Okay, what I did was the ileocecal valve sits between the small and large intestine and it often, in stress, it doesn't open and shut as you want just like the diaphragm. I mean, there is a real relationship because the diaphragm, if it's not opening and shutting as it should, it will often close off valves so that they're not really opening as well as you want. And so what I would suggest is before you even do that, do this first and then come to the diaphragm because then suddenly, all over your body, whatever was just sort of stuck and not opening as it should, opens. - Explain why it affected here and here. - Why did it affect both places? - Yeah. - It affected both places because that's precisely what happens. You like open a valve anywhere in the body, all the other valves respond. They all respond. Now, this isn't even a valve, but this is the opening on her crown chakra and it opens too and it... You feel the opening, Dondi? - Yes. - Okay. Okay. Thank you, honey. All right. All right, David. - Okay, so today, we have covered energy testing and we've learned that you can do a general indicator test or you can do the spleen test, and for ingesting things or seeing how things affect your body, the spleen test is a really effective way to do that. We've looked at how there is a technique that you can learn, that you can be practicing already and also that as you continue to use it that you develop more and more skill, more and more of the art part of it. We've learned a little bit that the research right now contradicts itself and so we have to look a little deeper into what's going on and how to do it well. And we've learned then that self testing is also possible and that it takes even more art. We've learned several of the ways that you can make an energy test more effective and we've also then gotten a little bonus on the valves and how to work with them and the diaphragm.

LESSON 11 – Questions & Answers for Chapter 4
--------------------
- [David] So, do you have questions about anything from this session? - [Woman 1] So, Donna talked about shopping and falling toward different foods in the grocery store, so maybe if I shop on Monday, will it still be the same result when I want to cook it on Wednesday? - [Donna] Oh my. That's quite a question, and nobody's ever asked me that before. But I will tell you that is an issue because you might change, and I've certainly had that problem. I scoop up so many things that I think my body needs, and it tests so strong that day, but boy, the next day, it may not want that at all and may not need it in my body. So I've learned to not grocery shop for a week. I grocery shop every couple of days, you know? - But also, there's many foods that will not vary, you know, that they're going to be good for you all the time. It's more unusual that there's something that is... You know, like if you test strong on cashews, and you eat a pound of cashews, you're probably not going to be wanting cashews... Your body's not going to be wanting cashews for a while, so it's the balances that we're talking about. And by the way, they also happen at different times of the day. Like Donna cannot do the great American breakfast of eggs in the morning, but she's fine with the eggs later on in the day. She's also much better with the eggs that are grass-fed, home-grown kinds, then kinds that have hormones in them. So you really learn what your body resonates with. - [Woman 2] Okay, so you were talking about energy testing for shoes, but at the beginning of this course, I also heard your story that you told about how you were wearing shoes, and how you used a spoon to help with the healing for that. So how do you know if it's the shoes themselves that you maybe aren't aligning with, or whether you just need to do the spoon exercise? - Well first of all, spooning the feet is always good for your feet because there are things that can throw you off and throw your polarities off. You will never do any harm to yourself if you want to spoon your feet. It's really good for you. - So bring your spoon to the shoe store. - Yes. - And then I have a follow-up question, which is so is it unique to that shoe, or is it the material, which means if there's material of that shoe that I test weak on, does that mean that I can't handle any shoe of that variety that has that same material? - Okay... - Usually not. Usually it's the way that the fit of the shoe is interacting with your foot, so that's what's most likely to cut off the energy. - How your foot is held. - Yes, how your foot is held. Sometimes, it'll be the material, but not usually. - So with jewelry then is it material? Like I can wear everything of a stone that I test strong for, whether it's on my neck or on my finger? - Yes. - Depending on the setting. - Usually. Let me just say, usually. I've known... Well, where we lived for many, many years and still feel like it's our home, Ashland, Oregon, there are many estate sales, and sometimes you'll get a piece of jewelry or something that... Oh, my gosh, it carries the energy of the person who wore it, and it can really do you in until you've cleaned that energy, so it just depends, but usually. There's another thing. I will find a stone... Say, everything there is the same stone. I'm just going to use a fluorite, because fluorite is really good for me, but often, there's only one that so energetically goes with my body and won't... None of the other fluorites will, and I can't explain it, except it's a different energy. It's a different energy, and I want it to resonate with me. - So I was thinking of the situation, say, your friend invites you over for dinner, and they make something, and it's... You know they put a lot of love into it, but when you energy test, it's just not right for you. Is there a technique you could use to sort of counteract any negative effects of eating that food while still showing your gratitude for it? - If you know that you've just got to make your hostess feel wonderful, then you want to tap spleen meridian before you ever eat it, and afterwards again, because it'll help you metabolize it. It's very interesting. I saw a program where somebody was using energy testing on television, and it was somebody who loved cooking, loved cooking so much and loved giving her gift of food to people, and it showed that... I mean she had... She used the cheapest foods, I mean, she didn't have any money for food, and yet, that food, everybody just did so great, and also they energy tested it, and it was really good for everybody. And so, I think if you pour love into your food, it is much, much better. I've got a long story that I'll make very short is that years ago, a man came to my class. I had a weekly class, and he came every week, but he came late, and he left early, and I didn't know why, and he never took place in the class. People were doing all sorts of work on each other, and he didn't, but one day I... The class had only one more week, and I grabbed him before he left the class to find out if he was getting anything out of the class, because he wasn't doing anything in the class. And his story basically was that he had had a very good job and a family, and long story short, he lost everything, and his family left as well, and he had to take a little tiny place behind a 7-Eleven Store, and so the only food he could eat were the packaged foods in a little tiny market, a 7-Eleven. And he knew it wasn't good for him, but he didn't have the money or the strength to go anywhere, and he didn't have a car. That's why he came late and left early. He always had to take the bus. And I said, "Okay, no problem. You've got no problem. Here's what you're going to do with that food. You're going to place it in front of you, and the first thing you're going to do is you're going to put a pyramid over that food, and just bless it. Really bless that food, and know that it's going to serve you well. And then, you're going to do a little Chakra clearing over it, as if this whole energy field, whatever isn't really good for you, you're going to move it on out, and then put that back in, and now know that “Wow, this is for sure." And he came back. We had a break between seeing each other for three months, and he came back. He'd gained about 15 pounds. He felt so good, and he took part in the class after that, and it was just, I mean, he knew what happened. - So hard as that might be for some of you to believe, that act actually did something for his body, for his metabolism, so that he was able to absorb that food. He was able to digest that food. And we're not really advocating getting all your meals at 7-Eleven. So be thinking about your questions from this session, and put them up on the Tribe, and get discussions going about it upon the Tribe. It's a great resource to have. - Now, we understand that a lot of you have signed up for this course because of pain, wanting to know ways to alleviate your pain, and we're going to address that in the next session. - So now we have the treat again of Titanya and energy medicine gas.

Week 5

====================

LESSON 13 – Energy Medicine Techniques to Eliminate Pain
--------------------
- [Donna] Welcome back, I'm so glad you're
here, and I want to remind you,
if you have any questions, just write them
down and get them to us,
because we love to answer your questions.
And I'm always aware as I'm teaching that
you're there. So welcome. And a welcome
to you, all of you guys.
You've been wonderful in this class and
I'm really happy to see you,
and I'm getting to know you all. I'm going
to teach this morning all about pain.
But first, we're going to do the daily
energy routine just so that it sinks in so
deep in you that it will be just like
second nature to do it every day.
- [David] So take a moment and tune in.
Just get a state of your body report.
Tune in so that you can compare it in a
couple of minutes with how it's changed.
Okay, open your eyes and stand up.
- Okay, so we're just going to do it to
ourselves this morning.
So you're going to reach across your
shoulder, really push in hard and pull it
across. You might even notice, if there is
a little less pain in your shoulders,
because you've been
pulling across your body.
Okay, now we're going to do the four
thumps, here on the cheekbones.
And then to K27.
Then thump your thymus.
And then bump your spleen points. And
again, notice if anything hurts,
that's just a clue your body is talking to
you to say, "Hey, I need a little
attention here." And then we're going to
do a cross crawl.
Wayne Cook. The Wayne Cook posture. Let's
do the shortened one right now this time,
put your left-hand out in front of you,
turn it backwards, take your right hand
and place it over your wrists, clasp your
fingers together, and pull them up.
And take a deep breath in through your
nose and out through your mouth.
- You can cross at your ankle if you wish.
- Yes. If it feels right, do that.
Otherwise, sometimes you're going to feel
like you just want your feet firmly
planted on the ground, and other times you
want to cross them.
- We're stretching up on the in breath.
- And now let your arms out and put the
fingers together and put the thumbs here
at the third eye, and do
the same breathing.
Now as you let your breath out,
bend your fingers
into your forehead, push in hard
and pull all the way across
to your temples and let it go. Now bring
your hands back up over at the hairline,
and this is for the crown pull, push in
hard and pull across. And you're just
going to travel across the top of your
head, pushing in and pulling apart.
You really want to put some pressure here.
You're going to open up that space.
And when there is space in places, energy
travels easier. So it's really good,
it helps clear you're head. Some people
have told me that when they do this,
after a while they noticed they're not
getting headaches anymore,
so it's a good one. And then, hang on your
shoulders, take a deep breath in,
drag it across your shoulders and land on
your heart chakra. And one deep breath
here and let go. And we're going to move
right into neurolymphatic reflexes.
And we're going to start right here and
massage right on the chest,
right where the arm meets the body, and
then on the other side.
And again this governs central meridian,
which governs both meridians and radiance
circuits. So we're going to drop lower
today and move into our large intestine
points. And again, notice if you have
any tenderness, it's just a real clue
your body is needing some attention here.
I'm going to go down the inside of my
legs, small intestine. Okay, now we're
going to zip up with an affirmation.
Whatever you want it to be, you can... This
is going to be a great day,
hallelujah. And then you're going to...
Oh, let's you're governing again too.
Straight up the spine, and pick to the
place where you can feel it and reach
it, and then come over your nose to the
top lip, and hook up.
So take a minute now and just tune in to
yourself and see, how does it feel now?
Do you feel a little bit more uplifted? Do
you feel like you're more ready to be in
the class? How does it feel? If you had
any aches and pains, did any of them
leave? It's something that also gradually
gets stronger and stronger in you the more
you do this. So it's a good thing to find
out. Okay, everybody can sit down.
So we're going to go after pain today.
And it's actually fun to find out just how
much your body already knows how to deal
with pain. You were designed to heal
yourself. We were all designed that way.
And it is a tragedy that we left that
behind. Several hundred years ago,
we started going to other people,
and also forgetting what is natural in our
body. So you can reclaim that,
and it changes your life to know that you
don't have to grab a pharmaceutical real
quick and take it down, you can do some
energy techniques that do not have any
side effects. And so without side effects,
it's a blessing, it's just a blessing.
And I'd like to say that your energy
systems also already have maps inside of
you to handle the pain. And all that is
needed is for you to be a partner with
your energy systems. And you'll be
thrilled what happens, how you can shift
things around. I was thinking that as we
were doing the daily energy routine,
wondering if any of you felt that maybe
even your shoulders are a little less
tender. Did anybody out there feel that?
It really does start to go away.
So energy is usually congested energy,
it's congested. Energy in excess someplace
that's just now bottlenecked. And
sometimes it is bottlenecked somewhere
else in the body and shows up because the
energy can't get through,
and things just get off. And so, you can
have congestion in another place,
but it's usually excess energy. So we're
going to start with the simple things,
with the simple ways of working with your
pain. And we're just going to build up to
harder, but even more
efficient ways as we go.
- Okay, so pain is a great equalizer. No
matter who you are or what your position
is, we all hate pain, none of us wants to
suffer. Marcel Proust said it really well.
He said, "To goodness and wisdom we make
promises, we obey pain." And Western
medicine has paid a lot of attention to
pain. And a lot of what Western medicine
does is based around the symptoms people
come in where they hurt,
what's going on, so pain is diagnostic,
but a lot of what the treatments are,
are to stop the signals of pain from
consciousness. And that's very different
from how energy medicine approaches pain.
Energy medicine approaches pain by going
to the energetic roots of what's causing
the pain. It doesn't try to block the pain
in the way that medications do and you
have all the side effects.
But by going to the root of what is at the
basis of the pain, you also are addressing
what's causing the pain, you're addressing
the underlying issues.
So you're not focused on, "Let's stop it
from hurting." Your focused on,
why is it hurting? What's going on
energetically? How can we shift that?
- In fact, I'd just like to say that, you
take pain away energetically,
that's also healing your body. When you
take a pharmaceutical,
it's blocking pain, but you're going
towards as David said, the root of it.
- Right. And we've already learned some
techniques that might make a difference in
your pain like Donna was pointing out,
that pulling on the shoulders,
it can pull pain out. There's just obvious
things that you can do with your hands
that your body is telling you to do that
can really help with pain.
Other things like working the neuro-
lymphatic points, they're painful,
they hurt, but they hurt in part because
that's where clogged energy is.
And breaking up clogged energy is one
of the ways of reducing pain.
So there's a lot that you've already
learned that may address pain.
And what you're going to be learning today
is much more specifically focused on
working with pain, so pain becomes a
signal from your body saying,
"I need attention. I want attention here."
But we don't know how to give it that
attention, so that's what we're going to
be doing today.
- Yes. So I'd like to start with simple
techniques that everybody can do,
a child can do. And one of them is, I'm
going to take it from what David just said
about speaking about pulling across your
shoulders. You can, there's a way you can
siphon pain off your body. So if you
take... And I want to say that there
are reasons to do these techniques,
different techniques at different times,
because we're all different, one pain
technique may not work for you,
but another will. And so, for some pain,
this will work great.
So if you take your left hand,
you take your left hand and just lay it on
the pain anywhere, just pretend you've got
pain somewhere, or on somebody else,
your child, somebody else has pain. Put
your left hand on the pain and just stand
this way and breath, in through your nose,
and out through your mouth,
put your right hand out and you can often
siphon off the pain.
It's that simple. You can
just siphon off that pain.
Have any of you had that experience?
Yes, yes, yes, okay. So I just encourage
you to experiment and try that.
Another way is, if maybe everybody
remembers some time in their life when say
they had a pain, or maybe you had a pain
in your stomach and you just went around
in a circle. That's, you are... And it's
more than instinct, your body remembers
that's good for it. So if you realize that
wherever you have pain you have too much
energy, and if you go in the counter
clockwise circle around that pain,
it begins to pull the energy up and out.
And as children we often did that on our
tummies. And there are so many things that
I teach, or that many of my teachers also
teach, you just find yourself teaching
things that somebody in the audience will
say, "Oh, I did that already." And that is
certainly one of them,
and people do things, like in an audience
I'll see somebody... Like I'm watching you
do your elbow there, she's making
counter-clockwise circles on her elbow.
And you'll see people doing things and
without even thinking about it,
but it's relieving the energy. Okay, I
want to say that, this...
David was just saying that neurolymphatic
reflexes can take away pain,
and I had a memory that a few years back I
was teaching in Germany.
I was in Germany, and I thought it was
because I had been carrying heavy
suitcases, and my shoulders up here hurt
so bad I thought, "Oh my gosh,
I wish I could get this. I don't know why
I can't move that energy." And I started
the class and I thought, well I better
tell everybody so that that if I'm acting
strange or... They'll know. And somebody
in the class said, "Well,
what muscle is that on?" And I said, "Oh,
it's central meridian." And so she popped
up and she started massaging these real
hard for me, and all of that drained,
it just drained so quick. And of course
that affected my arms too.
So it's really good, these are... All the
lymphatics will help release energy
somewhere. Some of you may be wondering if
this is also for emotional pain,
and I want to tell you, yes, on the things
that I have just shared.
I tend to, if I get my feelings hurt, I
feel it right up here in my heart chakra.
And I've got this pain up there and I
find myself just doing a counter-clockwise
circle, or I will... Yeah, that's usually
the one, but I might also go like this,
just rake across this area and just open
it up. So everything I teach in pain will
be for every kind of pain. Now, you're
going to wonder perhaps which way is
counter-clockwise. So I'm going to say, if
you imagine you have a clock,
say I've got my pain right here, I'm going
to put the clock right there,
and the clock looks out, as if somebody is
looking back at the clock,
which way does the clock go backwards? And
that's counter-clockwise.
Now another great pain technique, I think
I'll have somebody come up here,
because you may know this will also help
with just stuck energy.
So even if you don't have the pain, I can
find out if you've got some stuck energy.
But I will ask, has anybody ever... Does
anybody have any carpal tunnel or anything
like that in this room? You do? You do?
All right, come here.
- Hi, and so you're going to
give me your name.
- [Rachel] I'm Rachel.
- Rachel. Okay Rachel, I'm going to put
you over on this side.
And I'm going to have you face me, and I'm
going to energy test you.
And again, I just want to say for
everybody to remember, I'm putting one
hand on the shoulder so I create a
circuit. Because if I didn't,
she may be picking up my energy and not
hers. And so I'm going to close that
circuit, and this is you I'm picking up.
And hold your arm. And yes,
I'm going to say, don't look at me. And
the reason why is, sometimes because I'm
grinning at 'em, I might be giving them
energy just by smiling.
So let's see if you could look somewhere
else. Okay, hold. Okay,
she's nice and strong. What I want you to
do, so you have it on both hands?
Okay, what I want you to do with that hand
is exactly that. You're going to move your
fingers just... You can move it in any way
as if you were typing,
as if you... Any which way. And now we're
going to test you. And I'm going to use
one finger, don't look at me. Okay, so you
lost energy just by moving your fingers,
because... I mean it often shows up in
carpal tunnel, but it can show up in pain
in the arms or even in the shoulders some
time. So what she wants to do,
now this is a deeper healing by the way,
but it also helps take away the pain and
starts changing that whole energy in
there. So what you're going to do is this,
I'll do it for you this first time. I'm
going to turn your arm over and I'm going
to go up the arm, and it's called spindle
celling, and I'm making little tiny
movements just like... Remember old
Pac-Man, there's a Pac-Man,
it's going all the way up. You can even go
up higher, all the way up,
and it really works the inside of the arm
on the Yen energies.
Those are called spindle cells and at the
nucleus of every cell is a...
No, the nucleus of every... The nucleus of
every cell, there is a mechanism called
the spindle. And we call it the spindle
cell. And it get… You want to reset it
when somebody has no energy going off
their hand, and that's what that showed.
She should have been able to pull that
energy off her hand, but with you,
Rachel it's been backing up right here on
your hand. So the energy has been backing
up, and so we're going to reset that
mechanism. And all I do is pinch,
pinch, pinch, pinch. It is little tiny
pinches. Now do the same thing.
Okay, so that's the beginning of healing,
you've got to reset it so the energy will
continue to go off your fingers and not
back up into your hand.
- Thank you.
- Okay? You're welcome.
- Yes, it's very important to not pinch
hard, it won't work. It will literally
hold the energy even in your arm or your
hand, it will hold it even more so.
So you're going to reset it with the
tiniest, tiniest movement of your fingers,
your thumb and your pointer finger,
just very, very lightly.
Does everybody understand?
Okay, all right. And you can use that
technique in many, many,
many things like say, oh, I'll have us do
one right now. The neck tends to get
tight. So if you, on the neck, I like to
put a stretch though,
just because you've got these seven
chambers you want to open up space first.
So would somebody like to be energy
tested on? Come on up.
- Okay, hi Ellen.
- [Ellen] Hi.
- Okay, now I'm going to just touch.
First I'm just going to put my finger in
the middle of her neck, and I'm going to
each chamber. All right,
one finger, everybody get that. And I'm
going to go to the back of her neck too.
And you're really trying.
- I am trying.
- Okay. All right, so here's what we're
going to do. If you want to make space in
your neck, and on your throat chakra, so
you're going to put one hand and your chin
and one hand on your collarbone, and
stretch them apart, really stretch apart.
I had somebody tell me recently that's
really helped her double chin.
Okay, and then go around to the back side,
and go up against the bottom of the head.
I have hair here. I'm going to do it on you.
So you just really want to stretch all the
way around. And then you take that little
pincher again, the spindle cell mechanism,
and you're going to all start right back
here, pinch, pinch, pinch,
pinch, pinch, pinch, pinch, pinch, pinch,
pinch, pinch, pinch,
pinch. Okay, now I'm going to test you and
see. All right, yes,
you want to make space. Always think of
making space in your body,
because it allows
energy to move, and it...
- Which doesn't mean that she's testing
strong now and she tested weak before.
- The energy is moving through her neck.
Before, I mean you had just... It stopped,
it was not moving very much, right? You
know that. I know that.
- Thank you.
- All right.
- So we're starting out with the really
simple techniques and some of them are
almost self-evident, they're almost
obvious. The simplest one is simply called
breathing out the pain, breathing out the
pain. You find where the pain is,
and you mindfully connect with the pain
and you move it mindfully out with your
breath. So that one really combines the
mind with what you're doing with your
breath, with your body. And it works a
lot. And a lot of the more advanced ones
are not using your mind at all, a lot of
the more advanced techniques you'll be
learning are purely physical, they're
based on really shifting the energy,
and it doesn't matter what your mind is
doing. But just to give an example,
to really show you how much the mind can
move your energies, we're going to do a
very interesting experiment. And what I'd
like you to do back home,
and in the group is stand up, and face
forward directly. So you're facing
forward, you're looking... If you're back
home, you're looking directly at the
screen, you're standing up. Now I'm going
to turn around just because you're going
to be mimicking what I do. Okay, so the
first thing you're going to do is you're
going to turn to the right, and without
hurting yourself, without straining too
much, you're going to see how far you can
see to the right. And notice that point,
memorize that point. Now come back to
center. Now, stretch your right arm up,
stretch it up. Stretch your right fingers.
Stretch at the wrist.
Stretch in here. Stretch all along the
side. Stretch at your thighs,
your calves, and your ankle, and your
toes. Now come back to center.
And again, look to the right, see how far
you can see. Okay, who is able to see
further that time?
- [Audience] [crosstalk]
- Okay, everybody, and I imagine you were
also at home. Now, that is mechanical.
You're stretching pieces of parts of your
body and that makes more room for your
neck to turn. Now here's the part that's
really interesting is,
we're going to start off by again facing
directly ahead and looking to the left,
and memorize the furthest point you can
see without straining yourself.
And come back to center. And now you don't
move a muscle, you'll imagine that you're
doing what I'm doing, just imagine you're
doing it. So imagine that your arm is
going up, your left arm, and you're
stretching at the fingers,
stretching at the wrist, stretching all in
here, along the side,
here in the thighs, your calves, your
ankle, and your toes. And come back to
center in your imagination. And now turn
to the left. And again see how far you can
see. Who is able to see further that way?
Everybody. Who's able to see about as far
that way, many of you. So what that really
illustrates, is how... It illustrates a
number of things, but the one we're
focusing on is how the mind can move
energy that impacts the body. And you can
do that with pain, so that's why things
like the syphoning technique that Donna
talked before, things like breathing out
the pain are effective. If they're not
doing the job for you, you can still
continue to do them, it's kind of like
that pushes the pain away a bit,
but you may need more powerful techniques,
so that's what we're going to be moving
into now as the class proceeds. So now
we're going to move on to some more
advanced techniques. And for the first
one, it's in the PDF that you have a home,
so you can download the PDF that has all
the handouts and look for "Zone Tapping."
But also it's going to show up on the
screen, so you don't really need to do
that right now. But just know that it's
available to you when you need it.
- This is a great chart. And you will,
after a time you'll just have it in your
consciousness, you'll know it. But I'm
going to talk you through it.
The first thing I want you to know is,
this fellow here who's sitting there,
a strange way, that's because that's the
way the zones move in the body.
These are not meridians, they're not
chakras, they're nothing like that,
these are zones. And reflexology is based
on the zones. And that's why it works so
often, is because it's based on these
zones. But this is a great way to work
with the zones. So you'll know that if you
have a pain above your waist,
you're going to find the remedy on your
wrists. If you have a pain below your
waist, you're going to find the remedy on
your ankles. Okay, now I will ask,
is there anybody in here who's got maybe a
small pain that I can...
I mean just a local... What is it?
- [Female] Localized.
- Localized. Yeah, something
localized, a localized pain,
a little pain that I can...
- [Male] She has a pain.
- You've got a pain?
- [Female] Yeah.
- All right, come on down. Hi, all right.
- Hi.
- Now tell our audience your name.
- [Kat] I'm Kat.
- Kat. Okay Kat, now you're going to show
everybody where your pain is.
- The pain is here.
- It's right there. So if you can look on
the man there and see if you can see what
zone that would be in. Do you see that the
zones go one, two, three,
and four, five, six on the back side. So
can anybody tell? You can see it at the
waist where the numbers are, and anybody
want to take a guess?
- [Crosstalk]
- Probably three, but it doesn't harm you
if you do the wrong zone.
That's really important to get, it just
moves energies in another way.
But what you can also do, is you can come
down to the ankle and say,
"Okay..." Can I take your shoe off?
You're a sport.
- Yeah, of course.
- Nice socks.
- Okay.
- Sit on the chair.
- Yeah, sit on the chair.
- Thank you.
- Now, I want this foot up.
All right, so here, I'll let you hold
this, and I'm going to go… Here's what you
can do. Again you can guess. But if
somebody is around, you can test it,
you can find out which zone it's in. I'm
going to put my fingers back here,
on the inside of her ankle. And see, can
you see right there. I'm going to see,
I'm going to energy test you. First, I'll
just energy test you normally,
and you hold your arm real strong. Okay,
now let me check your foot again.
And now I'm going to put my finger back
there, and you hold. No,
it's not a one. I'm going to go to the
second... You can see it where I'm going
on the feet, you can see. I'm going to the
second one, that's not it.
So I'm going to go to the third one, and
that works. That's it,
that's the zone it's on. So you will lose
your energy when you touch the zone.
Now what I want to say is, I'll start
doing it. I'm going to come down here,
and I'm going to tap you. And you tap
about 10 taps and you breathe.
- I forgot.
- And then I'm going to stop for about 10
counts, because there are two types of
pulses that move through, and you want to
make sure they both go.
If you just continue to tap, the second
one won't jump in. So now I'm going to
come again. And I could tap for up to a
minute. And what I want to tell you is,
this won't always, always work, it just
depends. We're going to find out if this
works on you. We're just going to go to
another technique if this isn't it.
But this is a great one to do. If you're
out in the world somewhere,
and you've got a pain somewhere, and you
notice this for a while,
just put this in your purse and carry it
with you because
it's a great way to take away pain.
Now, I could have gone longer,
but what I want to say is that,
that will continue to pulse for another 10
minutes. The body will continue to pulse
without me tapping. So we won't know for
about 10 minutes. And sometimes it's
instant, a person is just it's gone and
it's over with. But for some people,
because they might have blocks other
places in their body, it might talk up to
10 minutes. So you can tell us if it
affected it at all so far.
- Okay.
- You want to tell us now.
- I don't know, I have to stand. Stand, I
mean it does feel a little better.
- It does?
- Yeah.
- All right, well, and another thing that
you can do, let us know in a few minutes
how it is, but you can also sit
there and tap your own,
it does not harm you to continue to tap.
- Okay.
- Okay.
- Thank you.
- Thank you. All right, good luck. Did
everybody understand how that worked?
- All right. Okay, so you can... So let me
just say that, so that you can start
letting it sink in, really sink in, where
the points are. Just think on your ankle,
it goes on inside of the ankle, it starts
at the back, one, two behind the bone.
And three is in front of the bone. And
then it goes four, five.
No, four, five, six. So two behind the
bone, and one in front.
And you could just start, you know say,
"Oh, I think that must be on that zone."
And you can just try and do not create any
problems. And on your wrist,
it starts on the inside, so it's one
underneath the baby finger,
and two in the middle, and three on the
outside, and then you turn it over,
and you go under thumb, four, five, six.
So if you've got a pain above your waist,
try the wrist, okay?
- And why is that part of the energy
medicine?
- Well, it's energy.
- Talk a little bit more about
the pulses that you're sending.
- Okay. Well, this gets a little gross. But
we have, just like chickens and cows,
there's light meat and dark meat. And in
human beings we also have light and dark
meat inside of us. And the pulses that go
over the light meat usually go much
faster, and the dark meat goes slower. And
so you want to stop after about 10 taps
and just relax for a minute, and then the
other pulse will start.
And it's just part of the amazing
brilliance of the body that this is all
set up in us. Again I said before this is
like our body has these maps already,
and is really thrilling. And again, this
is what reflexologist use.
They just work on the feet because they're
working in the zones.
All right. Next, let's go to shoulder
pain, does anybody still stuck with
shoulder pain? You are. Anybody else with
shoulder pain? I could go to a lot of
different things, but shoulder pain is one
of those things that now unfortunately
I've been taking it away from
you so that you don't...
Okay, let me pick another place. Where
is a place that most people have pain?
- [Female] Just like her upper arm.
- But nobody else has it. What I want to
see is, I want everybody in here to hold
some points on yourself. So I'm trying to
find... Okay, here's what I want everyone
to do. Take your hand and push in real
hard. Notice, do you have any tenderness
in your shoulder at all?
- Yes.
- This is one that we can easily do all
together. So before we move on to the next
technique, I want to bring Kat back on and
find out, just ask her some questions
about her pain. First Kat, I want you to
tell me, thinking back on your pain,
if you were to rate it 1 to 10, what
number would you say it was?
- It was more of a dull, annoying pain.
- Dull, annoying.
- There was something that didn't feel in
its right place.
- And has it changed at all for you?
- Yeah.
- And can you rate it in any way, how much
has gone down, or?
- I'd say it's not fully gone, but it's
definitely gone down, it's only been a
couple of minutes.
- Okay, all right, good.
- Thank you.
- Glad to here. Okay, now we're going
to... Everybody checked out their pain on
their shoulder if they have any
tenderness.
- Give it a rating.
- And yeah, give it a rating. How bad is
it? Give it a rating.
- Zero is no pain at all, 10 is
excruciating, 0 to 10.
- All right, now I'm going to sit down on
the chair so I can show this.
Now I'm going to take off my shoes,
because everybody in here are going to
hold the kidney sedating points, because
shoulders are on the kidney meridians.
And if you look on your muscle page,
you'll see that… That muscle page shows you
that name of the meridians that the
muscles are on. So you can see that... You
can see the shoulder is kidney meridian.
So here's how you do this,
you're going to use your own energy to
take away the tension or pain in your
shoulders. Now, everybody's given it a
rating? Yes, indeed.
- Now, when Donna says the sedating
points, what these are, are these are
points that are acupuncture points used
in acupressure, and by holding a pair of
points, it has the effect of releasing
energy in that meridian.
And sedating doesn't mean it's bad for the
meridian, it doesn't mean it's weakening
the meridian, it means it's helping the
energy to flow better by taking away
energy that is clogged. So that's what
sedating is, and there's two sets of
points. And so you're going to learn the
first point, first step right now.
- Yeah, thank you. Yeah, let me just say
that when you sedate,
remembering that pain is usually excess
energy, too much, and you want to move it
out. So when you hook up two points, the
energy flows from kidney that you want to
release, and it moves to the next point
you're holding. So we're hooking up kidney
and liver. And I would also like to tell
you that, yes, I mean the payoff for you
will be that your shoulders will feel
better. But it will also affect your
kidneys, and it will help the kidneys
release energy, and just... It's like a
cleanse, and it's really good. There are
other muscles in your body that it will
affect as well, so this is a really good
thing to do. If I was going to name
sedating points, now you're always going
to use different ones.
But I used kidney sedating for many
things, like even after a treatment,
I will often hold the sedating points or
whatever energy is moving now in the body,
like you were telling me... I just lost
your name.
- [Angela] Angela.
- Huh?
- Angela
- Angela. You were telling me that on the
first day that we were moving so much
energy and boy, you've feeling sick. And
that can happen if you move too much
energy with somebody, really the body
isn't moving it out fast enough,
it's in your body. So one of the things
you can always do is sedate kidney
meridian and it usually moves it all out,
and you're good again.
So here's what we're going to do, you can
do it one at a time,
or two. I'm going to try to hold two, but
put your middle finger underneath the ball
of your foot, and that's called K-1. It's
the first point on kidney meridian,
and it's considered the wellspring of life
point, take your...
- And is it above this or below this, show
exactly where.
- It's towards the bottom of the ball, and
it's actually between your second and
third toes. Then take your thumb or your
other hand, either way it doesn't matter,
and put it right at the inside bottom
corner of the big toe nail.
Now, you're just going to sit that way, so
get as comfortable as you can.
- Remember how you breathe.
In through the nose,
out through the mouth.
- So again, the point on the bottom of the
foot is kidney one,
and this is liver one. Liver one, and so
the energy is literally moving along that
meridian into the liver, into the liver
meridian. Okay, I'll tell you how I
used... I didn't use the kidney point, but
I used liver. On the first day when it was
so hot and I started feeling nauseated
like I had a heat stroke,
when I sat down, I held liver points, and
it will often move nausea out.
I hooked up the liver with my belly
button. And you hold this for up to two
minutes by the way, so I don't know how
long we've gone. Anybody have a clue?
- About a minute and a half.
- Okay, we're going to
go about 30 more seconds.
- But isn't it interesting that what
you're doing is you're instructing your
body to send the energy that is in the
kidney meridian into the next meridian on
the flow wheel, which is the liver
meridian. So it just gets that motion
going when the body has gotten stuck.
- You think we got it?
- Yeah.
- Okay. Now shake your hands off, and put
one finger behind the ankle bone.
In fact, use several fingers and you won't
make a mistake. People often get scared
that, "Oh, what if I'm not on the right
point?" Put several fingers there.
Your energies are electromagnetic, you're
going to hook up. And the next one is
right behind the lump on your inside of your
foot, bunion. Now,
this is a spleen point, and this kidney.
So what these second points do,
and you don't hold them quite as long. The
second points stop it from continuing on.
If you let go of the first points, it
would continue to drain the energy from
the kidney to the liver.
- So you open the valve,
now you close the valve.
- And this not only closes the valve, but
it balances it all out.
It's like it listens to the body's
brilliance, and it knows how much to let
go. These are called the control points.
You think that's about it?
- Mm-hm.
- Yes.
- A few more seconds.
- A few more seconds.
- Okay.
- Okay. Now you're going to shake up,
you're going to do the very simple...
- Why don't you have them compare now the
left shoulder to right shoulder?
- Well, sometimes it crosses over a bit.
[Crosstalk] So we're going to go to the
other side. And you're going to hold the
bottom of the foot, the bottom of the ball
of the foot, and the other is right on the
inside, bottom corner of the big toe nail,
and old those two. And again, you don't
have to worry about being right on it.
It's one of the wonderful things about
acupressure over acupuncture.
In acupuncture, you better be right on,
because that's the needle going into the
point. But in acupressure, you're using
your own energies. And if you get fairly
close, then your body just draws it in, so
it's really nice using acupressure.
- Just for the logistics of it, as Donna
mentioned earlier, you can hold them both
at once. It's just that it takes a little
bit of gymnastics to really figure out how
to do that. So while you're learning it
at least it's easier
to do it one at a time.
- And he didn't think I looked too dainty
when I was trying to.
Okay, now I'll just tell you, I didn't
think to say this to anybody,
but I just had a little bit of tension in
my lower back, and I can feel that that's
released. Because the muscles in the lower
back are usually kidney
or large intestine muscles, and so...
- One thing that's very interesting, as you
get more into this work is that you pay
more attention to your tension. Because,
Donna, if there's nothing that you can do
about it, why know about it? Just go on,
just go on. But if there's something you
can do to release that tension, to release
that pain, to release those minor aches
and pains, then it's important to
block them out the way that we do.
And people that learn the energy medicine
become more attuned to their body,
and that's really good for you in the long
run, it's really good for your health to
not be carrying those minor, mini
tensions, those minor, mini pains.
- Yeah. Is that about two minutes?
- Yeah.
- Okay, move to these second points,
behind the ankle bone and behind the lump.
I just want to say, a couple of months ago
our grandson who's seven years old and
Dandi's... He got sick and he
immediately said he wanted his mommy to
hold his points. So I came over too and
held his points, and he just kept asking
because it kept working. And so that was
nice to see him really recognizing this,
and he did not think, "Give me an
aspirin. Hold my points."
Remember these points for when you're
working on somebody, and you feel like you
really moved a lot of energy. You want to
be able to move it out of their body,
and these will move it out of their body,
and help the kidneys process it.
- We're in about two minutes on the first
set of points, and about a minute and a
half on the second set.
So this takes a while.
- Yes, it does. These are the second to
the longest techniques I have for pain.
But boy, it's worth it. It's so worth it
because it works. I do want to say,
if you can be in a really relaxed position
when you do this, it works better.
Because if you're all contorted,
maybe you're going to create a
block there somewhere you know. All right.
Now, we reach up and feel your shoulders.
Did you effect a change there? Is there
any difference for you?
- Oh yeah.
- So tell me…
- So you notice that off there.
- Yes.
- Is there a difference? And for our
group, who had the pain go down at least
1, at least 1 on a 0 to 10 scale? Almost
everybody. At least two?
Half the group. At least three? Okay,
still a number of people.
At least four? Wow, okay.
So there is some real change in just
doing that simple exercise on these pains
that you usually don't notice. You usually
just try and keep them in the background.
So if you can release it, it gets your
energy flowing more, it makes you more
vital, it makes you more alive.
- Yes. And you were also given, you have a
muscle chart there.
And I don't have one here. Maybe I can
just show it. Thank you.
So like you have in your possession also,
some stomach sedating points and Triple
Warmer sedating points. And so again, you
would look on this muscle page,
and everybody out there is going to have
all of the meridian muscles,
so you'll be able to find… Wherever you've
got pain you could say,
"Oh, that's that meridian, I'm going to
sedate that meridian and take away my
pain." Everybody get that?
And I want to just tell you a few more
things that's valuable.
Oh, I should say you have heart here.
Heart is the only one you don't sedate.
Do not sedate the heart because it can
slow your heart down. But the points we
give you for the heart are not any that
sedate the heart, is actually something
that sedates small intestine, and that
helps the heart slow down,
so you don't have to worry about getting
the chart that would show how to sedate
the heart. And since the next class is
going to be on chakras,
I would just like to say that sometimes
you can really get the ball rolling of
that energy moving on your chakras by
looking on the back side of this man
down here, at his gluteus medius, gluteus
maximus, his butt. And if you find that
you can't feel energy moving, or things
are just really stuck,
even the person who's with you that you're
working on, if they push in on their butt
muscles there. And if they have
tenderness, you can sedate circulation
sects and it'll make all the chakras move
faster and heal, and empty out.
And that's what I was trying to say
before, is that meridians feed the
chakras, and chakras feed the meridian. So
you can sometimes work with the meridians
and it'll suddenly trigger the chakras to
starts spitting more.
All right, and I would say one more thing,
since you've also got Triple Warmer there.
Triple Warmer governs the thyroid, it
governs your adrenals, and it governs
these muscles in the back of your leg.
Just take your thumb and push in the back
of your legs. Does it hurt? Does anybody
have pain there? Okay,
what I'm going to do is... Should we do it
or should we wait, and just have them do
it on their own? Should we go ahead
and do one more?
- Sure.
- Okay, does everybody
have pain there?
Perfect. Now I will tell you that, it
could… There are two different meridians
that govern this area. So it might be a
Triple Warmer, and it might be bladder
meridian. So if this doesn't work, just
know it's bladder. I used to work with
runners, and they would get cramps in
their calves. And so if they would sedate
Triple Warmer or bladder, but they'd find
out which ones were always affecting them,
then they wouldn't get cramps before they
ran in marathons and things.
So all right...
- So again, give a rating.
Zero to 10. So press in hard and notice
how much pain is there.
Zero, no pain at all, 10, excruciating.
And do that at home as well.
So we're making a guess that it's Triple
Warmer right now, you can't hurt yourself
because Triple Warmer always needs to be
sedated. This is where you're not going to
hurt yourself at all, so it's a good one
to try. So Triple Warmer is,
you just put your hand on your knee, where
your middle finger goes right there.
- And everyone understands that we know
we're going for a Triple Warmer because we
looked for where the muscle is that had
the pain on the chart,
and that shows up Triple Warmer or
possibly gallbladder.
- Okay, and then take your other hand and
put it above your elbow just in line with
the fourth finger. And make sure you're
comfortable please, so that...
And you're just going to sit this way for
a while. If you have anyone in your family
who has mood swings or they get just
really frazzled and crazed,
and crying, and falling apart, you just
sit down and hold these points on them.
And you'll find them, they lit
up out of it and
to be just calm and collected.
And it's always, always good
for Triple Warmer unless you've really
gone into shock, it's really good for
Triple Warmer to be sedated.
Is that about it? Okay, and now you're
going to drop your hand that was on your
leg, you're going to drop it to the
outside of the baby toe. And this is a
bladder point. And then the other one goes
on the back side of your hand,
in between the fourth and fifth fingers.
- Which is a...?
- Which is a Triple Warmer point,
and you just hold there.
I want to tell you that
some people have a hard time,
they just feel too contorted
when they hold their
own points. But if they lay down, and you
put their legs up over pillows,
it's suddenly very easy. If you like being
in the bathtub or a hot tub,
it's very easy to hold it because your
body is so relaxed, it's really good.
- So again, what this is doing is it's
draining energy out of Triple Warmer
meridian. And it's draining excess energy
which it's epidemic in our culture,
is that this particular meridian gets
blocked with too much energy.
It has too much energy moving through it.
- Okay, now the other one. All right, put
your hand on the knee and let where your
middle finger reaches, it's on the outside
of the bone there. And your other hand
right above your elbow in line with the
fourth finger. And you're hooking up
stomach and Triple Warmer. Because Triple
Warmer energy is flowing into the stomach.
This is on the five element wheel.
- And then my own suggestion is, carrying
the muscle page around with you,
at least check in on it once a day, and
see, "Okay. I've got a little tenderness
here, I've got a pain there," and
experiment, and see if you can take your
pain away. Because when you sedate
meridians to take the pain away,
it is far more than taking the pain away,
you are really bringing healing to an area
that would otherwise not get that healing.
So it's a really good thing to do.
Did that make you hot Tonya?
Sometimes when you start fooling around
with Triple Warmer, it can make you hot,
it can make you cold, because it governs
body temperature, it governs hot flashes.
Okay, now you're going to drop your finger
to the side of the baby toe,
and the other one right in between the
fourth and fifth fingers on the outside.
Oh yes, excuse me, it's down a little bit
further. I'm going to just say something,
I often bring it back to here. People are
different, you're individual.
And so just put your fingers right here on
both of them, and Ellen just pointed out
that this is considered unlegally.
That's what you say right there,
but it can be, there's two points here,
and it could be either one,
and they tend to both show up.
I'm going to say something
while we're holding these
points. Because if it doesn't work on you,
this always works unless it's the wrong
muscles, and that you also have bladder
muscles behind your calves.
And I was just thinking, somebody asked me
a few minutes ago about neuropathy,
and neuropathy is on bladder meridian. And
so you might want to try,
if you've got neuropathy, hold bladder
meridian. And while I'm at it,
I'll say, that is one time... There is a
part of B complex called pantothenic acid.
And usually anybody who has neuropathy,
you're needing pantothenic acid,
and you can just energy test and find out
how much of that you need,
but it really works. When I had MS, I had
neuropathy so bad, and it got so bad,
I had just moved to a town, Ashland,
Oregon, that had snow, and I went to see a
doctor who said, "Well, you're going to
have to either move away from Ashland,
or you're going to have your first two
toes cut off, because it's starting to go
into getting gangrene." And instead I...
And he said the reason why I have to move
away from Ashland was because, your body
cannot tolerate moving into a temperature,
a cold temperature that you're not used
to. And so I thought, "Well,
I'm not moving and I'm not cutting my toes
off. But, there was some research in the
World War I and World War II on
pantothenic acid, and it was given to
soldiers instead of chopping their toes
off and just large doses of pantothenic
acid brought your toes back. And it was
great for me. Okay, I also held bladder
meridian on it, but… So now, feel the back
of your calves, was it helped at all?
If it wasn't, remember you were just on
the wrong.
- Who went down at least one point on
that? Okay, two point? Great,
three points? Great. Okay, so it really
made the difference for a lot of you,
imagine at home, back home as well.
- Yes. And again, anybody here it did not
do anything for? Is there everybody it
didn't? Well, it was all Triple Warmer for
you guys. All right,
so now I'd like to do a different one a
little bit. Before we were doing,
we were stretching and pinching the neck
to make space in the neck,
here's another one, and it's a great
headache release. So everybody sit up
straight. And you drop you're going to
drop your head to the side,
just let it go as far as you can drop it.
Now take it deep breathe in,
hold your breath and take your hand and
push your hand in your head together.
And then let your breath out, drop your
hand away from your head,
and let your head drop over even further.
Now we're going to do the same thing
again, take a deep breath in, bring your
hand up to your head,
push together, and hold your breath. Now
let your breath out and let your head drop
over further. And one more time, hold your
breath, and push your hand
and your head together, and drop
your hand to your lap, and let your head
go over further. So you always want to do
that at least three or four times,
then lift your head and drop it the other
way. Now you might notice at this point,
is tighter over here now. Okay, now take a
deep breath in, hold your breath,
and push your hand in your head together,
and let go. And stretch your head over
further. Take a deep breath in again. Hold
your breath and push your hand in your
head together, and then let your head drop
over further. And one more time,
take a deep breath in, push your hand and
your head together, and let your head drop
over further. Now lift up your head. But
these next two are quite different,
you're going to take in deep breath in,
and put your hands in your... Your head up
against your fingers, and push real hard
against each other. And then let your
breath out and let your head drop over
further, as far as it can go.
Take a deep breath in again, and push your
head and your fingers together.
And one more time. And push your head and
fingers together, and then as you let go,
lace your fingers behind your head, and
let your head drop over even further.
Now, lift your head and take your fingers
and drop your head back onto your fingers,
so your fingers are holding just right at
the bottom of your head to the top of your
neck. And actually, it's the little
indents next to the center line,
that are called electric points. Now, take
a deep breath in, and push your fingers
into your head and hold your breath.
And now, open your jaw all the way.
And let your head drop back further. Now,
tighten your jaw and pull it up to your
face. And let your breath out, and let
your head just fall forward for a moment,
and then come back. And your head should
be looser. I get a lot of feedback about
that one. People tell me that they quit
having headaches on that one.
So it does take away headaches usually,
but it also prevents headaches,
so that's a really good one. The more you
do that one... Have you ever turned your
head and start hearing clicks, those
clicks will go away the more you do that,
the clicks will go away. I know what it
was I was going to say.
That exercise is an isometric, and they
did some real research on astronauts going
into space who always lose bones.
And two things...
- They didn't actually lose bones, they
lose bone density.
- They lose bone density. And they at one
time they thought that they should always
do weights, which is a good way to go. But
the way that they didn't lose any bone
density was with isometrics, so it's
really good, isometric exercises.
The other way that you don't lose bone
density as you age is through either doing
tap dancing, clogging, or Irish dancing,
that thud is really good for you not
losing bone density. Okay, now I do want
to show one more thing,
and I will just demonstrate this. Let's
see, does anybody have
a real localized pain still? You do?
- Yeah.
- Where's your pain?
- It's up here.
- Okay, come over here. And we're going to
see, has it been around for a while?
- No. It's new.
- Oh, okay. But I ...
- It started up just for you.
- Okay, let me just say that you usually
do this pain for chronic pain.
Hers isn't chronic, but we're going to
still see what happens.
But this is a great pain technique for
chronic pain. I have done this technique
on people who've had their pain for 25 and
30 years and could never make the pain
really go away unless they really downed a
lot of medication. So it really works,
but yours isn't chronic, but we're going
to see. Okay, show me where your pain is.
- It's right there.
- It's right there. So that looks like,
now we don't... That looks like it's a
small intestine meridian. Small intestine
goes like this, like that,
and over to the cheek bones and back. Do
we have anything we can tie her hair back,
because I'm going to be on her...
- I do.
- You do? This is great.
- It's in my pocket I think.
- So I will just explain this. If you have
chronic pain and you can find out,
you can look at a chart, look at the chart
of meridians and see,
"Oh, my pain is..." Usually chronic pain
is right on the meridian.
So you don't have to say, "Oh, it's not on
a meridian." Nope, chronic pain is usually
there because it's on a meridian. And the
meridian somehow has really gotten
bottlenecked over the years and it doesn't
even have the knowledge anymore to keep on
flowing. So again, we don't know about
you, but we're going to try.
- We don't know about me.
- So wait, where is it again?
- It's right in there?
- It's right there. Okay.
- Yeah, yeah.
- I got it.
- Oh yeah, there it is.
- So what I'm going to do is I'm going to
pain chase her. I'm going to go over to
where her... See the meridian goes like
this and like that. So I'm going to go to
the end of her meridian, and ask, do you
have any tenderness there?
- No.
- I'm going to just travel along, I'm
going to hold on to this pain,
any tenderness?
- No.
- Any tenderness?
- Yes.
- There. So I'm going to hold them both.
And I hold them both,
and I'm going to... One of them is going to
go away after a while.
We don't know which one of the two.
Sometimes it surprises me because the pain
actually goes away very early on. But
usually it doesn't, usually you've got to
chase the whole meridian.
- It's gone?
Okay, now if you're ever doing this with
somebody and maybe they're worried about
you holding for too long, and they'll say,
"Oh, that's better." Don't leave,
they've got to say it's completely gone
because you've got to get it all off the
meridian. So I'm going to just travel down
here, okay?
- Good
- And then right there, is okay?
- Mhm.
- A little bit?
- Now it's tender, yeah.
- Okay, so you think you've only got this
pain that's been bugging you for 30 years,
nope, you've got other pains out in that
meridian, and you just got to... And
they've got all these little bottlenecks
on the meridian that you've now got to
open up that flow.
- So I'm going to go just...
- That's good.
- That's good, okay. She's just going to
give me information.
- That's a little tender.
- A little tender. If it's even slightly
tender, it won't work if you leave it
behind, because the whole meridian has
been suffering though you don't know,
you just think it's this one place.
- That one's good.
- Okay?
- Yeah. Tender.
- Okay, that is good...
- Tender.
- Oh, tender, okay.
- It's gone. That's good. That's good.
That's good. That's tender…
- You see... Everybody kind of getting the
concept?
I'm chasing that pain. I'm going to
chase it right off the meridian.
And again, if you've got some client who
is really, I mean nothing's been working,
pain chase them.
- Okay, that's good.
- Okay.
- That's good.
- Okay, I should say one more thing, and
it is probably because this isn't
chronic. The pain on this is easier to
move, sometimes you have to sit there for
a while before it moves.
- That's tender.
- Hey Dandi, we should pain chase
you or your hips. I just thought of my
daughter and I had to speak up. Okay, so
I'm just going to go down
this meridian, it's good?
- Mm-hm, that's good. That's tender.
- Okay, now I'm going to do something, I'm
going to switch hands,
because it's going to... Well, it isn't
going to be able to go away.
Now, I also want to check in every
now and then. Has this changed at all?
- A little bit.
- Okay. Because as you chase it, you're
sending out this pressure of energy,
is going out like a tube, and so you're
pushing it along,
further along on the meridian.
- That's good.
- Okay.
- That's good. That's tender,
really tender.
- All right. And here she
thought it was just here.
- Right.
- But also you should know that it's being
chased, so it might have been accumulation
of all those other points, has now gotten
the energy down to this place.
- It's still really tender.
There it goes.
- This one's gone? All right.
- That's tender too.
- You're such a pretty girl. It's true.
- There, that's good. Tender.
- Everybody's understanding?
And everybody in here can do this.
Everybody can do this. Many years ago,
and you can butt in at any time.
I'm just going to tell a story. Oh, I'm
going to tell a story of something that I
haven't shared, and I just realize I'm
going to share it. And I'm going to show
you another pain technique because it sure
fits my story. But I'll tell it as
I'm doing this. Many years ago,
my mother in her about 78 years old had
climbed a ladder in the garage and fell
off right onto a cement floor and broke
her arm really bad, although she said,
"But I should have been much worse.
I felt like somebody was floating me down
on the ground." But she did break her
arm, and it was right here at the elbow.
And I was quite a distance from her,
and I told her, and this is what I'm going
to show you next, that
"Here mama, you do this. You put the north
side of a magnet, tape it there,
put another north side there and then tape
the south side there,
make a circuit. And she had been to the
doctor, she'd been to the hospital and
nothing could take the pain away, it just,
and she was not somebody who would take
medication but it had gotten that bad.
But, that worked, that took the pain away,
right away. So I'm going to show you
magnets right after this.
- That one is good.
- Which one? This one?
Oh my. You should know that if you're
working with chronic pain,
you might... It might take you some time to
do this, you've got to relax into it.
You've got to relax into it. But you can
know that you are giving whomever you're
going to work on such a gift, such an
amazing gift that they might have had this
pain for years, and pain chasing takes it
away. The first time...
- There it is.
- Yes?
Now I want to tell you what just
happened to me, because sometimes when
something releases, you might... The person
who's doing it might really feel it.
And I went, uh, I just felt like I was
going to pass out there just for a second.
But then I'm okay.
- I'm okay.
- Yeah, I'm going to get close.
- Yeah, that one's, yeah.
- Okay, so now I'm right next to each
other. And that's a good reason to always
ground before you work on somebody, ground
your energy. Somebody remind me,
how do you ground?
- You can spoon your feet.
- You can spoon your feet. You can tap
your cheek bones. You can smooth your
energy all the way down your legs. Okay,
now how is this one doing?
- It feels a lot better.
- Okay, I'm going to put that finger right
there, and we're going to go here.
- Nothing. Nothing. Nothing.
A little tender.
- So here I am. I'm just... So you want to
go from the end of the meridian that's on
the body somewhere, and end
up going off an extremity.
- Good.
Good.
Good.
Oh, that's good.
- This one's good?
- Mm-hm.
- How is this feeling? Is it any better?
- It feels so much better.
- So much better. Okay, well, we've got to
get to the end here.
And if we haven't skipped anything it
should come off.
- Now that's good. That's
a little tender.
- You got it.
- I got it?
- Mm-hm. All of it.
- All of it?
- It's gone, yeah. That's amazing.
- Pain chasing. And remember you don't
have to have a practice,
you can use these techniques. I am very,
very sure our ancient ancestors did...
Oh, good, I'm so glad.
Our ancient ancestors had to have used
these techniques, because the maps are in
us, the maps are in us, and all we have to
do is plug in. Okay,
everybody out there, just plug in. All
right, now I'm going to show you one last
pain technique. And it's great, but I have
a little... What's the word?
- Caveat.
- Caveat. I have a little caveat I want to
say, that some people,
if they're... Some people are very, very
sensitive to magnets. And so if you are,
you can try a crystal. It's not going to
be quite a strong... Not going to be as
strong, but it does have an effect and
helps. But if you can use a magnet,
just get the weakest magnet you can, the
weakest. These are from Radio Shack,
and they're for instruments, but they
really, really work hard and well.
And they're not too strong, you don't want
a real strong magnet,
because you don't want it to continue to
move your energy, because you want it just
to help your energy. You understand that?
You want it to help your own.
So sometimes you need an extension. Say,
is there somebody who doesn't know much
about magnets? All right, come on up.
- All right, I'm going to show you. Now,
say your name again.
- [Yvonne] Okay, I'm Yvonne.
- Yvonne. All right Yvonne, I'm going to
energy test you.
You're nice and strong. I'm going
to show you just how electromagnetic you
are. And I'm going to take this magnet,
and I'm going to tell you that you can
find out which is the north or south side
of a magnet on a human being,
you do not need a compass. So I'm going to
take this magnet and then I'm going to put
it above your ear. Now you're going to
test... I'm going to test you.
Oh, she's got really, really strong. That
means that's the south side of the magnet,
because energy goes, just fills up all the
spaces of your testing.
And then I'm going to go to the north
side, I just turned it over,
and you'll always lose energy on the north
side, because it pulls towards where the
magnet is. Okay?
- All right. Do you remember that north
side. So here's the deal.
- Thank you, you can go.
- So here's the deal. If you have pain and
it's not an open cut or something,
you can put the north side right against
it, and it will start lifting away the
pain. The south side will not. The south
side will expand it and move it around
your body, so just use the north side, and
yeah. Hi David.
- Hi Donna
- All right.
- Yeah. So you want to use the north side
to take pain away. Now that might be
puzzling because when you were having the
north side against her head,
her energies went weak. And the reason for
that is that the north side is pulling
energy toward it. So pulls energy out
of the muscle, and that's why the test
showed weak, but it's actually what you
want. You want to pull the energy out of
the area of pain. And conversely, when you
have the south side there and it pushes energy through
that’s what makes her arm so strong,
but it's not what you want.
That kind of just distributes the stale,
mucked up energy through the body,
and it can actually spread
problematic energy. The danger there
is spreading a tumor or something like
that. So you use the south side of the
magnet. And so you use the north side of
the magnet against the skin,
you can hold it, you can tape it. You want
to check in maybe every,
what 20 minutes or so.
- Yes, every now and then.
It's going to be always be different
with every person and how bad the pain is,
but check in. Has that pain left, take it
off. If you think, "Wow,
it's getting better but not all the way,
you can keep it on. Now again some people
are sensitive to pain.
Yes, we're all sensitive to pain.
Some people are sensitive to magnets. They
find that… Tonya, you use a… What is that
stone that you like to use?
- Selenite.
- Selenite. Tonya uses selenite, and
puts it right up against the pain,
and that works. And so, now this is a
kind of a clumsy one because it's big,
but you can. I've known people who
would tape the crystal right to a pain but
nothing works like magnet,
and maybe selenite.
- But do you want to leave the magnet
taped on all night?
- Well, I have. I have used… When I had
something that was really bad,
and then trying to heal it, I mean magnets
will heal it. And so I'll leave it on all
night long, but I don't… It has to be a bad
pain. It's something really that… And I
just I don't want to work on myself. I
just want to flap the magnet on and go to
sleep. I'll tell you, if you
have it on too long,
the pain will start to come back.
- Right, so that's, so it's really...
- Yeah, that's really important. So if
you get up in the night,
check it. And if it's gone, take it off.
- But you want to self-monitor it?
- Yes.

====================

LESSON 14 – Questions & Answers for Chapter 5
--------------------
- This may be a question that most people don't wonder about, but I do. South side, north side, positive, negative as far as magnets go, what does south and north... - Okay, the north side is considered negative, okay? And the south side is positive. And I cannot say enough that it's... If you get yourself a magnet, put some fingernail polish on the north side, so that you'll know that that's the side that goes next to you. And if you don't have anybody to test you, you can go to a compass. But I have a story that happened to me many years ago that was amazing, and it made me aware, and I really did some studying on it. Many magnet companies are, you know, they aren't... Chose magnet pads, for instance, are sometimes not made by brilliant magnet people or brilliant energy medicine people. And they have the magnets in wrong. And so it's really, really important to know that the magnet pad you buy or some people use a knee pad that has magnets in it or an elbow pad with magnets. Make sure that it's set in there that the north side is against your skin. I went to England a few years ago and my girlfriend picked me up at the airport. And I was supposed to go right to where I was going to teach. And oh, gosh, I couldn't believe it. I was sitting in her car, and I was going into such a stomach ache, and my back hurt. And I said, "Mandy, stop the car. I think I'm going to be sick.” She stopped the car, and I started to feel better right away. - You then got out of the car. - I got out of the car and I said, "Mandy, was I sitting on something?" And she said, "I was so excited. I bought this really expensive seat for my car for people to sit in." And I went back in and the whole thing was south side out, which was... It cost her about £500 for that thing. And so yeah, you want to be really careful. You can energy test it. - I have a question regarding the sedating points. The chart that you gave us is labeled as sedating and strengthening points, and we use the sedating points for pain. Can you explain the difference between the two? - Yes. Sedating points are for pain. They are for pain. And the strengthening points... There's a myriad of reasons you might use strengthening. I do not use them as much as I would use sedating because usually, our bodies hold on to too much energy. People come to me... When I had my practice and they'd say, "I have no energy." I'm going to tell you how much energy they had. They had so much energy, but it was all stuffed into their bodies. And their energies didn't flow in their bodies. So, you know, most of the time, I found that sedating was precisely what I needed to do. But every now and then, okay, say I've been sedating but their body has gotten used to being very, very slow and they couldn't get their energy up, then I might strengthen afterwards. Okay. - And my other question is regarding pain chasing when you're not familiar with meridians and you're not really familiar with the pathways, is it really important to be right on the points when you're chasing the pain? - Good question. Is it really, really important to be right on the points when you're chasing the pain? First of all, I tell people it's going to be one finger that's going to hit one of the points. But as you travel down, you do want to get yourself a good meridian chart because you want to get familiar. I want everybody to know how to trace their own meridians because those meridians begin to wake up for you, and you know where that meridian is. There's no mistaking. You get it if you start tracing them more and more. And then you could just feel it. You can feel it along the meridian. The thing is, say you're doing pain chasing, and it doesn't work. You can know you've probably worked on the meridian. Okay. But if you get it, just look at a chart and see, meridians are real easy to... Get charts. - Donna, when you're putting a magnet on the body, taping it for pain, can we put it on an organ, on the spine, is there any area we should not tape the magnet? - Yes. Anywhere near your heart. Do not put the magnet anywhere near your heart. Don't put a magnet… Or if somebody has a pacemaker, don't use the magnet on them, okay? And did I get the whole question? What was it? Yeah, I got it. Okay. Yes. But you could put it anywhere. And I'll tell you something that a lot of people have told me, that they, you know, you can go online probably and get these little magnets that are on tape that acupuncturists use sometimes when they want to send somebody home with that point. And you can put those strips alongside, not on the spine, but right next to the spine where your neurolymphatic reflexes are. I can't tell you how many people have told me that they don't go to chiropractors anymore. And they just leave it on for a while and get themselves taped up. - I have a question about pain chasing. When you say about points on the meridians... - When you say about points on the meridians, are they the acupressure points or any point on the meridian? When you... Oh, they are acupressure points. That's actually a really interesting question. You usually find that you've gone to an acupuncture point where the energy is congesting. But I have had it where nothing is there. It's not a real point and yet it's congested in a little vortex, a little vortex of energy where your body has learned a habit of holding pain there, okay? - You were going to share with us the protocol for your mother's broken arm with the magnets. You just said, "There, there, there." - Yes and okay, I will. And I will say that my mother also had osteoporosis. So they told her, I mean, she was 78. And they told her that she would probably never be able to use that arm again. But I told her to go to RadioShack and get these three little magnets and told her how to find out the north and south. I think she just used a compass because nobody was around. And she put, let's see, you put the north above the pain, above the break, north on the break and south below the break. And that knitted it all together. I mean it fixed so fast. She never had any more pain, and her arm healed just as good as it could possibly heal. - Hi. I have two questions. One was when you were doing the spindle celling and you were going a little bit below the elbow. How far down would you do it? She had the carpal tunnel, and you went up to the elbow. Would you go further up to the shoulder? - Okay. That is individual. Usually, you only have to do the inside the yen part's, which is the inside of your arm to the inside of your elbow, that's usually. But every now and then, if somebody's had it for a long time, you've got to go all the way up to their shoulder. - How much pressure are you putting on... - You mean when I test it? - No. When we're holding the points... - Oh, the holding the points. - …How much pressure? - It's like a firm lightness. It's not deep pressure but it is some pressing. It's pressing. But it's not so that it would hurt you or anything. It's a light pressure. - Comment there. - It's a real tap. You're going to bounce off that body. - Donna, when you're talking about flushing out the toxins, how important is it, since we contain so much water, if we are dehydrated? - That's very important. You know, we get dehydrated. What is the word? Dehydrated? - Mm-hmm. - Too quickly. I mean, very, very fast. And I've had that experience when somebody wasn't getting strong, and I knew they should. And I went, "Whoa! Let me give you a glass of water," and suddenly, everything works because you really, really want... You want water inside of you, everywhere. Thank you. - Right here. - Can you describe the pressure that you use when you're chasing the pain? - Oh, I should let you give the answers, so let her have the mic. - The pressure depended on if the point was sensitive or not, obviously. But it was pretty firm pressure. It was not a dainty hold. - I wasn't dainty. - No. There was nothing dainty about it. It was good, firm pressure. - I will say one thing. If you're working with somebody and it's too painful, they can't take that pain, once you find the pain, you can back off and not go so deep because the energy will still work. And then after a while, you're going to go in and just push it again, and see, does it hurt? I just didn't let up on her. But you're a nicer person if you just back off. - And over here. - For those of us who may have had some kitchen accidents, like a second-degree burn that blisters, what pain technique would you think would be most appropriate? - Well, about three years ago, that's what happened to me. And we were in Scotland, I think. Was that where we were? Scotland. And the same thing happened to me. I was moving a candle and all the melted candle wax went on me. And, I mean, I just was burned so badly. And I had to go teach. I had about five minutes to get to my class. And so I really wanted to do something fast. So I did a couple of things, one is I did put it under cold water, whether that's right or wrong, I'm not even sure. But I put it under cold water and let it keep going with cold water. And I figure eight-ed it. I figure eight-ed it so much. Honestly, you could see down to a bone in one place. And I just kept knitting it, remembering that figure eight, when you make figure eights in an area, you're knitting the energy together. And it begins to knit, and you begin to heal. - Donna, a couple of questions. One, when we were working... Couple of questions, Donna. One, we were working with the muscle meridian chart and we went and sedated the kidney meridian, and we definitely had the soreness there go away. But I noticed it could have also been perhaps liver, or the central meridian, or even spleen meridian. Do you notice that it's typically kidney meridian more often or maybe... - You mean if it's the shoulder? - Based on what the chart shows on the back. - Okay. Well, it's usually kidney if it's in this soft spot right here. You know just right... It's usually kidney. If you reach over, go down further, you'll hit some spleen muscles. So, but if it is right there, it's kidney. - Okay, great. Thank you. And one other question, I also had a small intestine line pain and as you were working on that, I also followed down the same pathway, but I was doing it on myself. I'm kind of curious because it did release almost all the pain, and it's been reasonably chronic since I was moving some furniture about two and a half months ago. So, do you have any comments on working with pain chasing when you're working only on yourself and have no one else to help you? - Okay. Now, did you say that it did take much of the pain away? - It did. - It did. Yeah, I've done that. If you can reach it, you can it do yourself. You know, if you can reach it, like, some places, it's too hard. You know, you can't reach on bladder back here. But if you can reach it, you can do it. I have had people tell me that they have done pain chasing on themselves and the area that they couldn't reach, they would literally imagine themselves doing it from that place to that place, and it still chased it because your mind gets involved and that'll work too. Thank you.

LESSON 14 – Energy Medicine Live Experience Bonus Call #2: Energy Tests and Working with Pain

Hello, everyone, and welcome to Energy Medicine's live experience call number two. This call, we are focusing on energy testing and pain relief. We've got two amazing energy faculty members with us with more decades of experience than I am old. And I would love to introduce Deborah and Lisa to the call. So Deborah Hurt, she has been with an energy medicine practitioner. She took her first course. 35 years ago when she was pregnant with her daughter. And so her daughter is about 35 years old right now. So she's got a lot of experience. Lisa met Donna about 20 years ago, and she was so blown away that she dropped everything else she was doing to focus wholeheartedly on energy medicine. And so she's been a practitioner for the last 20 years. Lisa, Debra, thank you so much for your time and welcome to the call. Thank you. Thank you. So we're going to get started with just a little bit of review over the last couple of weeks. So if you guys would like to share your experience and wisdom around pain relief and also energy testing, the students would love to get a little bit more insight into those topics. Okay. Well, I guess I'm up first. I'm Debra. Thank you all for taking the time to be here. As far as energy testing, I think... One of the things that I really love for beginning students to get with energy testing is to really start to develop a relationship with energy testing as a tool to assess and monitor the changes in the body. You can do the daily energy routine without energy testing. You can use a lot of the techniques that you're going to learn in this course without energy testing. But energy testing is a great equalizer. I don't see energies the way Donna does. I'm not clairvoyant. I have other skills, but I'm not clairvoyant. But even as a clairvoyant, Donna still uses the energy testing to verify what's going on in the big brain, in the body. Because we're part of nature living within the often chaotic, I mean, this past year, certainly chaotic environment and atmosphere of nature, just like what you see out your window, we're continually changing, continually changing. We are not the same biochemically. We are not the same emotionally. We are not the same mentally. We are not the same spiritually. as we were 10 years ago clearly, but also as we were yesterday. Every single day is a new set of circumstances and our best tool for determining what we need within the context of this new day is energy testing. So I would urge you to be persistent and not get discouraged if you don't succeed at first. Energy testing is a skill, but it's also an art. It requires repetition. It requires lots and lots of practice with lots and lots of different bodies. And as I often tell my new students coming up, it's like practice makes permanent. If you want to really master this incredible skill of energy testing, I would urge you to get a hold of as many different bodies as you can. and test them. And test them not as, you know, it's not brain surgery. It's stepping into the dance of life with curiosity. So be playful, be present, be very, very present, and try to the very best of your ability to set aside any agenda, whether conscious or We've got unconscious ones as well. When you step up to do the test, Don and David gave you lots of wonderful ways to troubleshoot your testing. My name is Deborah. My name is Lisa. Checking out to using the true false statements to calibrate the test. But testing a lot of different people will start to help you understand that there's as much variety in how people test as in how people's energy moves. So I think that's the thing I would say about the energy testing. And as far as pain, I noticed something that I wanted to clarify from the video, and that was in the section on pain chasing. Donna talked about when she was doing the demonstration on small intestine meridian. And she started here, right? She was starting on a small intestine. She said, I'm starting at the beginning of the meridian. So I just wanted to clarify for you that when you do the pain chasing technique, you may not be starting at the beginning of the meridian, at the first point of the meridian, but you'll be starting on the... the end of the meridian that is on the head or on the trunk, and you're going to be moving that energy out to the extremities. So if we've got a small intestine that begins on the baby finger, but Donna started at the opening of the ear and pushed that energy through the whole length. of the meridian and off the baby fingers so that meridian was going backwards. If you were going to pain chase lung you would be starting at the beginning on the first point of lung and pushing it toward the end of lung at the extremity. So I just wanted to make that that particular point clear so you just remember you're going from the head or from the trunk out to the extremities out to the hands out to the feet to move that energy away from the the organs i think i think that's all i got for now okay well i'll step in i concur with everything that deborah said and you know i mean energy testing is biofeedback really at its finest and you know like deborah mentioned you know donna doesn't really require energy testing because she can see if the energy is moving or not. But it's a really important concept. You know, I really reinforce, one, I never say weak, the word weak, because nobody wants to be weak. And when I energy test, you know, I really just reinforce that it is energy, that muscle is merely the vehicle in which energy is traveling through. So when we're testing, it's like, is the energy coming to meet me? Right? And so... really like always to do self -testing in the beginning where people, you know, lift the jug because energy testing really, you know, accurate energy testing requires that you be present. And people always think, well, you're pushing harder when the energy is not there. And so if people can feel and acknowledge the energy change in themselves to begin with, then it kind of rules that out. And so it's like you always want to get your baseline. you know, hold, you know, resist or whatever. It's like, can you be strong to begin with? So pay attention. How much effort or work does this require to pick up? And I like to calibrate. I mean, yes, we can do yes, no. We can do true, false. But a real calibration to me is think about what you love. You know, for people who energy is kind of a new concept, it's like most people have been in love like at least one time in their life. And you can remember that first time you fell in love. You don't eat. You don't sleep. You're in that, you know, total endorphin cocktail. And it's like your body is like charged, right, with energy. You can experience that or remember that. And then if you think back to a time where, you know, it was hard. Life was hard and you were really struggling. You know, it took. All you had to get your butt out of bed and to do the simple mundane things required so much more effort or energy. So just to kind of get the concept of, you know, energy of firsthand experience. And so when you think about what you love, it's a totally different experience lifting this up because you have more energy. And when you think about what you don't like, it's a different experience. And so now if we do reverse drug testing in a way, you know, we can kind of calibrate that and, you know. And it makes energy testing, I think, easier and more accurate. The other little tip is if you exhale when you test, it's always a clearer test because we have fight, flight, and freeze in the body. And if you hold your breath, you'll appear stronger for the moment because you're really recruiting that survival mechanism from the sympathetic nervous system. So if you just always breathe in, breathe out. The other thing that I also find sometimes with energy testing, I mean, this is just another nuance of troubleshooting is, it's like, think of what you love. Well, some people, kinesthetics, Donna would have no problem. She could instantly think about what she loves. She could instantly think about what she liked. But some other people have to kind of go through their little Rolodex there in their mind to get in touch with something. And if you test too soon before they're there, Or if you're just sitting here waiting, it's like we really want people to have their whole attention on whatever that we're asking them to do. So I'll often tell people to put their arm down and say, when you're thinking about what you love now, put your arm up. And then they're going to breathe in and we're going to breathe out together and test. I'm pacing myself and tracking their energy, whether it's quick or whether it's slow. And like Deborah said, just get bodies to test because some people that two seconds, two fingers, two fuzzle work, I don't find that to work very often in class one. I feel my arm is kind of broken by the end of that because everybody's pushing a whole lot harder than is necessary. But by class three, at least they've got that down. But some people will just flop. Some people you get a warble. I mean, the testing is not always the same. So persevere with energy testing because it truly is, you know, biofeedback at its finest. And we don't really ask questions in energy medicine. Here's the question. Are you hooked up? Walk forward. Kidney running forward. Touch thymus. I mean, so these are the questions, you know, that we energetically ask to get information in which to move on. And briefly, pain. I love when people are in pain. I mean, you know what I mean? Not pain, pain, but because it's both subjective and objective. So when we smash the nose, that's an objective test. When you think about something sad and then tell me on a scale of one to 10 what it is, that's a subjective test. So, you know, with pain. you know, lift your arms. Let me see, is it guarded? You know, it's like rate your pain on a scale of one to 10. So, you know, pain is really pretty verifiable. And so even because what we do is a little bit strange, I mean, and to get people to understand what we do. And so it's really nice, you know, for them to have their own personal experience of this and to have it be subjective, independent of energy testing until they get that part down because, oh, you're not hooked up that really means like squat to most people oh your energies aren't crossing over it's not really meaningful until you really you know understand but it's like oh i bet you get tired every time you exercise i bet you only exercise out of sheer will and discipline if you you know rub your little k27s and give them a good thump before you go and exercise you're going to get way more benefit out of that and feel better so we have to personalize this stuff so that people really understand. And I think that's all I have to say. Fantastic. Thank you, Lisa. And thank you, Deborah. Let's jump into the Q &A. So first up, I'm going to bring William onto the call. William, you are now a panelist. You can turn on your microphone and your camera. Welcome to the call. Hi, William. Hi, guys. Thank you. Here in Mexico, Central Mexico. I just wanted to ask, is there something we can do to have a more restorative sleep? Because I think when I wake up, I'm pretty tired. And then the other thing is, or I can wake up, I can be pretty energized. And at noon, I will be depleted. And so I just want, so doing the K -27s will work. two weeks ago i got married and and i was so stressed about everything and then after like the the service uh we're going to a party and all i wanted to do was to go to bed you know it was only like 6 p .m and then i figured it out and we parted until 3 30 but it was uh sometimes you you want to know something right so mainly every you want to go first severa okay so i think you You really gave us a lot of good information when you talked about how stressful it was leading up to the wedding. Yes. Because one of the things that you're describing is the effect of stress on the system and particularly on sleep. When we get stressed and the adrenals have to work really hard, pumping out those adrenal hormones, a lot of times that can interfere with sleep, especially when you notice that you don't wake rested and you have to kind of push through the day and you get going. But then about 10 o 'clock at night, you're suddenly wide awake and you can't fall asleep. That's the state they call wired and tired. And that has a lot to do with the activity of triple warmer. So one of the things that I would suggest is that you do a lot of the exercises from, I think it was class two, two, or was it three on triple warmer and spleen to help regulate that. Another thing that you can try, and I'm going to stand under this. This is my belly button right here. So if you go out about... about this distance the width of your thumb if you go out about this distance and up about that distance and that distance again so these two points right here and if you rub in there really really deeply that same pressure that you would use for the neurolymphatic reflex points, those points are specific to the adrenals. And when we're stressed, we create a lot of cell trash in all kinds of ways. And our lymphatic system has to work really hard. And especially the adrenals need a lot of support. So rubbing those points. So you could just go out from the belly button and rub up about three inches all along those two. all along those areas. But that will help to alert the lymphatic system that there's been a lot of stress, the adrenals need support, and it would be good if the body would go take out the trash. So supporting your adrenals, getting your stress managed, those would be really good ways to support sleep. Also, flushing liver. Liver, as you know, the... liver time is 1 a .m. to 3 a .m. And it has a lot to do at night. So if you flush liver, sometimes that can help with sleep. We get the peak of our melatonin production happens right in the middle of that liver time at 2 a .m. So if you flush liver before you go to bed, sometimes that will help. Lisa, do you have anything else you want to say about this? No. I think that's good. But did you have trouble sleeping before you were anticipating getting married? Oh, yeah. I'm doing much better because I actually started studying Donna Eden like 10 years ago because I was very depressed and I didn't know why. I have sleep apnea. But now I use my CPAP and I love that and it changed my life. I recover my life. I mean, I'm not depressed anymore and I don't have insomnia anymore or anything. But sometimes I don't get, you know, I get a lot of nightmares or, you know, not restful sleep sometimes. Yeah. No, the wedding was because you were going to have the service at five and then they call you like the 1230. Oh, picture. So you're already at one. You have all those pictures and then to the service at five. Yeah. So, but yeah, sometimes what really happens to me is that, that I'll have a pretty good morning. And then between 12 and three, Be very tired and just want to take a nap. Between 12 and 3, it's like drink water. Don't tap your kidney points. Rub them. It stimulates the carotid artery, sends oxygen in the brain. Give your thymus a little thumping. And then you could always do a flush on lung because that's easy enough to do. Backwards once and three times forward. Because, you know, we're starting to approach when we have the least amount of oxygen in our body is that three to five, right? Some cultures actually follow that clock and you can't go shopping and actually take siesta. I was shocked to learn that. But that three to five, so yours might just cycle in a little bit sooner if you have it that 12 to three. So plus long work, maybe there's a little phatics, but really stimulating. You know, those kidney points and getting a good stump and, you know, some good breathing happening might just kind of perk you up too. So it's always good to catch ourselves in the act. And so it's great that you notice and have already tracked and been paying attention. And a lot of this stuff, I mean, it's great to just do your daily routine. That's a great thing to do. But, you know, I always, I liken a lot of this energy medicine stuff. It's like if you've ever had a puppy. and you come home and it's peed. It's the long route to housebreaking. But if you're washing dishes and you see it squatting and you stop and you scoop it up and you run it outside and then it pees and you praise it and you bring it right in, it's a much faster route. So if you notice that you're kind of tired and you stop and get that drink and rub these points, you basically say, well, we don't really need to be tired right now. I really, you know. I noticed we're tired, but it's not really a convenient time. And I would really appreciate, you know, if you just woke up here a little bit, we'll get a good night's sleep tonight. You know, thank you very much. And so catching ourselves in the act, you know, doing something, you know, at the moment when we realize we're off is a great game plan. Thank you very much. Okay. Great. Thank you so much, William. And congratulations on your marriage. Thank you. All right. Next up to the call is Carrie. Carrie, welcome to the call. You can unmute your microphone and turn on your camera. Hi, Carrie. Hi, everyone. Hello. Hi. Yeah, I'm a week behind the cohort. So I'm on week three. So this might be a question that would have been answered in the coming week or so anyway. It's about energy testing and it's about energy testing when there's only you. I was diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis and ME and everything that goes with it, fibromyalgia, about 25 years ago and I've managed through energy work and diet and all sorts of other things. to actually reverse it all but last year I lost my husband and my mum both within a few months of each other having nursed them both and so I need to sort of get myself back on track again really and also I haven't got my two pillars to do the energy testing on me so I'm going to need to be able to do this sort of stuff for myself so I just wonder whether that's going to come up anyway on the course or whether you're going to be able to tell me that there are things I can do to test specific things like triple warmer and whether I'm in reversal and that sort of thing, rather than just generally my energy levels. Well, I'll just jump in with that because I think a lot of people are in that position where they don't have someone to test and as Deborah said you know it's a skill set and it's an art and I mean just briefly I mean I probably did 25 public little workshops and I never energy tested because I thought I'm going to get the person I can't test and then it's going to lose all credibility until Donna showed us the jug. So if you have a jug or a little barbell I'll tell you this is my favorite and I don't feel like I can really fool it. i mean we can do our body as a pendulum we can do small intestine but even if you have just like a little weight now and the thing is it's like it's not because it's not muscle it's the energy traveling through the muscle so it's like it's not can you pick this up it's like how much energy or effort do you expend to pick it up so as long as your arm is totally straight and if you have a jug or something so you just breathe in And on the exhale, you pick it up and you're really just paying attention to how much effort you're expending. And then you can put it down. And now you can think about what you love. We don't really need to energy test that because, you know, here's my brain dead dog sparkles. You know, it's like as soon as I think about sparkles, I just light up. But here's the sparkle. You know, it's like, and here's, you know, something I don't like. That gives us our baseline. So now you can go walk for, you get your baseline. You know, what is your neutral when you pick it up? Now you can go walk forward and pick it up. Is it heavier? You need to do your K27s. Is it lighter? You're on. You can look at your X. Is it good? Or is it not? So you can test really pretty much the whole daily routine that way. And, you know, if I don't have any vested interest in the outcome, I can use a pencil. If I have the least vested interest in the outcome, I use something that I can barely pick it up all by itself. So that's my favorite way to self -test. And I find it to be, you know, really reliable. And part of that is it really gets us present and grounded, which is, makes a difference in, you know, the accuracy of energy testing, because we're paying attention to one thing at a time. Okay. So, and I am so sorry for your losses. Thank you. Thank you. yeah that's lovely that's really helpful thank you so i can do that if i want to test triple warmer i just think triple warmer and do the lift or yeah you can just think triple warmer or because i don't know where the alarm points come in i mean you could start touching and see if you know is he standing or not sounding or whatever but um you probably have a a pretty good handle on what triple warmer feels like when it's off for you at this point as long as you've been doing this yeah just assume that it is with all that loss and all that change it's a it's a pretty safe assumption to say that yes yeah okay yeah okay thank you thank you great thank you so much carrie thank you And next up is actually Carrie as well. Carrie Mulligan, welcome to the call. Hi, Carrie. Hello. I'm just waiting for my camera. There you go. Hi, thank you. I've had someone come to me and they're a strong empath to the point that it's debilitating for them. So they're wondering how they can shut that off when they want to shut it off. or protect themselves from the energy and hurt of others around them. That'd be good for us too. So let me see if I, let me see if I got this. You're looking to find how people who have sensitivity to the environment can reduce that sensitivity when they - To control it for themselves. Well, okay. I would say your biggest, your biggest tool. is to be absolutely present absolutely grounded using all your grounding techniques that you've gotten and this is going to be your best friend the spoon the stainless steel spoon which helps to maintain your polarity I'm going to show you how to use it so you use the the curved side of the spoon and if you look at the spoon if you look at the back of the spoon you'll see yourself face up If you look into the inside of the spoon, you'll see yourself upside down. So we want to put the right side upside onto the bottom of the foot. Oh, my slippers are terrible. And rub it all over the bottom of the foot. What that does is it helps to orient your polarities, which means when your foot hits the ground, there's a... now like two opposite sides of a magnet coming together and you've got this incredible exchange between the body and the earth the earth and the body the body and the earth the earth and the body when that polarity is reversed it's like two magnets that are the same charge and you've got that space there when you've got space between your body and the earth when you're when you're not fully connected to the earth then you can be blown blown around by whatever information's coming into your org field. You can start to take in information as if it's your own when it's not. So keeping your polarities organized. Very, very important. Doing the grounding exercises, very, very important. Doing the Celtic weave to keep your auric field really strong, really clean, really clear, really organized. That improves communication in the entire energy field. And you want good communication so you can separate self from not self. Also, the zip up and the hookup. This guy. Keeping central and governing strong is an excellent way to make sure that you have a clear understanding of what is yours and what is not yours. Because the great beauty of having that higher sensitivity, that higher empathy, is to be able to be connected with other people and to be able to be connected with them in ways that are mutually beneficial. But when you find that you're, you're being in any way diminished from that kind of, that kind of contact, then it's your responsibility to reorganize your field so that it is, so that it is clean, so that it's functioning well, so that you can still be in that connection without moving that energy through your energies. Yeah. And those are, those are some of the, some of the ways that, that I would really focus on. to keep the energy field clear and clean so that you can make those easy distinctions between me, not me, and discharge that energy that's not yours. It takes an awful lot of energy to block other energies, to protect yourself. But if you put the energy into keeping your system clean, like a like a like a clean screen door that breeze can pass through and out again and you don't it doesn't stick to you it takes a lot more energy to try and keep it out nature doesn't work that way nature nature flows nature moves and when you allow that that motion to happen but you stay stable in your own field and you keep your polarities organized properly you don't feel those kinds of negative impacts of energy sticking that isn't yours i don't know is that helpful that was awesome thank you so much oh great great thank you carrie all right next up is lauren i think this is a question for you lisa lauren welcome to the call you can turn on your microphone and camera let's see where are you lauren there she is okay zoom's a little slow hi lauren hi hello um my question was just about the shoppers and how we can do some energy testing on this on our own well obviously you're not really going to be able to tap tap and pull your own arms apart but you could tap tap and pick up if it gets heavier some clearing would be appropriate and should we have like liquid in the jug or should it just be empty oh no i i usually i have it a weight where some people will use like a little barbell i really suggest that you always have a lid on it because you could get baptized otherwise and um yeah so you're just always going to get your baseline first you know breathe in breathe out what's my total neutral here tap tap did it get lighter or did it get heavier great thank you great thanks lauren all right next up is drena hi drena you are now a panelist you can uh unmute your microphone and turn on your camera hi drena so hi now you can hear me or see me okay good um we can't see you but we can hear you Well, yes, I cannot see me, but I don't know why, but it's okay. Oh, yes, here, my camera. Hello. Yeah, so the first question is, when I'm doing the energy routine, and then it goes here, and then it hurts in this part. So my question was, if we do the energy routine, and we... feel that one point hurts more than the other ones. Do we have to do it more? Do we have to do it separate alone and repeat it during the day? And if this part, for example, is related to another organ, if we have to do the organ too? That was my first question. I missed the last part of that question. Could you repeat just the last part? Yes. I don't know if this part is related to an opposite organ. And if it hurts, if we have to always work together, the organ that hurts, but the opposite too. Gotcha. Okay. There are a lot of things going on in this question. One thing is when you're doing this exercise, if you're finding that that it's hurting along this line, I would make sure that when you're doing the pulling, you pull past that and shake it off and pull past that point and shake it off. What you're doing when you're doing the crown pull is you've got a suture line here where the two skull plates come together and they come together like a little puzzle piece. So what you're trying to do with this motion is to make space. for those tiny little sutures to move. Because the movement that they're making is part of what creates the vacuum to pull the cerebral spinal fluid up the spine against gravity and bathe the brain. So that goes together with good oxygenation. But pulling that apart, make sure that you're going past this line. and shaking it off. The other thing is what goes along this line is bladder meridian. And bladder meridian is at its peak between 3 and 5 p .m. Lisa talked about that a little bit earlier. Its 24 -hour partner at 3 to 5 a .m. is lung. So we've got this... from lung and we've got this oxygenation from the from the cerebral spinal fluid so if if this is hurting it might be that you need to work bladder and lung to you know to solve that or maybe you just need to rub it but yes you can you can take any of the exercises and repeat them alone during the day if you're finding that the points are painful or you feel like you need extra support in that area. Like one of the things that Lisa referenced before is doing the K27 points whenever you need it throughout the day. You can certainly do that. Okay, thank you. My question was too long, so that's why I'm not going to do the other ones too. But yes, I wake up at three in the morning normally. So it's really exactly related to what you say right now. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you so much, Drina. And next up is Andrea. Hi, Andrea. Hello. It's actually, it's Andrea. There's some construction happening nearby. But thank you so much for bringing me on. And my question is about the quality of presence that we bring when we're doing the energy medicine. Well, like maybe if we just focus just on the daily energy routine. I noticed that if I'm sort of going through maybe not completely paying attention, that... it doesn't seem to kind of hook in as much as when I light a candle and maybe call in some spiritual presence and actually feel like there is presence there. I just feel like I'm being more present and paying attention. And I just wondered if you could comment on about that, that quality of presence that would be optimal for bringing to doing this work. Okay. So sometimes it's purely I mean, having presence is always good. I mean, this is where I really want to show up and ground. And then it, you know, seeped into the rest of my life. So that's a really good thing. But on another hand, it is a numbers game. It's like, I'm not a computer person. But every time you hook up, you're installing software, you're making a new neural net. After you've hooked up 2014 times. It's like you can think hookup and that'll do it. And it's going to, you know, do the same action. Now, I have a history of having my aura not really attached to my body and leaks and holes and tears, oh my, and not really being very grounded and being very present. And so doing the normal Celtic weave was helpful, but it wasn't, it didn't really make my field robust and address these things. And so. Without really saying, well, what else could I do? I just started kind of doing it in a little bit modified way with a step preceding it. And so if anybody wants to join me in doing the Celtic weave, a little bit modified. thing is I need to empty first because it's like my field doesn't really want to stay attached if there's a bunch of you know stuff in it and so this is where you know I really got you know present in a way and so it's like if you just stand for a moment and just take take a moment and I always go through because when we focus on our physical body that really helps us ground and be present so I always like check in like Do I have tension in my jaw? Do I have tension in my shoulders? So I just take this moment to check in with my body and I invite anything in my physical body, basically anything preventing me from fully being here now. I invite it to leave. Then I kind of go through my, you know, hamster mind. Is there anything I said I wished I hadn't? Anything I wished I said that I didn't? Or... you know, am I nervous about today? You know, what, what do I need? And so I just kind of go through that mental and emotional and physical inventory check -in, which calms triple warmer down because it's kind of the check -in and triple warmer loves ritual. And so he doesn't have to be saying, you know, tugging on me to say, Hey, you still got some problems, girl. You know, it's like, yeah, I know I do. Okay. So I'm just doing my little checklist, but, and acknowledge it. And then I just like stand and I usually pick my feet up and down. It's like, it's solid. Right. And it's like, this is kind of like my, my Bajra moment. I say where it's like, I have a right to be right where I am. And I believe the earth is meant to support like all of us where we stand and we hit. We're right where we're supposed to be. And so then I fill up. So, you know, maybe if I'm nervous about something, maybe I'm going to fill up with confidence. My default is happy heart, peace of mind. And it's like, I just imagined filling up, up, up. And I did this for years. And I always said, there's just something about when that energy comes over my knees and hits my thighs. It's like buzzing and I feel bigger and taller and standing straighter. And I laughed one day because it's like, this is large intestine and small intestine neural lymphatics. I just made a new decision and I got a chance at the new decision because I just let this other stuff go. So anyway, you still up and then I rub my hands together. And I just really take a moment here. And it's like, I imagine I'm spider woman because I have ribbons of light coming out of my fingertips and beams of light coming out of my palms out of all the chakras and the meridian. And so if I'm weaving in happy, heart, peaceful mind, like three times, so front, knees, and then at ankles, and then you want to reach behind so that you can turn your hands. palms forward so you can scoop that up and then i would just weave in front of my chakras and then i would just come and roll my field on and then know everything was going to be well so that's you know it's like make even energy medicine your own you know what are your vulnerabilities and being present is really good but also sometimes it is just that numbers game and i remember Just briefly, Donna said, well, you can't be depressed if your strange flows are flowing. And I was still having trouble with depression. Sad, right? It'd be like Thanksgiving to Easter. I'd be mildly depressed in the long winters. And so, you know, I can't be depressed. So I started just tracing all my gradient circuits. No presents at all about it. Five times a day. I started in August and I sailed through without. being depressed, having to pull out happy legs or anything else. So there was no presence in that, you know, chasing five times a day under five minutes and away we went. So, but I think, you know, being present is, you know, a really good thing. And you do get more bang for your buck. It's like, even if you trace triple warm backwards, it's like, I'm safe. There's really nothing threatening. I'm safe, you know? So thank you for the question. I don't know if Debra wants to add anything. That was awesome, Lisa. That was awesome. The only thing I would add to that is remember that the body has no choice but to be in present time. The brain can race all over the place, but the body is always in present time. And one of the ways that we lose our balance is when our brain and our body go different directions and they and it's hard to make peace so i would i would encourage you to do whatever you can to be present when you're doing your doing your energy exercises. So you have that moment where the brain and the body make peace. And as you do that over and over and over, just like Lisa says, that repetition, that repetition, then they start to work in a more harmonious way, which helps with racing mind. It helps with worry. It helps with anticipation and apprehension. Just keep bringing the mind back to the body when you do the exercises. And it really reinforces that they act as a team. Thank you both so much. That was just, it was amazing. Thank you both. Wonderful. Thank you so much. Next up is Sylvia. Hi, Sylvia. Hey, good afternoon. Is it for me? Ezra, I'm just going to connect for one moment with you because I heard that your family is from Indonesia and mine too. So I just wanted to give a shout out to you. Wonderful. Thank you. Sorry for that. And thanks to Deborah and Lisa, you are doing a great job. I understand that I'm nowhere. But I'm very positive. So my question was actually that after some healings. you know you kind of shake off right the energy and i was wondering where does this energy go i love this question so energy is neither created nor destroyed right we we know this from we know this from from quantum physics whatever it is that we're experiencing is usually creating discomfort because it's not balanced within our own systems so when we like with the crown pole, when we pull that energy and shake it off, all we're doing is we're moving a concentration of energy that's inappropriate in our system and sending it back to the general supply. So people used to get upset when I would say, you know, shake it off, give it back to the earth. It's like, oh, I couldn't possibly give that back to the earth. Why not? She is the grand. grand recycler she is the great healer so as soon as that energy leaves your sphere of experience it just goes back to being energy and when you give that back to the earth when you give that back to nature she turns it into mountains she turns it into butterflies she turns it into flowers and ocean waves. This is just the, it's all the sustaining energy of the world, the sustaining energy of life. We have a problem with it in our own little systems when we're out of harmony with those larger natural systems. So we want to stay in harmony with those systems with the spoon. We want to stay in harmony with those systems with our daily energy routine. We want to notice those places in our bodies where we have a little pain where that energy has has coagulated or has has congested and we want to we want to we want to grab but we want to move it off not because it's bad it is not bad it's it's congestion we want to redistribute it so that our energies run smoothly and we can receive from the earth and we can receive from the sky and we can continue to regenerate this marvelous experience of being alive with all of this pulsing figure eights and whatever is extra whatever is excess Just give it back to create something beautiful. And this goes for emotions as well. Not just our physical pain, but our emotional pain as well. When we give that back to nature, when we give that back to the earth, she makes beauty out of grief. She makes beauty out of fear. She makes beauty out of anger. She makes beauty out of worry. You don't have to worry about giving that back to her. It was hers to begin with. I really love your answer. I wasn't afraid. I was just wondering, where is it going? And so I love because I have total confidence in Mother Earth. And I also know that some of the, let's say the molecules are, you know, they can go to the universe as well. So, Ezra, I'm going to take the opportunity that I'm here. My son. uh the oldest son he's smoking joints and of course we parents would love him to stop doing that and uh and and sometimes he says that he wants that too so i understood from the tray from the from the classes that he is probably homolateral um so i said to him look i have some very simple exercises that you could do every day so you know he looks at me my mom with her energy right um and so um I was thinking he does love when I massage. So, you know, I do then include the crossovers from the shoulder to the left side and right shoulder and the other way around. Is there anything else I can do for him? You want me to take that, Deborah? Sure. So there's two little things here. One, it's bad to say I've learned something that'll help you. It doesn't really make people receptive. Been there, done that. A whole better approach is, oh, I'm learning something and I'm really excited. Will you help me? I need to practice. So right there, that's a better plan. Two, I used to pay my children to do stuff they didn't want to do at a certain point in time. Three, you can have a picture of your son there. And when you're doing your daily routine, you're doing it for him and for you. Okay. Right. So that's like the thing with prayer or setting the intention. It's like, you know, I'm doing this for both of us. And so, you know, energetically, you know, I'll get balanced, but you know, bribing or paying is, you know, not beyond me. Yeah. And my children went on to do year two. My one son said, I'm glad I got past the point where my mom had to bribe me to do this. yeah well i still have hope one day one day i thank you very very much for those beautiful answers and i'm definitely gonna gonna work with that thank you for giving me the opportunity to speak to you bye thank you so much sylvia all right we got about a minute to wrap up Thank you everyone for submitting your questions. We will have another call in two weeks for more questions. Be sure to join us. It's going to be on June 8th. Debra, Lisa, do you have any closing words before we sign off in the next minute? Well, I love this and I see there's other questions. You know, you can always go on and post them on the feed there because that way, you know, everyone, even people not on this call. post them on there and i'll be on tomorrow to answer questions i don't know who's on today but you know we should be able to get through these questions you know via that format and i love that you're here on this journey yeah likewise thank you so much for taking the time to be here this morning and as lisa said we We're trying our best to stay on top of that technology and get your questions answered. And I so appreciate your patience with our efforts in that. Sometimes we miss questions, but thank heaven somebody's watching out for you and bringing them back again so that we can get them answered. And I'll be there on Fridays. I also try to monitor the chat on the weekends or the questions on the weekends. It's been lovely to spend this time with you. Thank you so much. Great. Thank you so much, Debra. Thank you so much, Lisa. And thank you, Tribe. We will see you on the next call. Have a wonderful day, evening, morning, wherever you are in the world.

So, find your feet on the ground, come into this present moment. Let's breathe in. And breathe out, crossing your energies. Bring it up again. And out. Feeling where you are in this present moment in your life. We're going to open it up and really stretch your fingers, stretch your arms, and we're going to take the back of our chair.

And we're going to bring it up your chin up to the top lip. And open. Take your hands, and cross them, and rake across your chest. We're going to twist on our chair, looking up towards the highest point that you can see. And we're going to take the energy from that side of our body and bring it across. This is the belt flow that you will learn later. And we're going to squeeze it down our legs, grounding ourselves, and come up rolling your energy, and opening it up. And on the other side, twist, looking up towards the highest point that you can see. Breathe, and take that energy from the other side.

Week 6

LESSON 16 – Begin Your Exploration of The Chakras
--------------------
♪ [music] ♪ Hi, I'm Donna Eden and I really love sharing about chakras. I don't remember a time in my life when I didn't see them. Although I didn't call them chakras when I was little. I just saw these vortexes, these wheels of energy that spin in front of people and inside of them, and energy would go out from them and come back in. And I knew even then that they also went around the body feeding the different organs, so chakras are cool. They are really cool, and it's a joy for me to open people to just the magnificent power. So chakras are everything. I mean, they are electrical, they're chemical, they're hormonal, they're very physical, and they're very spiritual. They're all of this. They are different colors but not the colors you usually would see perhaps in a book that pertain to what they say belongs to the different chakras. Actually, every single person in this world has different vibrations and and colors because that's what color is. It's a vibration, and they represent who you are. They reflect what you have gone through and what you go through. And since there are seven layers on each chakra, each layer is a different time in your life or a different experience that impacted you deeply. And on each layer might be a different color too. So it's quite an encyclopedia of the person that you are. Each of the chakras rotate at a different speed as well. Like the lower chakras rotate at a slower speed because that's usually much denser energy, and the higher chakras rotate at faster speeds. But you know? Things can be different on you because your energy is as unique as a thumbprint, and... Well, here, I'm going to give you an example. Once in a while, I will see a color that not many people would attribute to the Root Chakra which is your first chakra. Sometimes on the deepest level, I will see purple there. Now, red is attributed to the Root Chakra, but you'll see a different color because there are different things you've gone through. But purple often signifies, to me, the energy you came in with, what you already knew, what you had learned in other times and you were born with it this time. So sometimes, when you can tap into that energy, it really does change your life magnificently. Here's something more. Just as a brain has neurotransmitters that alter your mood and your feelings, so do your chakras. There are neurotransmitters in every chakra in your body, and that is why, suddenly, you can feel differently than you did just a little while before. Something shifted in your chakras, so that is really powerful. So it is empowering to know that you can handle and affect your own moods by working with your own chakras. Now, I'm going to break them all down for you one at a time starting with the Root Chakra which starts down here at the bottom of the trunk of your body, and it governs your sex glands. It also governs just how safe you feel in this world. It's how grounded you are, and it gives you drive. If there's literally a pilot light that... I think of it as a pilot light, a light in the Root Chakra. And when it gets activated, it lights up all the other chakras, and you have passion, you have drive, and you were really moving through life. When it goes on a low ebb, you might not have that passion. You might not have the drive that you would like to have, and you might not have any interest in sex at all. Let's see. The Root Chakra... If you've had issues in your life with who you belong to like your family that you belong to, or a group you belong to, or your neighborhood, that affects your Root Chakra because that deals with how safe you are And say, for instance... Well, say you are the only black person in an all-white neighborhood. Maybe that neighborhood hasn't helped you feel really safe. That might affect you in your life and how safe you feel. If you don't feel safe, you might feel on alert all the time or have a real visceral reaction over things that aren't things that would actually take your safety away but you don't know it. So, that's basically the Root Chakra. So the next chakra up is the second chakra, and I call it the Womb Chakra, but some different chakra people call it the Sacral Chakra. And I think of it as sacral because it's sacred, and that word comes from the word sacred. And it is an extraordinary chakra. Well, I will see all sorts of colors in it, but if I see indigo or a powder blue on the second chakra, I'll know this person has real, strong, natural healing abilities more than just learning. It just comes natural like some people have a green thumb with plants, and anything will grow. Well, it's the same thing for these people. They have an ability, something that just flows out of them like some people can sing. Well, these people can heal. And the second chakra is so wonderful, and many adults kind of squash the information and the energy from their second chakra because they grew up, and they learned to put away the child inside of them, and the second chakra is very child-like. It's when you have faith, and you just feel good, and you love everybody around you, and you don't think anyone's going to harm you. You feel safe and you like to play, and... Yeah, you have faith. Feelings bubble up, and you aren't afraid of saying anything. Let's see. What else about the second chakra? It's so wonderful, but again, an awful lot of people have lost this part of themselves. And working with these chakras, you often have this come bubbling up again. Between the second and the third chakra, there is an energy band called the Belt Flow, and it is visceral. You can feel it sometimes, and it can often squash that energy down in the second chakra because the energy in the third is the Solar Plexus, and that's where you learned how to be, how you were supposed to be, and what you should do in life. It's about how you think of yourself and how other people think of you, and how you want to do it right, and you want to make people proud of you and pleased with you. And so sometimes, you can get lost in the third, and you certainly can get lost from your second chakra. So the third chakra has to do with competition but also confidence. It has to do with courage to stand tall and do something that you really need to do but are afraid to do because fear can also sit in the third chakra. But it can be about a sense of power and really knowing yourself, really knowing yourself. It governs the adrenals, but it also governs the organs of the liver, and gall bladder, and stomach, and spleen, and pancreas, and the diaphragm, and kidneys are back here behind, and all of those organs also have to do with all sorts of information, but it's covered over. Not covered over, but it is a part of the flow of the third chakra, the Solar Plexus. Now, it's really important to understand that each chakra is meant to really feed another chakra so that, you know, you're one complete person. And the more that there is an interaction, a communication between them all, the better you are. Like, for instance, the third chakra also governs judgment, how judging you might be, or your anger, or your fear whereas the second chakra is about your innocence. In fact, it is where we make babies in our wombs, and not only babies do we make, but all creativity really stems probably first from the second chakra. Whether you're an artist, a singer, a crafts person, whatever it is. So your Solar Plexus governs your adrenals and kidneys, your liver and gallbladder, and diaphragm, and stomach, and spleen, and pancreas. There is so much that the Solar Plexus governs that there's an awful lot of information, and energy, and even confusion sometimes within yourself over judgments and self-criticisms and things like these. It deals with control and power very much so. It also governs a certain kind of spirituality because when your heart is open, you feel more connected with everybody. So then we go on to the fifth chakra, and the fifth chakra is the Throat chakra. And the truth is it is more different, more unique than any other chakra. Well, yes, it does spin in a disk, on a spiraling wheel like all the others. There's a figure "8" energy here going to the side and up and down. And it also has seven chambers of a Heart Chakra, and those chambers are connected to all the other chakras. So the idea is since it governs expression mainly... The idea is that before you express, before you speak, before you bring out an energy of love or caring or anything for anybody else, you will feel the wisdom from every chakra, and it goes through to each of these chambers. So it's very powerful. In ancient times, it was considered the "Holy Grail" of chakras because they thought it was the last one to open. Sometimes, we think it's the Heart Chakra that is the last to open, but if the Throat Chakra is open, it pulls up the information from the heart and everything else before you speak. And the Throat Chakra also governs your tongue and it governs metabolism. It governs your voice box and your thyroid. All right. Next, we're going to go up to the sixth chakra, the Pituitary Chakra, the Third Eye. And yes, it governs the third eye, and it governs your pituitary. It governs your mind, the left and right hemispheres of your mind. And when you are clear, your mind works like magic. It's one of those amazing times where you just love how your mind worked. And you can create there also from your sixth chakra because your mind is so open, and flexible, and flowing. And I see in the sixth chakra, I see usually, but it can be different, but usually some shade of sea greens, and aquas, and turquoises, and those shades. But I have been surprised, and I will often see something that I'd never seen before. So here we are at the sixth chakra, and it is considered the Third Eye Chakra because there really is an illumination that can come right out this space above your nose between your eyes. And many, many people are psychic from that place. They can see things, they can get visions, they can know the future, and you can work with it to get stronger. You don't have to be psychic for that chakra to be turned on. It might just balance the hemispheres of your brain. It also governs your hypothalamus, which sits in the middle of your head, and the hypothalamus governs, for one thing, fight-or-flight response, and it governs just all the automatic things that your body will do for you, so it's very important. Yes, it's about your mind, but it's also about a gland in the middle of your head that's very important that when it works well, your hormones work well, your mind works well, you're calm in the situations of stress. This chakra also helps you be witty. If you are one of those really witty people, that's the sixth chakra. It governs your pituitary. I often see violets, I see mauve, I see different shades of red sometimes in this chakra. You know, the truth is because information from all of the chakras will come up and will literally bend at the back of your head and come out there, you might see colors of every kind of all the other chakras. A person might see who can see Energy Sun chakras. So that's your sixth chakra. Your seventh chakra is right up here at the crown of your head, and it governs your pineal gland, and it opens you to the heavens. It allows you to really feel connected in when you pray. Some people can channel in information, and that's seventh chakra. It allows you to feel it one with the whole world and feel safe just like the other end of your chakras. That the Root Chakra is about feeling safe so is this seventh chakra. You know you're being taken care of, and there is no worry here. You might get every color under the sun in the seventh chakra, and sometimes, people see white there. In old artist portrayals of the halo is really the Crown Chakra. And it's your connection... It's connection outside of this body, outside of this realm, and you really do feel not alone when you're connected in that way. So thank you for letting me share the chakras with you.

====================

LESSON: 17 – How to Unleash the Power of Your Chakras
--------------------
- [Donna] Welcome everybody, and welcome to all of you too. So we're going to start with a daily routine right away. Okay? So everybody on your feet. And you can take one hand, put it on the opposite shoulder, I bet you're learning it by now. And just pull across, hard across your shoulders to the opposite hip. And make sure you're breathing. Turns out breathing is really good for you, okay? And now we're going to do the four thumps on the cheekbones for grounding, and on K27 to make sure that your energies are all running in the right direction. And then the thymus thump for your immune system and spleen meridian to help you metabolize. And then we can do a cross crawl. Again, to help your energies cross over. It makes all healing work better if the energies are crossing over. Okay. And now it is the Wayne Cook Posture, okay? I'm going to do the long way. So I'm going to sit down and you're going to put the right foot over the left knee, left hand around the ankle, right hand around the bottom of the feet, and breathe in through your nose and out through your mouth.- [David] Lifting it up on the in breath. - One more time. And then put your leg down. And the other leg goes over the leg. Right hand around the ankle, left hand around the bottom of the feet, breathe in through your nose and out through your mouth. By now, it must be feeling more familiar to you, and that's really good because you're building habits in your body. - And if you needed the alternative Wayne Cook, this one, we know that you would have done that right then. - Yes. Okay, now take your fingers, put the pads of your fingers together, your thumbs here, and in the same way, in through your nose, and out through your mouth, and lift your body. - And now bend your fingers into your forehead, push in hard, pull across to your temples and let them go. Okay. Now we're going to do the crown pull. You just continue on from where you were, come to the hairline, push in and pull across. And then follow across the top of your head, push in, and pull apart a slight ways. And just continue across the top of your head. And go across the back side of your head. And then when you get to your neck, push in on your neck and come to the side of the neck. And then finally on your shoulders, just push in hard, drag them across, and land on your heart chakra. All right. Now we're going to neurolymphatic reflexes. I always do this one. It's just because central meridian neurolymphatics, right here, on your chest, where the arm attaches to it, really opens up the flow for all of the neurolymphatics. - And it tends to get clogged in everyday use. - Yes. And any kind of vulnerability, emotions, feelings, anything, can get this one. Okay. Now we can come to our sternum, do our sternum. Just massage it really, really well. Now, we'll choose today underneath our breasts, you take your thumb and just go right on your brow line, guys. Okay. And now let's do our lymphatics on the side of our legs for large intestine. And notice if they hurt. If they hurt, you need it, okay? Okay. And now you're going to zip yourself up. And if you have an affirmation, it's a good time to put it in. And then, if you want, do governing as well. Go up the back of the spine, think it up to where you can reach, go over the head, over the nose, to the top lip, and then hook it up. And now you'll be a lot more able to absorb information because everything is open and flowing right now. Okay. Onward. All right. Now, today, we're going to learn about chakras. But before we do, we're going to talk just a little bit about meridians. Because meridians feed into the chakras and chakras feed the meridians. So they really have a synergistic relationship with each other. And what I'd like to do is have us all trace our meridians, we're going to trace our own. And tracing meridians, first of all, I don't expect anybody to know it after just one time. You'd have to make the goal of learning how to trace your own meridians. But it's not hard. It's very easy. You can come back to this phase and do it again and again until you finally have it. But if you're a traveler, you go traveling around the world, you're going to want to know how to trace your meridians so that you don't get jetlag. Okay? And it's good for many other things as well. If you work on a night shift, you're rhythms get off, everything gets off. So these are great. When I was raising my kids and they were little, I remember very well when Tanya or Dondi would say to me, "Let me trace your meridians, Mom." That’s when I was off. And then I'd be back on again. So I love meridians. And just as a reminder, the energies on your hands are electromagnetic. So if you align your energies up with somebody else or yourself, you will move the energy. You will shift whatever needs to be shifted. So that's what we're going to do. Since you've already done the daily energy routine, your body is ready to go. Okay? If you haven't done that, it's a good thing to have done just the four thumps. Okay? All right. Here's what we're going to do. We're going to start from the time of day. But before we do the time of day, we're going to always start with central and governing and end with central and governing. And then you go to the time of day that you will find on your meridian wheel chart. So right now it is 4:30. So that's between 3:00 and 5:00 in the afternoon. That's bladder time. So that's what we're going to do. Everybody stand up and we're going to do... And again, just rub your hands together hard and shake them off so your hands have sort of come to neutral. And we're going to zip ourselves up to the bottom lip. And then governing, straight up the tail bone and think it up to the place that you can reach, go over the head, nose, to the top lip. All right. Now, bladder meridian starts in between the eyebrows, goes up over the crown of the head. Now reach down your neck, and then reach up to the place that you could go and then go down either side of the spine to below the waist. Jog in and up and around the waist and then in around the gluteus max. Now leave the meridian and come up as high as you can towards the outside shoulder. Go straight down the body to the knees, in at the knees, down to the floor, and off the baby toe. And then you're going to rock to the sides of your feet. And start underneath K1, right at the bottom of the ball of the foot, come up to the side of the feet, circle behind the inside of the ankle bone, and zoom straight out to K27, and buzz yourselves when you get there. Okay? All right. Circulation six starts at the outside of the nipple, up over the shoulder, and off the middle finger. Outside of the breast and straight down the inside of the arm and off the middle finger. Now shake it off every now and then. Now turn the hand over for Triple Warmer. Start at the ring finger, go straight up the arm to beneath the ears, follow the ears around and behind and into the eyebrow. And the other side. Straight up the arm from the ring finger, go straight up around the ears, and into the eyebrow. Now we're at gall bladder. Gall bladder starts right where you left off. And so it just drops back to the opening of the ear, goes straight up about two inches, circle forward on the temples and drop back behind the ears. Forward again over to the forehead, back over the crown of the head, and reach up and go forward on the ribcage, back on the waste, forward on the hips, straight down to legs, and off the fourth toe. Liver starts at the inside of the big toe and goes straight up from there. Straight up your legs, flare out of the hips, to the side of the rib cage, back underneath the rib cage in line with the nipples. Lungs, over the shoulder and off the thumb. Lungs, over the shoulder and off the thumb. Large intestines start at the pointer finger and goes straight up the arm to beneath the nose and out to the flare of the nose. Pointer finger, straight up the arm to beneath the nose, and out to the flare of the nose. Stomach starts underneath the eyes, drops to the jawbone, circles up the outside of the face to the forehead, comes down through the face to the collar bone, out slightly over the breasts, in at the waist, out at the hips, straight down the legs, and off the second toe. Spleen starts at the inside of the feet at the big toe, straight up the inside of the legs, flaring out at the hips, up the side of the rib cage, and down to the bottom of the rib cage. Heart starts underneath the armpits and goes off the baby finger. Underneath the armpits and off the baby finger. I always tend to really sort of twist it or pull it at the end. Turn the hand over for small intestines, start at the baby finger, go straight up to the shoulders, drop back and on the shoulder a bit, over to the cheekbones, and back to the opening of the ear. Baby finger to the shoulder, sit on the shoulder and just push where your middle finger reaches, over to the cheekbones, and back to the opening of the ear. Now, we're back to bladder. So you start right here in between the eye brows, and you go over the head and reach as far as you can, and reach behind, go down either side of the spine to below the waist, and in and around the gluteus max. Leave the meridian and come up to the outside of the shoulders, go straight to the knees, in at the knees, down to the floor, and off the baby toe. Now you're going to zip up one more time central and one more time governing. Ta-da. You just traced your own meridians and I cannot tell you how good that is for you. Now, we're starting on bladder time, which is between 3:00 and 5:00 p.m. because that's the time that we are in right here. But wherever you live, wherever you are, you might be in a completely different time zone. So you will see the time zone on that meridian wheel chart that you have and you will see which time to begin. Now, to go along and do it with us is just fine even though we've started on our time zone. That's okay. But as you start to learn it, then move to your time zone. And that's the best way to do it. I want to show you how easy this is and how fast. Now, in the beginning, you know, you're learning something, so it takes more time and I described it as we went. But say I'm flying to London. I'm flying to London and I get to London and London is on a different time zone than me and where I left home in California. So I'm reaching London and I'm going to trace my meridians. So the first thing I do is I would do the four thumps, okay? And I can do it fast. I can do it fast. And then, let's see, I'm going to pretend London is on, I'll just say heart time, okay? No, I'm going to make it spleen time. London is at 9:00 in the morning. So, here, I'm just going to zip myself up, and then I'm going to spleen, heart, small intestine, bladder, kidney, circulation sex, Triple Warmer, gall bladder, liver, lungs, large intestine, stomach, spleen. Oh, I just overlapped spleen again. You always want to overlap the first one you start with. And then I'm at central and governing and I'm out of jetlag and I'm on my way. Okay. - Now we're going to move into our topic for today, which is the chakras. - Oh, I love chakras. I mean, I love them. They are endlessly informative of what's going on a person's body, and in their soul, and in their spirit. It crosses all lines from mental, physical, spiritual, all of it. Emotional, did I say? So I really love chakras. And we're going to literally do a session on chakras today. And everybody in here is going to do them. And for those of you at home, if you do not have a partner, if you can return with a partner sometime and watch this part again, you can really learn it. You can do the things on yourself and you will have an understanding. And we're going to talk all about the chakras anyway. So... - So, chakras, you've heard the term? It's big in yoga. It's a term that's really come into our culture. But what does it mean? And what do the chakras do? The chakras have three major functions. They have physiological functions, they have psychological functions, and they have spiritual functions. Now, their physiological functions are the easiest to understand. Because if you think of the chakras as energy pools, pools of energy, the meridians are like rivers of energy, the chakras are pools of energy. And they sit in a particular part of the body, as you'll see. There's seven major chakras, many minor chakras, but seven major ones that sit at these parts of the body. If you think of them as pools of energies, they're feeding, they're bathing the organs that they're situated over. They're bathing those organs with energy. And so that's the most basic way to understand chakras, is that the heart chakra is feeding the heart. Okay? And it's actually feeding all the organs in this area. So each chakra has numerous organs that it's feeding and that's the physiological function. If that chakra is clear and clean, that organ is getting clear, clean energy. If the chakra is murky, if it's really been disturbed in some way, then the organs that are beneath that chakra are not getting clear, clean energy and that harms them. So it may be much more subtle than an illness, but it may be that you're just not at your best along the lines of what those organs do. The psychological functions of chakras are very interesting. Particularly, I find them as a clinical psychologist to be amazing because I had no concepts like this. Each of the chakras has a different behavioral psychological function. So the first chakra, the root chakra, that's about safety and survival. And the second chakra is about creativity, about your unique expression in the world. The third chakra, the solar plexus chakra, is about your identity. It is the chakra that has to do with what you have to do, who you have to be. It's the chakra that really pushes out into the world in a particular way. The heart chakra, which is the fourth chakra, is about love and connection. But like love often turns, it's also about grief and sadness. The fifth chakra is at the throat and it's the chakra of expression. The sixth chakra is at the crown. It's the chakra of perception, both perception because it's over your eyes and your ears, but it's also the chakra of extrasensory perception. It's the chakra that tunes into other energies in your environment and picks up and reads those energies. And the seventh chakra is connected to the heavens. It's the crown chakra. It's the chakra where you really are connecting directly into the heavens, directly into that which is beyond your personal self. Now, what was really neat to me as a psychologist was Donna saying that the chakras have memory, that they hold information, they hold information about a person's past. And the first time that I really understood that was when she told me about a woman she worked with. And she was working on the chakra doing the kinds of motions you'll be doing, and suddenly Donna is feeling enormously sad. She's just crying and she just can't... doesn't quite understand it, but she's feeling the energy in this woman's heart chakra. And the woman, who's you know, come to her for help doesn't understand why her healer has just broken into tears and is crying. But Donna just kind of keeped moving the chakra and she finally says, "I feel like I'm about six years old and I've lost the most important thing in the world to me." And it turned out that this was when the woman's brother died. So her big brother, who she looked up to so much. And Donna had said, "It doesn't feel like a parent but it feels so important." And as she said that, then the woman is suddenly, and then she's the one that's in tears. And what often happens in these early losses is that they never get fully processed, they never get resolved And so it's sitting there in the chakra, that unresolved energy. And as Donna worked the chakra and the woman was conscious of what was going on, that began to get resolved. And in fact, what happened was that, afterwards, it changed her relationship with her husband. dramatically. Because she had never again been able to love as fully as she loved her brother. It just kind of closed off there. So love had a block to it. And after the chakra clearing, she was able then to open up to her husband in new ways. So it was really very transformative. So in each of the chakras going along with the theme of that chakra of safety, of creativity, of power in the world, of connection, of expression, of perception, and of larger connection, there are memories of what happened in your past had had to do with that theme. So every emotionally significant experience gets coded in one of those chakras, and the chakra that corresponds with the theme of that experience. So that's very interesting to understand psychologically. But then there's another function of the chakras, which is a spiritual function And it's not only the spiritual chakra, the crown chakra, that has a spiritual dimension to it. Each of these themes has a counterpart in the universe. It's a kind of a strange concept. Carl Jung talked about it as archetypes. He talked about that there is, in the atmosphere, in the field that surrounds us, there is an archetype, there is a kind of energy, sometimes is referred to as a morphic field, that governs that theme. So there is your personal love for somebody, but there's also the archetype of love that human beings can tune into. And that archetype actually influences how we love or how we create or how we express our power or how we communicate. And so tuning into that archetype is a way that you can strengthen that quality. Like, supposing you have difficulty expressing yourself. One of the ways that you can work with that difficulty is to tune into your own throat chakra and sense out that there is a more ideal way of expressing that's out there and invite that in. Invite that into your throat chakra. So it begins to energetically impact what's happening in your chakra. And that then can transform your relationship to that issue. So these are the three basic functions of the chakras. The physiological, based on where the chakra is situated and what organs are near it, the psychological based on those themes, and the spiritual based on that which is beyond your personal self. What you'll be doing today is you'll be learning how to work with the chakras as an energy. And Donna will be leading you through a way of doing it that is very orderly, very systematic. It doesn't require being able to see the energies. It's something you'll do with your hands in an almost mechanical way that is then shifting the energies of the chakras and it will actually begin to heal what needs to be healed. But more importantly is that as we go through life, the energies get a bit disorganized. And so what you'll be doing first is kind of pulling out the old energy from the chakra and bringing in the new energy. So it's like, again, like we talked about, flushing a meridian is like changing the oil, clearing the chakras is like changing the oil, so it gets that really clear. And then more healing can happen and the functions can take care of themselves. So one other thing to understand about chakras is that each chakra has layers. They have seven layers. And the layers have different meaning. So the deepest layers are what you come in with, what you're born with, the inherited parts of the chakra. So for instance, if you're working with your third chakra, your chakra that has to do with power and identity, this is the identity that is really core for you. It even goes beyond what you learned in your childhood. What you learned in your childhood, those experiences certainly shape you, but they're not as deep as the deepest layers. They are more in the middle to deeper layers. That is what was shaped very early on in your life. And then the middle layers are what you've learned more recently, what's in the highest layer, the most surface layer, are recent experiences. But then they get sorted out, they get sorted through. So what are the principles that you can derive? What are the learnings from this experience? So as you process, this all happens unconsciously, but as you process the recent experience, it goes into the middle layers. So those are your learnings. Those become part of your sense of reality, your sense of what works in the world. Who am I? What am I meant for? What can I do? Who can I trust? All that is in the middle layers. So by working with the chakras, you don't know what layer you'll be working with but you'll certainly start with the outer layers. But then, whatever needs to be healed, that tends to happen as you do chakra sessions. So you'll be working with your hands on a partner. And, again, as Donna said, if you don't have a partner with you, this is one where, grab somebody and, you know, when you can, get somebody that, a friend, a spouse, a kid, a parent, a colleague, and go through this with them. And experience what it's like to be on both sides, to be the one that's doing the chakra healing session, and the one that's receiving it. And one thing that you'll find that I found certainly because, you know, I had the experience, like I'm sure some of you out there, of "Okay. This makes sense to me but I don't really feel energy. I don't see energy like Donna does." So it's kind of… I'm kind of taking it on faith. But when I was working with chakras, that energy first became palpable to me. And some of you are going to experience this, where as I was moving my hands over the chakra, it was like moving through something that was real, that had texture and warmth, and I could feel the sensation of that. So be alert for that as you are working with your partner. - So now we're going to get into partner work and we're going to change the scenery here. All right, we're back again in our new positions. And in a moment we're going to be doing the chakras. But I just want to tell a couple of things, only a couple of things. And the rest of the things I'm going to tell you as I work on somebody myself. Because then it becomes apparent what you see and what you get in a chakra. But I want everyone to know that chakras are like your own encyclopedia. It's your story, your journey through life, and your trials and tribulations. They all show up in your chakras. And today, because we do not have, you know, a forever amount of time, we're going to teach you how to do this, but keep it within a timeframe. So most people probably won't get below the first or second levels. But you can know you can come back to this and do it longer and longer and drop deeper. Or maybe, you will… If you do this work on the same person, then the next time you work on them, you will drop. It will begin at another level, probably. The other thing I want… No. So, all right. Here we go. All right? - Okay. And I'm going to be the timer. So we're going to go about two minutes on each chakra on the counterclockwise position, and then about a minute and a half on the clockwise position. So I'll be kind of letting Donna know when it's time to shift. - Yes. And again, you could take much more time than this, by the way. But this is… You're going to learn it in this time frame. Okay, I've got my patient. The first thing we're going to to do, you're going to lay your head this way you're going to lay on your tummy. We're going to do a little preliminary technique, which is just to clear their neurolymphatic reflexes down their spine, okay? So if you can sit at their heads or stand at their heads and massage down their backs, and clear that first. And you do this with pressure, with real pressure. - Remember we talked about this, this is the spinal flush. - Yes. Just brush them off. And then I'm going to... Well, I'll wait till you're all caught up with me. You can then reach across on their shoulders and drag it across, and help that energy to cross over. And this is going to be just a short preliminary, but then we're going to flip them over. Flip over. And when I have… One of the things I like to do before doing the chakras is just put my hands at the top of their neck and go into the center point, the top of the neck, the bottom of the head, there's an indent right in the middle. it's just right up at the top of the spine, and just push in and pull out. And then move next door right about a half an inch on each side are the electric points. And they just clear a lot of energy so that it's easier to have the chakras start moving. Now, that's all I'm going to do on you, okay? Now we're going to test the chakras, okay? You're going to pick up the arms, straight up, put them back to back. - So this is another kind of energy test. - Yes. Now, this is going to test, first you're just going to have them hold with all their might. This takes more energy for them because they've got more energy they can hold here so they can hold stronger. And you're going to pull apart. You're going to say, "Hold, hold while I pull." And if you do what she does, it won't work. She's bending her elbows. Just see if they lose their energy when you pull them apart. And then you're going to tap at seven places. Now, some places are, you know, personal parts of a person's body, you can do it within about an inch to two inches. You don't have to tap them. You can tap two taps. - You're in the energy field. - Is that right? All right. I'm going to… She won't mind if I touch the rest of her. So I'm going to tap right at the second chakra. And two taps and pull. And the third chakra, two taps and pull. You're just tapping right in the middle of the chakra. And then the heart chakra. If I go too fast, somebody say, "Slow down." Heart chakra, right in between the breasts, two taps and pull. Are you holding? Okay. And then the throat chakra, two taps and pull. And then the sixth chakra, two taps and pull. And now the seventh, two taps and pull. Did anybody have everything out like I did? And were there just some out? - [Woman 1] A couple. - A couple out. - Just a little weaker than the other. - All right, all right. So you might even find that if you were... I better not. You might drop into the second chakra. I mean second layer or third layer, okay? But here we go. - And just, on that energy test, the first time Donna didn't do any tapping, and that indicates whether any of them are out. So that is what that is doing then. Then you're specifically looking to see which ones might be out with the tapping. - Did anybody else not have any out that got, that's being worked on? Everybody is… Okay, good. - So we have the range from all of them out to… - Just a couple out. - To just couple out. - Okay. Here's what you're going to do. You're going to rub your hands together and you're going to shake them off. Now, you're going to get really tuned in here and you're going to… You can use one hand or two hands and very, very slowly move over the root chakra in a counterclockwise way. Some people find it easier to go over with the left hand in a counterclockwise way, but you can do it any way you want. And you probably will begin to feel things. And if you're not feeling anything, go slower. Go slower. You've got to get into the vibration of this energy. Now, I will tell you that if you read in a book, it will probably say that the root chakra is red. But I will tell you, I've never seen anybody have the exact colors that they say the chakras are supposed to be. You're unique. These are your energies, not anybody else's. So what I'm experiencing here, for instance, when I move around on her right side, I'm going very slow. On her left side, I speed up. So the energy is very different on each side and she has a different color on this top layer. The right side is sort of a reddish brown but the left side isn't. It's very bluely-green. - So what you want to do is watch Donna's hands and she's about an inch and a half, two inches above the chakra. You can see the size of the circles that she's making, and the speed, and go about that speed. Now, what she's saying is that if you feel the energy, let it guide you. But the default is what you're seeing right there. - Now, I want to say that the root chakra, you know, is about how grounded you are. It gives you drive in life. It often contains your survival issues. Now, I don't know what this is about, but if I stayed here longer, I might tell you. But right now, what I know is this hurts my hands. It's like, anybody else have any kind of feeling in your hands? You do. I mean, it's always going to be different depending on who you're working with. But there's something on this root chakra, my dear. - And you can always shake off your hands and come back to the chakra. You don't need to take that energy in. You have about two minutes. - Okay. Yeah? - Yeah. - All right. So we're going to... Now shake that energy off. Now you're going to go in a clockwise direction directly over it. Now, sometimes the things on a chakra can be, as David said, that could be physical, mental, whatever. And so I do feel that some of this is physical. It's not just… Because you can… And I think that that's a lot of the pain I'm feeling in my hands. - So when you go clockwise, when you go counterclockwise, you sort of clean it out. Yeah, you clean out that energy. And when you go clockwise, you're putting in and balancing the energies of that chakra. - Counterclockwise pulls out stale old energy. Clockwise stabilizes the energy of the chakra. - I feel a little warmth. - Warmth, yeah, that's one of the things you'll feel. - Is that normal? - Yes, yes. Warmth is something that you feel because you're in the field. You're in the field. Okay, shake off your hand and we're going to go up to the second chakra. Second chakra is one of my favorites because the second chakra, if you have a client that you're working with for a while and you're working with their chakras, there's something magical that happens when the second chakra opens. Because it's like your inner child, that free part of you, that part that doesn't have to take responsibility for anything and it’s wonderful. Yeah, this is the part of you that can laugh easily, that can just be free. It's the child before there was responsibility and stuff. And often in our culture, the third chakra blocks the second chakra. Because the third chakra is about power and what you have to do and things. And that along with something called a belt flow that we are going to have to fix before we move further on you. Okay? Shake it off and go clockwise. Now, Melanie has a lot of indigo color here, also your pants, but you do a have a lot of indigo in your second chakra. You also have this sense of, this is… I'm just giving you ideas of what energy might feel like, like I could fall through it. It's almost like a wind tunnel, too. And it's… I just have the… Well, I see you laugh sometimes, but this is even more so where you might really be free at times, it's very nice. - If anybody has any questions while we're doing this about something you're feeling, please speak up. - [Woman 2] I feel like a current, sort of like a current. - Yes. - Like coming from the first chakra Okay. Thank you for saying that. She's feeling a kind of current and it kind of goes up your arm. I want to tell you, don't let it get past your elbow. - Okay. Or it's like you take on that person's energy. So if it gets past your, I mean, just shake it off. I mean, if it really kept going then going, put your arm under cold water. It'll just move right off. - Okay. - Okay? But... Yes. - [Woman 3] I feel like this one is just moving just really quickly as opposed to the other one, which was a little bit more slow. - Yeah. It's like each chakra really is quite different than every other chakra. Okay. Now before we go into the third chakra, because I've got a patient who really needs it and I think it's a good thing to do, we're going to clear their belt flows, okay? A belt flow is a flow in the radiant circuits. And it cuts the energy off between the third and second. And to test it, you just take your hand like this around the waist and then energy test. I will talk you through the energy test. Lift the opposite arm and have the thumb pointing towards the ground. Put your hand, your open hand, below the wrist and pull down. Yeah, pull down. If their belt flows it out, they won't be able to hold their energy. And if their belt flows in, lucky them. Okay. So, everybody... Yes. So all right. So here's what we're going to do. We're going to reach around the waist. I'm going to reach all the way around the back and pull that energy. And pull it all the way across the body on the third or fourth swipe and then straight down this leg, smooth it down the leg and off the foot. - With a very firm touch. - A very firm, don't be too light, okay? And then on the other side, I'm going to go around the waist and pull across the stomach and down the leg and off the foot. Okay? All right. Just a moment. The third chakra gets more mature the older you get. And as a teenager, it really matures, or it doesn't mature but it begins to grow quite a bit. And it starts blocking the energy of your second chakra. And when you put away childish things that later on you want to get back again. But the third chakra, the solar plexus, governs your sense of identity, power in the world versus... Power with yourself versus power over others. It's competition. It's... What else? - Yeah, it's the shoulds and... - Yeah, the shoulds, what you should do, better do, have to do, need to do, and the list you're making all day long. That's the third chakra. And it's also who you see yourself as versus who other people see you as. It's making your way into the world of other people. So the solar plexus has so much in it. You have your stomach, and liver, and spleen, and pancreas, and kidneys. You just have so much going on here that it's really, really valuable. - Do you want to test the belt flow? - Yes, I'm going to test the… Oh, test the belt flow. Okay, test the belt flow. First, I'm going to hold and then I'm going to test again. See if you got it. Yes. Do I need to start over again into the third chakra? Okay. All right. All right. So now here we go. And we tested the third chakra already so we're just going to clear it now. We're going to do counterclockwise over the solar plexus. And you actually have a traditional color over solar plexus.. You have a sort of a mellow-yellow. But at deeper layers, now, every layer can have different colors. So on a deeper layer, I see some violet there. This is one of those techniques that you will really grow to love more and more because they so give information. And when I have time, real time to drop into the many layers, sometimes you're just astounded by what comes up. Now, I'm just going to tell you, just to give you an idea of what, you know, so that it won't surprise you if it happens to you. Like, here I am in the solar plexus, but I feel heart stuff. I mean, like, emotional heart stuff. So there is something that shows up in the solar plexus, but it's about her heart chakra as well, because you can really feel it. And now my hand is slowing down. You might find that you are doing counterclockwise circles at a certain tempo, and it's as if an energy grabs you a little bit and you suddenly move at a different pace and a different tempo. - Time. - Okay, shake her off. Off to clockwise now. Now, what happens for me is I often get visual pictures when I'm in a chakra. And the same one is sticking around that was in your second chakra. I do think I'm seeing you as a child. Is anybody feeling different feelings in the different chakras? Yes. - [Woman 4] I was feeling pain in the first but, yeah, they do feel differently. - Yes, they do. And it becomes even more striking when you can drop down into lower chakras. - Lower levels. - Lower levels. Yes. Time? Okay, shake it off. And now we're coming into the heart chakra. And the heart chakra, you know, it is what you know, it's about love. But it's also about universal love. And I often see many, many colors in the heart chakra because people go through journeys of their heart and what life is about. So one of the things you can see in Melanie's heart is that she has a lot of maroon there. And maroon, think of that Christmas velvet. You know, that deep reddish maroon that's so beautiful. And I always think when I see that in somebody's heart chakra that they have really learned the lessons of contradictions and love. Like, still being, like, if all your friends didn't love one person, you'd still love that person. And so that's really strong in you, Melanie. You know, in the heart chakra is also the lungs and it carries sorrow and pain and old grief, I mean, real grief. So you might be picking that up sometimes, too. Now, I'm going to ask, has anybody had the experience that the chakra felt one way and then suddenly it just suddenly feels different than it did? Yeah. It usually means you've moved into another layer and there's other energies there and issues there. - Okay. -  Okay, shake it off and go clockwise. Sometimes you start picking up all sorts of things and one of the things I'd say, and I can say anything that I want about you, right? Melanie has been quite a giver. I mean, she's a giver. And you can see that there… You can even get the imbalance between giving and taking. And she has a… It's your turn to take, so you were supposed to be on this table. I'm going to tell you something else that you might feel on the heart chakra. You can feel it on any chakra, but maybe more on the heart chakra than any. Especially if the heart has really learned a lot of lessons. You might find your hand going in a figure eight after you've been clearing it. It just, it literally goes in a figure eight. And a figure eight energy is an energy that binds different systems together and it feels very good on you. Okay. Now, the throat chakra is different. It's different. And normally you treat it in the same way you do all the other chakras. But sometimes you want to add something. Like if you feel that the person's throat chakra needs to be opened a lot, I'm going to tell you how you can stretch it a little bit. There are seven chambers on the throat chakra. It's not just a spiraling wheel. It's also a major figure eight that goes both ways, kind of like a four-leaf clover. But the main thing are these chambers in the throat chakra. And the seven chambers, each chamber matches to one of the chakras. So, you know, in ancient times, this was considered the Holy Grail of chakras. Because if this one opens, you get all the information from all the chakras, from below the throat chakra and above it. And before you ever speak, you speak all the information from all of the chakras. And that is what we're all heading for. So you can pull, if you put your hand on the jawbone and the other down there on the collar bone, you can stretch the chambers if you'd like. And it's just good for the throat chakra. And you can work a long time on the throat chakra because you'll not only find yourself, and then begin to spin when you're through with that. But you can work so long on the throat chakra because after a while, you might find that, "Gosh, I can feel a very different energy on one of the chambers," then another, and you just want to work on that one for a while. So it's more than just expression. Well, it's the expression of every chakra in your body. Like on Melanie's neck, I find myself, at first, the circles were very circular, and now they're kind of elliptical. You know, you find yourself going along those chambers. But you can cross them. You can do anything that feels right. And then, again, there's a figure eight going sideways and a figure eight going up and down. Once in a class, I was… You tell me when to turn and I'll… Now? Once in a class, I was demonstrating this and when I got to the man's throat chakra, my hand hurt so bad. And he says, "Well, I've got nothing wrong with my throat chakra. I don't know what you're feeling." And I said, "I don't know. I just know it's there." So then I began saying, "Well, the throat chakra covers the mouth and goes down. "And he said, "Oh." And he opened his mouth and he had, what is that disease? It's a disease of the gums. He was just… - Gingivitis? - Yes. And that was… And so we made him a project in our class to see if we could heal his gums. And we did, because he was going to lose all his teeth. - Okay. Okay. - Okay. Shake it off and go the other way. Could anyone feel any of the chambers? Yeah, all right. You have really pretty skin. - Okay. Come off the throat chakra and now you're going to go to the sixth chakra. So just once again, start counterclockwise circles over the third eye area that also covers the mind, the whole frontal imminence here. And the sixth chakra, you know, it governs… I mean, a lot of people are very psychic from the sixth chakra. And there really is an energy at the third eye. And you really do tap into it and you can start pulling energy from there. You see the energy on the chakras climb the spine and each one feeds energy into the next one. And when it gets to the back of your head, the energy literally bends and goes out the third eye area. And if you live in a culture that hasn't supported that, or a family that hasn't supported that a lot, it tends to go dormant. But many, many people can open this one up again, and do. And intuition begins it. Yeah. Now, with Melanie, it's very interesting, I can feel like her sixth chakra is just trying to move up into her seventh chakra. It's another sort of elliptical thing. Okay. Pull off and shake off your hand and go in a clockwise direction. I want to say one more thing about Melanie here, is that she's got a lot of energies here in her sixth chakra, so a lot of different colors, a lot of different colors with turquoise and lavender and a soft yellow. She's just got lots of colors here. But sometimes, if anybody has felt any pain in any of the chakras, it's really interesting, it may not be the chakra you're on. But, like, there's a way you can begin to tell where it comes from. But I feel like this comes down from the root chakra because I can feel that same pain that I felt there here. Okay. Shake it off and we're going to go to the crown chakra. Now, I have to tell you, if you're working on a man, there's something different at the crown chakra than a woman. A woman you're going to do precisely what we've done already. You're going to go counterclockwise. But if you're working on a man, you go clockwise first and counterclockwise second. And that's simply how the crown chakra spins on a man. And it's also, over time, I found that it's really, really good because it pulls in the balance to their yangness. Their yang energy is very, very good, but it's also the way it needs to be. So I'm going to go counterclockwise here. - But if you're working on a man, you'll go clockwise. - Yes. - And Donna has found that it's true for any man. It's not like gay men, it goes the same way as men that are not gay. - Melanie has like a huge bowl on the top of her head. And just, very nice. Sometimes the people on the floor, if their eyes are shut, sometimes they see color. Does anybody on the floor see color? All right, good. But it really feels like I'm pulling up some of the old stuff right up her body and out her crown chakra. You may find yourself, if you practice this a while at home, you may find that you know when you've dropped into another layer. It becomes really clear. It's a different energy, and that just happened on her crown chakra. Okay. So shake it off and go the other direction. Sometimes when you're working on the crown chakra, there will be a release and it will actually push your hand out a bit, like it just did with Melanie. So I'm back here further now. Okay. Now you're through, and you can kiss them on their forehead. Come back and we're going to… All right. When you're ready, we're going to retest them. You know, I want to say there's something you can do at the end, by the way, to help all of the energies of all the chakras sort of be very fluid with each other is just to lay your hands on one or two at the same time and just, I'm just going to let you be there for a minute, okay? And I'll hold right here and right here. - So you've balanced all the chakras, and now this is a technique, it's not necessary, but it's a technique for connecting them so that they're in this new balanced state. They're flowing with one another again. - And this is a great thing to do at night, lay your hands on different chakras and connect them up. - So if you feel like you're someone who's wanting to be more in the heart and not so much in the head, you can connect your heart's chakra with your sixth chakra. - Okay. Now we're going to retest them, okay? You're going to put back to back and retest. Oh, wow, goodie, goodie. Yea. All right, my dear. You just need somebody to do all the other layers now. - Yes. - So... - You need a mic. Dondi, do you have the mic? - So what you just saw was that Melanie started with all seven chakras weak and ended with all seven chakras strong. And she's going to tell you a little bit about her experience. - Okay, hold it close to your mouth. - Like this? Okay, can you hear me? - You got to be a little more, or be louder. - [Melanie] Okay. So I just want to tell you something. When Donna was working on my root chakra, I felt a lot of pain on the left side. And it was caused, you don't know that, but it was many years ago, actually, I was walking across the street and I was hit by a car and I landed on my left side. And, of course, there was a lot of healing going on and there was a mass of scar tissue here. And we released  the scar tissue. So I'm now learning to function again. And, you know, there's a lot of healing going on right now and I felt that pain actually coming out. - Which is what I felt. Yes, we both felt it. That's right. - So I know, I mean, in six months, it's all going to be fine. So I know that. But it was just very interesting. I'm going, "Wow." - Great. Thank you, Melanie. Does anybody else have anything to say? - All right. Now we're going to do an exercise to help all the energies. Everybody stand up. And I'll tell you what, how are you feeling? - Okay. - Okay. But you are the one who said that you didn't feel quite like you were in your body, right? - Yes. - Okay. So I'm going to test you, okay? You hold your arm real strong. Okay. Oh. She just dropped... Weak. Okay. Now, I want to tell you, you did a good job on her because she has not grounded yet. So I think this is going to be true, like, if I test your crown chakra, I'm going to test it like this. Hold your arm, hold it real strong. Okay. Your crown chakra is strong. If I test the crown chakra seventh and sixth together, she loses it. If I test your throat and your heart together, hold with all your might, you lose it. Your heart and your soul plexus, boing, solar plexus. And second, and first. Okay, so we're going to fix you. - But you'll have some of the other ones are in besides the crown. - Oh, well, oh, yes. Her other chakras, you'll see, the good job that was done on her. I mean, she's really strong on everything, everything. But what isn't strong is the communication between them all. And so that's just the next step. So here we go. Everybody rub your hands together and shake them off. Put your hands on your thighs and take a deep breath in through your nose, and out through your mouth. And swing your arms together and put your fingers together above your head. And as you let your breath out, drop your thumbs to the crown chakra at the top of your head. Now take another deep breath in and bring your thumbs to your third eye, and take a deep breath in. Now you're going to skip your throat chakra and come down to your heart chakra. And take a deep breath in, and come down to your belly button and triangle your fingers on your second chakra. Now take a deep breath in and flatten your hands and as you let your breath out, just smooth it all the way down your legs and make a figure eight down here at your feet and go all the way up. And reach up high, turn your hands backwards, and let your arms come down. All right. Now we're going to test you out. Sophie, right? - Yes. Okay, Sophie, I'm going to go boing, boing. Yes. So everything is connecting now. Yay. All right. Thank you very, very much. All right. If anybody wants to know why we skipped the second chakra, I mean the fifth chakra? It's because it's that same reason, the throat chakra is so convoluted with energy so much and Triple Warmer and spleen also govern that chakra. So there is a… It's like almost an insistence on that energy that it will direct what's going to happen there. And we can't direct it. Like, let's see. Somebody. You want to come up here, Jill? Oh, no, I'm going to send you right back, Jill, because she's trying to come up here. I know you're so good about those things. Thank you. Okay. What I want you to do, let me see if you start strong. You do. Okay. So I'm going to go that way and now, okay, you're strong on the whole thing. So we're going to do this. You're going to put your hands right here at the… Nobody else do this, okay? You're going to put your hands, take a deep breath in, and as you let your breath out, we get to the throat chakra. And take a deep breath in and come down to the heart chakra. I'll show you what happens now. She's going to hold her arms and I'm going to tap right there at the first two. It just blows the circuits. You don't get to control the one on the throat. So let's just start, come back up here, okay? And we're going to skip the throat chakra. And come down to the heart chakra. And that's all it will take. It's going to do its work. It's going to do what it needs to do. You don't do it, okay? So let's see. Boing, boing. All right, all right. Thank you. All right, Tanya, we would love to have you come up and lead everyone in energy dance, okay? - But before we do that, we'll just mention that our next session is about the aura. The aura is an energy that surrounds you, it's an energy that protects you, and it's an energy that helps to tune you in to the energies around you. So it's another really interesting and important energy system. So now, Titanya. - Okay. Thank you, everybody. 

====================

LESSON 18 – Questions & Answers for Chapter 6
--------------------
- [Woman 1] So when Jill was working on my chakras, as she was going up, I started feeling a lot of tension right here on my cheekbone, and I can still feel that. So, could you comment on that? - [Donna] You're not just clearing one chakra. The chakras begin to move up into your face and your head. And if you have tension or energy held there already, it moves and pushes against it. So, you know? If I were you, I would do little chakra clearings right on that area tonight when you're laying in bed and clear it all up. But she did a good thing. She really pushed that up into that area. - [Woman 2] So my question is, is there anything we're doing besides moving our hands? Do we hold an intention of clearing? Is that important in this? Or is just moving our hands is good enough? - You know, that's a very good question about whether intention should be a part of this. It can. It certainly can. Somewhere a long time ago, I just began to trust the process of energy and its brilliance of knowing what to do that I just simply moved the energy. But you can use intention if you want. But you don't have to. - [David] And intention... You know, you're coming into the session with an intention, an intention of healing, an intention of really having an experience that is going to be good for your client. So that is the intention that carries things. And I think one of the points Donna's been making is that actually moving the energies, really is adequate for that, you know, carrying out that broader intention. - And I think that because... You know? I had a practice for 23 years. And it was a very full practice. And I had so many people who would come who didn't believe it. So I think I intentionally didn't want my intent to be there except that I just wanted them to experience energy so much and that they would find what a brilliant, holy thing goes on inside them. And so yeah, it's not necessary, but you certainly can do it. Anybody else here? Yes. - [Woman 3] So it's a comment and also a question. When Jill was working on me, at some point, I felt like I could hear you, but I couldn't feel my physical body. So, could you suggest something to help the person that's been worked on to come back? - Okay. As a matter of fact, when we're through with all the questions, we're going to do an exercise to come back. We're going to do that exercise. But in the meantime, if you found that anybody worked on you and you were kind out of your body, hook up, hook up and that will bring you back into your body. Okay, anybody else? Yes. - So I mentioned early on that I was feeling like a current whenever I do energy work with people I get that really strong feeling, but I also see a lot of pictures. And they tend to be... - Hold it closer. - Okay. So I tend to... I see colors and I see pictures that seem to have messages. So I'm just curious. I am clairvoyant and I haven't really experienced that doing energy work because I'm not experienced with this. But do you see that that could be a way to do readings with people or...? - Yes, I'm going to say one thing, and David's going to say the opposite. What I'm going to say is... And the more you do this, you'll find that, I mean, you can't keep your mouth shut. It's so hard because you're picking stuff up, and it's real. And you know it. And what I always did I would really check it out with them. I didn't want to impart anything of mine, but I got more and more to know that this is theirs. It isn't mine at all. And you get better and better at that. But yeah, and David will say... - So, I'm not really going to say the opposite. But I'm just going to say that, you know, where Donna was careful not to project her own material onto the client, you know, you're working on a chakra and you don't know if it's from inside of you, inside of your chakra resonating with them. So if you get an image, it's like a hypothesis. It's something to check out. It's something to be aware of, okay? And maybe you say something then because it's relevant right then. And you might say it as an inquiry. You know? Like you did with the woman, "I'm feeling a lot of sadness right now. Does that resonate with you?" There's a danger with some people do get a lot of images and strong images and of over-interpreting them. So if for instance, you're working on someone's Heart Chakra, and here's what happens in the environment, is far away an ambulance goes by, okay? You subliminally hear the ambulance. You have an image of someone being rushed to the hospital. You're working on the Heart Chakra, and you blurt out, "Oh my God! You're going to have a heart attack." Okay. That's not the way that we utilize those images. We utilize them much more cautiously, but sometimes they are gems. They really have information that's not in the person's consciousness yet that is very relevant. And it if it's coming up it's... You know? They may be ready to hear it. So you just go gently. - [Woman 4] Donna, can I do this technique on myself? And if I do, how do I know which way is counterclockwise and which way is clockwise because I'm a little dyslexic. - You pretend like the clock is inside your body. So... - The clock looks out. - Yeah, so the clock looks out. - And that's how you know counterclockwise. And, you know, most people want somebody else to do it to them because it's so wonderful just to relax into it. But I have had quite a few people over the years who say, "Oh, no! I would not give up doing it to myself every night," and that their health has gotten so much better just by doing that to themselves. And another thing about doing it on yourself is that sometimes something is going on. You have a pain in your chest, and you just choose to do it on that area. Maybe even just it comes as a little first aid. And you saw in our pain session that that was one of the techniques that we use for working with pain is going in the counterclockwise area with small circles. - Yes. - [Man] Donna, can you share another simple technique to connect your chakras to clear and connect through your chakras? - Oh, are you telling me that she didn't get cleared. Did she not get cleared? - No. Actually, I have two questions about that. As we're talking about what you can do with yourself, is there a simple way you can hold your chakras? - I mean, you can hold... I always start somewhere. I start with my hands on one chakra and then one hand will move to another chakra. And it really doesn't take long before they hook up. Like, I could just feel that right then it hooked up that fast. And so that's a really good thing to do. I'll take your second question. But your question reminded me of something somebody else had in here. So go ahead. - Yes, after we cleared the chakras, which were weak before were strong, but one which was strong before, became weak. What would that mean? - You just said the thing I wanted to show. So, could I bring your client here up on the table? And I'll show what happened. Which chakra was it? - It was the first chakra. - The first chakra. Okay, hop off the table David. I need the table. Hi. Lay down. Okay. So the story is... And this is what I wondered about you guys too. Because you started with only two strong and the rest... No, two weak and the rest was strong. This probably is your truth. This isn't really what I'm teaching in here. But if anybody really grabs it and runs with it, it's okay. So her Root Chakra started strong and got weak, is that right? Okay. So I'm just going to tap there. Okay, so she's nice and weak, but she started strong. Now here's what really happened. I'm just going to put my fingers in that field, and I'm going to hold them. Now I can tell you already I can feel myself drop... And I just went. I just went to another layer. And now I tapped, and you hold. And she's strong. You just cleared one layer at least and then you found yourself in another layer. - Thank you. - You're welcome. - One other question. At the Heart Chakra, I felt a lot of heaviness, almost sadness. But it occurred when I was moving clockwise instead of counterclockwise. What might that mean? - You know? Yeah, usually people feel pain or something like that in the counterclockwise movement. But if you feel it in the clockwise, one of two things is going on. Either you're moving it out and things are smoothing over or... Can I check something on you? Okay, I'm just going to put my hands right here. I'm going to see if you're strong. I'm putting it right over your heart. You're fine. I'm going to move my fingers just a little bit, so it's a turn. So she's got a little bit of what I call a dyslexic heart. And what she needs, one simple thing she can do it usually deals with your assemblage point. But you can also do little figure eights here, figure eights here. And then that energy, it doesn't quite turn in the... Now it will. You can just feel it. Okay? All right. - Thank you. - You're welcome. You're welcome. Good-bye. Anybody else? All right so in a moment, we're going to do an exercise that helps all the chakras kind of talk to each other well and have good communication and flow between them. But first, I just want to say two things came up on that chakra clearing, and one was in the throat chakra. And I just want to say it clearly. You can treat the throat chakra just like any other chakra, which means you can just do counterclockwise circles and then clockwise. But so much is happening in the throat chakra you may want to experiment with doing more and that doing more is to really acknowledge that there are seven chambers that go up and down on your neck. And if you come to... You can actually do it to yourself any time. And you can put one hand on the collarbone and the other at the jawbone and stretch and just go all the way across the neck. You just open up the chambers then they're more available to you even on spinning. And the other thing on the Throat Chakra is there's a figure eight that goes sideways. There's a figure eight that goes up and down, okay? It's like a four-leaf clover. There's a lot of energy there. And, yes, it governs expression. But truly, it governs the expression of every chakra giving information to the throat chakra before you ever open your mouth. - But again, if you simply go in the counterclockwise then clockwise directionâ€¦ - We also mentioned the assemblage point. And I mentioned it because I had a client who clearly had something off on her assemblage point. We're not really actually teaching it here. But what it is is think of your North Star, what leads you through life. Carlos Castaneda called it the assemblage point. And it is like that. It's an energy that's out in front of your Heart Chakra that can lead you and guide you. And some things in our life can throw that assemblage point off, and you don't feel your North Star for a while. And that's what that's about.

====================

LESSON 18 - Energy Medicine Live Experience Bonus Call #3: Chakras, The Aura, and Radiant Circuits

Hello, everyone, and welcome to Energy Medicine's live experience call number three. This is our third and final call for this relaunch. We've got an exciting call tonight with Julie Lappin and Kelly Getz, two Energy Medicine faculty members who have been with the program and Donna for decades. So you may remember Julie. She was on the very first call. She's been with Energy Medicine for the last 40 years, serving powerfully. No? Did I get that wrong? 20. 20 years. Okay. 20 years. And, uh, Kelly, Kelly gets, um, she found energy medicine in 2007. It helped her actually get pregnant and heal a lot of other, uh, health issues. And she's been with Donna ever since practicing with, uh, my, uh, the energy medicine faculty. So Julie Kelly, welcome to the call. Great to be here. Great to be here. Thanks, Ezra. I didn't mean to make that weird. No, no, not at all. Thanks for correcting me. I didn't want people thinking I was claiming that. My brain was trying to figure it out and do the math. Do you want to start with a little bit of energy warp before we get into the questions, everybody? Would that be okay? All right. So I noticed that there's a lot of emotional stuff coming up. And Julie and I have been talking that at this time of the year, because we've been in the pandemic for 15 months, that a lot of people are exhausted and emotionally worn out. And so I thought I'd take us back to one of the things we learned early on, which was neurovasculars. So if you would, bring your three fingers together, your thumb, index, and your middle finger. And I want you to find that space about half inch above your ears. And I want you to just take a nice deep breath in. Thank you, Julie. And we are connecting to the spleen neurovascular. This is that part of you that needs to be fed to receive. And so allowing yourself just to take in this energy. You might notice some warmth. You might notice some pulsing. You might notice nothing. But as we connect to these spleen neurovascular, this is that part of you that is allowing yourself to take some energy for yourself rather than giving it all away. And now I'm going to just invite you to take one hand and place it over your forehead as we connect to the oh my God points. And I'm going to invite you to put your other hand on top of your head. When we connect to the forehead, we're connecting to the oh my God points. This is that ability to bring blood flow back to the forebrain so you can think. And on the top of your head, we are connecting to the large and small intestine neurovasculars, the kidney neurovasculars, success neurovasculars. And we're helping our bodies let go. So I want you to just notice what is it that you need to let go of. And breathe in through the nose, out through the mouth. Keeping your hand on your forehead, we're going to take our hand and we're just going to drop it to the back of your head as we connect to triple warmer. I'm a little lower than Julie. Thank you. So we're connecting to triple warmer and large intestine. Again, calming our nervous system down. Taking a nice deep breath in through the nose, out through the mouth. And if there's any panic or anxiety, this is a great one to hold. And just drop your hand down just a little bit more towards the back of the head. You can see Julie there. And this is a great one to let go of any fear about the future. Or any fear of do I know enough with all these eight weeks that I've studied? Have I learned enough? Can I solve my problem? And Julie and I and Ezra really want you to know that yes, you are empowered. And if you keep going and keep learning, you will shift and transform in ways you never imagined. Who knows, you might be on faculty with Julie and I at some point. And the last thing I want you to do is I want you to hold your cheeks, bring your thumb to one cheek and your two fingers to the other. We're just going to help ground a little bit. That's a good way too. Julie's got another way you can hold it. So we all know the stomach taps. And so for women especially, it's harder for us to stay grounded because when we plug into the earth, we want to rise higher. And just take a nice deep breath in. And we'll just close that by bringing your hands to your heart. Thank you. Hopefully that settled everybody down a little bit. I know it did me. That was lovely. And I just want to point out, it was hard to see. She actually had the heel of her hand at the side. That's where those large intestine and kidney neurovascular are. It kind of looked like she had her hand at the top of her head. The top of the head is lung, heart. Oh, I did say it wrong, didn't I? Thank you. To me, it looked like you had, these are the points right here. That's what you were doing. And liver and gallbladder, this is a great, the top of the head is a great hold with the forehead. If you wake up anytime from 11 at night to five in the morning and you want to get back to sleep, this is a great hold to do. Because all the meridians from 11 to 5 are covered right here. Okay, but let's get back to chakras. Radiant circuits, this is such a juicy bit of topics. Ezra, you got a question? Yes. I think you guys were asking me before the call started if I noticed anything that reoccurs with the students. I have noticed this from the last few calls. It's typically about self -energy testing. So I'm going to bring up Nisha to the call. Hi, Nisha. I'm going to make you a panelist. You can turn on your microphone and your camera. She's got a question about testing, self -testing. Hi, Nisha. You are now a panelist. Welcome to the call. Hi. Sorry about that. Thank you so much for taking this question. It's just been so cool. Such a treat to be able to ask these questions. How do you do self -energy testing in some way that's foolproof is the word that I used? I feel like I game the system a bit. You know, like if I really, really want chips. for example, and I'm trying to test whether it's like an okay thing to do or not. So yeah, I just wondered what are your foolproof tips for self -energy testing? You know, that is such a great question. And I really appreciate your honesty too about that because everybody goes through that, right? Let me ask you, is... i mean we basically we normally teach the body as pendulum and the small intestine test which is that leg test um raising the leg and what else did we teach um i think there was a finger one yeah lifting a weight is there a finger one like when you like shut your fingers i can't remember if that was from here or not absolutely not okay oh my gosh okay and and i'll tell you why i mean and And I don't mean to say it that I'm joking when I say absolutely not. But Donna does not teach that because we see so much testing that is inaccurate that people really believe in. And I did too. I used to do that kind of testing. until I got involved with Eden Energy Medicine. And when she said that she didn't use the finger testing because it didn't involve a big muscle group, and therefore it was easier to have your mind interfere, I remember thinking I was going to prove her wrong, right? I was, I mean, not... try to not try to interfere with Donna, but to me, to myself, I was going to prove that I could do it. And I started testing the bigger muscle groups like we test and comparing them to the answers that I was getting with my fingers. And I was shocked at how inaccurate I really was. um percentage wise so i i under i totally understand where she's coming from now um i mean that there are always going to be people who do finger mode testing but um but i have personally experienced that it is easier to shift the answers because we we're human we get invested in the outcome so now i will also say um that The process of learning to get good, get comfortable. It's not even so much good, but comfortable and confident in your testing is really just a matter of time and being willing to go through the exercise of letting go of investment and outcome and expectation, right? So that's part of it. And everybody... Everybody goes through a period of feeling lacking in confidence because it takes practice. It definitely takes practice. And there's no real antidote to that except to just put in the time and go through the discomfort of wondering, am I doing this right? Oh, I'm not sure that answer was right. What I would say, my best advice is to just relax. Don't overthink it and practice more. Every time you test yourself, practice more just saying, I want the right answer for me. You know, I want the right answer because a weak answer is a great answer because it tells you what you need to work on. So I had to practice that. I had to practice being okay, getting a weak answer and embracing that and going, yes, now I know what to work with. That's great because I can retrain it. i can retrain it okay might have gotten a little too enthusiastic about that i also want to say uh oh no okay can i just add real quickly the minute you question whether you're doing it right or wrong you're in your head and so put it aside. If you can stay in your body a hundred percent in your feeling space, you will get more accurate results. And the last thing I want to add to that is if you really want the potato chips and you're going to eat them anyway, don't test the potato chips, eat the potato chips and eat it with love and gratitude. Because everybody goes through this. So you're speaking for everyone when you ask that question. I love it. Thank you. She's right. If you find yourself questioning the results, stop and start over. Stop and get in your body. She was right about that. Okay. Ezra, sorry. Next question. Thank you so much, Nisha. Next up is Tiffany. Are you there, Tiffany? She's got a related question about energy testing. hey tiffany hey can you see me oh hello um i have two smaller kids uh one's three and one six and i didn't know what would be the best way to energy test for them since they're smaller and it'd be a lot easier to overpower them without trying to oh well You know, I started testing my daughter when she was two and I would have clients that were three. They get it and they get it quickly. So if you can use the spleen test that Donna demonstrated, the one where you have your arm out to the side and just show them, I'm going to pull your arm this way. And then you're just going to do a light, a light. Oh, Tug, you want to meet them at their pressure. And if you teach them how to spleen test you, you will be surprised when you're having a moment of doubt for yourself. They will do an excellent job. So always connect one hand on the shoulder and then the other hand on the arm. But young kids are fabulous. They get it and they have fun with it. And it's really easy to just match their strength when you test. Great. Thank you. You're welcome. Have fun. What a great age. We do. We have a lot of fun. All right. Next up to the call is Eva. Eva, welcome to the call. You're a panelist. You can unmute your microphone and turn on a camera. She's got a question for you, Julie. Hi. Do you hear me? Yes. Yes. Hi, Julie. I'm asking you, you told us last time you got rid of your allergies and your asthma by sedating triple warmer. And how often did you do anything? A lot. A lot. And it happens over time. It's about retraining. the meridians. So you can do one of two things. You can either tune in before you do whatever it is that you're doing to shift triple warmer and spleen. You can tune in and see how you feel. Do you feel your body? Because not everybody does, by the way. Not everybody's born to easily feel their bodies. I'm not sure. Okay. So what you can do is just tune into whatever it is that you pick up on. Some people actually need to focus on what's their mental acuity, you know, what's their clarity of thought, what's their vision like, is their hearing good, what is the room like, what are the colors, how bright are the colors. Some people just really don't feel their bodies very much, but if you feel your body. However it is that you tune in, just scan your system, scan your surroundings and notice what is true for you. Then do the exercise and then scan again and see what's changed. If you do that, if you keep doing that, it will teach you what your signals are when you are out of balance that way. Does that make sense? Because if you can notice the change, if you can notice the change, then you'll start realizing, oh, I get it. I feel kind of dull. You know, I feel, I don't feel very alert. Or I'm a bit more anxious when triple warmer is out of balance. right so and uh what if i cannot feel a change yeah well the other thing so the the one there are two ways to determine when you need something right one is to feel it or sense it sense it however you do the other is to test it so um we don't really teach testing the alarm points in uh in this course but we have you can buy the book It teaches how, it shows you where the alarm points are for the meridians. And you can, you can learn to do that. So you can test yourself using these self -testing methods. But I will say to you, honestly, most people are really, most people are really off on triple warmer and spleen when we first start this. So you, you would not be. there would be no problem with you doing it every hour, right? Doing something every hour. And I love going to the radiant circuits. That was really, that really shifted things for me. It made it a lot easier for me to get triple warmer as a meridian and spleen as a meridian more in line. I think of, so meridians, here's how I think of meridians. Meridians are like streets, right? there's streets in the city radiant circuits are like superpowers like so if you have if you think of like a big highway that's suspended above the city i i think of the radiant circuits as being like these superheroes up on this super highway looking down at all the drama going on in the meridian system like west side story you know if you if you know that if you know that musical but you know looking down and going oh man that's a hot mess down there let's use our superpowers right and so this radiant circuit segment that was just taught this week is so powerful and you know donna mentioned it's about spontaneous healing if your radiant circuits are vibrant and alive then spontaneous healing can occur um there are lots of ways to balance triple warmer and spilling those radiant circuits and then they really help move them as meridians one of the quick ways that you can do throughout the day without without feeling burdened because that's the big thing you know when i say to somebody um you could do this every hour, they usually go, oh, you know, right? And we don't want this to feel like work, you know, like, oh, work, we got to do work. What we want to remember is this is an opportunity to change our lives and get connected to health and joy. So one of the things I loved was the one she did, Hands Up Cowboy, where you do this and this, and then inhale and squeeze your scapulas back and just for a breath, you know, and you can follow that up with tapping spleen. You can do that throughout the day. The more you do it, the more you keep it from getting really out of balance and staying out of balance, the quicker it will, you'll retrain it over time. That make sense? Yeah, thank you. I'm only in week six now. So I'm looking forward for the radio. Thank you. You're welcome. Thanks so much, Eva. Up next, we have Amy. Amy, welcome to the call. Hello. Hi, Julie. Hi, Katie. Hey, Ezra. So my question is related to sleep. I notice I very often wake up between 3 and 5 a .m. And it was not at all because of nightmares. I just woke up. during that time and sometimes it would take half an hour even to to fall asleep again and i wonder is that um because of some blockages in my meridian or chakra or what's your idea on that Well, you're waking up from 3 to 5 a .m. in the morning is actually you're waking up during the meridian of liver and seeing that you're consistently waking up from 3 to 5 a .m. during that liver time. Then we're going to look first to liver to get back to sleep. And one of the ways that you can do it is just coming again to those. Oh, my God, point on your head and then bringing your hand on top of the head, because that's where the liver neural vasculars are. Oftentimes with the liver meridian, if you think about it, it is most active at nighttime from 3 to 5 a .m. in the morning. So any of those meridians, when they have their time, that's when they're at high tide. That's when they're at the most active part of the day. So you'd want to look at liver and liver is doing 800 different jobs. So one thing you might also consider before you go to bed, do you remember the expelling the venom exercise? Did you guys see that? Yeah, that's when you actually release, you know, making sure you get to bed by 11 o 'clock at night, which is gallbladder time. And if you release any excess energy with the expelling the venom before you go to bed, that can support you. If you wake up in the middle of the night, you certainly can flush the meridian as an additional thing to do. And one other meridian that you want to look to is the low tide meridian, which would be that 3 p .m. to 3. up to 5pm, which would be the bladder meridian. So you might want to look at the bladder meridian during the day because you can easily see if that needs to be sedated. Oftentimes the bladder can be over -energized if your nervous system is. And so you can look at what is happening during the day where it's easier to work on the meridian. during the day. And you might test that. Again, we suggested getting the energy medicine book. You can get that book. It'll show you where the alarm points are for both liver and for the bladder meridian. Does that make sense to you? Totally. That's so beautiful. Thank you. But these, you know, I can't say enough about neurovasculars. They have helped me through so many things. And I often will fall asleep holding my neurovasculars or wake up in the middle of night holding my neurovasculars because I do it so much throughout the day. It's a quick one for triple warmer as well. So you can use it on roller coasters. You can use it for any kind of stress, but certainly getting back to sleep is a huge one. And yeah, so you can use this to get back to sleep. too. Thank you. Thank you so much. Thank you, Amy. Let's see. Talita was asking in the chat, what was the book that you mentioned? It's the Energy Medicine book. It's the book that made Donna and David travel the world internationally. It's a yellow book right now, and it's just called Energy Medicine. And the fundamentals class that we teach for practitioners is based off of that particular book. So it's a really great starting point. You're never going to want to get rid of it. I mean, I know people that have had that book for 50 years. It'll be something on your shelf. Great. Next up is Verena. Hi, Verena. Welcome to the call. Hello. Can you hear me? Yeah. Wonderful. beautiful um i have a question regarding the clearing of my chakras um so like sometimes it feels easier to go um clockwise and then yeah with others it's anti -clockwise and i feel a big difference in between the two so i'm wondering am i doing it right or what's happening there So the, we, it's interesting because some, I answered a question that week from someone who was talking about, well, I went to this chakra and I, my hands wanted to stop, you know, and it stopped and it held it. And what I, what I wanted to, what I want to make sure that everybody understands is we're doing a particular protocol. that we teach right it's a technique that is specifically first to remove old energy old memories from the chakra and then we go back and we put a new energy back in to replace it so you may and by the way every every layer can be doing a different um sequence at any point in time and they keep shifting right so you might have a moment where you you know if you started out by doing clockwise this way on yourself you might go oh I like that that feels better well it might because your chakra might really be needing that at the moment right we're doing a specific technique that isn't about what that layer needs at that moment it's about going in and removing things specifically. So if you start by going anti -clockwise, what happens is the energy that is in that layer is going to entrain to your hand. It's going to attach to your hand and you're going to be able to unwind that energy that wants to leave. And the chakras will never release anything that they're not ready to release. That's the other thing you can always be assured of. And that's what I like about her technique, because there are other modalities that go in and remove things from the chakra system and the aura. And sometimes the body isn't ready for that. So this allows the wisdom of the body to remove whatever is ready to. be removed that's what will attach to your hand and you you let it remove and then you go back and replace it it's like um it's like if you unscrew a screw out of wood you're still left with a hole right so we're going back in and we we're putting things in the we're putting new energy new fresh lemon scented sudsy energy into what you removed Okay. Wonderful. Did that answer the question? Did that answer the question? I think so. And it's also like, can it change from day to day? It can change from minute to minute. Because each layer will do whatever it needs at that moment. It may say, the second layer of the second chakra may say, oh, I think I need to let some things go, right? And the first layer may at the same time be saying, I need to bring some energy in. So you might notice that a particular thing feels better when you first start doing it, but the technique is different. The technique is the technique. That's different than just connecting with your chakra and seeing what... is up for it right at that moment both are both are perfect okay wonderful thank you so much you're welcome thank you verena okay real quickly amy i said three to five a .m was liver time i do apologize it is actually a long time And it is high tide for lung time. So you're waking up during lung time, which is still holding the same place. And the alternative low tide is still bladder 3 to 5 p .m. So apologies for that. I had liver on the brain. So another one you can look at is what's happening before lung time. I still think that expelling a venom would be really good to release excess energy. So I'm drawn to liver still as well. holding here will both connect to liver and lungs. So apologies for that in correction. And thank you to the panelists for catching that for me. Thank you, Kelly. I've got a question from CJ. She's not on the call anymore, but it kind of relates to Verena's question. She asks, does chakra clearing also remove cords from or to other people? Or can we do another exercise for that? You know, in Donna's work, we really don't touch into cords and connections to other people. If you listen to Donna, she will talk about how she's not afraid of anybody else's energy. She has learned to let that energy just be what it is and pass through her. So when we are clearing chakras and we are doing that counterclockwise clearing, all we're doing is releasing excess energy that we have built up, most likely current energy that has come into us. But the more you... your hookup, you do your Wayne cook, and you fluff your aura with figure eights, or you get yourself some beautiful poi balls, you can get them on Amazon, and you really spend time doing those figure eights around your body, the more your aura is going to feel strengthened and solid. And so you're going to feel less at effect to other people. But chords, we just simply don't worry about in the Eden method program. We're about creating resiliency for our for ourselves and for our clients so that they can be adaptable with whatever they come across. And if your aura is really strong, if you do those figure eights, if you do the Celtic weave every day, if you keep doing that, your aura goes from like cheesecloth to 600 thread count sheets, right? People can't cord you when there's 600 thread count sheets. Right. Thanks, Ezra. Sure thing. Thank you. Marcia, welcome to the call. Thank you. Can you hear me? Yep. Yep. Good. Okay. I had a question from the pain module. I have a neighbor who has struggled with Lyme disease, but she also has inflammation in her hands and her hands hurt a lot. And I've done an energy healing session on her where I can you know work with the whole body and I can draw the pain out but then it'll come back you know in a couple of days and I'm wondering is there something she could do for herself where it's in the hands and the fingers like the magnets wouldn't work but um and meridian she might need somebody else to do so i just didn't know if there was a technique is it joints is it her bones her joints because you know how the joints are swollen sometimes with arthritis and and the fingers curve a little bit yeah so um the um arthritis is you is typically over energy and triple warmer and over energy and kidney and the So I would first have her work with kidney meridian. She needs to sedate it. And that also takes care of swelling. Swelling is kidney meridian, over energy. So since this is early in this core, it's not really covered. She can use the neurolymphatics. So the kidney neurolymphatics, there are a few of them. one is right just past the midpoint and usually if somebody needs it it's sore it's all up and down this line and then the next spot is one inch out and one to two inches you can really use both of these points one and two inches above the navel so one inch out and then go one inch and one inch and you can work that But then also, we don't really label it on the chart. The ileocecal and Houston valves are actually kidney neurolymphatics. We don't label it that way. And most people think of large intestine, but it actually is in an area that supports kidney. So you could show her those as well. Okay. That would help too, because often when the valves are out. it creates all sorts of complications in the body. There's something like 27 conditions that it mimics, and swelling is one of them. Wow. Oh, that's great. That's really good information. Thank you so much. You're welcome. Appreciate it. Thanks a lot, Marsha. And next up is Andrea Wynn. Andrea, welcome back. Hey, Ezra. Your voice dropped out, so I didn't hear who was coming up. Thank you. And so what I wanted to ask about is about using energy medicine techniques for preparing for meditation. I was brought up in a Tibetan Buddhist community and there was significant trauma. There was sexualized violence widespread through the community. So I kind of have this combination of having experienced a lot of trauma and also learned meditation. I do find it difficult to sit and to practice meditation as I've been taught. So having gone through all these weeks of this course, I'm just wondering what you would suggest from all of these different energy medicine techniques that we've been exposed to. What do you think might be most helpful for being able to settle after having experienced a lot of trauma, being able to settle to practice mindfulness meditation in a good way? Yeah, well, first of all, I'm so sorry that was your experience that you were learning something so valuable and it got crossed with something that was not valuable. And I think we all have our journey, whatever it is to grow us and those challenges do grow us. One of the things, you know, just like we were talking with allergies, working with triple warmer on a regular basis. And for you, we can take all of those triple warmer. exercises and start incorporating them all different ones throughout your day on the hour, whatever comes to mind, whether it's holding the neurovascular, whether it's doing the triple warm smoothie, you know, you might want to spend a lot of time before you even consider going into mindfulness meditation, where you really work with triple warmer and spleen together so that those are coming into balance. And, you know, I guess one of my thoughts is, I realized that you were trained in a certain type of meditation, but perhaps considering, you know, grounding and doing a different type of meditation and even using those neurovascular again, because if you hold the neurovascular and you speak out loud, whatever the fear or the trauma is while you're holding them. So simply coming to the head and speaking out loud, you know, I'm fearful of, of, of this meditation and you really emote. any thoughts, any emotions that come to mind as you're considering doing your meditation. And then you want to come to the other side of it. Once you have released as much fear thoughts or panic thoughts or whatever it is that come up for you, when you think of that mindfulness meditation and that trauma, and this is true for someone else that asked about trauma. The more you speak that out loud, when you'll get to a place where you're like, you're just done. You're done with the thoughts. You're done with the negative emotions. Now you want to bring something positive in. So it can be, I courageously trust my ability to mindfully meditate. I am safe now, mindfully meditating. All is well with my meditation. I am empowered. I am within myself. Whatever those words are that come for you, that are going to support you and bring you that reminder that you are your own person. There's nobody around you that is going to interfere with your space because you've created a safe space going into it. I think those would be the things. And I would do this, you know, when you think about that meditation, maybe it's bedtime, you're not even meditating. You don't have to do it when you're meditating. You can do it throughout the day at different times of the day, whenever those thoughts come up. That's what I would start incorporating, plus doing the regular triple warmer spleen work throughout the day. How does that serve you? That's an amazing answer. I really thank you for being touched and speaking in such a rich response. Thank you. Oh, you're welcome. Thank you for being so open. We so appreciate you. And I'm going to send you infinite love and gratitude while you're at it in a big hug. Thank you, Kelly. Yeah. Is there anything you wanted to add, Julie, or is that good? It was perfect. Awesome. Ezra, if I may pray that you post this video as soon as you can so that I can watch it again, I'd be so grateful. I will do that for you. Yes. Thank you, Andrea. All right. Elena, welcome to the call. Hi. Can you hear me? Yep. Okay. I have an issue with my daughter who is 24 years old and had a traumatic injury below the waist about a week ago, and I feel powerless to help her. She has both an emotional and a physical manifestation, and anything that I can do to speed things along would be really helpful. You know, you've got some very powerful techniques, really powerful, deceptively simple techniques that you've already learned. And any injury anywhere in the body, you can really significantly help by first doing anti -clockwise or counterclockwise slow circles. because you're removing the excess energy from it and you're helping to remove pain. But then also do lots of figure eights and have her do figure eights as much as she can think about it. If you did figure eights for... half an hour, that wouldn't be too much. If you did it for an hour, that wouldn't be too much. If you did it for three minutes, every 10 minutes, that's not too much. You know, the more you can think of it, the more you assist the body in speeding up the healing. We've been talking about neurovascular, and these are deceptively simple and profoundly powerful points to move people through. Current and past trauma, right? So what I would do is, what would you say her, she's probably got multiple emotions, but what do you think the top two are? Despondence and just fear. Yeah, and they're related in terms of Meridian. So what I would do is hold the back of the head. You can do this for her. It'll be easier for her to drop into it if she doesn't have to be her own practitioner. So hold the back of the head lightly. You don't want to push at all because you're trying to bring the blood back into the brain. And hold the main neurovasculars. And ask her to feel her feelings. Ask her to feel her despondency. Ask her to feel her fear. And hold the head. And also tell her, when you don't feel connected to it anymore, just let me know. Now, you will probably feel it. Not always, though. But you, especially the more you do it. the more you'll start feeling the pulses. You will feel the pulses when the blood starts filling the capillaries again. The blood comes back to those points. When the pulses match, you are done. And she will probably say, you know what? It doesn't feel compelling anymore. So you just want to hold. the head until she says that she doesn't feel connected to the charge anymore. And then have her go back in and try to try to emote again, try to feel the fear, try to feel the despondency. If there are other emotions like sadness or grief or not being able to let go, that's the top of the head. Anger is the top of the head. What am I missing, Kelly? Gosh, I don't know, but I do have a couple videos I can post just to show how you would hold it on somebody else. I don't know if you have all the emotions. And what you really want to do is get that moving for her now. This is such a powerful time to be able, before her system gets the habit built of being fearful. all the time when she thinks about it being fearful of whatever caused it another thing that you can do we've we've talked about the gamut point i'm pretty sure i remember us doing it in triple warmer between the fourth and fifth fingers this is a triple warmer three it's called the gamut point and if you tap it when she taps it whenever she's feeling anxiety or fear tap it 10 times Stop 10 seconds and then tap at another 90. That can really, really, really help to get triple warmer, calm down, to calm down the anxiety. And also remember, I know we often look to how do I help the other person? The more grounded you stay and the more you work on your own energy. before you work on her energy, then you can hold the space for her to do her healing work. So it's so, so, so vital and important that you stay grounded, you do your energy work. And if you have to pause and say, let me step out and let me come back in, that'll serve her in a big way because you won't be scrambled when you come into the room. Great. Thank you guys. You might also want to consider a session with a practitioner. And we can post, I'll post the link in the discussion thing to find a local practitioner. But a lot of us do remote work as well. If I were in an accident, I would want to get a session with a qualified practitioner because there's so much more that can be done. And it's a rich moment to do it right when it happens. Yeah. You know, there is a question on surgery in the chat, and I think it kind of links up to what we're talking about here because it's that medical thing and it relates to chakras. you know, really key before going into surgery is to do grounding exercise, is to do chakra work. Radiant circuits, because when you think about the radiant circuits, it's going to go, if you've got those lit up, that energy is going to go where the healing's needed. That's what causes those impromptu healing responses is when we're working with radiant circuits. So chakra work, grounding work, all your daily energy routine. Having had surgery a few years ago, I had other people holding my neurovascular before I went into surgery. There is a chart you can purchase and we'll put the link on. It's called the Brazilian toe. You can purchase this chart on Donna's website. I had my husband doing that immediately after surgery and my pain went, it's excellent for pain. It's excellent to send energy through the system. So we'll post a link on the actual community group. So you can see that as well. Great. Thank you, Kelly. And thank you, Julie. That's about all the time we have for tonight. Do you guys have any closing words as the students finish up and complete the quest? Go ahead, Julie. You know, I never realized how much Donna's work would change my life. I certainly never thought I'd be a practitioner. I didn't think I'd ever, I never, wasn't even on my radar to be on faculty, but it. It changed my life so significantly in the first year that I just kept going, right? And even if you never, ever want to be a professional with this, the possibilities are boundless for how much this work can change your life. So I'm so deeply grateful that each and every one of you is here. I'm deeply grateful to Mindvalley, to... such an incredible platform to reach so many people. And I really want to remind you to have a great, just have a ball. Have a great deal of fun as you move forward in this. Yeah, and I just want to add to that and say, you know, this course that Mindvalley and Donna Eden and David have put together is really juicy good. I mean, even every time that I look at it again coming in as faculty, I'm always delighted in the Q &As and in the comments, and I always pick up something new. So even though we've been doing this for years, we're always learning and growing and evolving. And if you're brand new to the work or if you've been in it for a while, it's like stay curious in that curiosity you will find so many golden nuggets for yourself and for other people and you know just allow yourself like Julie says to have fun Julie and I have a show together and we just like to have fun with it because we're always learning we're always involved and the best thing that Donna has given us is the gift of empowerment and so truly Trust yourselves. You really know more than you think you know. And that intuition will just keep building and blossoming. So thank you. Thank you. Thank you for growing here with us. Thank you so much, Kelly. Thank you so much, Julie. And thank you, Tribe, for tuning in for our last call for Energy Medicine. This relaunch, the recording for the last call will be up today. And I will also get the other recording for this call up as soon as possible. Thank you, guys, everyone, for tuning in wherever you are in the world. And we will see you next time.

LESSON 19 – Energy Dance for Healing Chakras
--------------------
Welcome back. I hope you really enjoyed the chakra session, and now I am going to give you some exercises to help set the work that you just did. Let's breathe in, in through your nose, out through your mouth as you cross the energies down. Breathe in again. Cross the energies down. One more time, and this time, you're going to connect up your palms which have chakras in them, as well. Bring them down into your Heart Chakra. Just put your hands on your Heart Chakra, and just sway, giving yourself love. ♪ [music] ♪ And bring down your hands, feeling your feet on the ground. We're going to take your heads to the side, and you're going to make a crescent moon all the way to the other side, and then, bring it back to the side that you started. We're going to open up our Throat Chakra all the way across. You're going to take your hands and put it on the back, and open up your throat chakra in the back. Breathe. Make tiny little angel pinches. We're going to start from the bottom. We're going to make a heart around your Root Chakra, just feeling that Root Chakra of security and safety. Bring it up to your womb, the place of creativity. You might even want to bring in a color that you need. Coming up to your Solar Plexus, the Solar Plexus that is about the identity and moving forward in the world. Come up to the heart, the place of loving yourself and forgiveness, the Throat Chakra of expression, what is it that you want to say in the world, what are... Is your truths. And come up to your third eye, the place of perception and intuition, and come up to the top. Touch the crown of your head. Open it up, up to the heavens. Let's connect up the heart all the way up to the crown, all your chakras. And we're going to come back the other way. We're going to breathe in. Connect your fingers. Let it go to your Crown Chakra. Breathe in. Come to your third eye. Breathe in. Come to your heart. Breathe in. Come to your Second Chakra, and triangle your... Diamond shape your hands. Come all the way down, grounding in. We're just going to bring it up, zip it up, and governing up the back, over your head. Just give yourself a nice hug. Let's open it up wide again. Go the other way. Give yourself a nice hug and just one more time bringing it up. Connect back down into your Heart Chakra, into the essence of who you are and what you are going to do in the world. Each of us is unique, and that is an expression that we can step forward within the world to share with others, so that you can allow others to let their own light shine. Thank you.

LESSON 20 – The Aura - Your Energetic Space Suit
--------------------
- [David] Welcome back to our seventh session already. And it's so good to be getting to share this with you. And as we've done each time, we're going to start with The Daily Energy Routine. But this time, when you tune-in, we want you to, yes again, notice the sensations in your body and your mood. But also something else. Notice how there is an energy that surrounds you. There is. It's an electromagnetic field. And notice it. See if you can sense into it. You may or may not be able to, but see if it's there and get a sense of its quality, the quality of that field that's around you. - [Donna] Right. Okay. Daily Energy Routine, everybody. So we're going to... Are you going to stand up? Okay, just take your hand on the opposite shoulder, push in hard and pull across. Yeah. I bet, there's not as much to pull across now, is there? That's right. Okay. And now, we're going to do the four thumps. Down the K27. And thymus thump. And spleen points. - Breathing in through your nose and out through your mouth. - Okay. Cross crawl. We're going to cross crawl. And again, this just helps the energy crossover. All right, Wayne Cook. We're going to sit down and do this one this time, okay? Do the longer version. We're going to put the right foot over the left knee. And if you can't do this, of course, do the shorter version, okay? Left hand around the ankle. Do you want to stand up and do the other one, just in case somebody needs it? - I'll do the other one, in case somebody needs it. So you probably have done this several times. But you like that, like that, like that, like that. And then, cross at the ankle if you wish to. - Okay. right hand around the bottom of the feet and in front of your chair. In front of your chair. And we're going to breathe in through our nose, and out through our mouth. Okay. Put your legs down, go up on the other side. - So everybody in the room is really stretching up on the in-breath. And I hope you are, out there back home. - Yes. Put your legs down and put your hands and your fingers meeting in a cathedral with the thumbs at the third eye, and do the same breathing. One more time. And now, bend your fingers into your forehead, push in hard and pull them across to your temples. And now we're going to keep on going. We're going to do the crown pull. Come up to the hairline, push in and pull apart, and then follow the top of the head, just push in and pull apart. Push in and pull apart. And continue to do that all the way around the turn of the head and the back of the head, and when you get to the neck, you push in and pull to the sides, two or three times. And then hold on your shoulders. Take a deep breath in, let your breath out and come to your heart chakra and just hold. All right. We're going to do neurolympathic reflexes. I'll tell you what, this time let's do our lungs in here, all right? In between the rib cage. And notice if they hurt. If they hurt, you need it. And then the sternum. And then, the rib cage. This is small intestine. And sometimes, after you've eaten, it might be a little sore. Yes? Okay. All right and everybody, pull up an affirmation if you want to. And put it in as you zip up all the way to the bottom lip. Now going all the way up, trace it up the back as far as you can reach and then reach over, pull over to the top, over the nose to the back of the throat. And now hook yourself up. And you're ready for our class. You know, that's the truth, what I just said. Because nothing's scrambled now. Everything is flowing as it should be, which means that you can absorb information and everything a lot easier. Okay. - So again, tune in, and has anything changed in your body? In your mood? And also, tune into that electromagnetic field that surrounds your body. It may be more vivid to you because you've just energized your body, or it may have a different quality. Is anybody... Who's able to actually sense it? Who is able to actually sense that there's this field around you? Okay, many of you. Who felt that that field changed in some way from doing this? Many of you. Good. Okay. So that field is the topic of today's session. And it is called in many ancient and modern spiritual and healing traditions, the aura. Okay. You see it, the aura, in religious paintings. The aura is talked about in many, many traditions using different language. But they're talking about something that surrounds you. And in modern science, it's been detected and talked about as the biofield. And this aura or biofield has a number of functions, but its main one is to protect you. It's to protect you and to help you to provide an environment within which you can thrive. It also connects you with the energies that are in the environment that surround you. And very interesting how this works. There's two very different metaphors that help us understand the aura. One of those metaphors is as a spacesuit. That it's our invisible spacesuit that is protecting us from environmental energies that are not in harmony with us, not in resonance with us, not good for us. The other analogy is, it's an antenna doing just the opposite of what the space suit does. The spacesuit is keeping energies out. The antenna is tuning in to energies that feed us, energies that we need, people that are going to be nourishing for us, things in the bigger atmosphere that are going to be nourishing for us, bringing in the energy of the moon, the energy of the sun, bringing in whatever energies our bodies are needing, our bodies are craving. So there are these very different metaphors that both capture a bit of what the aura is about. And we'll be learning about the aura today but I want to, before turning you back over to Donna, tell you about one other very interesting piece of science which is that, in the 1940s, a physiologist at Yale University named Harold Burr, loved to tinker with electronic things. He just would build electronic gadgets and he figured out a gadget that could measure the voltage that comes off of creatures. And he was working with salamanders. So his early work was with salamanders and it turned out that salamanders have this measurable electronic field around them. So that was interesting enough. In the electronic field, he could actually see from the field where the spine was, and where it connected with the other parts of the salamander. It was visible in the field. And he said, "Well okay, that's very interesting. I wonder when that develops." So he began looking at younger salamanders to see when it developed. And younger ones, and younger ones, and younger ones. And he found something that was amazing. Which was that the younger ones had basically the same size field as the mature salamander. Isn't that odd? He went all the way back to the unfertilized egg, and that unfertilized egg had the same field as the mature adult. That's remarkable. It's as if the field is there and then the body develops into that field. It's like the field provides a blueprint for what's going to happen. And that solved the mystery. Because we understand that genetics gives you the programming for all the parts, but we never really had a way in biology to completely explain how a cell in the leg knows to become a leg cell, and how a cell, somewhere else becomes the kind of cells it's meant to be. How does it all organize itself, and Burr really gave us a way to understand that this field is organizing the physiology to help it grow. And he took it even further because he started looking at humans. And he looked at all kinds of creatures, but he looked at humans. And he found something even more interesting which is that illness showed up in this field before it manifested in the body. So he did an amazing experiment in Bellevue Hospital in New York. For about a thousand women who came with gynecological problems and who were not knowing what the basis was. So they measured the energy field, and then they get the diagnosis. And he was able to predict with about 90% accuracy, who had cancer, who would turn out to have cancer based on this field. That got written up in the annals of science, major, major medical journal, and then promptly forgotten. Because we don't have any paradigms to really understand this, to think this way. So that work was forgotten for many, many years. And now, with energy medicine and other complementary health, they're starting to look at that work again and see, "Can we replicate that?" And so that's... So it's not only a modern thought, it goes back, way back, to ancient Chinese medicine. In many provinces, you paid the doctor when you were healthy. You didn't pay the doctor when you were sick. When you were sick, the doctor had to work on you, the doctor had to try to get you better, and work really hard, but you didn't pay extra for that because the doctor had already failed you by the time you were sick because the doctor's job was to keep your energy field healthy. And if you keep your energy field healthy, then the body stays healthy. What Burr found out is that the energy field becomes unhealthy before the body becomes unhealthy. So it's got tremendous implications for Energy Medicine to understand these fields and the aura is the key pin in understanding this. So as you know, there's nine energy systems that Donna worked with, but the aura is the one that surrounds us, that surrounds all our other energies. - Thank you. You know, I was thinking as you were talking that, I mean when I look at all of you, I mean, every one of you have a very different aura than each other. I mean, you're very, very different. Some auras go way, way out, some come in, kind of collapse in, some have some holes in them. And everybody has lots of different colors and diagrams and figure eights in your field. Our aura has at least, seven layers out. So each layer is a very different experience of what it means to you. And all of it together makes you. I mean, it really makes you. Maybe I'll just name them. You know, first is your etheric field, which is kind of like, it mirrors your spirit. It mirrors your spirit. And around that, is a protective mist, and it protects you from any onslaught trying to come at you and get you. And you're protected as much as that one's strong. And next is the feeling-mental band. And that's where you could see all of your sensory systems in that band, whether you’re more mental or more feeling or whatever you are, it'll show up in that field. And then, comes morphogenic band. It's like a template of your rhythm, your values, your things that are deep in your soul, really show up there. And if you're going to change, if you're going to shift, it will really show up in that band. It'll show up. Very strong if you're going to go through a major shift in your life. You hold your habits in there. But it's also your rhythm that is so much more than a habit. It's from probably conception on, your rhythm. And it'll show up there, okay? The celestial band, to me, is more like a wisdom band. But it is also, it is your wisdom that, I believe, you've carried in this time around. But it also opens you up to the spirit and into the universe. And whatever is in your celestial band and reaching out far, shows up there. So a lot of people who are really in deep prayer, they have a very strong band there. Okay. Okay, I'll just speak a little bit about life colors because they are so important. When I look at somebody's field, I'm looking to see which is the band that does not shift and change regardless of what they're going through, and it's an outer band. And it has a color that belongs... It’s their life color that they were born with and they die with. And if you meet somebody else along the way that has your life color, you have a vibration very similar, on some level with them. There is something very similar and you will recognize each other, usually. And yes, the life color is actually really important. And I think it has more to do with your spirit, your soul, your everything. Everything about you is the life color on some level. Because it's the big lessons, it's the big challenges you have to go through life with and you're meant to learn your challenges. But sometimes it takes a lifetime. And when you do, it's wonderful. You shift in a way that sets you free. - And it has to do with basic themes that govern your life. The people of the same life color are... They may be very different in every way except for, their life is running through a particular theme. The theme might be more a theme of mothering or it might be more a theme of spiritual leadership or organizational leadership or community leadership. And what's interesting to me about this is that Donna sees it in color, and it's talked about by other people as a color. So it's experienced as a color. But what is color? Color is what our eyes translate from a vibration. So it's a vibration that is there in this field that surrounds everything else. That's the vibration that's there. So it's really quite fundamental and important. But all of these, all of these layers that Donna's talking about make up the aura. And they may seem like, "Gosh, this is so very, very, you know, complicated." But the energy body is complicated. It's because the physical body is complicated. Think of how much complication there is with all our different systems, all our cells and organs and all that's going on there. Well, of course, if we agree that the energies are governing all of those, of course, the energy body would be complex. But we can put it all into a simple term, the aura, and work with it as the aura so that we don't get overwhelmed with all the parts of it. But just that little map, I think, is very useful to have in the back of your mind. - And the last one, the last band around the aura is the Celtic Weave. And it literally weaves everything together and it looks like a lot of figure eights out there far, and it also weaves into the body, it weaves into the chakras, it weaves into every energy system in the body. So it's really important. All of these bands have extraordinary meaning. And they really... They're part of what makes you, you. Okay now, I would like to energy test something. I would like somebody... I would like two people to come up. And here's who I... You want to come up? Okay. And the other person I want to be... Let me see. Should I pick the person or you, guys, can... I should pick it. Okay. All right. Would you like to come up? Okay. All right now, I'm going to show you something. Okay. I'm going to energy test you like this. You hold your arms strong and I'm going to push them down. Nice and strong. Now, I'm going to come way out here. And you're... Okay. I'm going to come and see where that ended. I think it was probably around your fingertips. Let me see. Yeah, you're fine there, and you go a little bit further. So that's just basically how far your aura goes out, okay? But you've got a nice strong aura. All right now, you. And I've got... There's a reason I've got you both up here this same time. You hold your arm real strong. Okay. Now, I'm going to just... On you I'm going to go right here about three inches in from your wrist, okay? And hold your arms. Now, they both have... And by the way, because this is a class, it may be simply the class that the reason that your aura comes in. But sometimes, you know, we're in a social situation or something that our aura will collapse in on us, and it's protective. It's protective too. But if you'd like your aura to go out further, I'm going to show you how. And if you'd like... And your aura's going to... I want to show you something else about you, okay? All right. So she is nice and strong, okay? But now, I'm just going to go like that, okay? Some of us... I do this too. Some of us disconnect. There is a disconnect between your aura and your body. And so, it's one of the ways that you could be vulnerable, that things could get you because... I mean, you got a great aura but your own self disconnects from it sometimes. I don't know if that makes any sense. It does. Okay. All right. And you, you don't. You've got no problem like that. I can... You're fine that way. But yours is just collapsed the other way. Okay. So here's what we're going to do. For you, I'm going to give you "the butterfly" okay? The butterfly. We're going to take your arm, and there goes a wing. Another one. All right. And when you do that, again, your energy is electromagnetic, so you take it out to the field. Now, let me see how far you go. First, I'll go to where you were. Now, I'm going to go to here. All right. I got to move you out of the way. Okay. So that's how far, but you can see it. You can pump your own field out further, and it really changes your experience. For you, we're going... I want you to do the opposite. Do the "Reverse Butterfly," with your thumb coming straight down your body, okay? With your thumb coming straight down. Not you, though. Now, you're going to... You're always going to have... That's enough. You're always going to have an aura that goes out far, okay? So even though you are bringing your aura in, it doesn't do it. But what it does do, is it re-attaches you to your body. - [Woman 1] Wow. - Thank you. - Thank you. - You're welcome. All right. You're welcome. All right. The reason why... Where are you? There. The reason why your energy detached. For a lot of people who are just really out there in the world, and sometimes a habit grows that your energy goes out further and further and is very connected to other people, but then sometimes, you're disconnected from yourself a little bit. And it's harder to come home to self or it's harder to find yourself or it's harder to... Or maybe you just pick up stuff. You can pick other people's stuff if you're detached. A long, long time ago, I had a wonderful teacher. And he was... He loved to, what is it called? Parachute out of airplanes, and he really loved it. And he loved the experience of what it does to your aura and things like that. But with the huge classroom, he said, "Dad, this is for everybody but you. Don't ever parachute out of an airplane because you'll fall right out of your aura. You'll get so detached." And I realized why that's true. That's what happened to me. I'd fall right out of my aura. Okay. All right, Judith come up here. All right, Judith. Now, one of the wonderful things for everybody and for holes in your field, for tares, for anything like that, this is really good. And you hold your arm real strong. Okay, Judith, I'm going to check you out right about there. And right about there. So I'm just slicing her field and you see. So you can see how much an aura affects your own body. I mean, it's about... It's yours. It's as much a part of you as your physical body. And we just are connected in. But you lose your strength when... Yeah when you lose your strength. So we're going to rub our hands together. And this one is also really good for attaching by the way. And shake them off. Put your hands on your thighs, and take a deep breath in through your nose and out through your mouth. Now, swing your arms together in a kind of prayerful position. And now, rub them together again. And then, just pull your hands apart, and you might feel the energy between them. There's something... It becomes more and more palpable. Now, take a deep breath in and put it up beside your ears. Now, take a deep breath in and bring your elbows together, cross your arms, out, and then bend over, and cross them, swing it out, cross it in front of your ankles, and swing it out. Now, turn your arms toward the front, bend your knees just a little bit, scoop it up, and put it down the front, sides and back of your body. That is a great thing to do. Okay, you can sit down. Let's see. And I'll show you what happened to Judith. We're going to go to the end. I know, you're there. So let's see. This is a great thing to do if you want to... If you feel that your aura isn't really strong and around you. And how you can know when your aura is strong is, I don't know. If you just feel confident, most of the time. If you feel like you can walk in to any space and your aura is really, really strong around you. But if you want it stronger, you do this. Okay, now we're going to see how much she got. You'll just keep going. That's great, Judith. Okay. We had a woman go through our program, our schools for a long time, and she was always repeating because she was so depleted and so frail and so weak. And she said that this made her feel better than anything else, but she still wanted to be at peak performance and feeling. And so, she challenged me in a class. It was a large class, and she challenged me in it because she wanted to really be in great shape. So I'm looking at her and I think, "Gosh. I mean, she had just done the Celtic weave, and her aura was shot." I said, "What does she need?" And that's what you want to do when you get into Energy Medicine, get as curious as you can. Get as curious as you can and figure out, you know, what would work here, what can I do. And just try things out. So for her, so much of her aura collapsed in on her and I just had her put her hands like this and very slowly, just push her field out. Now, if you do that yourself, you will probably feel it. I will suggest you do it. Just feel it. If you go slow enough, you can feel that you're in something or pushing against something. And basically, I had her do that all over, everywhere you can. And then when she got out there, she just sort of, she said she swam in it. She swam in it. And everything turned around for her, and it was interesting to me that there's so many things you can do to the body and so many things. But people have different things. That is the reason that they don't have all the vitality they want. And for her, it was the aura. I'm going to show you something else. I got into real trouble once, back in the 90s. I got what... For lack of a better word, I called it "I had electromagnetics." Because they were frying my circuits, and I literally mean that. We lived in a house, and I had to be out of the bed by 2:00 or 3:00 in the morning because the energy from the earth was electrocuting me, and it was. And I mean, in the morning, my arm wouldn't bend and it would be real, real swollen on both arms. And my legs hurt. And it turned out there was an underground river underneath our house, and it hit every socket in the house, and I got it. But it was really hard because I had a practice, and I had no aura anymore, and I knew it. I knew my aura was gone. And here's how I began to build an aura again. Because there was nothing there. I can only promise you, something else was keeping me alive. I don't know. It's just energy work, I suppose. But taking a magnet and spinning out into the field and back, just back and forth in every direction, in every level of my being from top to bottom, every which way. And slowly, I began to build an aura. - It was a real problem because we didn't know really what was going on. All that we knew was that Donna was having a lot of trouble and we thought, "We all maybe it's the bed." That was our first guess, and so we had experts from Sealy come and look at the bed and say, "You need to exchange this bed." And they said, "No, all the bed tests out fine." Then we actually bought three different top-of-the-line mattresses in a very short period of time. And then- - Because when I'd lay in the bed, it would feel like being I was being drawn into the earth. And on the bed, all I kept thinking was the bed must be breaking down. Already? The bed is breaking down. - And then, it really occurred to us that this has something to do with the electromagnetic fields. But we didn't know what, and we didn't know how to figure that out. And so, the next thing we did was, we found a guy who had worked for NASA, and he was now retired and was working as a consultant doing the kinds of things he did for NASA. And what he did for NASA is, he was the one who was responsible to minimize the impact of all those electromagnetic instruments that are in a spaceship from impacting the astronauts. So that was his job, that was his specialty. And he came out to our house and he had a way that he would figure things out and look at the electrical sockets, and what, you know-- - He had these little meters. - Yeah. It's the very instrument, and we heard him say, "You're the toughest case I've ever had." He knew something was happening but it had something to do with the house and it had something to do with Donna and her energetic. - I mean, it clearly was me too, because I had to sleep in other places trying to find a place I could sleep, and there was no place. Because I had no aura left. And he nailed magnets all over my house. And it was just wasn't enough. So I took the magnets. Okay, so the bottom of your feet is a south directed, okay? And the earth is north directed. So I wanted to stop the energy from the earth from coming in, so I took this. This is a south, so I put another... I put the north out, north facing out. And it would repel the earth's energies. That was the beginning. Because until then, I couldn't bear the pain that would come into my body every night. So what I'm trying to say is regardless of what you're going through, you can figure it out. - And that aura was not just a theoretical concept for her at that point. She had an aura, then she didn't have one. And life got a lot worse. - Yeah. Yeah, I didn't have the protection when I would be working on people. And again, I couldn't work until about 2:00 in the afternoon because my arms would not work. They just were so swollen. But what was very interesting, I was teaching a lot in Australia at the time and the first time I went to Australia after all this was going on. I found that that was very common there. Everybody understood you could have this problem and there would be clinics in different main cities because Australia is the oldest continent, and the top layer was going and people were getting absolutely... What? - The magnetic field of the earth was coming through more strongly and impacting people more strongly. That has always been the "canary in the cave" in a sense that it was very sensitive. So whatever's going on, it will register in her body. - But aren't you glad? Because here I am teaching it to you. - Yeah, Energy Medicine was her survival, technically. - Yes, it really was. It really was. - Yeah, so this is about as high-tech as Donna gets. This is a RadioShack magnet with dental floss around it. Okay, this is... And these have a hole in them so that you can put the dental floss through that so that you can spin it. And that's one of the ways that you work with the aura. - Yeah, back and forth in the aura. And later when my aura had gotten stronger, I did put it on a crystal. Then, we just sort of smooth things out and it would pick up vibrations that were fabulous, you know on this. So it was really good. But it didn't work until I could get the magnetics out there again. - That's why magnetics are stronger than a crystal but the crystal is a more subtle kind of energy, and you can use natural crystals but this is a cut-glass crystal and it's designed so that there is a place where you can put a string in the top of it. That's a more subtle way but both of these can be used for strengthening your aura in the way that Donna was showing. - Yeah. I will also say to just to let you know how much it affects your body. No acupuncturist who did... I went to several people seeing if somebody else could help me, and acupuncturists could never find my pulses. They simply weren't there. - When her aura had been stripped. - Yeah. So okay. - So in terms of the aura being there to protect you from all that's around you and from the energies of people. Who here, more than most other people, has the experience that people's energies really get to you? They really impact you. You're at work, you're at a mall, all kinds of places. So about... Look at that. About half the group is raising their hand. And that, in part, that's why you're attracted to Energy Medicine, is because that's a sensitivity. That's a sensitivity that is a gift. That attunement to the energies of your environment, that sensitivity that is also a hazard, in its essence is a great gift, and Donna has both of it. She has the gift side and the hazard side. She has to work really hard to survive in this world. And now, she's gotten much better. Yeah. No. I mean that's what her work has done, it's just really strengthened her. - I needed this work. - She needed this work. You know, people don't get MS when they're 16 because they have an energy system that is like rock solid, they get it because of their sensitivity. So that sensitivity has been Donna's path in life to figure out, as I learn how to strengthen myself I can also help others. And there are a number of techniques that are quite straightforward that you can use to really protect yourself better when you're going to a shopping mall or when you're in a business meeting or when you're in a conference or at a party. And so, I'm going to work with one person to show you one of the most basic of these. Then everybody out there and everybody in the audience raise your hand. Everybody really because we all run into situations that bombard our energies, can practice it so you'll all wind up knowing the technique. So, Donna, I want you to choose who I'm going to work with. - Well, I'm going to pick... Who first rose your hand. Yes. Yeah. - Okay. Tell me your name again. - [Teresa] Teresa. - Teresa. Okay so, Teresa, what we're going to do is to work with what's called "central meridian." And we've already been zipping it up, so we already have some experience with it from the 5-minute routine. But central meridian, remember, is also part of that microcosmic orbit between central and governing meridian. And that then becomes move... That's the out there, it's part of the aura. So it's there, you want that to be really strong to protect you, okay? So we're going to play with that a little bit, okay? So you're okay with this? - Mm hmm. - And you're okay being in front of everybody? - Sure. - Okay. So come on over here. And I'm going to show you the test for central meridian, okay? Every meridian has its own energy test. So you're going to press up, and I will press down. Okay, so it's nice and strong. And now, as you know, you can trace the meridian forward or backward. Okay so, and since it's strong, and it goes this way, I don't need to trace it forward to make you stronger but I'll trace it against the flow of the meridian, and let's see what happens. So, you don't lose all your energy but you lose enough that it's okay. So now, what we're going to do is let's get you strong again. Okay. Good. I'm going to step back a little bit, and you can affect the meridian with your eyes. There's a lot of ways that you can affect the meridian without touching a person. And you can just... Sometimes your thoughts can affect them. Now, with your eyes, I'm looking down the meridian. And now, test it. Okay. Now, looking up the meridian. Really strong. So you're like most people, you're very responsive to that. And there are cultures that really understand this. So, in the martial arts, for instance, how do they start? How do they start? They begin by strengthening their own central meridian, and weakening their opponent, okay? You know that... See... It's not just because it's cute. They know what they're doing. Okay. So that's one of my favorite stories with Donna was when Titanya and Dandi were in high school, the varsity, it's a small school, the varsity of football coach was a P.E. teacher, and he tried to get the girls to get Donna to come to work with the team. So Donna agrees and she comes in. And you know, this big hulking guy is just looking down at her. And she goes up to the biggest meanest looking one and says, "I want to show you something. Give me your arm." And I'm going to do the general indicator just he says, "Look at that, look how strong you are." And he goes "Grrr." And then she goes. And so, their reaction was, "Well, can we do that to the other team?" But that's not what we're teaching you. We're teaching you how to do it to yourself so the other team can't get you, okay? So that's what this is about. So now, if you're ready, we're going to turn it to the audience, okay? Okay. - Oh, I'm going to stay with you? - Yeah. You're going to turn to the audience and with your permission now because they're going to be messing with your energies, is that okay? - Sure. - Okay. So we left you strong, all right? Yeah, okay. So now, what I'd like you to do is to think, not about her, but think a negative thought. Just think something that bothers you, something that's hard for you. Okay, so that's why you're up here, right? Because that's what happens to you. Okay. Now think a positive thought. Okay. Really strong. So that's what you need now, you need to hang around happy, healthy people and you'll be fine. Thank you very much. No. No, we're not done yet. Okay. So now, we're going to do a little experiment. It's a kind of single-blind experiment. It's not science but what we're going to do is I'm going to have people either... When they go like this, you're going to look her up the meridian. Okay, the meridian goes from the base of the body to the lower lip. And when I go like that, you're going to look her down which would weaken her. But you're going to have your eyes closed if that's okay. Is it okay for them to be looking you up and down? Okay. Okay. Okay. So, go ahead and close your eyes. Just to make sure you're strong still. Okay, you're nice and strong. Okay. So okay, I'm going to test you. Okay. Good. I'll test you now. Okay, not bad. We're going to test you. You got three for three, were you peeking? No. Okay. - Should I turn around? - So, did you feel it? Sometimes you can even feel when they're looking you up or down. Could you feel it in your body? - Third time I felt really sweaty, but I don't know that's connected to it. - You feel really sweaty? So something was happening physiologically. So that was interesting that you were... You know, that what they did impacted you even though you didn't know what they were doing. And it was very simple. They weren't thinking something negative, they weren't going near at all. They were just looking down or up the meridian. Okay so, all that is build up because the technique is so simple. It's so simple that you'd forget it if I just taught it to you. With all that build up, maybe it'll be easier to remember. And that is, that we've been doing the zip-up, okay? We've been doing that already. We're going to add a dimension to it because the zip-up is the meridian that is most affected by self-suggestion, it's the meridian that's involved with hypnosis. And so, it's the meridian that we're working with. There's actually two meridians that are involved with the central nervous system. One is bladder which goes to the third eye of yoga theme, and the other is central. They both have to do with the central nervous system but this one, central, is really involved with suggestion as well as the Microcosmic Orbit. So in terms of suggestion, what you're going to do is you're going to not only zip up, but you're going to imagine there's a lock there and a key, and you're going to lock it and toss the key into the ethers, So let's do that. There you go. Okay, now do that in your imagination only. Okay? Good. So let's test you. So you're not surprised, I know you're strong. We'll do a central test. Very good. Okay. Now, here's the punch line, okay? Is I'm going to have them really try to weaken you with all they've got. Are you okay with that? - Sure. - Okay. So go ahead and face them and in your imagination, zip up once more to reinforce it. - Okay. - Okay? Okay. So now what you're going to do is I want you to really try to weaken her. Because I want her to know whether or not she can withstand a group of 20 people that are really trying to bring her energies down. So you can look her meridian down, you can think negative thoughts, you can do whatever you want, okay? And you can have your eyes open or closed, whichever you prefer. Okay. So I'm going to just step away. Okay? So go ahead, and give her your best shot. - You're still smiling. - So stop smiling and give her... Really get into it. Really, seriously give her your best shot. Okay, stop. This is the moment of truth. So that was... So thank you for coming up here and being vulnerable that way, and now, what I want you to recognize is that this group, is worse than any party you're ever going to go to, which you just withstood. You know, there was focus on you, was trying to weaken you, and you were there, meeting it all. So it's really worth remembering. And for those of you that raised your hand that aren't up here, it's that simple and it's that powerful. The other thing you want to do, there's two things. One is this is the Microcosmic Orbit through zip up, and the other is keep your aura strengthened. Do the Celtic Weave. So that's the outer job is the aura, the inner job is central meridian, okay? So before you go, we're just going to give you a really great hit of positive energy, okay? So you were negative so, give her your best appreciation for what she just came up here and did. Okay. Thank you.

LESSON 21 – Questions & Answers for Chapter 7
--------------------
- So, you said that one of the auric layers helped us connect to the energies of our environment. And sometimes, our cultures or our communities get a big shock. How can we remedy a shock like that, that we've received as a community? Do we just strengthen our own Central and do the Celtic Weave? - [Woman 2] Hold it closer, and ask again. A little bit closer. - So, through the aura, we're connected to the energies that surround us in our communities and in our world. When the world receives a big shock, what do we do ourselves? - [Donna] Hmm. I am definitely going through that one right now. So, I mean... - [David] Well, so much of it is that by keeping your aura balanced, by doing the Celtic Weave, by keeping all your energy systems balanced, that makes you much more resilient. It makes you much less vulnerable. So, even though that band is designed to connect and to resonate, it's going to be resonating with what is being led in. And so, if what's being led in is the more positive side, that's the internal part, that's going to feed you. That doesn't solve the world's problems. It doesn't solve all that we're going through, but what it means is that you can meet the world's problems whole. You can meet the world's problems with a full deck. So, it doesn't make those lesser easier, but it means that you can respond to them with everything that you have. - And I'll add a little bit. Because this last week, I saw so many people who were really... They looked like they were in shock, and in mourning and everything, and so was I. And... But I found myself... - This was the week after the US election. - Yes, the week after the US election. But I... And people looked... Their energies looked so scattered and sometimes just almost gone. And I found myself just doing this a lot, figure eight-ing them. And it was good for me, and I know it was good for them. And it was very hard when you meet somebody in the elevator and we were all... But I found myself figure eight-ing them and it really helped. And one person said to me, "It's like I have the same PTSD I had when the Vietnam war was going on. And I don't know what had just happened, but I feel better, and I thought, good." Yes. A very good thing to do when you feel overloaded with all of the things going on, is to do the Blow-Out. And I'll just repeat how it goes. You just put your arms out in front. Make a fist. Think of what you need to Blow Out and swing it. Swing above your head, and then blow it out. And do this at least twice fast and maybe twice really slow and controlled. And by when I do it slow and controlled, you can feel things move, and so, as a very good thing to do. And, what is interesting is even though it looks like you're blowing things out, your aura doesn't get smaller. Suddenly, you've got space in your field around you and it's good for you. Yes? - [Woman 3] This was not just a question, it was a comment too. - Okay. - The other thing you've taught that relates to this is spooning the feet. Because it well prevents medics - Spooning the feet. Yes, have we taught it in here? Did we teach it? Did I teach it in here? - Yes, you did. - Okay. - Yeah, you did. - Yeah, you taught. - pause and then new sentence. - Okay. I just don't remember teaching it in here. I did. All right. Spooning the feet. The spooning the feet, you know, it's above that Microcosmic Orbit that goes around your body and hooks to the earth and comes up over again. So, if you don't have that connect, if your polarities are off, so if you spoon your feet, it just really clears and your polarities get straightened up. - [Man] Dona, when would I want to fluff my aura, and how would I do it? - Well, fluffing the aura is a wonderful thing to do for yourself. For me, I just do it when suddenly the spirit moves me. You know it's like I'm down... I may be down here on the ground, and I'm ready to do an exercise, and I'll think... Let's say may be I'd come up spleen meridian or figure eight, I'll go, "Oh my God! I need to fluff." That's when I know. But, when I look at other people, they look like there is a certain buoyancy in the aura that you like to see, a certain buoyancy. And the person, by the way, if there is no bouyancy, that person doesn't feel very buoyant. And so, if you're not feeling buoyant, fluff your aura. Okay? - [Woman 4] So, we learned in this session that if you look someone down that you can negatively impact their energy field. If I were to do that to someone and negatively impact their energy field, am I also negatively impacting mine? - Oh. Well, I believe if I did it, it would negatively impact me. That's what I know. Just because it doesn't feel good to do that to another person. It just doesn't feel good. Many, many years ago, I worked with different athletic teams and the volleyball team, that... They made it a part of their entire practice to always look each other up, and they looked the team that they were playing, up. So that they all had more energy, which I always loved. - [Woman 5] So, going along with what you were just talking about, teachers are always looking down at their students. Has there ever been a suggestion of having teachers on the same eye level, or as adults when we're looking down at children? I mean, it seems like everybody should come eye to eye. - Oh, thank you for saying that. That's so true. Maybe, I will just take a moment to share something and show it. Why don't I use you? Okay. Put your stuff down, and here you can sit in my chair. - Okay. - And I am going to... You're the kid in the classroom. Let me see. First... Let me see. Hold your arm real strong. You're strong. You're the kid in the classroom. I have to put my back to you, okay? And you're going to... I'll just tell you what you're going to do and then you do it afterwards. You see, you've started strong. You're going to look up to the teacher who's at the blackboard, and then you're going to look down to your desk, and you're going to try to write something. Okay? - Uh hmm. - Okay. So start at your desk, up to the teacher, down to the desk. Okay. - Oh. Jeez. - I mean you lose your energy so fast. And what it is, is it makes your meridians run backwards. So K-27 gets really thrown. And kids often think they can't learn or what happened, they lost their ability to make sense of what's going on. And that's exactly... So I teach kids to always... Sorry, massage K-27, And okay, now. Okay. So now you're the little kid in school and I've just done your K-27, do the very same thing. - Okay. - So, K-27 is a really important thing... - Thank you. - when you're a kid in school. Okay - During this week, we hope that you will, as usual, do the daily energy routine and also experiment with your aura. Experiment with techniques like pushing it out, techniques like weaving it, techniques like doing the zip up and really doing it in that kind of meditative way so that you're really keeping your own aura strong and steady. For next week, we'll go to Dona's favorite topic. - Yes. The Radiant Circuits. So, we'll see you next time. Okay?

====================

Week 8

====================

LESSON 23 – Radiant Circuits - The Energies of Vitality & Joy
--------------------
♪ [music] ♪ - [David] Welcome to this eighth and final session of Journey to Vitality. Again, before we do the daily energy routine, tune in, notice what your body's feeling, notice your mood, and this time, I'm going to lead the daily energy routine to absolutely demonstrate to you that anybody can do it, okay? So we're going to begin. Now, as you do this pullover... Donna switches. I like to do the same side, kind of build it a little bit on each side. And you can do it whichever way you prefer. That gets the energies crossing over. And then you do The Four Thumps, just very quickly tapping these points gets a lot of different energies going in a really positive way. The K27s. In through your nose, out through your mouth. The thymus points. And the spleen points. And we'll do the cross crawl. And you just kind of let your body be free. The important thing is that it's the opposite hand, opposite leg. You just let your body go however you want. And then we'll do the short version of The Wayne Cook. So hand that way, hand that way, clasp, switch over, cross at the ankle if you wish, and same breathing, in through the nose, out through the mouth, and really raising up. Now cathedral, get the third eye, that same breathing, and stretching up on the in-breath. And one more deep breath. And then your hands are already here for the crown pull. So just end The Wayne Cook with that. And then you can go right across. Over the top. Pulling out, a nice big stretch out at the neck. And then finally, up to the shoulders, pull down. You're going to zip up and you're going to where the governing is in the back and reach over. Imagine that it's touching, coming over to the top lip. And going to do the hookup. So we're going to do these that we've been doing, that are where the arm connects. And then let's go under our ribs and do all along the bottom of the ribcage. And then put your hands let this, and you can do it sitting down, and use the strength of your legs to push in and do little circles, and really get those lymphatics moving. - [Donna] And if you remember, these are the points that make your body more flexible. So if you have a hard time, for instance, touching the ground, if you really massage these, that energy will open up and you can easily touch the ground. - Now let's hand it once more with the zip-up, and really zip up appreciation to yourself for having gotten this far in the course. - Yes. - You've invested a bunch of time in this already, so. Me, what I've learned, really feed me, really feed my health, happiness, and joy. May what I've learned feed my health, happiness, and joy. What I've learned is feeding my health, happiness, and joy. And hook it in. - Okay. Radiant circuits. First of all, they're magic. They are magic, and they are about being so in love with life, that you just fall to you knees in gratitude. I love that Thanksgiving is coming. Thanksgiving. It is about Thanksgiving and feeling it down to your soul. And radiant circuits sit underneath Triple Warmer, so if you can move those stress energies out of your body, they become much more available. If you've ever been in love, you know what radiant circuits are about. It's that kind of energy. And it's about the sense of wonder and awe. And they've just recently done some studies on awe, just awe. And there's something like, your arteries open 22% more when you go into awe. So it's like this... - That is awesome. - Yeah. Somebody told me in a class that she had a new appreciation of that word "awe" because she had an autistic son, and she was going to think of it very different, awe-tistic. So I love that. Yeah. Radiant circuits, it's about feeling free, it's about synchronicities, synchronicities. It's about spontaneity and spontaneous healings. And, I mean, amazing, wonderful life is what it's about. And it's available to everybody if you can scoop out, you know, the Triple Warmer energy, and let that come up more and more. So what I thought we'd like to do in this class is to give you some of the tools that can help you. Energetic tools that can help you move more into radiant circuits. In fact, I'd like to show, right away... I'd like to show right away somebody... Oh, Ellen, I'm going to take you. Because I know you work a lot with Triple Warmer. So I'm going to show you something. One of the things that I believe the Triple Warmer even is trying to do, what energies are trying to do is to move Triple Warmer away from its meridian identity, and more into its radiant circuit identity. And so, when you test Triple Warmer normally, it's like this. And you're very strong. And spleen test, I'm going to test spleen. And spleen is nice and weak. Okay. Now I'm going to come and I'm going to cup my hand around her ear, and that tests whether Triple Warmer, as a radiant circuit, is on enough. And so, I'm going to show her, and all of you, a simple way to get that energy moving energetically into your body. You just hold your hands up like this, and then you're going to flip them up, like your hands up. Hands up, okay? And now you're going to take a deep breath in, and squeeze your scapula back. And then let it go whenever you want. Now, very quickly, I'll show you what happens. All right, Ellen, you're healed. - [Ellen] It just felt like my angel wings opened up when you did that. - Yeah. It's good, it's good. I thought that so much when I was watching all of the different Black Lives Matter. Hands up, don't shoot, and I thought, "Whoa. That's a real Triple Warmer thing, and if you can just..." Yeah. Go back like that. That's a scapula squeeze. I'd like to venture into something just slightly different, to bring consciousness in, okay? I'd like somebody. How about, is there anybody in here who feels they're just stuck up in their head and they can't get out of their heads? Well, all right. Come on over. And we can test that, okay? Because what it does is, it affects... I'm going to push your arms straight out in front of you. Okay? Hold them backwards and don't let me pull them apart. Hold them real strong. So it affects your chakras, okay? So if you're... Yeah, thank you. You're very brave, saying you're up in your head with all the love I've been giving you. No. Okay, here's what you're going to do, you're going to close your eyes, okay? And you're going to, let's see, just take one deep breath in. And notice breath, just notice your breath. Take another deep breath in, notice your breath. And soften your belly. And one more time. Notice breath, soften belly, and open heart. And sometimes it feels good just to put your hands on your heart. Okay. Come here, my dear. Watch. Just what you did in that... Let me have your hands. Let me have your arms. Just, now hold your arms tight. And you start getting you energies on the side of your consciousness of what you really want. And it's just a simple one. It's really good for David, because he can get up in his head, and that one makes such a difference. Right, my dear? - It does. And I'd like everybody to do that with us. So, what you're doing is, you're beginning with attuning your consciousness to your body, okay? It's very simple. You just notice your first breath, okay? So notice breath. And soften belly. Okay, now you're doing something with your consciousness. You're instructing your body to soften belly, which allows a lot of energy to flow. So, soften belly. Open heart. And now you're instructing at another level, for you body to move more into a spiritual, open space. So let's do about three rounds of that. Notice breath. Soften belly. Open your heart. Notice breath. Soften belly. Open heart. And once more, notice breath. Soften belly. Open heart. And hands over your heart. Just notice how you're breathing, how the quality of your breathing may be a little different than it was a few moments ago. Simple, transportable, you have it in your back pocket anytime you're starting to get stressed, anytime you're starting to feel... Recognize that you're in your head more than you want to be. Notice breath, soften belly, open heart. - It's like you can't, your mind can't wander if you're noticing your breath. And then, oh, you've got to notice that you're softening your belly. You've got to do those things, and it's amazing how it lifts people out of their brains. - [Woman] Thank you so much, Donna. - Oh, you're welcome so much. Hey, let me have you. Can I keep you up here for a second? - Yes, you may. - All right. I just, one of the things that I noticed, and you've got wonderful energy, but I'm going to just do something right here. And you hold your arm real strong. Do you notice you're weak? - I do notice that, yes. - All right. There is a flow in the radiant circuits called the bridge flow. And the bridge flow bridges to your inner self, and out to others. And when it's really open, you can really feel it. You can feel things, and it's harder to feel it, or being in that feeling of love and joy and everything, if this is closed off. Now, if you just make a heart right here. Do about three of them. I always think it's so interesting that children all over the world make hearts exactly the same. And it's not like a heart really is, but it's like they, you know, they're attuned somehow to that bridge flow. Now, watch you. I should show you something else in a second, but hold, push. All right. Now, watch. The bridge flow is a little bit like a central meridian. Anyone who hasn't been up here much? Have you been up here? Yeah. Anybody. Okay. Come on up. Okay, now what I want you to do, all right, let's see. See if you're nice and strong. Now what I want you to do is, just think of something in your own world that's a little difficult. Got it? Okay. And she didn't get you with it. - No, she didn't. - Because this heart bridges deep into yourself and makes you stable. - Yeah. - So it's real good. - Oh, that's good. - Okay. We've got to keep you up here and do something with you. Okay. Okay. Well, I'll tell you an easy turn-on on the radiant circuits, okay? Let me see how out you are. Okay. I'm going to touch right there, and right there, and right there. Okay. You're going to do what I do. You're going to give yourself some space. You know, babies do this. And it's a radiant circuit pose. And they all start turning on... You stay there. - [Woman 2] Okay. - And I'm just going to let you... Okay, anytime you want, you can get up, but you could lay there as long as you want, also. - I felt something. - Could you feel? - Mm-hmm. - I mean, it's amazing, especially if you do that on grass, it's like heaven. It's like heaven. Okay, now I'm going to test you in the same places I tested you before. I mean, it moves energy so quick. - I felt it. It happened. - Da-da. Oh, that's good. What did you feel? - I just felt like an opening and I exhaled, you know, I took a breath, and it was like, "Oh. Okay. Different." - Yeah. There's a reason babies are in that state for so much of their little lives, because it really reinforces that kind of energy for a baby. - I'll do that more often. - All right, all right. Well, let me talk about the radiant circuits and the kind of energy it is. You know, there is something that I love to do more than anything in the whole world, and sometimes I think other people don't love it as much as I do. Some people do. I love to smile. I love to smile so much, because it isn't surface, it feels like it goes right down deep into my soul, and it saves my life. It's like it just kind of lifts me, and it makes me feel vibrant, and it feel so good. But it's a soul connection. It's very much a soul connection. And maybe a couple of you have heard this story, but I'm going to tell it to you anyway. When I was a little girl, at four, when I was four years old, my mother almost died. She had tuberculosis, and she was put in the terminal ward. And we were all, my brother, and sister, and I were told she wasn't going to make it. And it was in the days when nobody was afraid anybody was going to kidnap the kids, you know. So, I lived about a block and a half away from a church that was having a church revival. And I was four years old, it was nighttime, and I walked down to the church revival just because I felt so blue, and so bad. And there was a young man singing in front of this group of people. And I'm not a singer, and I probably shouldn't even try this. But he sang, "You can S-M-I-L-E. When you can't say a word, you can S-M-I-L-E. When you cannot be heard, you can S-M-I-L-E. When it's cloudy or fair you can, anytime, anywhere." And it went in around, and it began, it felt like it just went inside me. It just went inside me, and I was just lifted up out of this terrible pain, that my mother was going to die. And it was... And somehow I also knew that everything was okay, that my soul was reached, and it was so, so good. So I am an advocate of smiling, everybody. Okay. So. - It was interesting that I told Donna that there was an early study that really showed a lot of physiological benefits of smiling, and now some studies are contradicting that. And I said that to Donna, and she said... - Doesn't mean anything. They're not smiling down to their soul. So, of course, it wouldn't show the benefits if they're not getting it down there, but I mean, you feel always connected to your soul when you smile like that. And it's so much better than just being off of your personality or something, you know, it's just not as good. It is not as good. Okay. - So smiling is one easy turn-on, a deep smile, a true, genuine smile, of your radiant circuits. And here's five other quick, easy turn-ons for you radiant circuit. One is, put on music that you love, that's upbeat music, and move to it. And move to it in figure eights. As you're moving in figure eights, you're really helping your energy body, you're really doing something in the physical realm that is increasing your energies. A second is gratitude, is, find anything that you feel grateful about, and anything in nature, just anything that you really appreciate, and take a moment to be fully present with it, and to put your hands over your heart chakra, and breathe it in. And that gets the radiant circuits moving, it gets the radiant circuits moving. Another way to really get your radiant circuits going is to approve something, take something someone has done, and whole-heartedly approve of it, enthusiastically let them know, let them feel it. As you feel that enthusiasm for it, they're going to love it, and that's going to create a radiant circuit ping-pong back and forth between you and them. Another is with somebody that you have difficulty with, somebody that's not easy for you, and to consider, "Well, what do I like about this person?" And tell them. Say, "Joe, you know what I like about you?" And just sense. Just getting into that mood. So there's a lot that we can do in these very simple ways. And then one of our favorites is, you know, sometimes when you look at all the strife in the world and you say, "Why would the Creator set it up this way?”, but we know why there are more than one person, and the reason that there's more than one person is that we can scratch one another's backs. So that's another way to really get someone's radiant circuits moving, is scratch their back. It feel so good. And then have them scratch yours. So, those are five easy turn-ons for the radiant circuits, and smiling is a sixth. - That's good. Don't you love having somebody scratch your back? It is the best. Thank you. Okay, I'm going to stand here for a minute. Thank you. Thank you, David. Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you. Okay. Okay, so let me go through… We’re not going to go into depths in the different circuits of the radiant circuits. Instead, we're going to give you the easy turn-ons. But I do want to just go through them, like the regulator flow regulates joy and gladness, so that things like Thanksgiving bubbles up easy in you. It's an easy thing. And so the regulator flow, let's do it, okay? Is there anybody in here who feels like their regulator flow is clearly gone? How would they know? Well, it's not so easy to be joyful. Anybody got it? Not so easy to be in it. Oh, what a class! What? Okay, good. I got somebody. - What is it? - Elise. - Yeah. Hi. Hi, Elise. - Tell the audience your name. - Yeah, tell your audience. - [Elise] Hi. Elise. - Okay, Elise. I'm going to energy-test you in a certain way, okay? - Mm-hmm. - I'm going to, you close your eyes and I'm going to lay my hands right like that. You hold and don't let me push your feet. That's it. And on this side. Okay. Now, we're going to do this, and if... Everybody, you can do it sitting down, you guys. But you ought to do it. Okay. You're going to... Let me see, which one do I want to do? Okay. You're going to start like this with your chin in your hands, and your fingers over your eyes. And take one deep breath. Now, from there, you're going to use one of your fingers of each hand. You can open your eyes to see what I'm doing. And I'm going to make a heart right here. You're going to make a heart on a stick. And you're going to go down here, and then you're going to cross your arms like this. You're going to think of ‘I Dream of Jeannie’, okay? That's it. You bring your hands back, and you're going to go down your legs, all the way down, and then squeeze your feet, and oh. Okay, I'm going to see how much your energy has moved on just that, okay? All right. So the energies have started, so I would suggest you do that exercise a lot, and you can get it really funky. There's a way to do sort of a funky flow on it. And who's really good with funky flows in here? All right. All right, Ellen. All right, she's going to lead you in the funky flow. - Okay, so, we're going to do heart on a stick. ‘I Dream of Jeannie’ arms, oh, aren't I beautiful down the front, squeeze the feet, whee. And you can come up spleen. - Thank you, Ellen. So the more fun you can make out of it, the better. Thank you. - Okay. Thank you so much. - Okay. You know what I'm going to do? I'm going, in just a little bit, before the class is over, let me test you and see if it's holding at all. Okay? Not now, but in a little while. We're just going to let the time go by and... - So as we talk about these radiant circuits, and the individual ones, I want to remind you what we talked about in the Triple Warmer class, which is that radiant circuits predate the meridians. The meridians are like the riverbeds, but the radiant circuits go wherever they want. And so they're really the ki... And their job is to keep you as a fully-functioning unit, all the parts, getting all the parts. So, that's why we call them the Great Mom, they're looking at all the parts and making sure that this one at Thanksgiving dinner is sitting next to the one they like and getting the food that they like. So that's the radiant circuit's job. Now Donna's showing you the individual radiant circuits because they are actually, they do have pathways, but they're not fixed pathways like with the meridians. And so, so far we've looked at just the first one, the regulator flow. So... - Thank you. Yes, radiant circuits, even though when things are still you can trace them, the moment they're activated at all, they jump all over the place, wherever that energy needs to go. There is no path whatsoever. The bridge flow, we talked about a little bit, but I want to show it again. Who would like their bridge flow done? Okay. All right. Okay, I'm going to test you. You hold your arm real strong. Aren't these the greatest pants? Okay. Okay. I'm just going to... Okay, hold. All right, my dear. Here's what we're going to do, you're going to put your fingers right back here on the power point, which is right in the middle, okay? You can take a deep breath in, and go to the forehead, go on the inside of your eyes and all the way down to right the middle of your chest. And now you're going to make a heart, you go. Now, you did a heart really well, but when you make a heart, you're going to feel it. You go. That's better. Now, one of the things that we like to do is make a big heart, and come down as far as you want. And it starts opening up this flow that will come in and get you, but also connect up to other people. And then we're going to just go down your legs, and put your fingers under your feet, and stick your butt in the air. Okay, that's it. Yeah. Just go boop. And up you go. And the funky flow way? - Okay. It's a cheer. Back of the head, forehead, cheeks, chest. Heart, heart, heart, heart, you know the rest, boop. - Thanks, Ellen. So that's your homework assignment, okay? All right. The next one is the penetrating flow, and the penetrating flow is really... It's about... The penetrating flow is feeling things really deep, and that can be both joy, and it also can be, it can be poignant, but it can be sorrow, too. It's just feeling deep, but it affects everything, including sexuality and everything that you want to feel deep. So, here's how this goes. Let's see, anybody else? Anybody that would like... That one. Okay. All right. All right. Okay, my dear. What I'm going to do, you hold your arm real strong. There's several ways to test it, but I'm just going to lay my hand on your sacrum and hold. Boing. Okay. All right. Everybody, you might want to stand up for this one. You're going to put your fingers right up about, up from your waist, okay? And you're going to go, you're going to drop your fingers, right here in the middle of your waist, and just circle it once. And then go down to your sacrum, okay? And then up over your hipbones like a horseshoe. And then you're going to go all the way up. Now I'd rest here. I always rest here. And then. This is a great one to do funky. Come on. - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Oh, yeah, oh, yeah. - So for this one, you have to channel your inner Marilyn Monroe, okay? - [Woman 3] I've got the hips. - Okay. And very slow, it's like you're spreading honey, okay? Sacrum, hips, breasts. - Thank you, Ellen. Yes. Okay. Now we've got... The way... She does it for the children, okay? - [Angela] Yes, because the other one is a bit too sexual. So, we talk about Peter Penguin who's always so shy. Peter, Peter Penguin, why are you so shy? Now I know why. - That's so sweet. That's so sweet. I love that. Let's see, okay? I'm going to test your sacrum. All right, yes. - Thank you. - You're welcome. Let's see, what else would I like to show? Tanya, you come on up. I wasn't expecting to see this because her energy is really flowing, but here's where it isn't. I'm going to go from the back of her shoulder to her forward hip. She's got nothing. Now I'm going to go on this side, from her back shoulder to her forward hip. Nothing. But, just watch what this'll do. And this is a great one to do to music, you know? It's just on the sideways. You can also go down, you can go up. You do anything you want. Okay, let's see, Tanya. The more these energies flow, the more they connect with your consciousness, too, and your spirit, and it's just... It's really good. All right. Thank you, honey. - Thank you - Okay. All right. Let see, what else, David? That was figure eights on the side, what do we call that? Side... - [Woman 4] Yeah, but it connects off the back sense and the forward sense. - It does. It connects, yeah. Sometimes you see somebody walking around and there's a front of their body, but there's no energy, hardly, on their back side. - [Woman 5] It's front and back bridge flow? - Yes. The bridge flow most definitely connects that up, but that connects. So figure eights, anytime when you're lost, it feels really good. - Do you want to check Elise and see... - Come on up here, Elise. Let's see if you're holding. Okay, let's see because we want to build a habit. Yay. Yay. So you want to do this a lot and build a habit, okay? Thank you. A belt flow. Okay. This is really big, because I had the experience this week, this week, of my belt flow going out, and I was so surprised. Sometimes you're really surprised, because you think you've got it all together. And then you find out. So, on the first day of the class, on the first day, I was in shoes that bothered me, and I got really disconnect from the earth, and from the top part of my body. My belt flow was out. It is the first time in my life, though, I ever had my belt flow hurt. It literally hurt around my waist. And so the belt flow is really important. It connects the upper part of your body to the lower part of your body. It helps you ground. It also helps you open to the heavens. It helps the energy go, you know, through your whole being. And it also... I always loved that in... Gosh, even Mark K, when you and I were growing up and girls were getting married, you know, right out of high school, the style of the wedding dress was, it would dip down here. And a belt flow can go right around the waist, but it can also go under the belly. And they used to make wedding dresses that way so that a woman would be reminded to own herself and not be owned by the man. So, I love that, that there was an understanding of the belt flow. So, yeah. The belt flow is really, really important, and if it gets too pulled apart, I mean, you're just not connected into yourself, and you lose your rhythm, and all sorts of things happen. So, everybody, get up. We're going to do our belt flow. Anybody unsure about their belt flow? - It was on yesterday, I don't know. - Okay, let's see your belt flow, see if it held from yesterday. Okay. Hold your arm real, I mean, yeah, hold it strong. Oh, you held! That's good. Yay! Must have been that master practitioner who worked on you. - [Woman 6] No kidding. - Anybody else not sure? Anybody not sure about their belt flow? Come on. Okay, hold your arm real strong, and I'm going to hold right there. And oh, oh. All right. We're going to get your belt flow strong. There are a few ways to do it. One way is, I usually do them in both ways. But if you put your thumb all the way back, right here in the back, right at your waist, there's a point there called the Ming-men point. And it's really important for radiating energy out, and it's very interesting. It sits both in the world of meridians and energy in that way, but it also sits in the world of radiant circuits. And when you can get it to work as a radiant circuit, then you don't have any low back pain. Okay? So we're going to start back there, and then we're just going to come around our waists like this. And just go all the way down your legs, and then you're going to come up your legs, and now you're going to reach over and just pull around your waist. Yeah, three or four times, and then go down the opposite leg, and then the other side. And the other thing it does is, if your belt flow is out, you've got a break between your second and third chakras, which can really be problematic. And it's much harder, your second chakra has so much more to do with the radiant circuits than the third chakra. So you don't want that, a belt flow break there. So let's see if you've got it. Oh, yes! Beautiful. Oh, and what, how does it go? Where's my... Yeah, come on up, Ellen. - So, we have to find that belt. Fish around for your belt. Okay, where's my belt? Where's my belt? Where's my belt? My pants are falling down! Where's my belt? Where's my belt? Where's my belt? My pants are falling down! - [Woman 7] Lovely. Thank you. - Well, before this class breaks up into a total radiant circuit, I'm going to show you what we do every morning, okay? And, you know, I talked about how scratching the back is really a quick, wonderful radiant circuit turn-on? Well, doing someone's belt flow is another one. So, why don't you lie down? - Oh, okay. - Just lie down, right here. - Okay. Okay. - And lie down on your back. - Oh. - I always... - Okay. - Okay. So, what you do, put your hands under the person, and let the person's weight just work with you, don't let your watch get caught in their sweater. Okay. - Oh, I love it so much! - If you really do it, and do it really hard, and then down the leg, and then I would normally go around, but just so I don't turn my back to you, I'll come around this way. Do it really strong, and down, and then for an extra bonus, Donna talked about the Ming-men point, and you just bounce with the person on the Ming-men point. - It's so good. It's the best. This is real porn. This feels... Thank you. - Okay. - Okay. These simple things that we've even shown, little things you can do to start building a habit, a habit so that you gravitate more to joy, to a sense of wonder, and awe, and gladness, and radiance. And one of them is just, boy, when you're just a little lost, if you put your hands over here, and just take a couple of deep breaths, you come home to yourself. And the energy does truly, truly build. Another one is, just make a heart, you know? Make a heart over yourself. It's just that simple. I think the, you had it in another class, but the Triple Warmer smoothie is really good. It's another one that will help it turn into a radiant circuit. You want to remember the Triple Warmer smoothie? Okay. You lay your hands over the eyes, take a deep breath in. Let your breath out, and drag them to your temples. Now take one deep breath here, because you're sitting on Triple Warmer neurovasculars, which is really good for calming things down. And take a deep breath in, and go around the ear, go down around, and hold on your shoulders. Take a deep breath in, drag your fingers across, and land on your heart chakra. Okay? Is there anybody here who has a radiant circuit that they like to do? Yes. - I love to do this one with the children, because when you see something beautiful... - Do I need a microphone for her? - Hi, my name is Angela, and this is the one I love to do with the children. What is the sound that you utter when you see something beautiful? Ah. And ah is truly the sound of the heart. So when we do ah, we go ah, ah, and then bring that joy back in. - That's great. That's great. I've fallen in love with that word, ah. I love it. All right. I want my daughter, Tanya, to come up here and she's going to share the Triple Warmer spleen regulator. - Mm. - Okay, mm. Okay. All right, here we go. Everybody, fingers over your eyes. Take a deep breath in, and drag them out to your temples. Take a deep breath in through your nose, and out through your mouth, and then go up over your ears like James Dean, yeah, like James Dean. And then down, cross your arms and pull the energy out. Go all the way down, and up. Do, do, do, do, do, do. Yeah, that was great. - [Tanya] You could talk about weight with them. - Yes, that's actually very true. We have known people who've lost weight doing that exercise because it creates the balance between Triple Warmer and spleen, and you literally start burning calories better. Thank you, Tanya. Okay, all right. Come on, Elise. All right. First, I'm going to just check you and see how you're doing. Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes. Okay. Would you like to come up, Ellen, and do the funky flow way? - Sure. Okay. So, this starts with Sandra Dee in the soda shop, she's falling in love. Heart on a stick, ‘I Dream of Jeannie’ arms, and aren't I beautiful down the front? Squeeze your feet, whee, and come up the spleen. But there's also a back part to this. James Dean hair, ‘I Dream of Jeannie’ arms down the back. Oh, aren't I beautiful down the back? Come off the baby toes, whee, and come back up the spleen. - Yay! Thank you, Ellen. Oh, well, I know you're good. I know you're good. All right, thank you. - Thank you. - So we've covered the radiant circuits, the energies of joy, the energies that weave all the energies together into a happy family. And we've looked at natural ways that you can get the radiant circuits moving, and we've also looked at each of the radiant circuits, and at least one kind of jingle way of activating that circuit, and a little bit about what each of the circuits means. This is our last session, so we encourage you to continue to do the daily energy routine for a few days, to experiment with your radiant circuits, and then to review the course, to really look at all that you've covered, because we've covered so much material. And our concern was, we didn't want to overwhelm you, but we also wanted to share as much as we could. So, review it, review the handouts, review your notes, review your memory, and find a few things beyond the daily energy routine that really resonate with you, that you want to use. Doing a few things that resonate with you is much better than doing nothing or doing a hundred things in a rowed sort of way. So, really find a few things that really speak to you. There's lots of resources if you want to study further, energy medicine, Donna's work, other forms of energy medicine, it's all available. But for right now, continue with the daily energy routine. And then also find a few things that resonate with you, that really build your energy, that build your happiness, build your health, build your joy. - Thank you, Tanya, you were great. You were so good. - So talking about radiant circuit experiences, this was wonderful. - Yes. And we want Dandy to come up, too. Come on, Dandy. This is a family here, we're going to lead everybody in heaven rushing in. Okay? So on your feet, everybody. And you're going to rub your hands together and shake them off. And then put your hands on your thighs and take a deep breath, in through your nose and out through your mouth. Then swing your arms together in a kind of prayerful position. Now you're going to open up all the way to the heavens. And that ceiling is just going to evaporate, and you're going to see the sky beyond and the... Just the universe, the air, the wind, the stars, the sun, the moon, whatever is there, you're going to see it. And you're going to hang out there underneath this, just this brilliant, beautiful, really sacred sky. And you're going to feel grateful, you're going to really feel grateful for whatever you feel grateful for. And maybe there's a thank-you in you. And you're going to also be open to receiving, receiving and hearing just how wonderful it is that you are here on planet Earth, and that you are making such a difference in so many people's lives, and there are so many people who feel grateful for you. And suddenly, you feel the angels feeling grateful for you, every spirit out there feeling grateful for you. So maybe you feel also grateful. So when your hands feel like they've got a lot of energy on them, you're going to scoop It up, and put it in the middle of your heart chakra. There's a vortex there called heaven rushing in, and heaven rushes in with love, and vitality, and awe, and wonder, and gratitude for you. And if you think that you didn't get enough, you go back, and you get more. You just get more, and take it in. Amen. Thank you, everybody. Thank you, everybody. Okay. You were all so wonderful. And Tanya, you were amazing. And Dandy, you were amazing. You all were amazing. - So thank you, everybody, that has been with us through this journey, and sending you our deepest blessings.

LESSON 24 – Questions & Answers for Chapter 8
--------------------
- [David] You've just been through the Radiant Circuits and the energies of joy. And you may have some questions. And you may have some questions out there. You may have some comments that you want to put on the Tribe. - [Donna] And you should know also, that if you went on in this work, there are ways to work with other people and connect up there circuits in real sessions. Okay. - So, who has questions? - Yes. Oh we need a... Yes - [Woman 1] So, I know that you can do this for other people when you work on them. But can you do this for somebody... Like in my family, if wanted to send them some joy, could I do that on myself with the intention to send them the joy? - You can. Yes you can. Yes. You're awfully good at this, Dondi. - [Man] So, Donna, when else besides wanting to feel more joy would you think about using radiant circuit tracing as opposed to, say, meridian tracing? - Well, I love them both. I love both meridian tracing... But radiant circuit tracing starts building the habits of not being in stress. It starts building... And stress is hard for the body. Stress creates illness at times. And so to have the radiant circuits and also to move Triple Warmer out of its meridian stance and more into its radiant circuit stance, you don't have to live in as much stress in your life. Did that answer your question? - Yes. I want to say that I noticed, when I was doing, for example, the penetrating flow, how much more energy I immediately had. - Thank you for saying that. I love the penetrating flow. I love that flow. And it's true. I've known people who just sort of lived on the surface of life and started working the penetrating flow, and tracing it, and really getting their consciousness in with it. And life takes on a deeper meaning. It's like you find meaning in life more. Thank you. - Okay. Go inside and think of a question. We can do one or two more questions, radian circuits. - [Woman 2] Donna, to me, you are radiant. And I'm wondering have you always been this way, or have there been times when you, yourself, were low and were using the radiant circuits then? - Oh, thank you for that question. I mean I am basically... I love being me. And it has nothing to do with anything that's out here. I mean, if everything went away, I'd still be fine, you know. And I think that that started very early. My mother said I was born with a smile on my face. And I can remember my birth, which I loved. I loved my birth. And you know how you always hear how if you get born in a very lighted room and nobody has that sensitivity towards you, it can really be harmful? I loved that. I loved that it was a cold room. I loved that the doctor put my butt on a steel slab, and it made me laugh, you know. I just loved the whole thing. But it is very true that I've gone through things that have been very heavy in my life and very hard. And I used energy to, you know, get my energy cleared from the stress and move more into myself again and find my rhythm. I always think of it is what you want is to find your rhythm again. What is your rhythm? And... - Donna, how many times should I trace a radiant circuit? Should it be once or twice or three times? - You know, that is such a linear question. There's truly no answer to that one. I mean, how much can you do it to feel good, you know? And when does it quit feeling good? You quit. One of the things I used to do when I was growing up is we had these huge boulders behind our house. And I learned to... This is part of your question about what I did with my energy. My mother lived, by the way, from when I was four. But then when I went into... I was about ninth grade. She got sick again. She just had taken out one of her lungs, so they thought that at that time, that if you collapse one of the lungs, the other lung wouldn't get TB, so I don't know. But that was Western medicine, you see. So I did go through a lot of fears and tears. And so I'd go and lay on that boulder in the back of our house and it was... God, boulders are alive. And that energy was so amazing. It would come up and just come up through my energy, and just laying there, my body would begin to figure eight. It would just figure eight, and it wasn't me doing anything. There was just this undulating. And I knew I was connected in with the earth. And so that... Anybody else? Yes. - So, David, you said that one of the habits that you could do quickly is be in nature. But living in the city, there isn't always nature around. Can you look at pictures? Do you just imagine being in nature? - It is literally whatever turns you on. So... - Okay. So you don't have to literally be in nature or... - No, no. - Okay. - It's feeding yourself what turns you on. - Do you know what I did once when I was going through a period where I was so in the city and traveling a lot and I couldn't get to nature? We bought patches of grass in boxes. So right in my living room, I could put my feet on the grass. - Oh, that kind of grass. - Yeah. But that really worked. This is not to put anybody down with anything that they do, but everybody's different. So those products of... What are they called? Grounding products, that a lot of people use well, they fried my circuits. But a patch of grass doesn't, you know, and that grounds me. - [Woman 3] I have a question. By strengthening our own radiant circuits, is that something we can do to maybe help protect us from these worldly events that could cause damage or maybe with electromagnetic energy? Does that have anything to do with protecting us from the electromagnetic energies as well? - Yes, yes, it does. I mean it absolutely does. I would say the first thing is you've got to get an aura strong. You know, you've got to get your aura really working. But that aura becomes quite radiant for you when it's really flowing and is puffy, and fluffy and goes the way up. I mean, you just, you feel amazing when that happens. You feel safe. You feel utterly safe and that you can walk into any new venture and everything is fine. I just want to say I thought of one more thing. This is a really good reason to belly laugh, okay? It cleanses your liver. It cleanses your liver. So a good reason to belly laugh. Anybody else? - Great. So these are again, very thought-provoking questions, and I know that the discussion on the Tribe is going to be very rich.
