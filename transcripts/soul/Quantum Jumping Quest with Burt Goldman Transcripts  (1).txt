INTRO LESSON 1: Welcome to the Program
--------------------

Hi, my name is Bert Goldman, and let me ask you something. When you were a child, what sort of fantastic dreams did you have? Did you want to be a planet hopping astronaut, a brilliant scientist who discovers a cure for cancer, maybe a record breaking athlete with a cabinet of Olympic medals, a billionaire entrepreneur with a mansion on every continent? Well, what happened to those dreams? I'll tell you what happened. You grew up and you started living in the real world. Your teachers told you to stop daydreaming. Your parents told you to be realistic, get a steady job in a mortgage before you knew it, your childhood dreams, it vanished into thin air. But what if? What if somewhere out there in an alternate universe, there's a you who turned all those dreams into reality? Scientists like Stephen Hawking and Albert Einstein have long speculated on the existence of alternate universes.

So imagine that somewhere out there in these alternate universes, there's a version of you for everything you've ever wished You could be a version of you as a billionaire, a version, perhaps as a celebrity, a philanthropist, an inventor. You now imagine there was a way you could tap into these alternate universes and connect with alternate versions of yourself. What if you could meet the successful you and learn from that success, how to boost your wealth and career, even if you've been stuck in a rutt for years? What if you could talk to the athletic you and find out how to get that fit sexy body you've always wanted, even if you've never been able to shake off those extra pounds? Or what if you could meet the cussing over you and figure out how to attract your dream partner, even though you've never had much luck and love?

How would your life change if you could do this and hold on a second, how would this even be possible? Well, let me tell you something. I'm 84 years old, and over the past few years, just before my 80th birthday, I've taught myself to paint painted hundreds of canvases and got my work featured in museums Across the world, I've taught myself photography, pioneered a new photography style I call mirage Photography. I got my work featured in multiple. I've written books, multiple books, including the bestselling Silver Mind Control Method of Mental Dynamics with Mind Empowerment. Pioneer Jose Silva sold over a million copies, and I did all this with no prior knowledge of any of these subjects in just a few years. How did a man my age accomplish things? Some people spend their entire lives chasing. My secret might surprise you. You see, I spent decades of my life studying fields like hypnosis, yoga, meditation, and remote viewing.

I studied under some of the world's greatest mind empowerment masters like the Great Yogi Para Yogananda and Jose Silva, the man who brought meditation to the West. In this time, I've discovered amazing things about the human mind, things that could change your life like they did mine. So welcome to the world of quantum jumping. Quantum jumping is an advanced mental visualization technique like no other. It's unique. How does it work? Using a step-by-step visualization process, you picture yourself jumping into an alternate universe and gaining skills, wisdom, and experiences from alternate versions of yourself. You bring back the rhythm of that alternate version, all of which can help you go further in your career, make more money, learn new skills, improve your health and relationships, and yes, even realize those childhood dreams. Quantum jumping is the gateway to the ultimate. You think of it like creative visualization, but much more vivid and transformational.

Now, a lot of people ask me whether it's really possible to jump into alternate universes with the sheer power of their mind. Well, let me put it this way. When you quantum jump, what you're doing is visualizing meeting alternate versions of yourself. You're using that daydreaming mechanism. Doing this helps expand your possibility filter, which is the subconscious block in your mind that stops you from doing, stops you from achieving and being more than than you are. If you sometimes struggle to rise above your circumstances. If you can't fathom how you're going to turn your annual income into your monthly income, if you just can't imagine yourself achieving your loftiest goals, traveling to the most exotic places, meeting the most inspiring people, and going from your current reality to your ultimate reality.

Well, quantum jumping actually helps you to tap into your natural intuition and creativity and shift your reality in the process. Quantum jumping is what you make of it, and most importantly, it works. Think about this for a second. If you could connect with an alternate version of yourself who's living your childhood dreams at this very moment, what's the one question you'd ask him or her? Think about that. This is Bert Goldman. Thank you for watching.

Mindvalley presents Quantum Jumping with author Bert Goldman. Welcome to Quantum Jumping, the exciting extension of what has been described as one of the most powerful visualization techniques ever. This program has been rigorously constructed to make you feel more ingenious, to find the courage to start doing things you wouldn't have even thought of attempting before. Each jump will help guide you to trigger the universal form of attraction and bring all manner of good things your way. You will break down barriers, you'll resolve doubts. If applied with intent, your life will change drastically. And now, introduction to Quantum Jumping with author Bert Goldman.

Quantum Jumping The Beginning, <laugh> really the beginning here, I'm gonna go way back because it's strange how tiny seeds ultimately become great oaks and giant redwoods, sodas. With so very many things in our lives, I can trace a lot of what the world has come to know of as quantum jumping to a seed, a slight incident that took place in a small farmhouse in South Korea, right there at the 38th Parallel. That's the border that separated the American zone from the Russian of what was to be known as the country of North Korea. At the time I was a sergeant and the combat engineers of the American Army's 24th Corps. We would've been the first ones forward in the evasion of Japan, had it taken place, which thankfully it didn't due to President Truman's actions. Well, one of my buddies was another 19 year old soldier whose name was Johnny Kim or Kim as, as we all called him.

Kim, smoked Korean. And so we would wander through the countryside, making friends with the newly liberated people of Korea. They'd lived under the yoke of Japanese occupation for many years, and they really welcomed us as, as, as their saviors. Well, the seed that I mentioned was a tune Ang Z, an ancient Scottish tune that just about everyone knew I could pick it on a piano, I could pick it out, but I did know how to play a piano that with one finger, boom, boom, boom, boom, like that. Anyway, one afternoon, Kim and I, we passed this small farmhouse alongside a slow moving river whose name escapes me. And, uh, we're invited inside. And, you know, to this day, I, I can bring back some of the smells, the aroma of the place. It was a, a muskie, a pungent smell of, uh, what was it like manure and smoke and salt and vinegar and, and kimchi, and just living it.

It was a pleasant fragrance in, in spite of what it sounds like. Kim and I visited that farmhouse many times during the months we were stationed there. And one day I strolled over to the organ in the corner of the room. It was an ancient organ that you, you had to pump two big pedals with your feet to get it going. And I picked out the only song I could play, the only song I knew at the time, ol Lang z. You know, it goes that one. Anyway, much to my surprise, the old man of the house jumped up, his wife jumped up, and with big smiles, started speaking a mile a minute to my friend Kim. Unknowingly, I had played the Korean National anthem. That was the tune, old Lang zine. After that, the family couldn't do enough for us. That tune turned out to be a seed that was a grow even to today, 65 years later.

Well, we couldn't have been more welcome in the farmhouse after that. And we visited every time we had time off. That was often. 1946 was a pretty quiet recuperative time in the world. Anyway, one Sunday, Kim asked me if I wanted to visit the farm, and I said, no, I had a headache. And I just lie around and read or just, just relax. Well, finally, after a lot of coaxing, he finally got me out of the sack and off we went. I sat in the corner of the farmhouse feeling sorry for myself when the old man came over to me and said a few words in Korean and sort of waved his hands over my head. And just like that, my headache, which had grown into a full-blown migraine by then disappeared. When I told Kim what had happened, he laughed. He told me the old man was a muang or a shaman.

Well, muang, I never heard the expression before, but you know, I could write a book about what happened after that. For now, let me just say that I was introduced to Qi or energy manipulation to a lot of the metaphysical, uh, practices that I knew nothing about. There was chanting. I was taught ritual dancing, ritual food, ritual music, and a few other things that at the time just overwhelmed me with information. I never thought for a moment that I was gonna be using and teaching that information to other people for the rest of my life. But those months in the summer of 1946 in Korea, that was just the beginning. After that, I was shipped to Hawaii in the latter months of 46, where coincidentally on Oahu, I met a practitioner of Huna. Later I learned he was a kahuna or a Hawaiian shaman. He wouldn't even talk to me until I started talking to him about some of the things I'd learned in Korea.

And then he opened up and we had a lot of long and fruitful conversations while we were strolling the pineapple fields, just outside of, uh, the Schofield Barracks where I was stationed. Anyway, my, after my discharge from the Army in 1947, I was introduced to Parama Yogananda, and there I was strained in yoga after becoming a disciple. Right about that time, I began to get the feeling that all this exotic, this esoteric and spiritual knowledge I kept finding myself confronted by, was somehow guiding me via a higher intelligence. I immersed myself in yoga. I learned hypnosis. I learned and started teaching hypnotherapy, seeing all those regimens as variations of meditation. During my twenties, I spent most of my time reading, learning, and using the knowledge that I'd received. There had to be some purpose that all these varied methods of personal development, spiritual development, and healing, there had to be some purpose for all.

That. Why had to be put in front of me. Why did I seem to attract one coincidence after another, all leading me to the same place? Pretty soon, I developed a following, and I sharpened my healing skills and my ability to restore people to good health, strengthened all this began. I was convinced because I happened to play old Lang Z, the only tune I knew with one finger on an ancient organ in an old Korean farmhouse in 1946. That's how it all started. But let me bring you forward. Allow me to tell you how the concept of quantum jumping, the most amazingly effective method of rocketing a person forward came to be.

--------------------
Audio 2: The Story Behind Quantum Jumping
--------------------

The story behind quantum jumping Concept history, foundation research. Virtually everything I did with regard to solving life's problems when they came up, led me to believe that there was a higher intelligence involved. Oh, I'm aware that many of them are gonna take that statement with a, a large grain of salt. But in retrospect, as the years go by more and more, I believe that that statement has some validity to it, some truth to it. During the passing years, I've, I've studied, learned, taught, examined, and used a variety of the techniques and processes that came before me. There was Emil Kuey, Milton Erickson, hypnosis Eye Movement Therapy, E F T E M D R N L P, Feng Shui Qigong, tapping the seven principles of Hermes yoga, meditation, labyrinths octave programming, the silver Mind Control method. I taught and received feedback on them all. I became experts in them all.

And finally, during the new century, I became the American monk, an honorary title bestowed by my many thousands of students who knew of my early days as a monk. Within the self-realization organization, a monk is a person who's decided to dedicate his life to serve other living beings. That's how my life is addressed. It's all I do serve others without mountain of knowledge. As a foundation, I decided when in my late seventies, to study something on the physical plane, whereas before all my focus had been on the metaphysical dimensions. And so one day after lecturing before Dr. Edgar Mitchell's group in Petaluma, California, I decided to look into the world of physics. I'd lunch with Dr. Mitchell, and we discussed his time as an astronaut when he was a sixth man. To set foot on the moon intrigued me and I, I left the Institute of Noetic Sciences with an armload of books written by many, many eminent scientists, both physicists and quantum physicists.

Alas, the science of physics was beyond me. I decided to stick to what I knew best. Metaphysics after all, my lecture before the students and teachers of the Noetic Sciences was intriguing, and my presentation was well received, but everything happens for a reason. I found the reason in one of the books I'd read by physicist Alan Wolf in another, by Achi Kaku, professor of Theoretical physics, and author of many books dealing with the concepts of quantum physics. Then I read a quote by Franks of the Royal Astronomical Society of Canada. He said, if a universe can be imagined, it exists. Now. I thought, what in the world does that mean does? Well, let's see if we can find an answer. It seems that there's an idea in physics of infinite universes, infinite meaning that whatever can be imagined is in one of that endless number of universes.

Now, many of these learned men accept the premise that in an infinite universe, a super verse or a multiverse, whatever can be imagined actually does exist. Infinity is endless, endless. And the quantum physics theory is that there is an infinite sea of bubble universes, endless and beyond number, and one of those universes, the time is prehistoric. And another, it's far into our future. In one of those universes, you are a king, a queen, homeless, successful, rich, poor, plain handsome, ugly, beautiful, a musician, a business person, a soldier, an actor, a ballplayer, whatever. Whatever can be imagined is in an infinite universe. As I've said, it appears that this is a standard belief in the field of quantum physics. Only problem is it's beyond the laws of physics for person to break through any of the bubbles. And so here we are in our own little bubble universe with thousands of billions of trillions of planet stars, solar systems in galaxies, in other bubble universes.

But we are just one of an infinity of universes. But then I thought, the laws of physics, they don't apply in the world of metaphysics and the world of metaphysics. I can imagine myself on the planet Mars in an instant. The speed of light doesn't apply on the mental level. Well, that being the case, I can break through our grain of a bubble universe in an instant and go wherever I like. Whenever I like, I can do that mentally. And so can anyone was my thought. But when, when that came to me, I decided to utilize all that knowledge, that half century of knowledge that had been planted in my mind and come up with a method of teaching it to other people. Then they would indeed have the way and the means of breaking out of the bumb we're in, they would have the means of controlling their lives, their reality.

But first had to develop a process, and that process had to work for me while on this problem. For some time still, another thought came to me, something that took place. Some years back in New Jersey, uh, it was a social gathering in a friend's house. I was presenting a, a seminar nearby, and it seems like I was always doing a seminar somewhere, and one of the people at the, uh, the gathering pulled out a guitar, and we had a contest to see who was the best singer. Everyone had to participate. I wasn't a vocalist, didn't care to participate, but I saw that to turn them down was to go against my own training, which was that there's no such thing as failure, only learning experience. And so I went to a deep meditation and I took what I now see as my first quantum jump, but that's not what I called it at the time.

I just kind of melded into the body of, of a singer. And Al Jolson somehow came up, and when I visualized him, I just kind of daydreamed him and said, okay, al, you sing. Now I know that sounds unusual. Let me tell you how I did that. While in deep meditation, I imagined Al Joel singing, and then I visualized myself walking over to him, and I slipped into his body after I slipped into his body as he sung. I also singing, was singing along with him, but it wasn't me singing. It was, I imagined him singing. Now, I didn't know it at the time, but what I was doing was getting into his rhythm with my extensive background into the metaphysical world. It worked the very first time because when it came my time to sing, even though I, I don't sing, I had never sung before outside, you know, happy birthday or something.

I blew everyone away, including myself. They recorded me after that, I started singing song after song after song. That was my first quantum jump. But as I said, I didn't know it at the time. I was actually offered, uh, jobs, uh, as to sing for, for groups. And I, I, I, I laughed. I I'm not a vocalist. I've never felt that I was what I became through quantum jumping, because I was always working it out for me anyway, while working out the process. I, I, I thought about that time when I was singing and things started to come to me in infinity, in an infinity of universes. I was everything. And, and of course, so was everyone else. I was in every profession, every occupation, every strat of society, everything. I studied and worked with people again and again, smoothing out the process, simplifying it so that anyone could use it.

And then I came to a word the scientists were using double ganger. It's a German word, meaning double walker. It was a twin self, an exact duplicate in another universe, and one of the infinity of universes, exactly like me, but with different upbringing, different programming, a self who had made different choices in life. Oh, I thought a long time about that one. So there were twin selves, exactly like me. They looked like me. They fought like me, had the same parents as I did, same friends, same upbringing in some cases, but they made different choices. When I joined the regular army, while a draftee in Korea, one of my twin selves didn't. When I met the girl at a party, I went to a 1949 who was to become my wife, my twin self didn't. He met a different girl with different parents from a different culture.

When I met Yogananda, he didn't, and on and on. Interesting that notion. So then there was a me who was an expert in whatever. I could have imagine a success in every endeavor. Now, so far, my conclusions were the same as that of the quantum physicists at the time. But they felt it was impossible to break out of your bubble and reach your twin self. I didn't feel that. I knew just the opposite. I could break out any time simply by using my mind, and that's when quantum jumping was born. First time I formally used a quantum jumping technique, knowing I was doing, it was during a class in creativity. I was teaching in San Diego. It was decided throughout the seminar that I knew little about photography. And so I was kind of challenged to take a quantum jump into a twin self who was a successful and famous photographer.

See if I could learn from him. Well, I used the process that you were learning here, and I soon found myself looking at a man myself, actually with a black velvet hood over his head, leaning into an old fashioned box camera. I asked him for advice on my becoming a photographer, and I heard him say, take a lot of pictures. Well, that didn't mean much to me. What kind of advice is that? But that's all I got out of that jump. Well, I, I was working it out. So I bought a camera and I took a lot of pictures after they'd been developed. That was before the days of digital photography. I spread them out and discovered that I had a lot of pictures, none of 'em special or even good back. I went for another chump to the tw same twin self. I mentally said, Hey, it didn't work.

And was there any other, other advice for me? Plant yourself was what I heard. What kind of advice is that? I thought plant yourself and take a lot of pictures. Anyway, I, I forgot the whole incident. It was interesting, but it was just a day dream. Well, the next day I found myself at the marina in San Diego looking for a good spot to get a picture. I moved over to the shoreline of the marina and I was poking around where the water meets the, uh, the rocks there, and I was poking around in some rocks and finding a likely spot where I, where I had a, a good composition. I felt I stent my feet down so I wouldn't slip, and I kind of planted myself. So, hmm, I wonder if that's what my twin self meant. Well, anyway, standing in one spot, I took a lot of pictures, firmly planted there, kind of making a tripod outta myself.

And when the photos were developed, I spread them all out on the bed looking for the best one, and something happened. Lo and behold, it wasn't a bunch of pictures, it was one picture. I took 130 photos, and the 130 photos that I took when laid out like a jigsaw puzzle, had turned into one big picture. And what a picture. It was a classic that's been shown in galleries around the world, you might say, because they showed in Switzerland, in Geneva. It seems as though I was on to something. Now, my original Burtons, as they're called, so for thousands of dollars, and I don't consider myself a photographer any more than I consider myself a singer. When I was singing, my belief in the validity of quantum jumping took a quantum jump right about then. I didn't want to pursue photography, but I just wanted to see if there was something in quantum jumping that could turn me into a photographer, which you did.

Hmm. Then there's something to this. I'm still not sure what it is, but I became convinced that this may well be the most effective process on the planet for self-improvement and unlocking the hidden abilities that are buried within everyone. I used a quantum jump to become a pianist, and I don't know the first thing about music or the piano, nor do I read music or no chords, but people love to hear me play the piano I never painted before, but at age 78, so when I said I was 78 years old when I took a quantum jump and became a professional artist, and my work sells. I don't know anything about writing, but I've written 11 books. I jumped into a feng shui self and became a master of feng shui and on and on and on. Now, is quantum jumping a magic wand? No, nothing works all the time.

I've said that thousands of times. But quantum jumping works enough of the time to put you in command to give you control. A jumper has confidence and motivation and will take on just about anything. A jumper is in control of that elusive law of attraction. A jumper knows no defeat. Defeat will never win, and quantum jumpers never lose because they know they have an unending number of twin cells waiting in the to help them. Your doppelganger or twin self, as I prefer to call them, is there for you to help you to transform your life, to help you to attain the life you dream about, but don't quite know how to go about starting. Well, that's my job, to get you started making the right choices, wise decisions, and to develop a winning out attitude so that you'll have a better and better life. Now, then you may wanna ask, how can you double ger help to transform your life?

That's a good question. And what's important, because sometimes the question is just as important as the answer. What hidden talents are buried deep within you? Waiting for an open sesame to bring them out? What if you have talents and the means to overcome all the obstacles in your life within you, but you haven't known how to bring 'em out? How many people have the voices of a Pavarotti or a Maria callous, but never thought to sing? How many people have the business acumen of a a, a Warren Buffett, but had no idea how to release it, and how many have the creativity of Steve Jobs within them, but didn't know how to bring it out? What's hidden in your inner conscious? Later, you hear me speak about rhythm or the energy of things? For now, let me briefly give you a bit of information on this particular principle.

All things have an energy, a field that surrounds it all. Things from the smallest molecule to our star. The sun science accepts this fact that everything is in constant never ending motion. As example on the physical scale, the first note of music would be the musical note. A, a vibrates at 880 frequencies per second. Always, that's science. On other octaves, the frequency is either doubled or have most know this. What is not generally known is that all things add their own particular vibration or rhythm. That being said, people who are successful have a different rhythm than those who are not sick. People have a different rhythm than those who are not talented. People have a different rhythm as well. Places have rhythms. A church or temple has a different feel, a different rhythm than a jail or a mental institution. Cities and countries have a rhythm. Your successful, talented doppelganger or twin self has a different rhythm than you do, or it may be the same rhythm, but on a different octave. When you jump to another universe, you do it mentally. You can't bring back the material things that are there, but you can, by using the quantum jumping process, bring back the rhythm of success, and that's why the quantum jumping process can be your most valuable resource.

Audio 3: Introduction to Quantum Mind Sequence
--------------------

Wondering how to attract the good luck and fortunate events your successful doppelganger has. In this chapter, you will learn how to extract their experiences and apply it to your life like they were your own. The key lies in keeping a consistently abundant mindset, even in times of strife. It is. Here you will learn the underlying mental techniques needed for applying effective quantum jumping, and now introduction to the quantum mind sequence with author Bert Goldman. 

And so we begin. Now, before you take your first jump, there's a few things that you wanna know and do before you become a qualified jumper. First of all, let me open you to the power of the bga. This is an ancient yoga technique that goes back thousands of years. The concept being the use of one of the so-called, uh, minor chakras, namely the tlu, that's T A L u, the tolu, which is the most neglected, even though it's among the most useful of all the chakra points. The Tolu chakra is located at the soft palate just behind the upper row of teeth. I learned a barga technique in 1950 while a disciple of paramount yoga. And I've used it more times than I can imagine. Since then, the method itself couldn't be simpler. Just touch the tip of your tongue to the roof of your mouth. 

That's where the soft palate is now. Then you may well ask now, well, what good is that gonna do? Well then in, in itself, it won't do any good. It's a trigger. It's meant to set something off an action. It's a fuse, but a fuse that isn't attached to anything will just fizzle and burn out. The BGA requires intent. Before you use it, you must have some outcome in mind. Touching the tip of your tongue to the roof of your mouth is kinda like telling your mind, Hey, get ready. We're about to do something, and that's something is your intent. And couple that with the fact that it is a chakra point, it becomes an important resource. So important that I'm going to be reinforcing it with every meditation that we do before each jump. And one thing you'll be doing prior to your first quantum jump is to go to the meditation state. 

The meditation state is a stage of consciousness where you are at ease and totally concentrative on one subject where you are stress-free and relaxed. A meditation is kind of a, a jumping off place. It's easier to reach this concentrative state of consciousness if your intention is to relax and you touch your tongue to the roof of your mouth using the bga. That's the way to use the bagga for your first jump. In future, whenever you desire something to happen of an immediate nature, use the Bagga as example. Say that you're going to a restaurant, you want a good seat, and you wanna make the right choice in what you choose from food to eat while on the way you touch your tongue to the roof of your mouth and think good seat or best choice or, or good meal, or whatever words apply that sets your intent. 

You're going somewhere and you want a parking place close to where you'll be on the way. Use the bagga and think good parking place or just parking place. That's it, <laugh>. Now I know how that sounds. If it sounds kinda weird, don't judge it. Use it. And soon you'll be using it constantly. No, it doesn't work every single time. Nothing does, but it works enough to become a valuable asset in your box of resources. Personally, I use it many times, every day. Keep it simple. You know, over the years I've been teaching the bug for 30 years. We've had tens of thou, maybe hundreds of thousands of people who use it and attest to the fact that, geez, I got, I I I was going this place and nobody, everybody could looking for a pocket place. And boom, I used a bag on there, somebody pulled out. 

Just I was pulling in. It almost seems like a magic wand, but it's not. Don't expect it to work all the time, but it works enough so that you will be using it more and more. And the more you use it, the more you see how valuable it becomes in your life. It tells your mind, get ready. We're about to do something. You'll discover new ways to use the bagga. Now, a few words about the alpha state. The medical community has separated the frequencies of the brain into four basic areas, delta, theta, alpha, and beta. The brain's frequency of electrical emanations changes with a variety of activities. Basically, the more emotional one is the higher the frequency. The beta area is the aware awake state. You're now in beta. When you listen to me here, and when you go about your daily activities, if you were to be hooked up to an electroencephalograph or an e e G mechanism, your brain would be producing about 21 cycles or frequencies per second. 

When you're in beta, the more excited you are, the higher the brain frequency, the more relaxed, the lower the brain frequency. When the brain is producing about 13 cycles per second, you are in a state of relaxation going into on your way to the alpha area, which is between seven and 13 frequencies per second. 10 cycles per second is the ideal stage of relaxation. And that stage of relaxation is what we call a deep state of alpha. When we speak of alpha, we're generally speaking of the brain producing 10 frequencies per second. Now, this is a simplification of brainwave production, but it's all the information that you need at this time. Just look at alpha as a very relaxed state of mind. When you are highly concentrated. That's enough. Meditation is almost always a state of alpha consciousness. The simplest way to look at Alpha is to think of it as a relaxed, stress-free area. 

Going to alpha, totally relaxing, meditating a very much the same thing. So with this module, your intent is to relax, meditate, visualize, and then take your first jump into an alternate universe to visit your twin self. First thing is to find a quiet place where you'll be undisturbed for 15 minutes or so. Now then before taking the first jump, consider a problem that you have a minor problem. What do you think the cause of that problem is? Something caused it something you did or something you did not do. Something that someone else did, or something that someone else didn't do. Something caused it. It might've been a choice that you made. That choice was the source of the problem. Think about what you can learn from the problem. If failure was involved, it was a learning experience. You learn what not to do. Problems are also learning experiences. 

When you jump, you do that with a fearless attitude. Consider this fear is simply a negative expectation. When you fear something, you expect something bad to happen. But when you jump, you're fearless because you expect something good to happen. You're going to jump into a twin self who made different choices and therefore does not have the problem. Your twin self is involved with the outcome that you're seeking, that you're looking for. So use this first jump as an example. Remember, we're, we're still in kindergarten here. This is kind of a test run. You'll be using your visualization sense. That's the daydreaming mechanism of yours that creates mental images. You've daydreamed in the past for recreation, for stress-free relaxation. When you use quantum jumping, you are using that same daydreaming mechanism, but this time for creation, not recreation or recreation. Recreation. This time creation, there's a big difference there. 

When you daydream, you're playing around with things. You're the greatest baseball player, you are the greatest fisherman, or whatever your hobby is, you're the king of the world. But you know that it, it's, it's, it's just a fantasy. It's recreation. But when you quantum jump, you're looking for a positive result. You're creating something. And now for your first jump. Now remember, alpha is simply identifying a relaxed state of mind during this meditation. We will also program and set the bagga for you to use at any time from now to whenever. Okay, now we're going to start getting to the alpha level with the three to one count. This we use in all of our, our meditations, our mental conditioning exercises, if you will. We just call these jumps, meditations. I start with the three to one count. When you do the three to one count, it's very easy if you do it this way. 

When I say 3, 3, 3, 2, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, mentally, you take a deep breath and you mentally say 3, 3, 3. And you diminish the mental sound of the three each time you order it, so it isn't 3, 3, 3, but rather 3, 3, 3. And then take a deep breath and 2, 2, 2. You see, you diminish the sound of it each time, and then 1, 1 1. After a while, just by doing the three to one count, you will be in a state of meditation. Now, this alone will put you in that stress-free zone. I recommend you do the three to one and just that a few times a day, whenever you're in a stressful environment. Okay? Alright. Now, this, uh, is an alpha meditation exercise to help you to get to the transit door, the transit point of quantum jumping. So relax, find yourself a, a comfortable place where you're going to be undisturbed for a while, and we'll go into our first jump, the introductory jump.


--------------------
Audio 4: The First Quantum Jump Meditation
--------------------

Find a comfortable position. Close your eyes. Take a deep breath. And as you exhale, mentally repeat and visualize the number three three times. Take another deep breath. And as you exhale, mentally repeat and visualize the number two three times. Take another deep breath. And as you exhale, mentally repeat and visualize The number one, three times. To help you to enter the alpha level of mind, I'm going to count from ten. On every descending number, you will feel yourself going inward. And you will enter a pleasant meditation level of mind where you'll be able to concentrate fully on one subject. Ten, nine, feel going deeper. Eight, seven, six. Deeper and deeper. Five. Four. Three. Deeper and deeper. Two. What a pleasant level of mind where you are able to concentrate fully on one subject. At this time, concentrate on my words. You are now and always in complete control of your state of mind. You can open your eyes. You can be fully alert anytime you wish to be. Every time you enter this relaxed state, know that you're getting better and better in every way. Whenever you enter this relaxed meditation state, you'll mentally say, every day, in every way, I'm getting better and better. And when you say these words, sense yourself improving in all areas of your life. Sense yourself getting better and better. Visualize improvements in your life now. As you mentally repeat the words, every day, in every way, I'm getting better and better. Relax. Relax your eyes, your lips, mouth. Relax your jaw. Relax your head, your neck. Relax your body. Relax your arms and hands. Relax your legs and feet. You now completely repeat mentally. My body rests and refreshes itself when I consciously relax. I am relaxed. Repeat mentally. Every day my image of myself gets better. I can do anything I have a desire to do. I am a wonderful human being. There's no one else on earth exactly like me. Every day I grow stronger knowing. that I can. I can think. I can create. I can do. I can do anything I have a desire to do. Relax. At this time, concentrate on the image of you relaxed and at ease. Get a sense of yourself sitting comfortably, eyes closed, at a relaxed level of mind, the alpha level. With that thought, you are as comfortable as you can. possibly be. Still holding that image in your mind and with the mouth closed, touch the roof of your mouth with the tip of your tongue and hold it there while I count from one to three. One, two, three. That's fine. In touching the tip of your tongue to the roof of your mouth, you were just programmed that whenever you do touch the tip of your tongue to the roof of your mouth, you are striving for success. in something. This is an ancient technique we call the bhaga. Use it when you wish to strengthen intent. The bhaga is a means of telling your mind to come to attention. You want something. There are many choices that appear in your life. Some of them are clear. Some of them are purely guesswork and generally made spontaneously. When you are relaxed, and stress -free as you are now, inspiration may help you to make the right choice, the choice that you will be happy with further on down the line. At this time, think about an incident in the past that, at the time, seemed to be insignificant, but turned out to be the cause of a problem or problems in your life. It was an incident.

that you did not necessarily have to go along with. There are always other choices, other paths you might have taken. Now you are going to go back to that incident mentally and examine it at this, the alpha level. Relax. I'm going to count from one to three and a door will appear in front of you. One, two, three. Imagine now that there is a door in front of you. This is the transit point. The transit door, the jumping off place to get you wherever your intent directs you to go. Beyond the door, there are an infinite number of dimensions, an infinite number of universes. In one of those universes, you took a different path. The incident of the past that is causing you problems now had a different conclusion in one of those universes. A positive conclusion. Anything that you can imagine is in one of the infinite number of dimensions now available to you on the other side of that door. Millions upon millions of you, each of these cells is a twin self of yours who is experiencing a different reality than you are now because of different choices. of problems, or a problem, in your present life. I'm going to count from one to three, and at the count of three, the door will open, and you will jump or step through it, whichever you're more comfortable doing. You will then be back to that scene that was the source of problems in your present life. But it will be your twin self in the scene. Don't judge it. Don't critique it. Just view the scene as... Your twin self is going through the scene just as you did. One, two, three. The door is opening. Now just go through it. You are now back at that long ago scene that is causing you problems in the present. Examine it. Imagine it. View the scene as an observer only. Begin. The scene was instigated long ago by that thing that was said or done, either by you or by others. Perhaps the thing that was not said or done. In a parallel dimension, there's another you, a double, who had a different outcome to that incident. After viewing the scene as you remember it happening, come back to the other side of the transit door to count to three. One, two, three. You are now back at this side of the transit door.

Now I'm going to count from one to three and you will again jump through the doorway and you'll find yourself observing the scene that you'd like to change. Except the scene has already changed. In the infinity of choices, your doppelganger, your twin self, made a different choice. Imagine that. View the scene as you would have liked it to be, as it is in another dimension. View your twin self's handling of the same scene. that is causing you problems in the present, but observe it as your doppelganger, your twin self, handled it in a positive way, a way that would cause your present to be a joyful place with success and all the best in life. On the count of three, imagine the scene as you would have wished it to go, as it did go in another dimension. One, two, three, begin. Take your time. Relax. That was fine. That was good. Now I will count from one to three, and you'll be back on this side of the transit door, in this reality. One, two, three. You are now back on this side of the door, back in this dimension, this reality. In a moment, I'm going to count from one to three. At that moment, you'll open your eyes. You'll be wide awake and alert, feeling better than you did before. Feeling as though you've released a great problem, a great energy that causes feeling better than you did before. One, two, three. Eyes open, wide awake, feeling wonderfully refreshed, feeling better than before.

INTRO LESSON 3: Vishen Shares a Tour of Burt's Home in 2010
--------------------

Here's Part 1 with all references to Bert/Bert's corrected to Burt/Burt's:

**PART 1 (CORRECTED):**
So the man I was going to meet was Burt Goldman, that remarkable 83 -year -old Renaissance man who is a well -known painter, artist, internet entrepreneur, writer, personal development leader, and seems to be mastering skill after skill after skill despite the fact that he's over 80 years old. I drove two hours north of San Diego to meet Burt at his home in Rancho Mirage. It was one of the most beautiful drives I've ever been on. Hey Burt, good to see you. The artwork over here is amazing. Well, you may as well get it all. Come on in here. My God, you're prolific at coming up with this stuff. You're looking at maybe a quarter of it. Wow. This is very, very, very cool. One of the things that most impressed me about Burt's home is the amount of artwork hanging on the walls. Literally every blank space of wall was covered in art. I'd known Burt as a personal development leader. But never as such a prolific artist. And this is where all the magic happens. This is where you produce your stuff. This is where I'm surrounded by computers. And that's your art studio. So if you've heard of Burt Goldman, you've heard of his quantum jumping technique. And Burt's idea that one can pick up any skill, plus ideas and inspiration, by going into deep levels of mind and connecting with other sources of intelligence. Now, one of Burt's most remarkable feats in quantum jumping occurred while teaching a class in San Diego. He told his students about the idea and challenged them to suggest a skill that he would pick up over the weekend and bring back to them in the next class, which was about five days later. One of them raised their hands and said, how about photography? Burt said, okay, and that day he went home, did his quantum jumping exercise, and asked to develop the skills of a photographer. Burt had two messages come into his head. The first was the phrase, plant yourself. The second was the phrase, take lots of pictures. Armed with this knowledge, he headed to the beach the very next day in San Diego. As Burt was heading towards the beach, he found himself slipping on some rocks that led down to the beach. Instinctively, he planted his feet on the ground to prevent himself from falling further. And then it occurred to him, that first message, plant yourself. So Burt thought about the second message, take lots of photos, and using his feet firmly planted on the ground and his body as a pivot, he moved his body around and took multiple photographs. That night, he developed his photos, went back to his hotel room, scattered them across his bed, and immediately he noticed something really interesting. These pictures could fit together like pieces of a jigsaw puzzle. And when he cut these pictures up and pasted them on a canvas, they turned into a beautiful piece of art. This was the start of Burt's style of photography. And to date, he's been in at least one International Photography Hall of Fame. And this is a famous original picture. This is the first one. And this was when those words, plant yourself and take lots of photos, came to you. That's it. Plant yourself. This is where I planted myself. This is San Diego. Beautiful. Cool. And you can see what that evolved into when you look at... These pictures, this is that style of photography that you developed where you take multiple pictures and you put them together. Wow, it's got this really cool 3D effect to it. What would something like this cost? Because this is beautiful. Well, I had it in the gallery and had it up for $12 ,000 and then decided, no, I don't want to sell it. So I told my children, because I've got like 100 paintings, I said, you know, One day, a long time from now, these are going to be worth enough to put your grandchildren through 10 colleges. So just hang on to them for a while. So none of these are for sale? None of these are for sale. If I gave you $12 ,000 for that right now, you wouldn't sell it? I wouldn't sell it. $20 ,000. If I didn't know you, no. $20 ,000. Well, you know, you reach a point where you say, well, come on. But this is pretty cool. It's not worth $20 ,000 yet. Yet. Right. Maybe one day. You've got 100 paintings in here. And, I mean, if the average is around 10 grand each, that's a million dollars worth of paintings in this house. That's why I'm not giving this address to any one of the blog readers. So, Burt, in Quantum Jumping, you mentioned a piece of art called At the Museum. This is it, right? Yes. The idea is you're supposed to be standing here and as though you're in a museum looking at all the different works. Right. And this is super, super creative. This is very, very, very cool. So, like, you get these ideas through quantum jumping. Most of my ideas I do get through quantum jumping. Yeah. Now, what's cool is, I mean, like, imagine if this was applied at business or at, you know, at other stuff that requires instant creativity. Wow. Imagine the money that could be made there. And he's also gone on to become a prolific writer and internet entrepreneur. His websites and blogs are among the most popular personal development websites and blogs on the net. He's also now starting to learn singing and music. And he's working on his latest iPhone app. And of course, he's doing all of this at the age of 83. What's he going to pick up next? Ballroom dancing, martial arts, cage fighting, who knows? But Burt's ability to evolve himself and pick up different skills and talents seemingly with ease is seeming as an inspiration to millions of people, particularly people who are past 50 and are looking for new ways to bring joy and talent and skill and ideas into their life. Burt is really teaching people that no matter how old you are or what restrictions you might have, you can be anyone you want to be by simply tapping into unused portions of your mind.

INTRO LESSON 4: 3 Elements to Improve Visualization
Text lesson only. No video
--------------------

3 Elements to Improve Your Quantum Jumping Visualization
When it comes to manifesting our goals from the realm of ideas into reality, a simple misunderstanding can leave us feeling disillusioned. Understanding how and why creative visualization works is the first step to using it effectively.

Quantum Jumping expert, Burt Goldman, shares 3 key elements that must be met to manifest the most with your visualizations.

Of all the “New Age” techniques for manifesting our dreams, creative visualization is perhaps the best known – unfortunately, it is also the most misunderstood.

The West began to embrace “visualization” as a powerful technique when Russian athletes used it to train for the Olympic Games in the 80s.

Athletes that spent 25% of their time on physical training and 75% of their time mentally training performed better than those who spent all of their time exclusively on physical training. To this day, most of the best athletes employ creative visualization as a central part of their training program.

However, effective visualization requires 3 very specific components:

1. Detail
The most common complaint I hear from people is that they can’t “see” or create a clear enough picture. They close their eyes and maybe all they see are colors or even just a “blank screen”.

The key here is to use all five senses – not just sight.

If you can’t see your new job – can you hear it? Imagine a conversation you may have with a colleague or superior. A very detailed conversation where you are expressing yourself to others with extreme confidence and competence.

Can you smell your new job? Perhaps your desk is near the coffee maker. Now the conversation you have imagined has a smell attached to it.

Can you touch your new job? Maybe you can feel the warmth of the coffee cup in your hands as you talk to your colleagues.

2. Consistency
Think of visualization as preparing for a live performance.

Actors, directors, and technical staff do not leave rehearsing to chance – there is a formal schedule put into place.

At first, rehearsals are scheduled quite frequently and the performances are usually pretty choppy. People forget their lines, actors have not completely embraced their characters, and props are missing. But, with frequent rehearsal, performances begin to improve.

Eventually, scheduled, consistent, and frequent rehearsals result in performances where the actors completely forget they are on stage and become the play.

Just like in the performing arts, the power of visualization is truly realized when it is performed in a scheduled, consistent, and frequent manner.

3. Belief
“To be it, you must believe it”. This statement is true on more levels than you might realize.

Psychologists call this the “self-fulfilling prophecy”.

It has been observed that whatever one believes about themselves or their circumstances, impacts their behavior, which then impacts the result – often causing the initial belief to become true.

For example, if you believe you will flunk a test, it is likely that your study habits will be negatively impacted, reducing the amount of material you remember. The result? You are not your best on the day of the test and the original belief becomes reality.

However, visualization techniques can help change negative self-fulfilling prophecies into positive ones.

Bonus: How to Radically Transform Your Life With Creative Visualization
The most powerful (and my personal favorite) way to use visualization is to “quantum jump”.

This involves visualizing your twin or “doppelgänger” in an alternate universe who is already “doing the thing or getting the thing” we want to make real in our current lives.

The process takes you through imagining yourself talking to this already-successful version of yourself and receiving tips, instructions, and specific information to help you now.

People that use this technique have been able to shift their lives in directions they didn’t believe were possible without really understanding how or why it works. I find that to be the most beautiful part of the whole thing – you don’t need to understand how something works to benefit from it.

Part 1: Chapter 1: Jump Into Abundance

====================


Lesson 1: Jump Into an Abundant Mindset
--------------------

Jump Into Abundance
What is abundance? Why do some people have loads of it and other people don’t have any? When you’re out of rhythm with the universe, scarcity is never far. You walk through life as if you have a black cloud hanging over your head.

By using Quantum Jumping, you can access a twin-self who already has the rich life and universal “rhythm” that you desire. This twin-self has already attracted the fortunate events that lead to success. In this part of the program, you’ll learn how to access the abundance of your twin-self and bring it back into this universe with you.

Listen to the introduction audio below to get started.

--------------------
Audio 1: Introduction to Jump Into Abundance
--------------------

Abundance is present all throughout the universe, and it can be yours if you only dare to ask for it. The trick is believing that you are worthy of receiving it. In this chapter, you'll discover more about the true meaning of abundance and how you can let it flow into all areas of your life. And now, introduction to the jump into abundance with author Bert Goldman, 

One of the most elusive things is that is that seemingly accidental factor in life called abundance. Some people are born with it, some work for it, some fight for it, and others just seem to fall into it. Then there are those who don't care about it at all, but what is it and why do some people have loads of it and other people don't have any? Abundance generally comes about after a series of fortunate events. Luck, you might say the opposite is true as well. There are people who are involved with scarcity. That's the opposite of abundance. What is not generally considered is that there are degrees of abundance for someone who's at a phase with the universe at a rhythm, so to speak, scarcity comes into the door and the person is like that guy in the comics who walks through life with a black cloud hanging over his head. 

If abundance was on a scale of degrees with super abundance on one end and terrible scarcity on the other, most of us would be somewhere on that line. Well, everyone would be somewhere on that line. Imagine a scale with zero in the middle and out from the middle towards affluence. There were numbers from plus one to plus a hundred, plus a hundred being the abundance of a billionaire, plus one being the average person who works all their lives, living only for the day they can retire. Now, go the other way. Minus one to minus 100 on the scarcity side, 100 minus being homeless and one minus just getting by. Where on that scale would you be? Well, what people generally don't think about when working with the laws of attraction is that attraction means to draw something to you. Those things that we hopefully are attracting are abundance, along with positive events, a pleasing partner in life, employment, the home and automobile business, success, and of course, money. 

But when you use the laws of attraction with no understanding of the overriding law of rhythm, then you're just as likely to attract the opposite, scarcity, poverty, negative events, a dreadful partner, loss of a job, a poor home, and so on. It's still attraction. You're still attracting. In quantum jumping. We now have the means through the use of the quantum jumping concept of reaching a twin self who already has a rich life and who has the rhythm that we want for ourselves, the twin self who has already attracted the fortunate events that you may lack, but want. Now we have a question that is, how do you attract what your successful doppelganger has? Your twin self has? Only fortunate events, only. Good luck. Well, before answering that question, let me speak of rhythm. Allow me to define the great principle of rhythm. It states all things rise and fall. 

All things are born, grow, peak, diminish, or deteriorate, and end or die. There are cycles within cycles as example, you wake up in the morning, your day is born, it grows, peaks at some time or another, and then diminishes and ends or dies. But when your day cycle dies, your night or sleep cycle begins, it grows peaks and ultimately ends, and once again, your day cycle is born. That's the way of all things including affluence. The cycles of rhythm when under control may allow you the full consciousness, the full resourcefulness of attracting only good fortune and being at the right place at the right time, catching things at the top, the peak rather than at the bottom, so that you'll be on the plus side of that metaphorical scale of degrees. Now, there are many scales, many levels of abundance. Let's simplify the word and just say that it means lots of when you have abundance and wealth, you have lots of money. 

When you have abundance and health, you have lots of good health. When you have abundance and relationships, you have lots of relationships that are wonderful. When you have abundant career, you have lots of success in your chosen field. When you have abundance in your home, you have lots of good feelings about where you live. When you have spiritual abundance, you have lots of faith that good things will come about. When you have abundance and adventure, you have lots of experiences and excitements in your life. These are the main issues with respect to abundance, and now through the metaphoric magic of quantum jumping, I'm gonna help you on the way through a series of specific jumps so that you may find and develop the right attitude through the use of the quantum jumping, so that you can gather the rhythm and mindset of a person who's satisfied with life, happy with your lifestyle, and looking forward to more and more of the better and better That will soon become your mantra. 

During this and other jumps that I'll be helping you with, you'll go back to some seemingly insignificant incident in your life. This incident, although apparently inconsequential at the time it happened, could be one of the causes, if not the main cause, that's keeping you from the result that you want. During the jump, you'll be directed to simply visualize or imagine something taking place. Don't judge, don't critique it. Let me repeat that. Whatever you sense what you imagine, don't judge your past judgment only observe. That's all you have to do. Keep this one simple. Just imagine that you're viewing the scene with your twin self, almost as though it were a play and you were on the stage looking at the players. After that, you'll be directed to merge with your twin self. That twin self has the rhythm of affluence that you want. Now just allow it to happen. Follow my voice as I direct you. Just keep it simple. Now, later on, you may do the jumps on your own, but for now, just relax. Find a place where you're going to be undisturbed for, oh, let's say 20 minutes or so, and we'll begin. Your first jump will take you to the place where you are going to be developing an abundant mindset or attitude.

--------------------
Audio 2: Preparation to Jump Into an Abundant Mindset
--------------------

Your mindset is the manner in which your mind is set to view your reality. The world as you see it, it's easy to see the difference in mindsets when you look at the extreme views of people, views on things that polarize people. Oh, like religion or politics or for that matter, diet or music as though we're on a scale of degrees. When you're on either extreme, the opposite view is difficult to con comprehend, but like all things, most of us are somewhere in the middle. How to know is not that difficult. Just look at the extremes and that'll take care of it. Take music as an example. One extreme might be, uh, the frantic rap sound a while at the other end, a Mozart prelude for me, the middle would be just about any of the big bands of the forties for you, perhaps, um, Elvis or Elton John. But what about abundance? The extreme attitude, that's what mindset is towards having more than you need, would be that of a Warren Buffet or Bill Gates on one end, and homeless people on the other. Where would you be on that scale? What would you be doing? This first jump will give you a good idea where you stand and how your attitude, your thinking, got you there. Knowing where you are is the first step towards getting to where you want to be.

--------------------
Meditation: Jump Into an Abundant Mindset
--------------------

Relax. Find a comfortable position. Close your eyes. Take a deep breath. And as you exhale, mentally repeat and visualize the number three three times. Take another deep breath. And as you exhale, mentally repeat and visualize the number two three times. Take another deep breath. And as you exhale, mentally repeat and visualize The number one. Three times. To help you to enter the alpha level of mind, I'm going to count from ten to one. On each descending number, you will feel yourself going inward. And you will enter a pleasant meditation level of mind where you'll be able to concentrate fully on one subject. Ten. Nine. Feel going deeper. Eight. Seven. Six. Deeper and deeper. Five. Four. Three. Deeper and deeper. Two. One. You are now at a pleasant level of mind where you are able to concentrate fully on one subject. At this time, concentrate on my words. You are now and always in complete control of your state of mind. You can open your eyes and be fully alert anytime you wish to be. Every time you enter this relaxed state, know that you're getting better and better in every way. Whenever you enter this relaxed meditation state, you'll mentally say, every day, in every way, I'm getting better and better. When you sense these words, sense yourself improving in all areas of your life. Sense yourself getting better and better. Visualize improvements in your life as you mentally repeat the words. Every day, in every way, I'm getting better and better. Relax. Relax your eyes. Relax your lips. Your jaw. Relax your head. Relax your neck. Relax your body. Relax your arms and hands. Relax your legs. and feet you are now completely relaxed repeat mentally my body rests and refreshes itself when i consciously relax i am relaxed now repeat mentally after me every day my image of myself gets better i can do anything i have a desire to do i am a wonderful human being There's no one else on earth exactly like me. Every day I grow stronger knowing that I can. I can think. I can create. I can do. I can do anything I have a desire to do. Relax. At this time, concentrate on the image of you relaxed and at ease. Get a sense of yourself. Comfortable. Eyes closed. at the alpha level. At thought, you are as comfortable as you can possibly be. Still holding that image in your mind, and with your mouth closed, touch the roof of your mouth with the tip of your tongue, and hold it there while I count from one to three. One, two, three. That's fine. You may release your tongue now. In touching the tip of your tongue to the roof of your mouth, you were just reprogrammed, that whenever you do touch the tip of your tongue to the roof of your mouth, you are striving for success in something. Each time you are programmed for the bhaga, it is reinforced. Use it when you wish to strengthen intent. The bhaga is a means of telling your mind to come to attention. You want something. There are many choices that appear in your life. Some of them are clear. Some of them are purely guesswork and made spontaneously. When you are relaxed and stress -free, as you are now, inspiration often helps you to make the right choice, the choice that you will be happy with later on in life. Relax.Imagine that one of your twin selves thinks just like you do on all subjects. Now imagine that another of your twin selves takes a positive attitude toward those things. And another of your twin selves has a negative attitude toward those things. First think about money and the things that money can buy. A fine house, a fine car, expensive restaurants, things of luxury. I'm going to count from one to three and a door will appear in front of you. The transit door. One, two, three. Imagine now that there is a door in front of you. This is the transit point. and jumping off place to get you wherever your intent directs you to go. Beyond the door, there are an infinite number of dimensions, an infinite number of universes. And one of those universes is the positive twin self, who sees everything from a positive viewpoint, a positive attitude. You will visit your positive twin self first. I'm going to count from one to three, and at the count of three, the door will open. You'll jump or step through it, whatever you're comfortable doing. You will then see everything that you did yesterday as your positive twin self doing it. Everything will be seen with positive eyes. One, two, three. The door is opening, and now just jump through it. And now you're going through your entire day as your positive twin self would do it. View the scene as an observer only. See your positive twin self doing everything that you did yesterday, but seeing it through positive viewpoint, a positive attitude. Begin. Relax. Now once again through the scene, but this time imagine how a negative you, a negative twin self, would have viewed things. Relax. And now visit the twin self who did the things you did yesterday as you actually did them. This twin self will do exactly what you did yesterday. Begin. Relax. It's easy to see how people view the world. when you know that some of them, to varying degrees, see the world from a positive perspective and some from a negative one. Your mindset or your attitude makes you the person you most want to be. Visit your positive twin self who has an abundance -set attitude often, and you will see the world from a positive viewpoint, from a positive attitude. Relax. Now imagine a twin self who handled a situation that you had recently. Visit a self who handled things differently than you actually did. Something that you were involved with. See yourself observing the scene that you'd like to change. Except the scene has already changed. In the infinity of choices, your doppelganger, your twin self, did in fact make a different choice. Imagine that. Your twin self made a choice that led to a different conclusion. View the scene as you would have liked it to be, as it is in another dimension. View your twin self's handling of that same scene that is causing you problems in the present, but observe it as your twin self handled it in a positive way, a way that would cause your present to be a joyful place with affluence and a positive attitude. At the count of three, imagine that scene as you would have wished it to go, as it did go in that other dimension, that other universe. One, two, three, begin. Relax. That was fine. Now I will count from one to three and you'll be back on this side of the transit door in this reality. One, two, three. You are now back on this side of the door. back in this dimension, this universe. Relax. In a moment, I'm going to count from one to three. At that moment, you'll open your eyes. You'll be wide awake and alert, feeling wonderfully refreshed, feeling better than you did before. One, two, three. Eyes open, wide awake, feeling wonderfully refreshed, feeling better than before.

Audio 1: Preparation to Jump Into a Lucky You
--------------------

Luck. That combination of fortunate circumstances. It, it seems to affect some people more than others, but everyone has it to some degree. Luck is simply the law of attraction at work. Some call it e s p intuition. Some say it's a sixth sense. Everyone has e s p extra sensory perception. Some have it in abundance, some have very little of it. Flip a coin a thousand times, calling for heads each time. And according to the law of probability, you will have 500 heads and 500 tails. People who have an an abundance of E S P or luck will have 600 heads and 400 tails. They're the lucky ones. The others who have negative E S P may find 400 heads and 600 tails. Those are the ones who attract bad luck. They have negative E S P. The following jump will direct you to the twin self with an abundance of E S P, the lucky to himself.

Relax. Find a comfortable position. Close your eyes. Take a deep breath. And as you exhale, mentally repeat and visualize the number three three times. Another deep breath. And as you exhale, mentally repeat and visualize the number two three times. Take another deep breath. And as you exhale, mentally repeat and visualize the number three. Three times. To help you to enter the alpha level of mind, I'm going to count from ten to one. On each descending number, you will feel yourself going inward. And you will enter a pleasant meditation level of mind where you'll be able to concentrate fully on one subject. Ten. Nine. Feel going deeper. Eight. Seven. Six. Deeper and deeper. Five. Four. Three. Deeper and deeper. Two. One. You are now at a pleasant level of mind where you are able to concentrate fully on one subject. At this time, concentrate on my words. You are now and always in complete control of your state of mind. You can open your eyes and be fully alert anytime you wish to be. Every time you enter this relaxed state, know that you're getting better and better in every way. Whenever you enter this relaxed meditation state, you'll mentally say, every day, in every way, I'm getting better and better. When you sense these words, sense yourself improving in all areas of your life. Sense yourself getting better and better. Visualize improvements in your life as you mentally repeat the words. Every day, in every way, I'm getting better and better. Relax. Relax your eyes. Relax your lips. Your jaw. Relax your head. Relax your neck. Relax your body. Relax your arms and hands. Relax your legs. and feet, you are now completely relaxed. Repeat mentally, my body rests and refreshes itself when I consciously relax. I am relaxed now. Repeat mentally after me, every day my image of myself gets better. I can do anything I have a desire to do. I am a wonderful human being. There's no one else on earth exactly like me. Every day I grow stronger knowing that I can. I can think. I can create. I can do. I can do anything I have a desire to do. Relax. At this time, concentrate on the image of you relaxed and at ease. Get a sense of yourself. Comfortable. Eyes closed. at the alpha level. That thought, you are as comfortable as you can possibly be. Still holding that image in your mind, and with your mouth closed, touch the roof of your mouth with the tip of your tongue, and hold it there while I count from one to three. One, two, three. That's fine. You may release your tongue now. In touching the tip of your tongue to the roof of your mouth, you were just reprogrammed, that whenever you do touch the tip of your tongue to the roof of your mouth, you are striving for success in something. Each time you are programmed for the bhaga, it is reinforced. Use it when you wish to strengthen intent. The bhaga is a means of telling your mind to come to attention. You want something. There are many choices that appear in your life. Some of them are clear. Some of them are purely guesswork and made spontaneously. When you are relaxed and stress -free, as you are now, inspiration often helps you to make the right choice, the choice that you will be happy with later on in life. Relax. Imagine that one of your twin selves is a lucky self. This self attracts all the good things in life. and has come to expect good luck in all endeavors. One way in which to see your twin self as lucky is to imagine winning at something. What that something is doesn't matter too much, as all you want to do is get into the rhythm of luck. In a moment, you'll go through the transit door into the universe where your twin self is displaying the results of good luck. I'm going to count from one to three. and a door will appear in front of you, the transit door. One, two, three. Imagine now that there is a door in front of you. This is the transit point, the jumping -off place to get you wherever your intent directs you to go. Beyond the door, there are an infinite number of dimensions, an infinite number of universes, and one of those universes is the lucky twin self. who sees everything from a luck viewpoint, a positive luck viewpoint. Your intention at this time is to visit with that lucky doppelganger, that lucky twin self. I'm now going to count from one to three. To count to three, the door will open, and you will jump or step through it, whatever you're comfortable doing. One, two, three. The door is opening, and now just... Jump through. In front of you is your lucky twin self. Imagine it. Create the image. Know that the image in front of you is your lucky twin self. Observe your lucky twin self. Get a sense of your twin self winning. Winning at cards or winning with slot machines, winning with lottery tickets, winning a race, winning at your favorite sport. Sense your twin self smiling, looking in your direction. View the scene. As an observer only, observe the scene. Take your time. Relax. Now walk closer to your twin self and then merge. Just imagine your body just merging into your twin self's body and then just continue to do what you observed your twin self doing. That's fine. Relax. Now I'm going to count from one to three and you'll be back on this side of the transit door. One, two, three. You're now back on this side of the door, back in this dimension. Relax. In a moment, I'm going to count from one to three. In that moment, you'll open your eyes, be wide awake, fully alert, feeling better than you did before. One, two, three. Eyes open, wide awake, feeling wonderfully refreshed, feeling better than before.

But think now what it is that you’d like to gather the right rhythm for, the right investment. What would that be? Consider that before we visit your twin self.

The twin self you will be with may give you advice. That advice may be in the way of a metaphor or story, or it may almost seem like a riddle.

Part 1: Chapter 2: Jump Into Ideal Health

====================

Lesson 5: Jump Into Your Ideal Body
--------------------

Jump Into Ideal Health
The four jumps that follow in this chapter are designed to change your attitude toward your health - so that when you have it, you see it as something deserved and valuable. In this chapter, you’ll learn not only to improve your health but also how to attract your ideal body.

Listen to the introduction audio below to get started.

Health is one of the most beautiful gifts of life. It's time to unlock the power of Quantum Jumping to help you Jump Into Your Ideal Body.

There is preparation audio before each quantum jump audio to help you understand the intention surrounding each jump, and prepare your mindset for the quantum jumping experience.


--------------------
Audio 1: Introduction to Jump Into Ideal Health
--------------------

The four jumps featured in this chapter are meant to help guide you on changing your mindset about the idea of your ideal health, understanding that it is something deserved and valuable. Make your way through each of the jumps and watch not only your life change for the better, but the lives of those around you as well. And now introduction to the jump into ideal health with author Bert Goldman. 

Quantum jumping is designed for all ages. People tell me again and again if only I had known about this when I was in my twenties. Well, here it is. And if you're in your twenties or thirties, strap yourself in because you're gone for the right of your life. And when you finish, you'll have an appetite to devour the world for those in their forties and fifties. Well, you started late, but look forward to many, many years of the good things in life. If 60 or more, be thankful that you discovered quantum jumping because you are going to discover that you are in the very prime of life to be really effective with the things you want. You should have health, energy, and the kind of attitude that carries you forward in life no matter what your age. When you begin the quantum jumping process in general, people in their sixties feel they've crossed some kind of threshold that says you are a senior citizen, a euphemism for you are getting old kid. 

And many places offer discounts to those over 60. So social security kicks in. Even the government is telling you you're getting old. People in their seventies look and feel older still, and they hear about friends dropping like flies and celebrities leaving the planet as well. People in their eighties, for the most part, look ancient, and many of them feel that life for them is a waiting room for the hereafter. People in their nineties, they just putter through life, marveling at the fact that they're still around life after 70 seems to be bound up in memories of their lives when they were 40 and 50 with an occasional nostalgic thought of their late teens and early twenties when they were healthy and loaded with vigor and energy. Most 70 plus people look back to the time when they were 45 at the peak of their energies, both physical and mental, with only picture postcard memories of their twenties and thirties. 

Well, here am I. As of this recording, 85 years of age telling you I still see a road ahead with lots of exciting and creative things coming up. You've hopefully already had a jump or two into abundance, and soon you'll find it's all true. You do have a degree of control over the energies of the universe. Now you're going to start jumping into ideal health, and these jumps are designed to create a better you, a more vigorous you, the kind of you you most want to be. Had you given the idea of a better you any thought? Now, why should you listen to some old geezer giving you advice on anything? What can anyone in their mid eighties tell you? Most people fear aging. I never did and all because something happened to me. I discovered you could control your attitude by getting the rhythm of a twin self in an alternate universe. 

I discovered my attitude was not only different, it was under my control. Why was my attitude so different from most of the people that I knew? Well, when I was in my seventies, I decided to embark on a new career. I had gone as far as I could with the former one, so I decided to learn about photography. I'll just pick something almost at random, but it was interesting for me. Well, soon I had photos hanging in a museum when I was 78. I thought I'd take up painting. I didn't know the first thing about it, but everyone has to start somewhere soon. My canvases were being sold and are still being sold. When I turned 80, I decided to see what this internet business was all about. I had heard so many success stories, most of them about kids in their twenties and teens. 

Well, what the heck? I figured that with all my experience, I should be able to compete with them. So I learned about the computer and I started an internet company just after my 80th birthday. Now I'm 85 and have three flourishing internet businesses bring me more income than when I was active in commerce in my forties and fifties. Most people in their eighties, when I look in the mirror, they see an old man or an old lady. Me, I see a man in the prime of his life raring to get on with the day and having so much to do that weekends, there's just two more days to complete my chores. Yes, I work seven days a week, about 12 hours a day. It's not really work 'cause I love every minute of it. A few years ago, I came up with the idea of making videos for a blog so people could see me and I could offer them some of the knowledge that I've gained over the past 50 years. 

You can see some of the videos just by searching my name on YouTube. As of this date, I've made over 200 of them. Yes, that's what I said, more than 200 videos, and everyone has a helpful technique in it. I'm also working on the idea of the digital method of downloading books. I should be able to offer all of the 11 novels and nonfiction volumes that I've written. I'll have to work that out, not ready yet, but I often get ideas in the middle of the night or early in the morning. You can see why I laugh when I hear one of my contemporaries say that they're too old to change a career or too old to learn a new skill. Uh, you can't teach an old dog new tricks or better yet, too old to enjoy a new hobby nonsense. You're never too old. 

Sometimes I have to explain to friends who want me to join them in playing golf or cards or tennis or some such, I just don't have the time, and they find it hard to believe. I used to play golf, but it takes a good five hours and I have better use for that time cards. To me, it's a complete waste of time. Tennis at least gives a lot of exercise and that's good. But there again, time, I'd rather expend my time writing or doing other things that I love, like painting or presenting a seminar or maybe even a bit of photography, which I've neglected for a few years. And on top of everything else, I do have to give some time to my girlfriend who's in her fifties and wants to do things. Well. I'm in my eighties and I don't necessarily wanna do the same things, but I adjust. 

The other day, I took her for a short hike through the Indian Canyons of Palm Springs. We had lunch in a quiet spot alongside a stream where a small full of water splashes onto a kind of a rocky bottom. I left my iPad at home that made her happy and it even refreshed me. Although it's hard to tear myself away from the computer, there's so much work to be done. But let me say, say it once again. It's work that I love. So perhaps work is a is the wrong word. When all that is boiled down into a single idea, it's as I've said, attitude. That's where the secret to one's ideal health lies in a person's attitude. The four jumps that follow this module are designed to change your attitude toward ideal health, so that when you have it, you see it as something you deserve, something that you value. Continue jumping and watch not only your life change for the better, but those around you as well.

Audio 2: Preparation to Jump Into Your Ideal Body

During this jump, you'll go into a twin self who has the body that you want to identify with? Do this jump whenever you feel a need for self-expression and confidence. After opening the transit door and jumping through with the intent to visit your twin self, who has the body shape and stature that you want, then you observe your twin always during a jump, you first want to observe and then merge. Merging will enable you to bring back the energy, the rhythm that is necessary to achieve success. Your twin self is your model. And now find a comfortable place where you'll be undisturbed, relax, and will begin to jump into your ideal body. Do this jump as often as you feel the need.

Sense yourself getting better and better. Visualize improvements in your life as you mentally repeat the words. Every day, in every way, I’m getting better and better. Relax your eyes. Relax your lips. Relax your jaw. Relax your entire head and your neck. Relax your body. Relax your arms and hands. Relax your legs and feet. You are now completely. Relax. Repeat mentally. My body rests and refreshes itself when I consciously relax. I am relaxed now. Repeat mentally after me. Every day my image of myself improves. Every day my image of myself gets better. I can do anything I have a desire to do. I am a wonderful human being. There’s no one else on earth exactly like me. Every day I grow stronger knowing that I can. I can think. I can create. I can do. I can do anything I have a desire to do. At this time, concentrate on the image of you relaxed and at ease. Get a sense of yourself sitting comfortably, eyes closed, at the meditation, at the alpha level. With that thought, you are as comfortable as you can possibly be. Still holding that image in your mind and with your mouth closed, touch the roof of your mouth with the tip of your tongue and hold it there while I count from one to three. One, two, three. That’s fine. You may release your tongue now. In touching the tip of your tongue to the roof of your mouth, you were just programmed and reprogrammed that whenever you do touch the tip of your tongue to the roof of your mouth, you are striving for success in something. Each time you are programmed for the bhaga, it is reinforced. Use it when you wish to strengthen intent. The bhaga is a means of telling your mind to come to attention. You want something. There are many choices that appear in your life. Some of them are clear. Some of them are purely guesswork and made spontaneously. When you’re relaxed and stress -free as you are now, inspiration often helps you to make the right choice. The choice that you will be happy with later on in life. During this jump, you’ll go into a twin self. who has your ideal body. Think for a moment what your ideal body would look like. Imagine an ideal weight, an ideal stomach, an ideal posture, an ideal you. What would that you look like? How would that ideal you walk? Imagine that for a moment. In one of the infinity of universes, that you exists. That you… is your doppelganger, your twin self. In a moment, we’re going to go to the small hallway that contains the transit door. The other side of that door are all the universes and all the twin selves of infinity. On the other side of that door is your ideal self, your ideal twin self. In a moment, I’m going to count from one to three. At the count of three, You’ll mentally project yourself to the small hallway and you’ll be standing in front of the transit door. One, two, three. You are now in front of the transit door. Imagine it. Know that it is there. Visualize a door in front of you. The transit door. The door is whatever you make it to be. You want a fancy door? Create a fancy door. You want a plain door? Create a plain door. On the other side of that door is infinity, an infinity of universes. Anything that can be imagined is on the other side of that door. It only requires your intent to take you to the right place, the right twin self. During this jump, you’ll imagine the door opening, and then you’ll jump or step through the door and be with your twin self who has the ideal body. that you are programming for. Relax. Now it’s time for the door to open. One, two, the door is opening. Three, the door is open. On the other side of that door is your twin self in another universe. Jump over the threshold and visit with your twin self. Take your time. I will allow you plenty of time. For now you are an observer only. Observe your twin self with the ideal body. Watch your twin self walk, run, eat, sit down, stand up. Observe your twin self looking in a mirror. That is you as you might have been, as you still may become. Observe your twin self. Imagine that your twin self with the ideal body is talking with some of your friends and family. Imagine your twin self at work or at play. Take your time. Relax. Have your twin self stand still for a moment. Now imagine that you’re walking up to your twin self, getting closer and closer. And now imagine merging with that twin self, with the ideal body. Now you’re no longer observing. Now you are your twin self. You have merged. Move around for a while. Do the same thing that you observed your twin self doing. Take a walk. Sit down. Stand up. When you merge and use your twin self’s body, as you are now doing, you are getting into the rhythm of that self. And that’s what you’ll bring back with you. the rhythm of an ideal body. Relax. Relax. That was fine. That was good. Now count from one to three, and you’ll be back on this side of the transit door. One, two, three. You are now back on this side of the door, back in this dimension. Relax. In a moment, I’m going to count from one to three. At that moment, you’ll open your eyes, be wide awake and alert, feeling better. than you did before. One, two, three. Eyes open, wide awake, feeling wonderfully refreshed, feeling better than before, back with the rhythm of an ideal you.

Lesson 8: Jump Into Healthy Mindset
--------------------

Health is one of the most beautiful gifts of life. It's time to unlock the power of Quantum Jumping to help you Jump Into Healthy Mindset.

There is preparation audio before each quantum jump audio to help you understand the intention surrounding each jump, and prepare your mindset for the quantum jumping experience.

--------------------
Audio 1: Preparation to Jump Into a Healthy Mindset
--------------------

People often ask me, what do you do to look the way you do younger? Well, I'm not quite sure how to answer that. Look at the photo I took of myself at age 85, and you probably find it hard to believe that I was actually born in 1927, even before talking pictures came on the scene. And I often wonder myself, I eat just about everything. I don't take vitamins or supplements. I get very little exercise. Seemingly, I go contrary to everyone's youth and longevity belief. So what's the secret? I'm asked again and again, especially friends of my youth who all look 20 years older. I could tell you a dozen stories and talk about a hundred things, but I, I won't keep you in suspense. I'll give you the secret in one word. A healthy mindset. Oh, I know that's three words, <laugh>, but what is a healthy mindset? 

Why it is attitude. And that is one word, a word that comes from 50 years of reading, teaching, studying other concepts and feedback from people all over the planet. Now, that begs the question, how do you get an attitude like that? How do you change your attitude to that of a healthy mindset? Well, that's what this jump is all about. If your mindset needs a bit of adjusting, you've come to the right place. So find that comfortable position where you'll be undisturbed for the next 20 minutes or so, and be prepared for a major change in attitude because you're going to visit a twin self with a perfect attitude. And you know what? It's your own twin self. And of course you can do this jump. You may do this jump as often as you feel it's necessary.

--------------------
Meditation: Jump Into a Healthy Mindset
--------------------

Relax. Find a comfortable position. Close your eyes. Take a deep breath. And as you exhale, mentally repeat and visualize the number three three times. Take another deep breath. And as you exhale, mentally repeat and visualize the number two three times. Take another deep breath. And as you exhale, mentally repeat. and visualize the number one three times. To help you to enter the alpha level of mind, I’m going to count from ten to one. On each descending number, you will feel yourself going inward, and you will enter a pleasant, a meditation level of mind, a level of mind where you’ll be able to concentrate fully on one subject. Ten. Nine. Feel going deeper. Eight. seven, six, deeper and deeper, five, four, three, deeper and deeper, two, one. You are now at a pleasant where you’re able to concentrate fully on one subject. At this time, concentrate on my words. You are now and always in complete control of your state of mind. You can open your eyes. You can be fully alert. anytime you wish to be. Every time you enter this relaxed state, know that you’re getting better and better in every way. Whenever you enter this relaxed meditation state, mentally say, every day, in every way, I’m getting better and better. When you say these words, sense yourself improving in all areas of your life. Sense yourself getting better and better. Visualize improvements in your life as you mentally repeat the words. Every day, in every way, I’m getting better and better. Relax. Relax your eyes. Relax your lips. Relax your jaw. Relax your entire head and your neck. Relax your body. Relax your arms and hands. Relax your legs and feet. You are now completely relaxed. Repeat mentally. My body rests and refreshes itself when I consciously relax. I am relaxed now. Repeat mentally after me. Every day my image of myself improves. Every day my image of myself gets better. I can do anything I have a desire to do. I am a wonderful human being. There’s no one else on earth exactly like me. Every day I grow stronger knowing that I can. I can think. I can create. I can do. I can do anything I have a desire to do. At this time, concentrate on the image of you. Relaxed and at ease. Get a sense of yourself sitting comfortably, eyes closed, at the meditation, at the alpha level. With that thought, you are as comfortable as you can possibly be. Still holding that image in your mind and with your mouth closed, touch the roof of your mouth with the tip of your tongue and hold it there while I count from one to three. One, two, three. That’s fine. You may release your tongue now. In touching the tip of your tongue to the roof of your mouth, you were just programmed and reprogrammed that whenever you do touch the tip of your tongue to the roof of your mouth, you are striving for success in something. Each time you are programmed for the bhaga, it is reinforced. Use it when you wish to strengthen intent. The bhaga is a means of telling your mind to come to attention. to do something, and you want something. There are many choices that appear in your life. Some of them are clear. Some of them are purely guesswork and made spontaneously. When you’re relaxed and stress -free as you are now, inspiration often helps you to make the right choice, the choice that you will be happy with later on in life. Many of the choices that you do make will have an effect on your attitude. As an example, you say you go to your car that’s parked in a lot and discover a dent in the fender that wasn’t there before. Now you have choices. You can get angry, and then your attitude will be that of a negative nature. And you will see everything from a negative viewpoint. Or you can look at the dent and determine to earn twice as much money as it costs to fix the dent. Two different mindsets. One, anger. Anger that causes all kinds of physical problems, some of them not coming forward for months or years. Two, determination and creativity. With the second choice, you’re determined to set your mind to earning twice as much as it costs to repair the fender. All things in your life are like that. Some of them producing negative results, some positive. All due to your attitude. During this jump, you’ll go into a twin self who has a positive attitude about all things. What if you had a positive attitude about all things? Think what life would be like if you had a positive attitude toward everything. You wouldn’t have any problems because you wouldn’t be looking for solutions. Negative attitudes are drawn to problems. Positive attitudes… are drawn to solutions. You couldn’t have a bad relationship because you would see the positive aspects of the other person. In one of the infinity of universes, that totally positive self of yours exists. That positive attitude you is your doppelganger or your twin self. In a moment, we’re going to go to the small hallway that contains the transit door. On the other side of that door are all the universes. and all the twin selves of infinity. On the other side of that door is your ideal you with a perfect, positive attitude toward all things. In a moment, I will count from one to three. And at the count of three, you will mentally project yourself to the small hallway and you will be standing in front of the transit door. One, two, three. You are now in front of the transit door. Imagine it. Know that it is there. Visualize a door in front of you. The transit door. On the other side of that door is infinity. An infinity of universes. Anything that can be imagined is on the other side of that door. It only requires your intent to take you to the right place and to be with the twin self who has the mindset that you want for yourself, the attitude that you want for yourself. During this jump, you will imagine the door opening and then you’ll jump or step through the door, whatever is easiest for you. And be with your twin self who has the ability to make choices based on positive results. The results that you are programming for. Relax. And now it’s time for the transit door to open. One, two, the door is opening. Three, the door is open. On the other side of that door is your twin self. Jump over the threshold and visit with your twin self. Take your time. I will allow you plenty of time. Begin. now you’re just an observer, watch your twin self making positive choices, seeking solutions. That is you as you might have been, as you still may become. Observe your twin self walking and talking. Your twin self has a positive attitude toward everything. All your twin self’s choices are based on a positive mindset. Have your twin self Stand still for a moment. Now imagine that you are walking up to your twin self, getting closer and closer. And now imagine merging with the twin self, with the positive attitude, rhythm, the rhythm that you want. Now merge. Now you are your twin self. You’re not observing anymore. You merge. Now you are participating. Now you have the positive viewpoint, the positive mindset. The positive attitude. Move around for a while. Take a walk. Do something that is helped by a positive attitude. What occupation are you in? In another universe, you have a better attitude toward your occupation, a better mindset. Your twin self has a better attitude toward your occupation. Get a sense of decisions that your twin self is making. Positive decisions. regarding the things that you do. And now you are making the decisions because you’ve merged with your twin self. You’re gathering the rhythm of that merger. Relax. That was good. That was fine. Now I will count from one to three and you’ll be back on this side of the transit door. One, two, three. You’re back on this side of the door, back in this dimension. Relax. In a moment, I’m going to count from one to three. At that moment, you’ll open your eyes. You’ll be wide awake, alert, feeling better than before. One, two, three. Eyes open, wide awake, feeling wonderfully refreshed, feeling better than before. Back with the rhythm of a healthy and positive you.

There is preparation audio before each quantum jump audio to help you understand the intention surrounding each jump, and prepare your mindset for the quantum jumping experience.

--------------------
Audio 1: Introduction to Jump Into Healthy Relationships
--------------------

At its very foundation, a relationship is a mutual filling of needs between two people. A good relationship takes place when those people relate to one another and when there is a sense of equality between them. On this side of the program, you will jump into a parallel universe to meet your doppelganger that maintains the healthy relationships you desire. And now, introduction to the jump into healthy relationships with author Bert Goldman, 

A relationship is a connection between two people. A good relationship takes place when two people relate to one another when there's an equality between the two. When two people have a good relationship with each other, it's due mainly to the fact that each is supplying something the other person needs. When the needs are strong, when the needs are weak and are filled, there's a fair relationship. When the needs are weak and are not filled, there are problems in the relationship, but not as serious as when strong needs are not filled. A strong relationship comes about when needs are filled by each party. A mutual filling of leads. Consider your relationship with the person you wish to relate to. What are your needs? Consider what it is that you need, that you wish to be fulfilled through this relationship. Take your time. Consider them carefully. What are your needs that you would like to be filled by this particular relationship? Consider the other person. What do you believe the other person's needs are? Consider what it is that you believe the other person in this relationship needs. Now that you have considered both your needs and the other person in this relationship, consider this. Are your needs being filled? Is the other person filling your needs? Are the other person's needs in the relationship being filled? Are you filling the needs of the other person in this relationship? Visualize yourself filling the needs of the other party in this relationship. Imagine that you're filling this need and the other person is enjoying the relationship more and more. 

After you visualize yourself having filled the other person's needs, take the time to explore your needs. And after viewing all needs at the meditative alpha level, discuss them with the other person in this relationship. First, mentally at the alpha level. Do it mentally and then physically by speaking with the other person at the beta level. Good relationships can easily be acquired when both people feel equal as human beings. When each of them is kind to the other, and when each of them fills the others needs. Alcohol and drugs have been called mood changers. It's much easier to understand their effects. If we alter that to need changers under their influence. Foreign needs are no longer necessary, and things that were not necessary suddenly become vital. Some needs are enhanced by alcohol or drugs. Others diminished and some eliminated while an entirely new need pops up. 

When a person sobers up or comes down from the high, another set of needs come back into being. This rollercoaster of fluctuating needs makes for a very difficult period in the lives of the substance abusers, loved ones, especially when they do not recognize the cause. So long as someone is filling the temporary needs created under the influence, the relationship between substance, abuser, and loved ones will continue in such a relationship. You must ask yourself whether you're willing to fill the temporary needs, thereby enabling the person and simply prolonging the problem. Why not? Instead, create a new need? You can create needs as well as fill them. Create a need for sobriety. Make a trip of mutual discovery as to what life would be like without the opiates of alcohol or drugs. Communication is the key to discovering what a person's needs are. Communication is the key to unlocking the person from the cell of misery. 

Ask this question and expect and get an answer. What would your life, what would our lives like if you didn't drink or take drugs? Whatever the case may be. At this point, it's vital to set goals for the person and for yourself. Individual goals and goals for the two of you. Goals for the next week, the next month, a year from now, 10 years from now, even 20 years from now. Goals will give direction and create new thoughts as to how to treat the now. We're going to do that through the process of four quantum jumps. First, the jump into loving relationships.

--------------------
Audio 2: Preparation to Jump Into Loving Relationships
--------------------

With this jump, there'll be two people, your twin self, and the person who you wish to strengthen your loving relationship with. After going through the transit door, you will go to that place where you and the person you want more love from, have that relationship, the one that you want, the perfect relationship, where all you see are the positives of the other person and all the other person sees of you are your positive attributes. Love in its purest form, is seeing only the positives, only the good in the other person. Your twin self sees only the good things. No matter what the other person is saying, doing, or even thinking. Your twin self sees the positive side. That is a true loving relationship. Your intent for this jump is just that to go to two twin selves, yours and the one you love, those twin selves have a living relationship because they don't judge one another but love one another. As they're seeing only the good, only the positive, you'll observe the two selves and then you'll merge with your twin self. Bring back the rhythm of that love with you to this reality.

Meditation: Introduction to Jump Into Healthy Relationships
--------------------

Relax. Find a comfortable position. Close your eyes. Take a deep breath. And as you exhale, mentally repeat and visualize the number three three times. Take another deep breath. And as you exhale, mentally repeat and visualize the number two three times. Take another deep breath. And as you exhale, mentally repeat. And visualize the number one three times. To help you to enter the alpha level of mind, I’m going to count from ten to one. On each descending number, you will feel yourself going inward. And you will enter a pleasant, a meditation level of mind. A level of mind where you’ll be able to concentrate fully on one subject. Ten. Nine. Feel going deeper. Eight. seven, six, deeper and deeper, five, four, three, deeper and deeper, two, one. You are now at a pleasant where you’re able to concentrate fully on one subject. At this time, concentrate on my words. You are now and always in complete control of your state of mind. You can open your eyes. You can be fully alert. anytime you wish to be. Every time you enter this relaxed state, know that you’re getting better and better in every way. Whenever you enter this relaxed meditation state, mentally say, every day, in every way, I’m getting better and better. When you say these words, sense yourself improving in all areas of your life. Sense yourself getting better and better. Visualize improvements in your life as you mentally repeat the words. Every day, in every way, I’m getting better and better. Relax. Relax your eyes. Relax your lips. Relax your jaw. Relax your entire head and relax your body. Relax your arms and hands. Relax your legs and feet. You are now completely relaxed. Repeat mentally. My body rests and refreshes itself when I consciously relax. I am relaxed now. Repeat mentally after me. Every day my image of myself improves. Every day my image of myself gets better. I can do anything I have a desire to do. I am a wonderful human being. There’s no one else on earth exactly like me. Every day I grow stronger knowing that I can. I can think. I can create. I can do. I can do anything I have a desire to do. Relax. At this time, concentrate on the image of you relaxed and at ease. Get a sense of yourself sitting comfortably, eyes closed, at the meditation, at the alpha level. With that thought, you are as comfortable as you can possibly be. Still holding that image in your mind and with your mouth closed, touch the roof of your mouth with the tip of your tongue and hold it there while I count from one to three. One, two, three. That’s fine. You may release your tongue now. In touching the tip of your tongue to the roof of your mouth, you were just programmed and reprogrammed that whenever you do touch the tip of your tongue to the roof of your mouth, you are striving for success in something. Each time you are programmed for the bhaga, it is reinforced. Use it when you wish to strengthen intent. The bhaga is a means of telling your mind to come to attention. You want something. There are many choices that appear in your life. Some of them are clear. Some of them are purely guesswork and made spontaneously. When you’re relaxed and stress -free as you are now, inspiration often helps you to make the right choice. The choice that you will be happy with later on in life. Relax. In a moment, you will jump to a twin self. Who’s with another person? That person is the twin self of the one you want to have a more loving relationship with. In the infinite world of quantum universes, whatever can be imagined is in one of those universes. In one of those universes, you have the loving relationship you want in this universe, in this reality. You will observe your twin self acting the way you want to act in this reality. You will observe your twin self interacting with the other person’s twin self. You will watch the two selves interacting, perhaps loving, playing together, talking, whatever a loving relationship represents to you. Then you will merge with your twin self. to gather the rhythm of that loving relationship to you, and you will bring it back to this reality. Relax. I’m going to count from one to three, and a door will appear in front of you. The transit door. One, two, three. Imagine now that there is a door in front of you. This is the transit point, the jumping -off place, to get you wherever your intent directs you to go. Beyond the door, there are an infinite number of dimensions, an infinite number of universes. In one of those universes are the two twin selves, your twin self and the twin self of the person you want to have a loving relationship with. When you count from one to three, to count to three, the door will open and you will jump or step through it, whatever you’re comfortable doing. And you will then observe. One. Two. Three. The door is opening. Now, jump through and view the scene as an observer only. Relax and take your time. Create the scene exactly as you would want it to be. Whatever you create already is in an infinite world. It only remains to unlock it. See your twin self and the other person in the relationship interacting with love and positive thoughts. Create a loving relationship scene. Observe it. Watch it unfold. Take your time. Relax. Now imagine that you’re getting closer and closer to your twin self. And when you are touching, merge your body with that of your twin self. And now you are doing what you saw your twin self doing, what you observed your twin self doing. You’ve merged. And now you’re bringing that rhythm, the rhythm of that self, to you. You’re merged. That’s fine. You may do this jump whenever you feel the need. That was good. Now, we’ll count from one to three, and you’ll be back on this side of the transit door with the proper rhythm. One, two, three. You’re back on this side of the door, back in this dimension, and you now have the rhythm of a positive attitude towards your relationships. Relax. In a moment, I’m going to count from one to three. At that moment, you will open your eyes. You’ll be wide awake and alert. feeling better than you did before. One, two, three. Eyes open, wide awake, feeling wonderfully refreshed, feeling better than before.

Get a sense of yourself sitting comfortably, eyes closed, at the meditation, at the alpha level. With that thought, you are as comfortable as you can possibly be. Still holding that image in your mind and with your mouth closed, touch the roof of your mouth with the tip of your tongue and hold it there while I count from one to three. One, two, three. That’s fine. You may release your tongue now. In touching the tip of your tongue to the roof of your mouth, you were just programmed and reprogrammed that whenever you do touch the tip of your tongue to the roof of your mouth, you are striving for success in something. Each time you are programmed for the bhaga, it is reinforced. Use it when you wish to strengthen intent. The bhaga is a means of telling your mind to come to attention. You want something.

When you’re relaxed and stress -free as you are now, inspiration often helps you to make the right choice, the choice that you will be happy with later on in life. Relax. At this time, imagine what your ideal mate, would be like. What would your ideal mate look like, act like, be like? Your ideal mate should compliment you. Your ideal mate should like the things that you like. Enjoy the food that you enjoy. Listen to the music that you listen to. View the movies you like. Your ideal mate should share your religious beliefs, your political beliefs, and be generous with you and your friends. Imagine that. Imagine an ideal mate for you. Create that person now. Create that person in your mind. Imagine the way that person dresses, walks, talks. Your ideal mate would fill your needs. At this time, consider what it is that you need that your ideal mate could provide. You have many needs. Some of them are obvious. Some buried deep within your subconscious. For now, imagine some of those needs. On a scale of 1 to 10, 10 being the absolute essential needs, think about some of them. Think about a few simple needs that would be 2 or 3 perhaps on the scale of 1 to 10. What would those needs be? Now think of 1 or 2 essential needs. Oh, say a 9 or 10 on a scale. Do you have any needs? like that, what would they be? What needs do you have that you couldn’t live without, that you don’t want to be without? Your ideal mate will have needs as well. Consider your ideal mate’s needs now. There may be a 10 there. Are you willing to fill it? There are certainly many twos and threes that you can easily fill. How many of your ideal mate’s needs are you willing to fill? Consider that. Because during this jump, you’re going to visit your twin self who is involved with your ideal mate. will be filling all those needs. Every single one. And that will make for the very best relationship of all. You will observe your twin self acting with your ideal mate and you will interact with them. Relax. In a moment I will count from one to three and at the count of three you will mentally project yourself to the small hallway and you’ll be standing in front of the transit door. One. Two. Three. You are now in front of the transit door. Imagine it. Know that it’s there. Visualize a door in front of you. A transit door. On the other side of that door is infinity. An infinity of universes. Anything that can be imagined is on the other side of that door. It only requires your intent to take you to the right place. The right twin self along with your ideal mate. During this jump, you will imagine the door opening and then you will jump or step through the door and be with your twin self who is with that ideal mate you’re programming for. Relax. And now it’s time for the door to open. One, two, the door is opening. Three, the door is open. On the other side of that door is your twin self. Jump over the threshold and visit with your twin self. Take your time. I will allow you time. Begin. For now you are an observer. Just watch your twin self who is with your ideal mate. Imagine that. Create it. Have your twin self stand still for a moment alongside your ideal mate. Now imagine that you’re walking up to your twin self, getting closer and closer. And now imagine merging with that twin self who is next to your ideal mate. Now you are your twin self. You’ve merged. Move around for a while. Take a walk. Imagine talking to your ideal mate. When you merge and use your twin self’s body, as you are now doing, you’re getting into the rhythm of that self. And that’s what you’ll bring back with you, the rhythm of an ideal body. Relax. Now, interact. Have the rhythm, the proper rhythm, the rhythm that you’re programming for. That was fine. Now I will count from one to three and you will be back on this side of the transit door. One, two, three. You are now back on this side of the door, back in this dimension with the proper rhythm, the rhythm that you’re programming for, the rhythm that you want to attract your ideal mate and also to know how to act with your ideal mate. I’m going to count from one to three and at that moment you’ll open your eyes. You’ll be wide awake, feeling better than you did before. One, two, three. Eyes open, wide awake, feeling wonderfully refreshed, feeling better than before. Back with the rhythm of a twin self who has found the ideal.

Audio 1: Preparation to Jump Into Fun Friendships
--------------------

A fun friendship is a friendship that you enjoy. This jump is going to be fun. Fun for you, fun for your twin self, and fun for any friends you wanna bring into the jump. Yes, you can bring others into your jump. Remember, our mantra, whatever can be imagined, is in an infinite universe. This jump is for recreation, and it's designed for you to have fun with you and any of your friends who you wanna bring into the jump with you. For me, a fun friendship jump is when I visit a twin self, who's a writer in 1920s, Paris, or a painter in 1890 ARL or the forties in Greenwich Village. I have a twin self who's Van Gogh, another who's Hemmingway, and once in a while, mark Twain. This is the jump where I have the most fun. Before I put paint to canvas, I jumped to my artist Twin Self. Yesterday I was Jackson Pollock last week, Modigliani next week. Who knows? But the result should be interesting. Before I lecture, I always jump into Burt Goldman Primo, lecturer and darling of whatever city I'm going to be in. Jump into fun with this one. Let your hair down and bring on the twin self. You may have been deep in your subconscious, but above all, have fun.

Let’s use one of your twin selves to have fun at work. What kind of work will you be doing tomorrow or next week or whenever? Think about the kind of work you’d like to be doing. Your twin self is doing the same. Get a sense of your twin self at work. Now see your twin self. dancing around at work or playing a musical instrument and having fun.

Take your time. Just observe. No merging as yet. See your twin self at work or play, but wherever your twin self is, your twin self is having fun. For now you are just an observer. Watch your twin self having fun. Imagine that. Create it. Have your twin self stand still for a moment. Now imagine that you’re walking up to your twin self. getting closer and closer.

Lesson 12: Jump Into Healthy Family Dynamics
--------------------

For so many people, relationships bring joy and meaning to their lives. Why not have the best relationships possible? It's time to unlock the power of Quantum Jumping to help you jump into healthy family dynamics.

There is preparation audio before each quantum jump audio to help you understand the intention surrounding each jump, and prepare your mindset for the quantum jumping experience.

--------------------
Audio 1: Preparation to Jump Into Healthy Family Dynamics
--------------------

Think about the dynamics or the energy of your family. A family is a unit, an element with many, many pieces. We think of the normal family dynamic as mother, father, son, and daughter. This unit is then extended into siblings, grandparents, aunts, uncles, and cousins. When using quantum jumping to create a healthy family dynamic, you go to the twin cells that most resemble your existing family unit. Look at your unit as, oh, a tree with you as the trunk. All other members of the unit are the branches of the tree. As the trunk, you feed the rest of the members of the family dynamic, or the unit you feed them with sustenance, you nourish them. Feed the dynamic when speaking to the group, create options and the understanding that each of the branches is unique and is to be unconditionally loved and respected by all others. 

Each of the family members is different, and the difference is what should be respected by all other members of the family unit to strengthen the family dynamic. Before jumping, think about each member of the family that you would like to bring into your jump. During the jumps into spiritual connection, you'll learn to bring those family members who are deceased back into the dynamic. For now, however, consider those members of the family unit that you would like to bring into the dynamic. Mother, father, son, daughter, brother, sister, grandparents, uncle and cousin who only you can make the decision for. Now, just give it a bit of thought and then I will help you with the jump into a healthy family dynamic. But first, let's get to that pleasant, comfortable meditation state, uh, that we call the alpha state for the necessary concentration for the success of the jump.

Ten. Nine. Feel going deeper. Eight. seven, six, deeper and deeper, five, four, three, deeper and deeper, two, one. You are now at a pleasant level of mind where you’re able to concentrate fully on one subject. At this time, concentrate on my words. You are now and always in complete control of your state of mind. You can open your eyes. You can be fully alert anytime you wish to be. Every time you enter this relaxed state, know that you’re getting better and better in every way. Whenever you enter this relaxed meditation state, mentally say, every day, in every way, I’m getting better and better. When you say these words, sense yourself improving in all areas of your life. Sense yourself getting better and better. Visualize improvements in your life as you mentally repeat the words. Every day, in every way, I’m getting better and better. Relax. Relax your eyes. Relax your lips. Relax your jaw. Relax your entire head and your neck. Relax your body. Relax your arms and hands. Relax your legs and feet. You are now completely relaxed. Repeat mentally. My body rests and refreshes itself when I consciously relax. I am relaxed now. Repeat mentally after me. Every day my image of myself improves. Every day my image of myself gets better. I can do anything I have a desire to do. I am a wonderful human being. There’s no one else on earth exactly like me. Every day I grow stronger knowing that I can. I can think. I can create. I can do. I can do anything I have a desire to do. Relax. At this time, concentrate on the image of you. relaxed and at ease. Get a sense of yourself sitting comfortably, eyes closed, at the meditation, at the alpha level. With that thought, you are as comfortable as you can possibly be. Still holding that image in your mind and with your mouth closed, touch the roof of your mouth with the tip of your tongue and hold it there while I count from one to three. One, two, three. That’s fine. You may release your tongue now. In touching the tip of your tongue to the roof of your mouth, you were just programmed and reprogrammed that whenever you do touch the tip of your tongue to the roof of your mouth, you are striving for success in something. Each time you are programmed for the bhaga, it is reinforced. Use it when you wish to strengthen intent. The bhaga is a means of telling your mind to come to attention. You are about to to do something, and you want something. There are many choices that appear in your life. Some of them are clear. Some of them are purely guesswork and made spontaneously. When you’re relaxed and stress -free as you are now, inspiration often helps you to make the right choice, the choice that you will be happy with later on in life. Relax. During this jump, you’ll go through the transit door and be with your family unit, the one you would like to enhance and strengthen. Everyone wants a happy, healthy family dynamic. And in the infinity of universes, your dynamic is a perfect dynamic with positive, loving energies, with each of your family units supportive of each of the others. In a moment, I’m going to count from one to three. At the count of three, you’ll mentally project yourself to the small hallway where you will be in front of the transit door to any one of the infinity of universes available to you. One, two, three. You are now in front of the transit door. Imagine it. Know that it is there. Visualize a door in front of you. The transit door. On the other side of that door is infinity. An infinity of universes. Anything that can be imagined is on the other side of that door. It only requires your intent to take you to the right place and to be with the twin self who has the mindset that you want for yourself. During this jump, you’ll imagine the door opening and then you will jump or step through the door. and be with your twin self, the twin self who has the ability to make choices based on positive expectations, positive results, the results that you are programming for. In this instance, for this jump, your intention is to strengthen your immediate family unit. When you make this jump, you will be there in the form of your twin self, as well as the twin selves, of all the other members of your family who you wish to be there. It’s all through your invitation and your invitation only. Consider which members of your family will you be inviting. Consider that now. decide on, their twin selves will be there waiting for you. Now you’re the main branch because it is through you that the family dynamic will be together. You are the trunk of the family tree. All other family members are the branches. Relax. Now it’s time for the door to open. One, two, the door is opening. Three, the door is open. On the other side of that door is your twin self and also the twin selves of other family members. Jump over the threshold and visit with your twin self and the family member twin selves that you have invited. Take your time. This is your creation. I will allow you plenty of time. Observe and begin. For now you are an observer. Watch your twin self interact with the other twin self family members. Listen to what they are saying. They are building a dynamic, an energy, and a rhythm for you to merge with and bring back to this reality. After interacting and observing, you will take on much of that rhythm and energy. Observe the scene as though it were a play on a stage, an infinite stage, with you as the producer and the director of all the actors. The actors are your twin selves. Get a sense that each of them communicates well. You are the trunk of the tree. All the substance comes from you. All the family members want to communicate with you. All the family members want to love you and to see the positive aspects of you. Observe. Observe the scene and imagine what each of the family members are saying and doing. You are the controlling factor. You can change the conversation whenever you like. In infinity, you can have twin selves of yourself and others do whatever to your liking. All the twin selves are now in agreement. And now, as you observe, walk over to your twin self and now merge with your twin self so as to get the proper rhythm to bring back with you. Go to that self now and merge. That’s good. That’s fine. Now still merged with your twin self, imagine that you’re telling the other twin selves, the rest of the family dynamic, you’re telling them what’s best for a healthy family dynamic. When you merge and use your twin self’s body, as you are now doing, you are getting into the rhythm of that self. And that is what you’ll bring back with you. the rhythm of a healthy family dynamic. Relax. Dad was fine. Now I will count from one to three, and you’ll be back on this side of the transit door. One, two, three. You are back on this side of the door, back in this dimension, this reality. Relax. In a moment, I’m going to count from one to three. At that moment, you’ll open your eyes, be wide awake and alert, feeling better than you did before. One, two, three. Eyes open, wide awake, feeling wonderfully refreshed, feeling better than before, back with the rhythm of an ideal family dynamic.

Lesson 13: Jump Into a Purposeful Career
--------------------

Jump Into Career & Success
It’s easier to understand your career when you look at it as your “path” through life. Most of us have a mentor (at least at first), either someone we know personally or someone we respect through their writings and philosophy. We want to be successful at whatever field we enter, but there are many forks in the road of life – and in reality itself.

Every choice you make, even the seemingly inconsequential ones, may very well have a profound effect on your life. Choosing wisely is something that only Quantum Jumping can often assure you of – the jumps in this chapter actually allow you to see the results of any decision you’re thinking of making regarding your career.

Listen to the introduction audio below to get started.

We spend our lives learning, growing, and improving so that we can provide value to the world through our work. Success in work and in all areas of your life, leaves you feeling happy and fulfilled. It's time to unlock the power of Quantum Jumping to help you jump into a purposeful career.

There is preparation audio before each quantum jump audio to help you understand the intention surrounding each jump, and prepare your mindset for the quantum jumping experience.

--------------------
Audio 1: Introduction to Jump Into Career & Success
--------------------

Are you following a career path that you chose for yourself or was it chosen for you? Every decision you make, even the seemingly inconsequential can have a profound effect on your life. Choosing wisely is something that quantum jumping can assure you of. Through the techniques covered in this chapter, you will instigate the cause for your career and discover how to bring success into your life. And now, introduction to the jump into career and success with Author Bert Goldman. 

Your career would be easier to understand if we looked at it as your pathway through life. Let's assume that although it's impossible to tell where you, or for that matter, any of us will be 10 years from today, especially with the dynamic ever-changing technological world that we live in, you do have an idea as to where you want to be with respect to that pathway. First of all, you probably want a career that serves a purpose, some purpose, and then you wanna be happy in your chosen field, whatever that might be. Few people are total instigators. Most of us follow a mentor, either living or one we respect through their writings and philosophy. And last, we wanna be successful at whatever field of endeavor is chosen. The one thing that's certain is that there will be a lot of forks in the road of life, the road of your reality. 

Every choice that you make, even the seemingly inconsequential ones, may very well have a profound effect on your life. Choosing wisely now, that's something that only quantum jumping can really assure you of sometimes. However, the choice is random and the universe sets your career. Let me tell you a story I've told to thousands of my students over the years. One day a leaf fell in a park in Whittier, California. It landed on the forest floor and a and a big green caterpillar that was inching along had to make a sharp turn to avoid it. The caterpillar came to a log, crawled up the side, and just as it reached the top of the log, a man came by and sat down squishing the caterpillar. Well, the man jumped up and felt the goo on the seat of his pants. So naturally he went home, changed clothes, and took the pants to the local cleaners. 

While he was there, he met a young woman. They began a conversation which continued at a nearby coffee shop. They began to date, fell in love, married, and had a child. Their son being very clever, did well in school, became an attorney, and then went into politics rising in his party. And so, because a leaf fell in the forest one day, blocking a Caterpillar's way forward, Richard Nixon became the president of the United States. Is that a silly story? You know, there is some insignificant occurrence in Nixon's life, just as it is in your life, from a random incident, an insignificant cause. Great effects take place now through many of the quantum jumping techniques. You instigate insignificant cause for effects that you want. The desired effect and the desired effect here is success in your chosen career.

--------------------
Audio 2: Preparation to Jump Into a Purposeful Career
--------------------

Career choices are often accidental before making a choice that has purpose behind it. When you consider alternatives and consequences, that helps you to make the choice when you're just tied to one thing, only expending your energies and desire and making that thing happen, you kind of build a wall around you that prevents you from seeing any other options. This has positive aspects and also negative ones. With a purposeful career jump, you'll not only view a variety of choices with respect to career, you can also investigate the alternatives and consequences. With a purposeful career jump, you're going to visit four different twin selves. Each of them is a you who had different programming, different experiences, a different childhood, but each of them is a you that might have been each has a different career. Examine each one and then visit a fifth twin self who has chosen the career. That has a great purpose for you.

Meditation: Jump Into a Purposeful Career
--------------------

Relax. Find a comfortable position. Close your eyes. Take a deep breath. And as you exhale, mentally repeat and visualize the number three three times. Take another deep breath. And as you exhale, mentally repeat and visualize the number two three times. Take another deep breath. And as you exhale, mentally repeat. and visualize the number one three times. To help you to enter the alpha level of mind, I’m going to count from ten to one. On each descending number, you will feel yourself going inward, and you will enter a pleasant, a meditation level of mind, a level of mind where you’ll be able to concentrate fully on one subject. Ten. Nine. Feel going deeper. Eight. 7, 6, deeper and deeper, 5, 4, 3, deeper and deeper, 2, 1. You are now at a pleasant level of mind where you’re able to concentrate fully on one subject. At this time, concentrate on my words. You are now and always in complete control of your state of mind. You can open your eyes. You can be fully alert anytime you wish to be. Every time you enter this relaxed state, know that you’re getting better and better in every way. Whenever you enter this relaxed meditation state, mentally say, every day, in every way, I’m getting better and better. When you say these words, sense yourself improving in all areas of your life. Sense yourself getting. Better and better. Visualize improvements in your life as you mentally repeat the words. Every day, in every way, I’m getting better and better. Relax. Relax your eyes. Relax your lips. Relax your jaw. Relax your entire head and your neck. Relax your body. Relax your arms and hands. Relax your legs and feet. You are now completely relaxed. Repeat mentally. My body rests and refreshes itself when I consciously relax. I am relaxed now. Repeat mentally after me. Every day my image of myself improves. Every day my image of myself gets better. I can do anything I have a desire to do. I am a wonderful human being. There’s no one else on earth exactly like me. Every day I grow stronger knowing that I can. I can think. I can create. I can do. I can do anything I have a desire to do. Relax. At this time, concentrate on the image of you. Relaxed and at ease. Get a sense of yourself sitting comfortably, eyes closed, at the meditation, at the alpha level. With that thought, you are as comfortable as you can possibly be. Still holding that image in your mind and with your mouth closed, touch the roof of your mouth with the tip of your tongue and hold it there while I count from one to three. One, two, three. That’s fine. You may release your tongue now. In touching the tip of your tongue to the roof of your mouth, you were just programmed and reprogrammed that whenever you do touch the tip of your tongue to the roof of your mouth, you are striving for success in something. Each time you are programmed for the bhaga, it is reinforced. Use it when you wish to strengthen intent. The bhaga is a means of telling your mind to come to attention. to do something, and you want something. There are many choices that appear in your life. Some of them are clear. Some of them are purely guesswork and made spontaneously. When you’re relaxed and stress -free as you are now, inspiration often helps you to make the right choice, the choice that you will be happy with later on in life. For now, relax. Relax. In a moment, you’re going to jump to the first of four twin selves who have chosen different careers for themselves. In the infinite world of quantum universes, whatever can be imagined is in one of those universes. In one of those universes, you have the career you may feel most suited for. But as these twin selves are an infinity of selves, And whatever you image them to be, let’s go to four different selves. They are the same in that they look, act, and talk like you. Because they are you. But they made different choices and wound up with different careers. They may have gone to college, they may not have. But they have had different programming. Relax. I’m now going to count from one to three and a door will appear in front of you, the transit door. One, two, three. Imagine now that there is a door in front of you. This is the jumping off place to get you wherever your intent directs you to go. Beyond the door, there are an infinite number of dimensions, an infinite number of universes. And one of those universes are the twin selves with different careers and for a different purpose. One of those selves has money as a purpose. Another has a place, a country to live in as a purpose. Another has helping others as a purpose. And the fourth wants a career that includes a family. You’ll visit with each one, one at a time, to see what could have been had you made different choices. Let’s visit the first one, whose purpose is just money. I’m going to count from one to three, and at the count of three, the door will open. You’ll jump or step through it, whatever you’re comfortable doing. You will then observe your twin self and the career that self has chosen. Money is the object, and your twin self is successful in getting it. One, two, three. The door is opening, and now just jump through. View the scene as an observer only. This self has making money as the chief purpose. Begin. Observe only. You’re observing your twin self whose chief purpose in life is making money. After observing that self, whatever that self is doing, you merge with that self and you do whatever that self was doing. How do you feel about it? what the self was doing. How do you feel about what you’re doing at present? Relax. I’m now going to count from one to three and you will leave the money purpose and you will be with the self who has a different place to live in mind, observing only. One, two, three. You are now with the self who has a different place, a different place to live in mind. That is the purpose. See that self. Observe that self. Now after observing, merge with that self and you imagine what you’re seeing, the place that you’re seeing, the country that you’re seeing, the activity that you’re seeing. I’m now going to count from one to three and you will leave the self whose purpose is a place to live and you will be with the self who has helping others in mind. One, two, three. You are now with the self who has helping others in mind as their main purpose in life. Observe that self. Get a sense that self is helping other people. And now merge with that self and you help other people in the same manner. I’m now going to count from one to three and you will leave the self whose purpose is helping others and you’ll be with the self who has family as the prime purpose in mind. One. two, three. You are now with a self who has family in mind. See that self. Observe that self with family. As you observe that self acting with family as the chief purpose, merge with that self and you do the same. And now you are acting with family. I’m going to count from one to three and you will leave the self whose purpose is family as the prime purpose in mind and you will be with a different self. A self whose purpose is different. Something you just thought of. Something you’re just thinking of now. What purpose would be different that is just popping into your mind? I’m going to count from one to three and you will be with a self whose purpose is different. Something you’ve just thought of. What is that self doing? How is that self acting? One, two, three. You are now with the self who has a different purpose. See that self. Observe what that self is doing. If you’re comfortable with what that self is doing, merge with that self. And now you do the thing that you saw the self doing who had a different purpose. How does that purpose fit in with your plans for yourself? Relax. You’ve just visited different twin selves. Which of them are you attracted to the most? Which of them would you like to revisit? You may want to jump on your own to the twin self you feel most comfortable with. Relax. That was fine. Those were fine jumps. Now I will count from one to three and you will be back. on this side of the transit door one two three you’re back on this side of the door back in this dimension this reality in a moment i’m going to count from one to three at that moment you’ll open your eyes be wide awake fully alert feeling better than you did before one two three eyes open wide awake feeling wonderfully refreshed feeling better than before.

Audio 1: Preparation to Jump Into a Happy Workplace
--------------------

More than anything else, your attitude is what creates a happy or discontented work atmosphere. Your twin self in the happiest of workplaces has acquired PV or positive viewpoint eyeglasses. PV glasses are similar to a lightly tinted rose color and, when in place, allow only a positive viewpoint toward things. In the alternate universe, of your twin self PV glasses are readily available. You can take advantage of this simply by jumping to your twin self of a happy workplace. Observe and then merge. After that, whenever you’re at work, just imagine your own PV glasses slipping into place over your eyes and everything you see will be seen from the aspects of a positive attitude and positive viewpoint.

Relax. Find a comfortable position. Close your eyes. Take a deep breath. And as you exhale, mentally repeat and visualize the number three three times. Take another deep breath. And as you exhale, mentally repeat and visualize the number two three times. Take another deep breath. And as you exhale, mentally repeat and visualize the number one three times. To help you to enter the alpha level of mind, I’m going to count from ten to one. On each descending number, you will feel yourself going inward, and you will enter a pleasant, a meditation level of mind, a level of mind where you’ll be able to concentrate fully on one subject. Ten. Nine. Feel going deeper. Eight. Seven. Six. Deeper and deeper. Five. Four. Three. Deeper and deeper. Two. You are now at a pleasant mind where you’re able to concentrate fully on one subject. At this time, concentrate on my words. You are now and always in complete control of your state of mind. You can open your eyes. You can be fully alert. Anytime you wish to be. Every time you enter this relaxed state, know that you’re getting better and better in every way. Whenever you enter this relaxed meditation state, mentally say, every day, in every way, I’m getting better and better. When you say these words, sense yourself improving in all areas of your life. Sense yourself getting better and better. Visualize improvements in your life as you mentally repeat the words. Every day, in every way, I’m getting better and better. Relax. Relax your eyes. Relax your lips. Relax your jaw. Relax your entire head and relax your body. Relax your arms and hands. Relax your legs and feet. You are now completely Relax. Repeat mentally.

I can do anything I have a desire to do. I am a wonderful human being. There’s no one else on earth exactly like me. Every day I grow stronger knowing that I can. I can think. I can create. I can do. I can do anything I have a desire to do. Relax. At this time, concentrate on the image of you relaxed and at ease. Get a sense of yourself sitting comfortably, eyes closed, at the meditation, at the alpha level. With that thought, you are as comfortable as you can possibly be. Still holding that image in your mind and with your mouth closed, touch the roof of your mouth with the tip of your tongue and hold it there while I count from one to three. One, two, three. That’s fine. You may release your tongue now. In touching the tip of your tongue to the roof of your mouth, you were just programmed and reprogrammed that whenever you do touch the tip of your tongue to the roof of your mouth, you are striving for success in something. Each time you are programmed for the bhaga, it is reinforced. Use it when you wish to strengthen intent. The bhaga is a means of telling your mind to come to attention. You are about to do something. And you want something. There are many choices that appear in your life. Some of them are clear. Some of them are purely guesswork and made spontaneously. When you’re relaxed and stress -free as you are now, inspiration often helps you to make the right choice. The choice that you will be happy with later on in life. Relax. During this jump, you will go into a twin self who is in a happy workplace, filled with positive people and positive thoughts. Think for a moment what that happy workplace would be like. Imagine that for a moment. In one of the infinity of universes, that you exists. That you is your doppelganger or your twin self. In a moment, we’re going to go to the small hallway. that contains the transit door. On the other side of that door are all the universes and all the twin selves of infinity. On the other side of that door is your twin self, who is in a happy workplace. In a moment I’ll count from one to three, and at the count of three you will mentally project yourself to the small hallway, and you’ll be standing in front of the transit door. One, two, three. You are now in front of the transit door. Imagine it. Know that it is there. Visualize the door in front of you, the transit door. On the other side of that door is infinity, an infinity of universes. Anything that can be imagined is on the other side of that door. It only requires your intent to take you to the right place and to be with the twin self. who works in the happiest of places that you want for yourself. During this jump, you’ll imagine the door opening, and then you will jump or step through the door and be with your twin self, who has the workplace that you are programming for. Relax. Now it’s time for the transit door to open. One, two, the door is opening. Three, the door is open. On the other side of that door is your twin self. Jump over the threshold and visit with your twin self. Take your time. Visit and observe. you plenty of time. For now you are an observer. Watch your twin self at work. Notice how happy your twin self is. Notice how the rest of the workplace reflects that happiness. As you watch your twin self, you notice lightly colored sunglasses. Rose colored sunglasses on your twin self. But they’re not sunglasses. They’re positive viewpoint glasses, PV glasses. They allow your twin self to see only the positive, only the happy nature of the surroundings. Now have your twin self stand still for a moment. Now imagine that you’re walking up to your twin self, getting closer and closer. And now your twin self is putting on the positive viewpoint glasses. You’re observing. Your twin self is smiling as your twin self looks around with the glasses on. And now merge with your twin self and imagine that you, as your twin self, have on the glasses. And you look around. Suddenly everything is seen with a positive attitude. Imagine that. Get a sense that when you put on the PV glasses, everything is rosy and happy. The grass is greener. The air smells clear. When it’s cold, the coolness feels good on your skin. When it’s warm, the warmth feels wonderful to your body. Food tastes better. People look pleasanter. The surroundings are nicer. Everything takes on a positive aspect when you have on the PV glasses. Imagine moving around for a while. Take a walk. Do something energetic. Perhaps skip rope or run or swim. Or just notice the people in your workplace, all seen through your positive viewpoint glasses. You can see no negatives when the glass is on, only the positives in all things. What sport are you fond of? Imagine your twin self participating in that sport with positive viewpoint glasses on and winning. Your twin self is a winner. You are a winner. When you merge and use your twin self’s body, as you are doing now, you’re getting into the rhythm of that self. And that’s what you’re going to bring back with you, the rhythm of a self who has the ability at any time of imagining positive viewpoint glasses over the eyes like sunglasses, and then looking through them, seeing only the positive aspects of reality. That way… You control the happy workplace, not others. Look about you, whatever you see. You see only the positive. You see only the positives in people. You see only the positives in events. You see only the positives in your surroundings. Relax. That was fine. That was good. Now I will count from one to three and you’ll be back on this side of the transit door. You’ll bring the rhythm with you, and you’ll remember that you can use the positive viewpoint glasses at any time. All you have to do is use the bhaga, touch the roof of your mouth with your tongue, and say, positive viewpoint glasses on. And imagine them on your eyes like sunglasses, and all you will be able to see when the glasses are on. are the positives, only the positives. Relax. One, two, three. You’re back on this side of the door, back in this dimension, in this reality. In a moment, I’m going to count from one to three. At that moment, you’ll open your eyes, be wide awake and alert, feeling better than you did before. One, two, three. Eyes open, wide awake, feeling wonderfully refreshed, feeling better than before, back with the rhythm of the positive viewpoint glasses that you now have as a resource to use anytime you have a desire to.

Audio 1: Preparation to Jump Into The Power of the Mentor
--------------------

Who do you consider to be your mentor, your counselor, guide, or teacher? Everyone has one. Perhaps yours is an angel, or maybe a great mind of the present or past. Well, during this jump, you’re going to have available to you a veritable excess of mentors. How about one of this group as your mentor? Steve Jobs, Bill Gates, Albert Einstein, Socrates, Plato, Winston Churchill. Martin Luther King, Madam Curry, Eleanor Roosevelt, Hillary Clinton, anyone else you can think of. Make your own list. If you could choose from any person, living or dead, ancient or modern, who would it be? You can choose three mentors for now. Who will they be? Think about that, because you’re going to be visiting them shortly. In our infinite world, your twin selves are exactly that. The greatest of the great, except your mentor, is you. A you with different programming, different opportunities, different upbringing, who made different choices. A you who might have been, and in another universe, a you who is.

--------------------
Meditation: Jump Into The Power of the Mentor
--------------------

Relax. Find a comfortable position. Close your eyes. Take a deep breath. And as you exhale, mentally repeat and visualize the number three three times. Take another deep breath. And as you exhale, mentally repeat and visualize the number two three times. Take another deep breath. And as you exhale, mentally repeat. And visualize the number one three times. To help you to enter the alpha level of mind, I’m going to count from ten to one. On each descending number, you will feel yourself going inward. And you will enter a pleasant, a meditation level of mind. A level of mind where you’ll be able to concentrate fully on one subject. Ten. Nine. Feel going deeper. Eight. Seven. Six. Deeper and deeper. Five. Four. Three. Deeper and deeper. Two. You are now at a pleasant where you’re able to concentrate fully on one subject. At this time, concentrate on my words. You are now and always in complete control of your state of mind. You can open your eyes. You can be fully alert. Anytime you wish to be. Every time you enter this relaxed state, know that you’re getting better and better in every way. Whenever you enter this relaxed meditation state, mentally say, every day, in every way, I’m getting better and better. When you say these words, sense yourself improving in all areas of your life. Sense yourself getting better and better. Visualize improvements in your life as you mentally repeat the words. Every day, in every way, I’m getting better and better. Relax. Relax your eyes. Relax your lips. Relax your jaw. Relax your entire head and your neck. Relax your body. Relax your arms and hands. Relax your legs and feet. You are now completely relaxed. Repeat mentally. My body rests and refreshes itself when I consciously relax. I am relaxed now. Repeat mentally after me. Every day my image of myself improves. Every day my image of myself gets better. I can do anything I have a desire to do. I am a wonderful human being. There’s no one else on earth exactly like me. Every day I grow stronger knowing that I can. I can think. I can create. I can do. I can do anything I have a desire to do. Relax. At this time, concentrate on the image of you relaxed and at ease. Get a sense of yourself sitting comfortably, eyes closed, at the meditation, at the alpha level. With that thought, you are as comfortable as you can possibly be. Still holding that image in your mind and with your mouth closed, touch the roof of your mouth with the tip of your tongue and hold it there while I count from one to three. One, two, three. That’s fine. You may release your tongue now. In touching the tip of your tongue to the roof of your mouth, you were just programmed and reprogrammed that whenever you do touch the tip of your tongue to the roof of your mouth, you are striving for success in something. Each time you are programmed for the bhaga, it is reinforced. Use it when you wish to strengthen intent. The bhaga is a means of telling your mind to come to attention. You are about to do something. And you want something. There are many choices that appear in your life. Some of them are clear. Some of them are purely guesswork and made spontaneously. When you’re relaxed and stress -free as you are now, inspiration often helps you to make the right choice. The choice that you will be happy with later on in life. Relax. In a moment, you’ll be in the small hallway. In front of you will be the transit door. Step through the door and you will be in an alternate universe. This universe holds three twin selves who are going to be your mentors, your teachers. They are your twin selves, selves who look like you, think like you, and act like you, except for one very big thing. Their attitudes are uniquely theirs. They had a different upbringing, a different education, and have sharpened the skills that you have but are buried deep within your subconscious. These three selves are your mentors, your teachers, your guides. They mean to guide you to a proper career and success in your life. Imagine them sitting at a large square table. There are four chairs around the table, one for each of you. Your three mentor selves. And you. In a moment, I will count from one to three. And at the count of three, you will mentally project yourself to the small hallway, and you’ll be standing in front of the transit door. One, two, three. You’re now in front of the transit door. Imagine it. Know that it’s there. Visualize a door in front of you. The transit door. On the other side of that door is infinity, an infinity of universes. Anything that can be imagined is on the other side of that door. It only requires your intent to take you to the right place and to be with a twin self who works in the happiest of places, the places that you want for yourself. During this jump, you will imagine the door opening and then you will jump through the door and be in a room with your three twin selves sitting around that large square table. Relax. And now it’s time for the transit door to open. One, two, the door is opening. Three, the door is open. On the other side of that door are your three selves. Jump over the threshold and take a seat at the table where they are sitting and make yourself comfortable. For now, you’re just an observer. Listen to yourselves as they speak. They speak with each other. They may speak with you. They will be talking about you, about your career, your aspirations, your goals, and they will speak of how to attain success in your career. Now imagine yourself. You’re sitting at the table, sitting on a chair at the table. Your three selves are sitting around the table, your mentor selves. Now imagine yourself asking them a question. Formulate the question and mentally speak the question. What kind of an answer would you imagine you would get? You will remember the answer. And back in this reality, you will interpret the answers you get and use them to full advantage. Relax. I will be quiet for a while. Listen to your mentor selves. Whenever you have a problem and are unsure of the answer or unsure of what to do, jump to your three twin selves, your mentors, and ask them the question. And then consider the information that you receive from them. Relax. I will count from one to three, and you’ll be back on this side of the transit door. One, two, three. You’re back on this side of the door, back in this dimension, in this reality. In a moment, I’m going to count from one to three. At that moment, you’ll open your eyes. You’ll be wide awake, feeling better than you did before. One, two, three. Eyes open. Wide awake, feeling wonderfully refreshed, feeling better than before. Back with answers to the questions.

Lesson 16: Jump Into Blissful Success
--------------------

We spend our lives learning, growing, and improving so that we can provide value to the world through our work. Success in work and in all areas of your life, leaves you feeling happy and fulfilled. It's time to unlock the power of Quantum Jumping to help you jump into blissful success.

There is preparation audio before each quantum jump audio to help you understand the intention surrounding each jump, and prepare your mindset for the quantum jumping experience.

Audio 1: Preparation to Jump Into Blissful Success
--------------------

What would you consider to be blissful success? Would it be accomplishment? That would certainly indicate a successful agenda. At the end of it all, when you look back on your life, a life that whisks by like a speeding bullet train with stations of activity, showing for an instant before dropping back into a buried memory, what then? When all the picture postcard scenes of success and failure come to the front of the line, which will bring you pleasure? And what scenes will the demon guilt bring out to cover you with a blanket of misery? And what scenes will regret bring out? Those questions you can’t answer. Not yet. But when the time comes, as it invariably does for everyone, the answers will be there with crystal clarity. By consciously jumping now into success that you have planned, that your intention is to proceed to build what you know is success, is to forge a link in the chain in your life that will be a model for all the rest. Then you will have what few others do, a bar set for you alone to measure future and past successes with. So with the next jump, let’s set the bar at a height you know you’ll be successful with. That could be the most important jump of all, the jump into blissful success.

Meditation: Jump Into Blissful Success
--------------------

Relax. Find a comfortable position. Close your eyes. Take a deep breath. And as you exhale, mentally repeat and visualize the number three three times. Take another deep breath. And as you exhale, mentally repeat and visualize the number two three times. Take another deep breath. And as you exhale, mentally repeat. And visualize the number one three times. To help you to enter the alpha level of mind, I’m going to count from ten to one. On each descending number, you will feel yourself going inward. And you will enter a pleasant, a meditation level of mind. A level of mind where you’ll be able to concentrate fully on one subject. Ten. Nine. Feel going deeper. Eight. 7, 6, deeper and deeper, 5, 4, 3, deeper and deeper, 2, 1. You are now at a pleasant level of mind where you’re able to concentrate fully on one subject. At this time, concentrate on my words. You are now and always in complete control of your state of mind. You can open your eyes. You can be fully alert anytime you wish to be. Every time you enter this relaxed state, know that you’re getting better and better in every way. Whenever you enter this relaxed meditation state, mentally say, every day, in every way, I’m getting better and better. When you say these words, sense yourself improving in all areas of your life. Sense yourself getting. Better and better. Visualize improvements in your life as you mentally repeat the words. Every day, in every way, I’m getting better and better. Relax. Relax your eyes. Relax your lips. Relax your jaw. Relax your entire head and your neck. Relax your body. Relax your arms and hands. Relax your legs and feet. You are now completely relaxed. Repeat mentally. My body rests and refreshes itself when I consciously relax. I am relaxed now. Repeat mentally after me. Every day my image of myself improves. Every day my image of myself gets better. I can do anything I have a desire to do. I am a wonderful human being. There’s no one else on earth exactly like me. Every day I grow stronger knowing that I can. I can think. I can create. I can do. I can do anything I have a desire to do. Relax. At this time, concentrate on the image of you, relaxed and at ease. Get a sense of yourself sitting comfortably, eyes closed, at the meditation, at the alpha level. With that thought, you are as comfortable as you can possibly be. Still holding that image in your mind and with your mouth closed, touch the roof of your mouth with the tip of your tongue and hold it there while I count from one to three. One. Two, three. That’s fine. You may release your tongue now. In touching the tip of your tongue to the roof of your mouth, you were just programmed and reprogrammed that whenever you do touch the tip of your tongue to the roof of your mouth, you are striving for success in something. Each time you are programmed for the Bara, it is reinforced. Use it when you wish to strengthen intent. The bhaga is a means of telling your mind to come to attention. You are about to do something and you want something. There are many choices that appear in your life. Some of them are clear. Some of them are purely guesswork and made spontaneously. When you’re relaxed and stress -free as you are now, inspiration often helps you to make the right choice. The choice that you will be happy with. Later on in life. Relax. In a moment you’ll be in the small hallway. In front of you will be the transit door. Step through the door and you will be in an alternate universe. This universe holds one of your twin selves. A self who only knows success in all things. Everything this self does is successful because this self has the rhythm of success. That’s what you want to take back to this reality, the rhythm of success. At this time, think about something that you will be doing tomorrow. Something simple. Could be as simple as walking around the block or going to the store to purchase something or playing a game on your computer or looking something up on your computer. Imagine that tomorrow you’re going to look something up on the computer. It’s a name. The name is Kuwait. That’s spelled C -O -U -E. Search for that name and do a little research. You will be successful. That will be taking advantage of the success rhythm you’ll bring back from this particular jump, the jump into blissful success. As you search the name Kuwe, you will find comprehension growing. And then you will jump on your own. To your own twin self who is Kuwe and who developed the system that the world uses to such advantage. His bywords and mantra was better and better. Every day in every way I’m getting better and better. That was Emil Kuwe. And those will be your twin self’s ticket to blissful success. Kuwe’s blissful mantra once again is every day. And in every way, I’m getting better and better. In a moment, I’m going to count from one to three. And at the count of three, you’ll project yourself to the small hallway and you’ll be standing in front of the transit door. Relax. One, two, three. You are now in front of the transit door. Imagine it. Know that you are there. Visualize a door in front of you, the transit door. On the other side of that door is infinity, an infinity of universes. Anything that can be imagined is on the other side of that door. It only requires your intent to take you to the right place and to be with the twin self who works in the happiest of places that you want for yourself. During this jump, you will imagine the door opening, and then you will jump through the door, or over the threshold, and be in a room with your twin self, who is friends with Emil Kuwait, the man who first coined the phrase, every day in every way, I’m getting better and better. Your twin self has always been successful in every endeavor, for that self truly believes that every day is better than the last. And things always get better and better. Relax. Now it’s time for the transit door to open. One, two, the door’s opening. Three, the door’s open. On the other side of that door is your twin self and a male Kuwait. Observe them interacting. Your twin self is a friend of Kuwait. They’re both very successful. What are they saying? What are they advising you? For now you are an observer. Listen as they speak. They will be talking about you, your career, your aspirations, your goals. And they will speak of how to attain success in your career. And now allow Emile Coué to disappear from the scene. And your twin self suddenly becomes Emile Coué. Because in this universe, you are Emile Coué. You developed the mantra, every day in every way I’m getting better and better. Now get a sense you’re walking up to your twin self and then merge with that self. And now you walk around. You look at your surroundings. You hear yourself saying every day in every way I’m getting better and better. Now as you merge with that self, you get into the success rhythm. Relax. That was good. That was fine. Now I will count from one to three and you’ll be back on this side of the transit door. One, two, three. You are back on this side of the door, back in this dimension, in this reality. In a moment, I’m going to count from one to three. At that moment, you’ll open your eyes, be wide awake and alert, feeling better than you did before. One, two. Three, eyes open, wide awake, feeling wonderfully refreshed, feeling better than before, back with the rhythm of an Emil Kuwait.

Lesson 17: Jump Into a Clutter-Free Home
--------------------

Jump Into A Happy Home
Attracting positive energy isn’t as simple as broadcasting your intentions to the universe. The ancient practice of "Feng Shui" teaches us that natural forces can also shape the human tide of events.

In this series of jumps, you’ll learn to arrange your home and life with intention – allowing cosmic energy to enter and flow through your life in a way that creates the most harmonious circumstances possible.

The beauty of Quantum Jumping is that you don’t need to be a Feng Shui guru. During the jumps, you’ll meet your twin-self who’s already mastered the art of metaphoric design – and they’ll guide you with specific instructions you can implement in your own reality.

Listen to the introduction audio below to get started.

--------------------
Audio 1: Introduction to Jump Into a Happy Home
--------------------

They say, home is where the heart is, and a real home is not just a house, but a sacred place that is just your own. It is your sanctuary, your castle, a place where you can learn to walk, talk, love, and grow. In this chapter, you will discover more about the extraordinary power of feng shui and how it can help bring order to the home and to the lives of those who live in it. And now, Introduction to the Jump into a Happy Home with author Bert Goldman. The principles of energy, the laws of attraction, and simply good luck can all be seen from an alternate perspective that’s as ancient as the pyramids. That belief being the study of how the natural forces of wind and water affect the human tide, the tide of events. This force is known as feng shui. Feng shui brings order to the home and by extension to the reality of all who live in that home. An understanding of this principle, along with the knowledge of how the cosmic energy ebbs and flows through all things, from the smallest molecule to the greater universe, that gives a measure of clarification to the concept. The feng shui, or wind and water, is a perfect description of the cosmic force when represented in the mind. The manner in which we will be using the feng shui principles is simply to achieve a harmonious home atmosphere. Picture, if you will, a great lake of placid, motionless water. The surface is peaceful and calm, undisturbed. Along comes an energy force in the form of a breeze. The water moves. Ripples appear. The energy increases and the breeze freshens, turning into a wind. The surface of the water is agitated. More ripples appear. The wind grows stronger and the lake is churned and jarred into peaks and valleys of water. The force of energy feeds on itself and the wind becomes a storm. Wild gusts fling the surface of the water about until it’s so disturbed that froth appears and the waves hurl great puddles of mist and water into the air as though the liquid droplets were trying to merge with the wind. That is feng shui manifesting on a planetary level. The work you are now hearing will show you how this relates to all things in your life and how you can control the forces of energy that directly affect You. Energies created by any of the elements often have far-reaching effects that are impossible to relate to cause. Feng shui, when used with intent, sets up cause. The cause may be as insignificant as a bowl of water, a fan, a stone, a pebble, a faded photo of an old love, or the placement of ordinary items to create an extraordinary energy force. When you follow a pattern created by your intent, you will be setting up the insignificant that turns into the very significant to point your life in the direction that you want to go. The term feng shui is commonly defined as wind and water. But what does that mean? With feng shui, we come to see the wind as the ultimate energy of the planet. Off planet, there is no wind, nor is there any water. And so the concept would be one for an occupied planet. But without wind and water, there can be no life. Wind represents energy, as does water. The wind generates electrical current when there’s a windmill to harness the power. Water, through the damming and harnessing process, is where most of the world gets its power. Wind and water are energy producers. The great principle of correspondence says, as above, so below. As below, so above. As it is on the physical plane, so it is on the mental plane. On the physical plane, wind and water are energy forms. That’s science. On the mental plane, wind and water are patterns of energy waiting to be harnessed. That’s feng shui. The object of feng shui is to give direction to not only the wind and water, but to other elements as well. Minerals, wood, fire, and earth all hold an energy that’s released through the use of feng shui. The objective of the feng shui practitioner is to harmonize the components, and in doing that, direct the energy to find solutions, solutions to situations that exist. The feng shui practitioner is much like a musical conductor. The instruments are there, but until a balance and unity is achieved, there’s no concert. Even when all the components are in place and the musicians are reading the same music, without a conductor whose intent is to unify the elements, there’d just be a melange of sound. To turn the confusion into a balanced, harmonious work, The conductor first assembles a group, then unifies them all with practice, and then conducts the orchestra, creating a pleasing, harmonious sound that everyone enjoys. Then, and only then, is a concert created. Music is a form of energy, as are all things. Sound is an element of the physical plane. A piano constructed of wood and mineral matter is an instrument of potential energy. That energy is released as the keys are struck. The feng shui concert is that of life. On the physical plane, when burned, wood releases the energy of fire, which is multiplied by the energy of the wind, while water and earth dampen the energy of fire. Water dissipates and fractionates earth while releasing the nuggets of mineral content. Wind moves water about, but it’s blocked by a building constructed of elements of the earth. All elements are affected in some manner by all other elements, and by the growth and disintegration process of life, whether it be animal, vegetable, or mineral. It’s the task of Feng Shui to unify this process, disintegrating the unwanted and integrating that which is desired. Metaphoric design, as used in quantum jumping, is using the power of intent to create a pattern with furniture, with the elements, pictures, and accessories. The pattern becomes a metaphor that you create. It must be uniquely yours. You must have in mind a particular project when you build your metaphor. A metaphoric design can be built with furniture in any room of your home, or with pictures and paintings, with wallpaper, with paint, with books and accessories, with paraphernalia. the top of your desk, with the plates and silverware on your dining room table, even with the food in your plate. You may create a circular energy metaphor, an ellipse or a rectangle, a triangle, a square, or a combination of all five with any permutation that you choose. You’ll visit a twin self who’ll create a design with just those elements, as an example. Say that you have a desire to create a metaphor in your living room for, oh, let’s say for interesting conversation. You have people coming over. You have guests coming over and you wish to use the energies of the feng shui for a pleasant and an entertaining evening. While thinking about a pleasant evening, you move the couch to a different position. Then you place a coffee table near the arm of the couch. You move a chair next to that, and then another. A picture is placed so that your guests can see if they turn their head to the right, they’ll see the picture. You change the entire room around, all the while thinking about your interesting evening of conversation. Your intention is to build the interest. That is metaphoric design. The beauty of quantum jumping is that all that has been done for you. During the jumps, you’ll be with your twin self who solved the riddle of feng shui. And by following specific instructions, you will observe your twin self create a metaphoric design. Then, after merging and coming back to this reality, you do it yourself. You create your own metaphoric design, thereby following the pattern of your twin self. But you don’t have to do it exactly as your twin self did it. Your intention will cause you to create the proper metaphoric design and thereby create your happy home. And when you get to the green clean jump, you’ll visit a twin self in a world that have solved the problems of the environment. That entire world has been metaphorically designed.

--------------------
Audio 2: Preparation to Jump Into Clutter-Free Home
--------------------

Is there any clutter in the room? If there is, it must be removed. That’s absolute. If it’s trash, throw it out. If it’s storage, store it. Clutter is negative. Storage is positive. But don’t store it in the living room. Store it in a corner of the garage or a storeroom or shed. Clutter under your bed may well cause health problems. Clear all things from under the bed and store them somewhere else. Clutter stops energy flow. Like stagnating water, it breeds negative things. Your home and every room in your home have an energy flow. We call this the breath of the room. Every room breathes. Closing up the room stops the breath. Clutter stops the breath. After removing clutter, open your doors and windows in the room. Let it get its breath back. Closet clutter is something most people have to deal with. One of the important things you can do to energize your home is to clear your closets, all of them. It’s work, yes, but it’ll more than pay for you to do it first thing. If you have clothes in your closet that you haven’t worn for years, get rid of them. They represent stagnation and decay. Give them away, sell them, throw them away, but clear your closets. That includes your food storage areas. If you have things in your freezer that’s been there for years, throw them out. Same in the canned goods section. Start fresh. Avoid purchasing a used bed. Never buy a used mattress. The energies of a bed stick through the life of the bed. Same goes for used couches and chairs. Unless you know who owned the furniture prior to yourself, don’t buy it. If you know who and you respect and admire the people, fine. If not, consider waiting and purchasing new. Used furniture may have been cluttering up the other person’s house, and you’re just taking on their clutter. During the next jump, you’ll see how your twin self did it.

Relax. Find a comfortable position. Close your eyes. Take a deep breath. And as you exhale, mentally repeat and visualize the number three three times. Take another deep breath. And as you exhale, mentally repeat and visualize the number two three times. Take another deep breath. And as you exhale, mentally repeat and visualize the number one three times.

Ten. Nine. Feel going deeper. Eight. Seven. Six. Deeper and deeper. Five. Four. Three. Deeper and deeper. Two. One. You are now at a pleasant level of mind where you’re able to concentrate fully on one subject. At this time, concentrate on my words. You are now and always in complete control of your state of mind. You can open your eyes. You can be fully alert anytime you wish to be. Every time you enter this relaxed state, know that you’re getting better and better in every way. Whenever you enter this relaxed meditation state, mentally say, every day, in every way, I’m getting better and better. When you say these words, sense yourself improving in all areas of your life. Sense yourself getting better and better. Visualize improvements in your life as you mentally repeat the words. Every day, in every way, I’m getting better and better. Relax. Relax your eyes. Relax your lips. Relax your jaw. Relax your entire head and your neck. Relax your body. Relax your arms and hands. Relax your legs and feet. You are now completely relaxed. Repeat mentally.

When you’re relaxed and stress-free as you are now, inspiration often helps you to make the right choice, the choice that you will be happy with later on in life. Relax. During the clutter-free home jump, you’ll be observing a twin self who lives in a home the exact duplicate of yours, with one exception. The rooms are identical, but there’s not a scrap of clutter in any of the rooms. The closets are immaculate. The kitchen is almost like a model kitchen. The bathrooms are spotless. There are no bits and pieces of clothes or anything else under the beds. And everything is in perfect order. You will visit a few of your twin self’s rooms, and after merging, you will have the motivation to bring about the positive energies necessary for your present reality. In a moment, I will count from one to three, and at the count of three, you’ll mentally project yourself to the small hallway, and you’ll be standing in front of the transit door. One, two, three. You are now in front of the transit door. Imagine it. Know that it’s there. Visualize the door in front of you. The transit door. On the other side of the door is infinity. An infinity of universes. Anything that can be imagined is on the other side of that door. It only requires your intent to take you to the right place and to be with the twin self who has a clutter-free environment that you want for yourself. During this jump, you will imagine the door opening, and then you will jump or step through the door and be with your twin self, who will be in the exact duplicate of the living room of your home, except it will be a clutter-free room. Relax. And now it’s time for the transit door to open. One, two, the door is opening. Three, the door is open. On the other side of that door is your twin self. Jump over the threshold and visit with your twin self. You’re in the living room of your home. It’s the exact way your own living room is furnished. But there’s no clutter anywhere. Examine the room, the walls, the furnishings, the color of the paint, what’s on the walls, where are the windows. Note that everything is in place. Nothing is superfluous, nothing is out of place, and there is absolutely no clutter in the room. Observe the entire room. Take your time. You’re just an observer. Watch your twin self walk around the room, pointing things out to you. Now leave the living room and go into the kitchen. It’s the exact duplicate of your kitchen in this reality, but nothing is out of place, and it is clutter-free. Now go into the bedroom and note how clutter-free it is. Look under the bed. Clutter-free. Look into the closet. Clutter-free. And now explore the rest of the house, including the carport or the garage. Everything is free of clutter. Relax. Now back to the living room. Walk up to your twin self and merge. You’re no longer observing with your twin self. You are now merged with your twin self. Look around you. No clutter. And now that you have merged and gotten into the rhythm of that self, you may come back to this reality. Relax. I’m going to count from one to three, and you will be back on this side of the transit door. One, two, three. Now back on this side of the door, back in this dimension, relax. In a moment, I’m going to count from one through three. At that moment, you’ll open your eyes, be wide awake, feeling better than you did before. One, two, three. Eyes open, wide awake, feeling wonderfully refreshed, feeling better than before, back with the rhythm of a clutter-free you.

Your Feng Shui guru is that twin self who has been immersed in all the concepts of metaphoric energy, the driving force behind all Feng Shui concepts. Your Feng Shui twin self guru fully understands that the primary moving force behind the success of the position of individual and specific items that are placed in a room or on a table or a sideboard, or a desk, only have the power to change when placed with intent. The intention of the person placing the items, that creates the degree of energy that ultimately manifests into the effect that you want. Whatever effect you want to achieve, your twin self guru has the proper intention. Before you jump into your feng shui guru twin self, Think about what you intend for this jump.

Soon you will jump into a universe where your twin self is a feng shui guru who teaches others the art and who is an expert in the concept of metaphoric design. After your jump, you will be with your twin self who will move some of the things in your room. Move them around to start the energies flowing for a happy home. The placement will be things that are already in your home, perhaps starting with the living room. In a moment, I’m going to count from one to three, and to count to three, you will mentally project yourself to the small hallway, and you will be standing in front of the transit door. One, two, three. You are now in front of the transit door. Imagine it. Know that the door is there. Visualize a door in front of you, a transit door. On the other side of that door is infinity, an infinity of universes. Anything that can be imagined is on the other side of that door. It only requires your intent to take you to the right place and to be with the twin self who will be in your living room as it is now. During this jump, you’ll imagine the door opening and then you will jump or step if you like through the door and be with your twin self who will be in the exact duplicate of the living room of your home. Relax. Now it’s time for the transit door to open. One, two, the door is opening. Three, the door is open. On the other side of that door is your twin self. Jump over the threshold and visit with your twin self. Imagine that you’re in your living room. The furniture and everything else in the room is as it is. Imagine that. You know what’s in the room. You know what’s on the walls. You know what’s on the floor. Imagine that you’re standing at the entrance to the room. Look to the left. What’s on the left wall? Now look to the right. What’s on the left wall? To use metaphoric design, you must move things around with the intention of having a happy home. That’s what your twin self is doing right now. Imagine your twin self moving things. Observe. It could be small things, such as magazines, newspapers, books, anything that’s just lying around. But your twin self is moving these things with the intention of creating a happy home. Observe your twin self moving things in your living room. Perhaps putting things in a pattern. It could be a triangular pattern, it could be square, circular, it could be a line, whatever. But whatever, it is done with intention. The intention is to create a happy home, a happy atmosphere. Observe your twin self, who is an expert in metaphoric design, position things, changing things, putting things in a pattern. Observe this. Take your time. Watch your twin self move things around, placing things in a pattern. It could be circular, square, triangular, or it could be just a line of things. But it’s done with intent. The intent is to create a happy home. All you have to do is think the words, happy home, while your twin self is doing all this. And now imagine walking up to your twin self and merging with that self. And now instead of observing, you are doing, you are moving things around. And in your mind is the thought, happy home. That’s all there is to it. That is metaphoric design. Now that you have merged and gotten into the rhythm of that self, you may come back with that rhythm to this reality. Relax. I’m going to count from one to three and you’ll be back on this side of the transit door. One, two, three. You’re back on this side of the door, back in this dimension. Relax. In a moment, I’m going to count from one to three. At that moment, you’ll open your eyes. You’ll be wide awake. Alert. feeling better than before. One, two, three. Eyes open, wide awake, feeling wonderfully refreshed, feeling better than before. Back with the rhythm of metaphoric design.

Lesson 19: Jump Into the Green Clean
--------------------

Your home is your sanctuary. It's time to unlock the power of Quantum Jumping to help you jump into the green clean.

There is preparation audio before each quantum jump audio to help you understand the intention surrounding each jump, and prepare your mindset for the quantum jumping experience.

--------------------
Audio 1: Preparation to Jump Into the Green Clean
--------------------

And now we come to a universe and a world that everyone would love to be in permanently. The green, clean universe in bubble dome cities. Within the domes, each of the 13 months of the year of the green, clean universe have four seasons. Every seven days, the season changes. Spring, summer, autumn, and winter. Each last seven days within the dome. Each bubble dome is an environmentally friendly world where solar power is the primary means of energy. Your twin self lives in one of the bubble dome cities. Limited to one million people in each of the bubble dome cities, the bubble dome extends over the entire city, enclosing it. Outside the city is farmland, the green natural forest. mountain ocean islands, and landscape where 30 % of the planet’s occupants choose to live. This is your place of greatest attraction, the ideal planet, green and clean. Create your own bubble city or farmland if you so choose. Remember, whatever you create already exists in the infinite worlds of quantum jumping. Imagine the bubble dome city supplied with food by the surrounding farmlands. Power comes from the sun and everything is environmentally controlled. Four seasons of perfect weather with a storm once in a while for excitement, but with a difference. In the bubble domes, there are 13 months in a year. Each month has four seasons of seven days each. Farmland, however, has seasons of 91 days each. Visit your twin self in the green, clean universe and enjoy the visit. Not just for recreation, but any time you are bored or fed up with this reality, visit your green, clean twin self and gather the rhythm every now and again. You’ll be the better for it.

Meditation: Jump Into the Green Clean
--------------------

Relax. Find a comfortable position. Close your eyes. Take a deep breath. And as you exhale, mentally repeat and visualize the number three three times. Take another deep breath. And as you exhale, mentally repeat and visualize the number two three times. Take another deep breath. And as you exhale, mentally repeat and visualize the number one three times. To help you to enter the alpha level of mind, I’m going to count from ten to one. On each descending number, you will feel yourself going inward, and you will enter a pleasant, a meditation level of mind, a level of mind where you’ll be able to concentrate fully on one subject. Ten. Nine. Feel going deeper. Eight. seven, six, deeper and deeper, five, four, three, deeper and deeper, two, one. You are now at a pleasant level of mind where you’re able to concentrate fully on one subject. At this time, concentrate on my words. You are now and always in complete control of your state of mind. You can open your eyes. You can be fully alert anytime you wish to be. Every time you enter this relaxed state, know that you’re getting better and better in every way. Whenever you enter this relaxed meditation state, mentally say, every day, in every way, I’m getting better and better. When you say these words, sense yourself improving in all areas of your life. Sense yourself getting better and better. Visualize improvements in your life as you mentally repeat the words. Every day, in every way, I’m getting better and better. Relax. Relax your eyes. Relax your lips. Relax your jaw. Relax your entire head and your neck. Relax your body. Relax your arms and hands. Relax your legs and feet. You are now completely relaxed. Repeat mentally. My body rests and refreshes itself when I consciously relax. I am relaxed now. Repeat mentally after me. Every day my image of myself improves. Every day my image of myself gets better. I can do anything I have a desire to do. I am a wonderful human being. There’s no one else on earth exactly like me. Every day I grow stronger knowing that I can. I can think. I can create. I can do. I can do anything I have a desire to do. Relax. At this time, concentrate on the image of you relaxed and at ease. Get a sense of yourself sitting comfortably, eyes closed, at the meditation, at the alpha level. With that thought, you are as comfortable as you can possibly be. Still holding that image in your mind and with your mouth closed, touch the roof of your mouth with the tip of your tongue and hold it there while I count from one to three. One, two, three. That’s fine. You may release your tongue now. In touching the tip of your tongue to the roof of your mouth, you were just programmed and reprogrammed that whenever you do touch the tip of your tongue to the roof of your mouth, you are striving for success in something. Each time you are programmed for the bhaga, it is reinforced. Use it when you wish to strengthen intent. The bhaga is a means of telling your mind to come to attention. You are about to do something. And you want something. There are many choices that appear in your life. Some of them are clear. Some of them are purely guesswork and made spontaneously. When you’re relaxed and stress-free as you are now, inspiration often helps you to make the right choice. The choice that you will be happy with later on in life. Relax. In the infinity of universes, there are many of your twin selves who live in idyllic conditions. Remember that whatever can be imagined is in many of those universes. Idyllic planets beyond counting with your twin selves living there. To visit a twin self in a green, clean universe is to refresh your psyche, your consciousness. During this jump, you will first find yourself in a domed city, a bubble dome, as it’s called. In this universe, your twin self lives on a planet that is ecologically perfect. What would that be? Remember, whatever you can imagine is in an infinite universe. There is no unemployment in either the bubble domes or the farmland. Some people prefer to ranch or farm. Others prefer city life. Whatever you prefer, you have a twin self who’s living that life. After visiting your twin self in the bubble dome city, you’ll visit another twin self who lives in the farmland. All energy is from the sun, and everyone has a sun engine that they receive their energy for lighting, holographic TVs, movies, and every other mechanism that requires energy. Vehicles all operate through solar power, as do all computers and all means of transportation. Whatever you can imagine is in an infinite universe. Your twin self is the same age as you are, has the same friends and the same family members. The big difference is that your twin self lives in a bubble dome city, an environmentally perfect town of one million people. The major difference between the bubble dome and the city of your present reality is that the bubble dome city is weather controlled by a master station. There are 13 months in the year. The 13 months of the year of this universe are divided into four parts, with summer coming every seven days, followed by seven days of autumn, followed by seven days of winter, followed by seven days of spring. At the end of the year is Eventide Day, the 365th day of the year when there is a huge celebration, and all the bubble domes have a perfect climate day. Outside the bubble domes, in the farmland, there are also 13 months of 28 days each, with Eventide Day on the 365th day of the year. But instead of the seasons coming every 7 days, they come every 90 days. Many prefer the naturalness of the farmland, and some, like yourself, go occasionally from bubble dome to farmland. For now, visit with your twin self in the bubble dome. Take your time. Have a mental conversation if you like. Ask questions if you like. I’ll be silent for a while. This time, all you have to do is imagine you’re with your twin self in another universe, in the green clean universe, and you will be there. This time, you don’t have to go through the door. I’m going to count from one to three, and at the count of three, you will be with your twin self in the bubble dome city. One, two, three. Relax. Now it’s time to visit and observe. Take your time. Begin. Relax. Now it’s time to visit with your twin self in farmland. It could be in the mountains, by the ocean, on a prairie, ranch land, anything you can imagine. It will be outside of the dome city. But there’s constant coming and going, both by farmland dwellers coming into the domes to vacation, or domers going into the farmland. I will count from one to three, and at the count of three, you will be with your twin self in farmland. One, two, three. You are now with your twin self in farmland. Visit for a while. Take your time. Have a mental conversation if you like. Ask questions if you like. This time, you jumped without the formality of the transit door. You can do that every now and again. After a while, you will decide whether you want to use the transit door to help you to go into another universe or to just imagine that you’re there as you’re doing now. Relax. In a moment, I’m going to count from one to three. At that moment, you’ll open your eyes. You’ll be wide awake and alert, feeling better than before. One, two, three. Eyes open, wide awake, feeling wonderfully refreshed, feeling better than before.

Lesson 20: Jump Into Home Harmony
--------------------

Your home is your sanctuary. It's time to unlock the power of Quantum Jumping to help you jump into home harmony.

There is preparation audio before each quantum jump audio to help you understand the intention surrounding each jump, and prepare your mindset for the quantum jumping experience.

--------------------
Audio 1: Preparation to Jump Into Home Harmony
--------------------

Harmony is agreement. When you have harmony in the home, all the people in that home are in agreement about the major things that affect the home. Harmony is a relationship with the home. A good relationship consists of a filling of needs. When the home fills your needs and the needs of everyone else in the home, there’s harmony. When needs are not being filled by the home, there is discord. There are, of course, different needs filled by different rooms and segments of the home. The kitchen fills the need for nourishment, the bedroom for sleep, the bathroom for cleansing oneself, the living room fills the need for socializing, the dining area for eating and conversation, and the garage for vehicles. Harmony is achieved by filling the demands of each segment within the home. Discord comes about, as example, when sleeping in the living room, eating in the bedroom, washing oneself in the kitchen, or socializing in the bathroom. The harmonious home is a home where each segment has a useful purpose, and each purpose is filled daily. If there’s anything in your home that you’re not comfortable with, change it. The laws and principles of feng shui tell us that by placing items in each room with intent, the energy becomes harmonious. As example, take a magazine, a comb, a floral arrangement, and a flashlight. The items themselves are unimportant. Make up your own. And place these items on your dining room table in a pleasing triangular pattern, thinking, while you are doing that, that the pattern is for harmony while eating. That’s your intent. And that, in a nutshell, is how to enhance the flow of energy, the flow of harmony in your home. You will soon visit a twin self who harmonizes the home with intent and patterns.

And as you exhale, mentally repeat and visualize the number two three times. Take another deep breath. And as you exhale, mentally repeat and visualize the number one three times. To help you to enter the alpha level of mind, I’m going to count from ten to one. On each descending number, you will feel yourself going inward, and you will enter a pleasant, a meditation level of mind, a level of mind where you’ll be able to concentrate fully on one subject. Ten. Nine. Feel going deeper. Eight. seven, six, deeper and deeper, five, four, three, deeper and deeper, two, one. You are now at a pleasant level of mind where you’re able to concentrate fully on one subject. At this time, concentrate on my words. You are now and always in complete control of your state of mind. You can open your eyes. You can be fully alert anytime you wish to be. Every time you enter this relaxed state, know that you’re getting better and better in every way. Whenever you enter this relaxed meditation state, mentally say, every day, in every way, I’m getting better and better. When you say these words, sense yourself improving in all areas of your life. Better and better. Visualize improvements in your life as you mentally repeat the words. Every day, in every way, I’m getting better and better. Relax. Relax your eyes. Relax your lips. Relax your jaw. Relax your entire head and your neck. Relax your body. Relax your arms and hands. Relax your legs and feet. You are now completely relaxed. Repeat mentally. My body rests and refreshes itself when I consciously relax. I am relaxed now. Repeat mentally after me. Every day my image of myself improves. Every day my image of myself gets better. I can do anything I have a desire to do. I am a wonderful human being. There’s no one else on earth exactly like me. Every day I grow stronger knowing that I can. I can think. I can create. I can do. I can do anything I have a desire to do. At this time, concentrate on the image of you. relaxed and at ease. Get a sense of yourself sitting comfortably, eyes closed, at the meditation, at the alpha level. With that thought, you are as comfortable as you can possibly be. Still holding that image in your mind and with your mouth closed, touch the roof of your mouth with the tip of your tongue and hold it there while I count from one to three. One, two, three. That’s fine. You may release your tongue now. In touching the tip of your tongue to the roof of your mouth, you were just programmed and reprogrammed that whenever you do touch the tip of your tongue to the roof of your mouth, you are striving for success in something. Each time you are programmed for the bhaga, it is reinforced. Use it when you wish to strengthen intent. The bhaga is a means of telling your mind to come to attention. to do something and you want something. There are many choices that appear in your life. Some of them are clear. Some of them are purely guesswork and made spontaneously. When you’re relaxed and stress -free as you are now, inspiration often helps you to make the right choice. The choice that you will be happy with later on in life. You have a twin self whose home is in perfect harmony. What would you imagine a home in perfect harmony would be? First of all, there’d be no clutter, no books or magazines out of place, no clothing strewn about, no dirty dishes in the kitchen, beds made and neat, wall coverings and pictures nicely placed, nothing under the bed. Your twin self lives in a clutter -free home that fills needs. At this time, think of what it is that you need from your home. If you lived in the desert, your home might be a tent to keep out the sun. Living on the ocean, a boat may be your home, and you would need different things than the twin self of the desert. Living in the city, the home of your twin self might be proximity to a school. or a business, a hospital, or restaurants. People have different needs arising from their homes. Before you jump, consider what it is that you need from your home that you don’t have at present. Is it proximity to some thing or place? Is it size? Is it the number of rooms? A pool? What is it that you would add or subtract from your home? to bring in a greater sense of harmony. In a moment, you will jump to a twin self who has all the things that are lacking in your present home. By observing how your twin self goes about a house in perfect harmony, you can bring back the rhythm of that home and attract the harmonious relationship that you are looking for. I’m going to count from one to three, and a door will appear in front of you. The transit door. One, two, three. Imagine now that there is a door in front of you. This is the transit point, the jumping off place, to get you wherever your intent directs you to go. Beyond the door, there are an infinite number of dimensions. an infinite number of universes. And one of those universes is a twin self who lives in a home of perfect harmony. One, two, three. The door is opening, and now just jump through. Imagine that you’re in your home, but in a different universe. It’s the home of your twin self. And although it is a duplicate of your home, in this reality, it is a home in perfect harmony. Harmony. Note how your twin self has arranged everything. You may even speak to your twin self and ask how the harmonious relationship between self and home came about. View the scene as an observer only. Begin. What would your home be like if it were in perfect harmony? Observe the kitchen, the living room, the bedroom, the bathroom. Note what’s on the walls, what’s on side tables, and note the accessories. Observe. Now speak to your twin self. Imagine walking around the home in perfect harmony with your twin self. Imagine other people who live in the home or who visit the home remarking how good it feels to be there. After observing the scene, Walk up to your twin self and merge. It only takes a moment. But in that moment of merger, it allows you to absorb the rhythm of your twin self. The rhythm of a home with a perfect harmony atmosphere. Now your twin self and you are one. You’re no longer observing. Now you are acting. Look about you. Note the rooms. Relax. In a moment, I’m going to count from one to three. That moment, you will open your eyes, be wide awake and alert, feeling better than you did before. One, two, three. Eyes open, wide awake, feeling wonderfully refreshed, feeling better than before, back with the rhythm of a harmonious home.

Part 1: Chapter 6: Jump Into Spiritual Connection

Lesson 21: Jump Into Open Heart
--------------------

Jump Into A Spiritual Connection
No one can really tell you what “spirit” is – it’s one of those words that is indefinable. Though different religions and philosophies will all tell you different things about what you’ll find on “the other side” – there’s a way to know, here and now, what’s waiting for you after you pass on.

With Quantum Jumping you can experience it all, now. Because when you jump, you are jumping into the now – not the past or future, not a different time or place. The jumps in this chapter will help you understand the secrets of the spiritual plane, infinity, and choice. You’ll learn to see the eternity of time not as a motion picture - but as a series of infinite individual pictures.

Listen to the introduction audio below to get started.

--------------------
Audio 1: Introduction to Jump Into Spiritual Connection
--------------------

In this chapter, we seek to understand the indefinable. Appreciate this. When you jump, you are jumping into the now. It may seem as though you are going into the past or future, or even to another time or place. But it’s all happening in the present. You have transcended time. Therein lies the secret of the spiritual place, infinity and choice. Don’t see the eternity of time as a motion picture, but a series of infinite individual pictures, and you will see everything as being in the now. And now, Introduction to the Jump into Spiritual Connection with author Bert Goldman. The spirit is one of those words that’s just simply indefinable. Oh, you’ll find definitions in the dictionary and on the internet. But exactly what is the spirit? Common beliefs in what happens to the spirit of the individual, that’s after one leaves this plane of existence, is that there’s some sort of reward in store, or in some cases punishment, or in some cases both. But when you use your sense of logic, you see that the notion doesn’t really make a whole lot of sense. Let’s take a common belief, that in the spiritual plane you receive your reward, and that forevermore you have all that you want. Whether the wanting is gratification of the senses or the acquisition of things. But generally thinking, things are of a material nature, and if they do appear magically on the spirit plane, they’ll be kind of tenuous at best. Imagine that you’ve been given all that you desire and will have it forever. Now we come into a big problem, because forever, that’s a long time. As a matter of fact, it’s really no time. It’s ever. Forever. So you have your gratification and you’re happy with your reward for, oh, say 10 years. And then another 10 years. Well, it may be getting boring after 20 years, but now you pick something else as a reward. Do that for 20 years. And 20 more. And 100 more. Wow. Well, after a few hundred years, that too is going to get kind of wearisome. How about having it a thousand years, ten thousand? How about being involved with the same thing for a hundred thousand years, a million? After all, this is eternity. And a million years is just a drop in the bucket of time, beginning to get the problem. Well, quantum jumping can show you the way. Through memory. And memory requires experience. With quantum jumping, you gain a bit of the experience as to what is waiting for you on the other side. With quantum jumping, you can experience it now. Because when you jump, you’re jumping into now. It may seem as though you go to the past or the future or some other time or place, but it’s happening now, and so it’s all now. You’ve transcended time. Therein lies the secret of the spiritual plane, infinity and choice. See the eternity of time not as an ongoing motion picture, but rather as a series of infinite individual pictures. And you’ll get the idea of everything being now. And what a platter of choices are waiting for you. Here in the physical, you utilize the power of your mind. But once you fully enter the spirit plane and you realize that there is an infinity of choices for you, then and only then you begin to get the idea that perhaps eternity is a necessary part of the equation. And because you have utilized the power of infinite choices on this plane, you can eliminate much of the training that you’d have to normally go through. How can I possibly know this? Because it’s logical. So let’s pursue this concept a little bit further. And to lock it in, I will guide you through four meditations that will bring you closer to the dimension of the spirit, the plane that you will eventually be in permanently. Those will be the spirit of the heart, the spirit of energy, the centered spirit, and the spirit of inner peace. All things are composed of energy. That’s science. Energy can best be understood when we view it as a vibration. The easiest way to understand this is through music. Music is all vibratory. As example, take a guitar string or a piano wire. The A note. And the mid-range vibrates at 880 hertz. A hertz is a unit of vibration or frequency that is equal to one cycle per second. So that 880 hertz is 880 vibrations per second. Volt 40 is also an A, but on a lower octave. Now that’s the physical plane. All things on the physical plane vibrate or move. You can see that when you visualize an atom. An atom has a nucleus with electrons swirling around it. All matter consists of atoms, movement. Therefore, all things vibrate or move. A radio wave has a low vibration, whereas an X-ray is at the near high end of the vibratory scale. When you reach the high point of the physical scale, you come into the low point of the mental. That’s due to your thoughts having a vibration as well. The gross thoughts are the lowest vibration, while thoughts of, well, however you envision God, have the highest vibration. That’s on the mental scale. The highest vibrations of the mental scale are equal to the lowest vibrations of the spiritual plane. Your thoughts of God, or angels, or whatever higher power you envision creates the highest vibrations of the mental scale. When you meditate and concentrate on a higher power, on, say, God, you are automatically vibrating at a high mental level and close to the lowest levels of the spiritual plane. Here’s where the meditator leaves the physical plane, often getting a feeling of floating away from the body. The best minds of the quantum physicists accept that there is an infinity of universes seemingly on the physical plane. They also feel that there will never be a way to reach any of those universes on the physical plane. Oh, they’ll agree that you can visualize a different you on an alternate universe, but that doesn’t place you there. Or does it? There’s an ancient principle known as the principle of correspondence, which states, as above, so below, as below, so above. We take this to mean, as it is on the physical, so it is on the mental. As it is on the mental, so it is on the physical. That being so, as it is on the mental, so it is on the spiritual, so that the infinite universe is a reality on the spiritual plane and can be accessed by initiate. After developing your jumping expertise, you’ll be very close to operating on the spiritual plane. The more you utilize the resource of quantum jumping, the closer you get to developing the skill so that when you do arrive totally on the spirit plane, you’ll be familiar with the fact as it will be a fact on that plane. You have the resources available to you of the experience of every person on earth. In every time period, every culture, every age, it’s all there at your beck and call. As you develop your imagination on the mental plane, you’ll carry that forward with you on the spiritual plane. Even though this is an immense advantage to you, it’s not the thing that will help you the most on this, the physical plane of existence. Here we’re involved with things of a physical nature, matter and such. But in addition to things, material things, there are also many psychological things to contend with, such as attitude, relationships, courage, faith, and so on, that are not involved with matter, but with the emotional side of things. To sum it all up, all things have a vibration, which means that things on all three levels vibrate. Whatever the vibration represents will always manifest as that thing. 880 hertz on the musical scale will produce the sound of A every single time. The same goes for physical and mental vibrations. Negative thinking, fear, anger, apprehension all have a vibration, usually a low vibration, on the mental scale. Positive thinking, faith, forgiveness, courage, and action have a higher vibration. On the mental level these can all be controlled by attitude and actions. Now you may ask what advantage is there to going to the spiritual level at this time. Well, there are many advantages, not the least of which is to eliminate pain or a physical problem you may have. To begin the experience you should be prepared to jump to the spiritual level to overcome a problem. Once you’ve done that and have experienced the energy level of the spirit plane, you should really visit it every day. It often strengthens the immune system and charges up the attitude so that you’ll be attracting only the good things to you, only those things that will help you to stay on the right path. Now, the following module is a spiritual jump and will help you to change your energy level or vibration, if you will, to the one best suited for you. At this time, the energy or vibrations of this one will set you up prior to every other jump you may take. It’s almost a guarantee that if you will meditate every morning before starting your day, whatever occupation, whatever profession you’re involved with, your days are going to improve. You’ll find your mind working better. You will find yourself thinking more clearly. Your creativity will be activated, and in short, you’ll be more efficient at everything you do. In addition to that, you’ll find a peacefulness that many people strive for, but few achieve. The following modules are designed to take you to the spiritual level and to start those things in motion. All you have to do is follow along with my voice. You may listen to this during your morning meditation until you’re comfortable doing it without the need to listen to me guiding you. But it’s fine if you use the module as a guide every morning. After using our standard method of guiding you to the meditation of level of mind, then I’ll guide you through the doorway and into the light of the spiritual dimension. Just listen to my voice and go along with the suggestions. You may imagine that you are surrounded with light, similar to a bright fog. This bright fog of light will surround you. It will be above, around, and below, totally around you. You’ll breathe in the fog of light. You’ll find yourself totally calm and at peace. You will have arrived at the dimension of the Spirit.

--------------------
Audio 2: Preparation to Jump Into Open Heart
--------------------

The heart is generally seen to be the center of love and empathy. An open heart is one that allows entry to those who think the same. It’s been said that goodness is an abundance of empathy, while evil is a lack of empathy. A heart that’s open to the spiritual energies of other people can see the world from the perspective of goodwill. An open heart can understand the other person’s thinking, even when in total disagreement. Look at the open heart as a gatherer of the feelings and difficulties of others. Once you gather them, you can then transfer your own feelings and emotions back to the person to help them have a better life. This is done by jumping to the spiritual dimension. Visiting your twin self who has such an abundance of empathy, you’re practically sucked into the twin self’s merging. The lowest vibration of the spiritual dimension is the highest of the mental. The light of the mental at the highest vibration is bright white light. The lowest level of the spiritual dimension produces a brighter, whiter light. Too bright to see anything in, brighter than the sun at high noon and midsummer. You cannot look at the spiritual light. You can’t look directly at it. But you can bathe in its glow. During the next jump, perhaps you’re first into the spiritual dimension, you’ll visit a universe of the spirit, a place where all beings are at a higher level of spirit. Your twin self will be a spiritual self and may not be seen as a full person, but probably more like a fog of bright white light. But whatever you sense your twin self to be, that twin self will help you to attain the open heart that you’re looking for after the merger.

I can do anything I have a desire to do. I am a wonderful human being. There’s no one else on earth exactly like me. Every day I grow stronger knowing that I can. I can think. I can create. I can do. I can do anything I have a desire to do. Relax. At this time, concentrate on the image of you relaxed and at ease. Get a sense of yourself sitting comfortably, eyes closed, at the meditation, at the alpha level. With that thought, you are as comfortable as you can possibly be. Still holding that image in your mind and with your mouth closed, touch the roof of your mouth with the tip of your tongue and hold it there while I count from one to three. One, two, three. That’s fine. You may release your tongue now. In touching the tip of your tongue to the roof of your mouth, you were just programmed and reprogrammed that whenever you do touch the tip of your tongue to the roof of your mouth, you are striving for success in something. Each time you are programmed for the bhaga, it is reinforced. Use it when you wish to strengthen intent. The bhaga is a means of telling your mind to come to attention. You are about to do something. And you want something. There are many choices that appear in your life. Some of them are clear. Some of them are purely guesswork and made spontaneously. When you’re relaxed and stress -free as you are now, inspiration often helps you to make the right choice. The choice that you will be happy with later on in life. In a moment, you’ll jump to the twin self who’s in spirit. who lives in a universe situated in the spiritual universe, a universe beyond imagination. In this universe, you’ll be engulfed by light. You won’t be able to view your doppelganger twin self as the light of the spiritual dimension permeates everything with brightness and energy. The light doesn’t come from the sun, but… in every molecule of the dimension and comes from everywhere. There are no shadows, only a brightness. But within the bright, the fog -like bright, there’s an intelligence that touches all who are bathed by it. Your twin self in this universe knows your coming and will appear as a shadowy figure just a little less bright. You’ll recognize your twin self. Your twin self has a heart open to all and an infinity of empathy for all creatures. When you merge with this self, you’ll feel an abundance of goodwill and empathy for all creatures, great and small. I’m going to count from one to three and a door will appear in front of you. The transit door. One, two, three. Imagine now that there is a door in front of you. This is the transit point, the jumping off place to get you wherever your intent directs you to go. Your intent this time is to go to the spiritual dimension, the spiritual universe, and visit a spirit twin self. Beyond the door there are an infinite number of dimensions, an infinite number of universes. Let’s visit the first one, whose purpose is only an open heart to all. goodness, and empathy. I’m going to count from one to three, and at the count of three, the door will open, and you’ll jump or step through whatever you’re comfortable doing. You’ll then be immersed in a bright, white, fog -like brightness. Too bright for viewing. Imagine that. Know that you’re there. Create it. Relax. I will now count. One, two, three. The door is opening. And now just jump through it and imagine being in a world of brightness. Through the bright, you can barely make out a shadowy figure. Still bright, but just a little bit darker looking. Perhaps shadowy looking. Three, you are now with your spiritual self. You may hear words of wisdom from this self if you just stay in the light and open your mind. Look in the direction of where you feel your spiritual self is. and simply allow yourself to be immersed in the bright white light. Take your time. I will allow you plenty of time. Just imagine bright fog light permeating everything, surrounding you with a bright light. Get a sense that your spiritual twin self is there, difficult to see, but somewhat shadowy within the bright light. Now as you sense that self, sense yourself floating closer and closer to that self. Closer and closer. And now merge with that twin self. Merge with your spiritual self. After the merger, you may feel all pain, both physical and mental, just floating out away from you. Now on you will feel differently towards many others. and you become more empathetic, more open -hearted. That’s fine. You may do this jump whenever you feel the need for empathy, goodness, and an open heart. Whenever you feel the need for healing, for healing physical pain, or for healing mental pain. Now I will count from one to three, and you’ll be back on this side of the transit door. One, two, three. You are back on this side of the door, back in this dimension, in this reality. In a moment, I’m going to count from one to three. At that moment, you’ll open your eyes, be wide awake, feeling better than you did before. You may do this jump whenever you feel the need for it, whenever you feel depressed, whenever you feel any pain, whatever. or whenever you feel you wish to be closer to the Spirit. One, two, three. Eyes open, wide awake, feeling wonderfully refreshed, feeling better than before.

Lesson 22: Jump Into Energetic Connection
--------------------

Spirituality is a great mystery of life and Quantum Jumping can help you find the answers that are right for you. It's time to unlock the power of Quantum Jumping to help you jump into an energetic connection.

There is preparation audio before each quantum jump audio to help you understand the intention surrounding each jump, and prepare your mindset for the quantum jumping experience.

--------------------
Audio 1: Preparation to Jump Into Energetic Connection
--------------------

One aspect of energy is the ability to do things. When you want to do something and you’re motivated by a desire to get the thing done, you’ll usually find the energy to do it. But what if you can’t seem to develop that energy? Very young people are loaded with it. It’s as though they were plugged into an energy socket, and so much of it comes through they can’t stand still, or sit still for that matter. On the spiritual dimension, energy is in the very air, as the light that is everywhere is energy. The bright light that you encounter when entering the spiritual universe is energy. And everyone who enters its atmosphere is permeated by it. Spiritual entities are energy entities. When you go to the spiritual dimension, via the avenue of a quantum jump, even though you’re there mentally, your intent, your intention, helps to create the atmosphere of energy in the light that will surround you. And there’s an instant connection. Simply by visiting your twin spiritual self who lives with that energy and then merging, you make the connection more of a permanent nature. and should feel an immediate difference in your well -being.

To help you to enter the alpha level of mind, I’m going to count from ten to one. On each descending number, you will feel yourself going inward, and you will enter a pleasant, a meditation level of mind, a level of mind where you’ll be able to concentrate fully on one subject. Ten. Nine. Feel going deeper. Eight. Seven. Six. Deeper and deeper. Five. Four. Three. Deeper and deeper. Two. You are now at a pleasant where you’re able to concentrate fully on one subject.

When you’re relaxed and stress -free as you are now, inspiration often helps you to make the right choice. The choice that you will be happy with later on in life. Relax. In a moment, you will jump to a different… universe, a different dimension, a spiritual dimension. There you will encounter light, great light, great white, brilliant, bright light, light, a kind of light that you’ve never before imagined. It’s the light of the spirit. The spiritual dimension is a dimension and a universe of light, great white Brilliant. Bright. So bright that a person from the physical universes cannot see anything but the bright, too bright to see, light. Your twin self, however, who is a spiritual being in this jump, can see all. Can see right into you. Can see through you. Can see everything that’s ever happened to you. And can see everything that will happen to you. Your spirit twin self is also aware of all the choices that you’ve made and all the tributaries in the stream of your life that was, that is, and that could be. That is the view your spiritual twin has of you and your world. When you meld with this self, your twin self will only allow you to gather the rhythm that you are capable. of handling. When you merge with this twin spiritual self, just relax and allow yourself to be engulfed by the rhythm and energy of your twin self. It promises to be an extraordinary positive experience that will be with you always. You may come back and do this meditation and this jump whenever you feel you need a boost in energy. And now for this, the ultimate energy connection. Relax. I’m going to count from one to three. and a door will appear in front of you, the transit door. One, two, three. Imagine now that there is a door in front of you. This is the transit door, the jumping off place to get you wherever your intent directs you to go. Beyond the door there are an infinite number of dimensions, an infinite number of universes. Infinity. Never ending. I’m going to count from one to three. And to count to three, the door will open. And you’ll jump or step through whatever you’re comfortable doing. You will then observe. One, two, three. The door is opening. And now jump through. View the scene as an observer only. Look at the light. Observe the light. Allow the light to saturate your very being, your standing surrounded, engulfed. Imagine that you are immersed in bright light, bright, brilliant, white light, a fog of light, like a blanket. Just imagine being in a fog of bright, bright, too bright to look at light. Now imagine that in front of you is a bit of a displacement, a little displacement of the light. There’s an outline there, a shadowy outline of a person. It’s your twin self, your spiritual twin self. Just close your eyes and imagine the shadowy figure of your twin self beckoning to you. Listen and you may hear words, helpful words. Your spiritual twin self is like your angel. There to help you with energy, connecting you to the universal energy. The energy source. The energetic source of energy. Bright white. And now move closer to your spiritual twin and merge. Are you within your twin? You are your twin self now. still permeated by light. Feel the rhythm of your spiritual twin self as you receive the energetic connection. That’s fine. That’s good. You may do this jump whenever you feel the need. Now I will count from one to three and you’ll be back on this side of the transit door. One, two, three. You’re back on this side of the door, back in this dimension. Relax. In a moment, I’m going to count from one to three. At that moment, you’ll open your eyes. You’ll be wide awake and alert, feeling better than you did before, feeling energized, feeling wonderfully refreshed. One, two, three. Eyes open, wide awake, feeling wonderfully refreshed, fully energized, feeling better than before.

Lesson 23: Jump Into Your Spirit Center
--------------------

Spirituality is a great mystery of life and Quantum Jumping can help you find the answers that are right for you. It's time to unlock the power of Quantum Jumping to help you jump into your spirit center.

There is preparation audio before each quantum jump audio to help you understand the intention surrounding each jump, and prepare your mindset for the quantum jumping experience.

--------------------
Audio 1: Preparation to Jump Into Your Spirit Center
--------------------

There are three basic forms of consciousness. The physical, the mental, and the spiritual. The great mystery, of course, is the spiritual consciousness. To be conscious of something, however, is to be aware of it. And although we speak about the spiritual, and virtually all the world is involved with things spiritual, virtually no one knows one single thing about it. It’s all based on belief, tradition, hope, and trust. However, through the resource of quantum jumping, you can now actually jump into the spiritual dimension through our interpretation of the infinity of universes. What you’ll find in your spirit center is love, but a love like none that you can imagine. There in your spirit center is the love of the universe, the all -encompassing love of the Almighty, or however your upbringing and mentors call the master of the universes, God. There in the spirit center is a longing and love that you will feel as you have never felt it before. Prior to jumping to your spirit center, be certain that you’re ready for this intensely emotional experience. The love that you will feel encompasses not only the love for spiritual and those gone before you, but for family, friends, acquaintances, and indeed all the world that you know. So prepare yourself. Because when you jump into the spirit center, you will be engulfed by an emotion so powerful, you’ll want to repeat the experience again and again. But first, allow me to guide you to the meditation necessary for this very profound jump.

For now, the choice that you are making is to jump into your spirit center, to go to the spiritual dimension, the universe that consists of the spirit, and then go to the spirit center, a place of universal, all -encompassing love. Just relax. Prepare yourself for a total stress -free environment where there are no cares, no troubles, no stress. Only good, positive, loving energies. I’m going to count from one to three and a door will appear in front of you. The transit door. One, two, three. Imagine now that there’s a door in front of you. This is the transit point. The jumping off place to get you wherever your intent directs you to go. Beyond the door there are an infinite number of dimensions, an infinite number of universes. I’m going to count from one to three and at the count of three the door will open and you will jump or step through it, whatever you’re comfortable doing. You’ll then observe a brightness, a bright fog -like light, intense in brightness, too bright to see anything except the light. One, two, three. The door is opening. Now just jump. View the scene as an observer only. Observe the light. Allow the light to saturate your very being. Imagine you are immersed in bright light. Bright, brilliant white light. A fog of light. Like a blanket of light. Just imagine being in a fog of bright, bright, too bright to look at light. Now imagine that in front of you is a bit of a displacement of the light, a vortex of light that’s even brighter than the light that surrounds you. Imagine that you are moving slowly toward the vortex of light. It’s like an eddy of light, a whirlpool of light. As you get closer, you begin to feel the loving energies of the spirit. The closer you get to the vortex, the more you feel the loving energies. Relax. And just enjoy the feeling of the spiritual dimension. And now go closer to the vortex, the whirlpool of light, and allow it to surround you. Merge with it. I’ll be quiet for a while. You receive the benefits of the connection to the energetic source of energy surrounded by the swirling vortex of light. Feel the rhythm of love and peace as the light permeates your very being. You may do this jump whenever you feel the need. You are now in the true center of yourself. Whenever you feel the need to center yourself and surround yourself with love, do this jump. That’s fine. Do this jump whenever you feel the need. That was good. Now I will count from one to three and you will be back on this side of the transit door. One, two, three. You’re back on this side of the door, back in this dimension, this reality. Relax. In a moment. I’m going to count from one to three at that moment. You’ll open your eyes, be wide awake, alert, feeling better than you did before, feeling the rhythm of having been centered and surrounded by love. One, two, three.

Audio 1: Preparation to Jump Into Inner Peace
--------------------

And now we come to a jump that you must surely appreciate. The jump into inner peace. But the initial jump, you’ll be jumping to a family member or friend who’s passed on and is now in the spiritual dimension. In that infinity of universes, there are many spiritual universes and dimensions. And many of your family members’ twin selves and the family members themselves now reside. It’s highly recommended that you visit your most loved ones who have passed on. Do that every now and again to speak about all those things that should have been said by them to you and by you to them. With a jump into inner peace, you can do that. Nothing gives greater pleasure than to have a peaceful conversation with a passed -on loved one in the spiritual dimension and talk things over. This can be done immediately on the demise of the family member or even years later. All those things you wish you should have said and all those things that the family member should have said can now be said and heard and nothing in the world will bring you more inner peace than resolving all those problems and situations that had risen after the passing of the loved one. As always, prior to the actual jump, You want to be totally concentrative and in the meditation zone of consciousness. That relaxed state of mind and your intention to visit with the loved one who has passed over into the spiritual, that is what enables you to jump directly to the right place. Remember that. Your intention. You intend to do it. It’s automatic. Yes, the bright light will still be there, but you’ll be able to see and hear your loved one. So then. Just relax, make yourself comfortable, and enjoy the peace and tranquility the jump into inner peace will bring to you.

For now, the choice that you’re making is to jump into the spiritual universe where your loved ones or friends who have passed on now reside, now live. Either they themselves or their twin selves who also know you and all about you. Those on the spiritual dimension see all those things in their memory and many if not all things in your memory. They’re surrounded by the boundless spirit center of peace and goodwill and love. They love and they are loved. They cannot visit you unbidden, but you may visit them with a quantum jump into the spiritual realm. When you make this jump, do so with the intent to visit not your own twin self at this time, but your loved one who has passed. Just have that person in mind. either with a mental image of their face or by name. For now, just relax and prepare yourself for a total stress -free environment where there are no cares, no troubles, no stress, only good, positive, loving energies where your loved ones reside. I’m going to count from one to three and a door will appear in front of you, the transit door. One, two, three. Imagine now that there is a door in front of you. This is a transit point, the jumping off place to get you to the spiritual dimension. Beyond the door, there are an infinite number of dimensions, an infinite number of universes, both physical and spiritual. I’m going to count from one to three, and at the count of three, the door will open and you’ll jump or step through it, whatever you’re comfortable doing. You’ll then observe. A brightness. You’ll observe this bright, fog -like light. Intense in brightness. Too bright to see anything except the light. That is the light of the Spirit. One, two, three. The door’s opening. And now just jump through. View the scene as an observer. Observe the light. Allow the light to saturate your very being. Imagine that you are immersed in bright light. Bright, brilliant white light. A fog of light. Like a blanket of light that’s fallen over you. Just imagine being in a fog of bright, bright, too bright to look at light. And now create an image in your mind of the loved one you wish to meet and speak with. Or think of the name of the loved one. At the count of three, you’ll be in the presence of your loved one who has passed on. Your loved one will simply appear in front of you. One, two, three. Your loved one has appeared. You are now in the presence of your loved one who has passed on. Know that to be true. Imagine it. Sense it. Create it. Imagine the voice of your loved one. Speak about the things you wanted to tell your loved one, but perhaps did not get the chance before now. Listen to your loved one telling you about things that should have been resolved. Take your time. Begin. That’s fine. You may do this jump whenever you feel the need. Each time you do this jump. You will feel much lighter in spirit. Now I will count from one to three, and you will be back on this side of the transit door. One, two, three. You are back on this side of the door, back in this dimension. Relax. In a moment, I’m going to count from one to three. That moment, you’ll open your eyes, be wide awake, alert, feeling better than before. One. two, three, eyes open, wide awake, feeling wonderfully refreshed, feeling better than before.

Part 1: Chapter 7: Jump Into Life Adventure

====================

Lesson 25: Jump Into Boundless Excitement
--------------------

Jump Into Life Adventure
What is “adventure?” An exciting experience, sometimes bold - often with an outcome that is not certain. Adventure can also be any mission in life that involves a bit of risk. But all adventure involves an unknown result – and it always involves both choice and change.

Listen to the introduction audio below to get started.

Prepare yourself for this series of quantum jumps that will take you on adventures beyond your wildest imagination. The more adventures you take the more you create a life for yourself with a bold attitude beyond limitations. It's time to unlock the power of Quantum Jumping to help you jump into boundless excitement.

There is preparation audio before each quantum jump audio to help you understand the intention surrounding each jump, and prepare your mindset for the quantum jumping experience.

--------------------
Audio 1: Introduction to Jump Into Life Adventure
--------------------

Wherever you find choice and change, you will find adventure. Be it in new challenges, a change of career, or even a change from within. Adventure keeps the spirit bold. We have four jumps into an adventurous life for you. The first finds your threshold for boundless excitement. The second searches for fun opportunities. The third exotic flavors. And finally, into a dreamlike state that is gentle and will take you to the most amazing adventure of all. To be truly calm, like a ship of life carried forward with the blowing wind. And now, introduction to the Jump into Life adventure with author Bert Goldman. What distinguishes the couch potato from the energetic participant in life is boredom. or monotonous tedium, ennui, some would say, which is the opposite of energy. Now, that simply means that doing nothing protects you from the dangers that you believe surround you, these dangers that change create. Not making decisions that will affect the lifestyle of an individual becomes a means of living followed by… All too many. Some people choose going to seminars to get advice on dealing with the boredom of life. Others read about the adventures of heroic and romantic figures. And then, of course, there are always the stimulating movies and TV programs with heroic figures accomplishing deeds of daring that are impossible to emulate. But the couch potato misses the point. The key to the relief of boredom is a willingness to accept change. Change is that factor that people fear most. That’s because change involves the unknown. People who fear change and making any decisions are generally those who have lost faith in themselves, and they fear making the wrong choice. Very often they turn to causes, political, moral, or holy. And then the belief in the cause becomes a substitute for the lack of belief in oneself. The problem with this type of boredom is that fun and the adventure and excitement of life are missing. And one feels limitations in all aspects of life. Bored people. find more and more limitations popping up as they simply just sit around and vegetate. Limitations come in the form of, I only deserve so much. I only deserve so much in the way of relationships or money or health or fun. When that happens, the abnormal becomes the norm and the undeserving sense becomes a self -fulfilling prophecy as more and more limiting factors come about. That’s why our jumps into life adventure can be so important. Before you can do a thing, you must create a picture in your mind of you doing it. And with a quantum jump, you not only create the picture, you see your twin self living it. That old homily of René Descartes, I think, therefore I am, quite possibly one of the most famous… phrases ever uttered says it very well. You must think before you become, but not to visit a heroic Superman or Wonder Woman or Batman or James Bond. They’re fictional and they’re the thoughts of others. You cannot say they think, therefore I am. And so we, through the quantum jump, bring about the adventure that limits the boredom and the weariness of languor. The adventure of the quantum jump. Here the heroic figure is you. You as you might have been with other programming, with other mentors, with other upbringing, with other choices. Adventure is generally seen as an exciting experience, sometimes bold, often with an outcome that’s uncertain. Adventure can also be a mission in life with a bit of risk. Adventure always has attached to it an unknown result. Adventure is always involved with choice and with change. We have four jumps into life adventure for you. The first into boundless excitement, then fun opportunities, exotic flavors, and finally, a jump into an adventure’s dream, a gentle but soft breeze. that will take you to the most amazing adventure of all, like a ship of life carried forward with the wind.

Audio 2: Preparation to Jump Into Boundless Excitement
--------------------

Excitement is the exact opposite of boredom. But excitement means different things to different people. What does excitement mean to you? What’s the most exciting thing you can think of? Might be something you’ve done in the past or something you’d wished you’d done or dreamed about doing. Or maybe something that you’re thinking about doing. Consider that for a minute. What is it that would be exciting for you that you’d like to be doing? Is it involved with a person, a thing, something to do, a place to visit, a sport, a physical activity? Well, your twin self has done, will do, and is doing that right now. When something is boundless, it’s limitless, has no end. There are very few excitements that have no limitations. But what if? What if there were? And what if you had control over that excitement that seemed to have no limit, no end? Virtually everything gets old after a while. The most adventurous thing, when done again and again and again, it loses the initial excitement. Anything done to the exclusion of other things will lose the excitement. But when you jump into a different excitement with each jump, then the very jumping process itself becomes an adventure. The adventure is in the limitless nature of the jump, because whatever you decide on, the excitement of the adventure will increase if you go to a twin self who’s successful at the thing that you’re excited by. That experience will create a boundless excitement because you’ll enjoy and learn from it. So get ready for your first jump into adventure. But first, put in your mind a thing that excites you. Your intent. What is it that excites you?

Meditation: Jump Into Boundless Excitement

Relax. Find a comfortable position. Close your eyes. Take a deep breath. And as you exhale, mentally repeat and visualize the number three three times. Take another deep breath. And as you exhale, mentally repeat and visualize the number two three times. Take another deep breath. And as you exhale, mentally repeat. and visualize the number one three times. To help you to enter the alpha level of mind, I’m going to count from ten to one. On each descending number, you will feel yourself going inward, and you will enter a pleasant, a meditation level of mind, a level of mind where you’ll be able to concentrate fully on one subject. Ten. Nine. Feel going deeper. Eight. Seven. Six. Deeper and deeper. Five. Four. Three. Deeper and deeper. Two. One. You are now at a pleasant mind where you’re able to concentrate fully on one subject. At this time, concentrate on my words. You are now and always in complete control of your state of mind. You can open your eyes. You can be fully alert. anytime you wish to be. Every time you enter this relaxed state, know that you’re getting better and better in every way. Whenever you enter this relaxed meditation state, mentally say, every day, in every way, I’m getting better and better. When you say these words, sense yourself improving in all areas of your life. Sense yourself getting better and better. Visualize improvements in your life as you mentally repeat the words. Every day, in every way, I’m getting better and better. Relax. Relax your eyes. Relax your lips. Relax your jaw. Relax your entire head and your neck. Relax your body. Relax your arms and hands. Relax your legs and feet. You are now completely relaxed. Repeat mentally. My body rests and refreshes itself when I consciously relax. I am relaxed now. Repeat mentally after me. Every day my image of myself improves. Every day my image of myself gets better. I can do anything I have a desire to do. I am a wonderful human being. There’s no one else on earth exactly like me. Every day I grow stronger knowing that I can. I can think. I can create. I can do. I can do anything I have a desire to do. At this time, concentrate on the image of you, relaxed and at ease. Get a sense of yourself sitting comfortably, eyes closed, at the meditation, at the alpha level. With that thought, you are as comfortable as you can possibly be. Still holding that image in your mind and with your mouth closed, touch the roof of your mouth with the tip of your tongue and hold it there while I count from one to three. One, two, three. That’s fine. You may release your tongue now. In touching the tip of your tongue to the roof of your mouth, you were just programmed and reprogrammed that whenever you do touch the tip of your tongue to the roof of your mouth, you are striving for success in something. Each time you are programmed for the bhaga, it is reinforced. Use it when you wish to strengthen intent. The bhaga is a means of telling your mind to come to attention. You are about to do something. And you want something. There are many choices that appear in your life. Some of them are clear. Some of them are purely guesswork and made spontaneously. When you’re relaxed and stress -free as you are now, inspiration often helps you to make the right choice. The choice that you will be happy with later on in life. Relax. In a moment, you’ll jump to your twin self, who has chosen a thing that you are excited by, an adventurous experience, an experience that’s limitless and exciting. Your twin self will have the experience and be successful with it, whatever that experience might be. You will then choose another experience, a different experience. that is also exciting and adventurous. The twin self you visit will tell you about the enjoyment of the exciting experience and how much the experience is enjoyed. Relax. I’m going to count from one to three and a door will appear in front of you. A transit door. One, two, three. Imagine now that there is a door in front of you. This is the transit point, the jumping off place. to get you to wherever your intent directs you to go. Beyond the door, there are an infinite number of dimensions, an infinite number of universes. And one of those universes is the twin self who’s going through the experience that you want and is being excited about that experience. One, two, three, the door is opening. And now just jump through it. You are now with your twin self, having an exciting experience. But view this scene as an observer only. Watch your twin self have the adventure. This twin self of yours is having a positive attitude toward the excitement of the adventure and is enjoying it immensely. Observe. Relax. All experiences should have a sense of adventure attached to them. This is only possible if there’s a possibility of disappointment. If you were an archer and you visited a twin self who only hit the center of the center ring, hit the bullseye every single time, well, the sport would kind of lose the excitement. Excitement comes with the possibility of failure. The boundless excitement lies in the possibility of being defeated. But then again, failure can be looked at as a learning experience, whereby you do it again, but differently. And now imagine your twin self who occasionally fails, but who laughs at failure, because failure is seen only as a learning experience. By learning from failure, Your twin self becomes more successful with every adventure. I’ll count from one to three. At the count of three, you’ll visit your twin self and you’ll be the controlling factor as to the success or failure of the experience. You may talk to your twin self this time and direct to some degree. You’re still observing, but you’re also telling your twin self how to go about gaining a positive result from the experience. One, two, three. Begin. Relax. Observe. And now, get closer to your twin self. Merge with your twin self. Now that you’ve merged, you have the adventure. What are you doing? How are you enjoying it? Now you see a positive result of the adventure. That was good. That was fine. Relax. Now I will count from one to three, and you’ll be back on this side of the transit door. One, two, three. You’re back on this side of the door, back in this dimension, this reality. You’re bringing back the rhythm of the adventure with you. In a moment, I’m going to count from one to three. At that moment, you’ll open your eyes, be wide awake and alert, feeling better than before. One, two, three. Eyes wide open. Wide awake, feeling wonderfully refreshed, feeling better than before, back with the rhythm of an adventurous you.

Audio 1: Preparation to Jump Into Fun Opportunities
--------------------

Children almost always find ways to have fun. But what about adults? What do you consider fun? How often do you have the opportunity to have fun? When was the last time you can honestly say that you had fun? Well, here’s a way that practically guarantees you will have the opportunity to once again have fun. And when you do this jump, you will wonder why you didn’t think of it yourself. The secret is in four words. Be as a child. That’s it. When you were a child, you had lots of fun. Every child does. Aside from extremes, children manage to have fun in the cold, in the heat, in poverty, in wealth. Children don’t even know they’re cold or hot or poor or wealthy. Children in just about every imaginable situation have fun. Get two or more kids together and they’re going to have fun. But you already know that. You also know that in the multiverse of infinite universes and dimensions and infinite twin selves, that there are twin selves of yours who are children and who are having fun in their universe right now. You can observe your twin young self. Your twin young self. Let me say that once again. Your twin self, but younger. Remember, everything is now. There is no future past. Everything is now in an infinite universe. So you can observe your twin young self and you can join in the fun. After joining the fun, merge with your child twin self and get the rhythm of fun and bring it back to this reality. And you know something? It’ll be fun.

When you’re relaxed and stress -free as you are now, inspiration often helps you to make the right choice, the choice that you will be happy with later on in life. Relax. During this jump, You’ll be visiting with the twin self of your youth. Still your twin self, but a self much younger. A self who is a child. The twin self is you, but you at a young age when the world was fresh and every side a new discovery and you could play and run and dance and have fun. Have fun doing different things. Throwing a pebble into a puddle was fun. Climbing trees was fun. Playing in the mud was fun. Splashing in a wet spot was fun. What other things do you remember doing as a child that was fun? Think about that. Bring back that memory. Relax. While you’re thinking about that, I’m going to count. I’m going to count from one to three, and a door will appear in front of you. The transit door. One, two, three. Imagine now that there is a door in front of you. This is the transit point. The jumping off place to get you wherever your intent directs you to go. Beyond the door, there are an infinite number of dimensions, an infinite number of universes. And one of those universes is the young twin self of yours who is having fun. One, two, three. The door is opening. And now just jump through it. You are now with your young twin self. Watching the fun. Observing the fun. View the scene, but as an observer only. This twin self of yours is having a lot of fun and is enjoying it immensely. It’s your young twin self. You as you once were, but are in another dimension. Observe your twin self having fun. What is your twin self doing? Is it something that you remember doing yourself at one time? Or is it something different? Get a sense of hearing your young twin self laugh and observe the playing. Are any of your friends there? Bring some in. Watch them all. Watch all of them as they have fun. Now you join in the fun. You, as you are now, as an adult, play and have fun with your twin self and any friends who are there. Don’t be embarrassed even though your twin self is quite young because it is you after all, as you once were. You’re an adult, but play and have fun. Join in. Bring in any of your old friends. Now move closer to your young self and merge with your young twin self. Now you are younger. Now you are the child. Now you are gathering the rhythm. of a twin self, you, who has the opportunity to have fun at any time, in any kind of weather. That’s the rhythm you will bring back to this reality. Merge with that twin self. And now you are not observing. You are the child and you are playing. That was fine. That was good. Now I will count from one to three and you’ll be back on this side of the transit door. One, two, three. You’re now back on this side of the door, back in this dimension. You can go do this jump anytime you like. Anytime you feel like you want to have some fun. Just follow this jump. Relax. Now I’m going to count from one to three. And at that moment, you’ll open your eyes. Be wide awake and alert feeling better than you did before. One, two, three. Eyes wide open. Wide awake, feeling wonderfully refreshed, feeling better than before, back with the rhythm of fun.

Lesson 27: Jump Into Exotic Flavors
--------------------

Prepare yourself for this series of quantum jumps that will take you on adventures beyond your wildest imagination. The more adventures you take the more you create a life for yourself with a bold attitude beyond limitations. It's time to unlock the power of Quantum Jumping to help you jump into exotic flavors.

There is preparation audio before each quantum jump audio to help you understand the intention surrounding each jump, and prepare your mindset for the quantum jumping experience.

--------------------
Audio 1: Preparation to Jump Into Exotic Flavors
--------------------

When something is exotic, it’s not only different, it is strikingly so. It is very different. Unusual and usually unfamiliar. The flavor of something, say a work of art or literature, is also unique. And the flavor of a book is that thing which gives it life. Quantum jumping has a flavor all its own. Certainly unique. as there’s nothing else like it, and generally unfamiliar to the uninitiated. It’s difficult, if not impossible, to really describe the flavor of something to someone unfamiliar with the thing. All you can do is to compare the thing to something that the person is familiar with. That’s what makes a quantum jump unique. There’s nothing to compare it with. During this jump, you’ll be… tasting things, not only with your palate, but with your mind. And when you do that, you see things. You see people, events, and the world as a whole with a stronger mind, a mind in control, an evolved mind. After you jump into exotic flavors, you’re going to discover a new sense, a sixth sense, that of mentally tasting another person’s thoughts. This jump could very well turn out to be a major turning point in your life. For now, just allow yourself to be open to the supposition that you can indeed open your sense of taste and taste thoughts. When you jump to the twin self who already has this ability, you will observe a tasting of the flavor of thought. It works like this. Say that you’re thinking about buying a car, but you don’t know which model. You think about the car. And then you mentally taste it. You compare the taste with foods that you either like or dislike. Say that you love chocolate ice cream. You think of the model car you want to buy and mentally taste it. If chocolate ice cream comes to mind, you have a winner. And you’re going to be satisfied with your purchase. But if liver and onions comes up and you dislike liver and onions, don’t buy the car. Wow. Think how well this could work when going to the racetrack or picking a stock. Think how well this can work when you make a choice for anything.

Meditation: Jump Into Exotic Flavors

Relax. Find a comfortable position. Close your eyes. Take a deep breath. And as you exhale, mentally repeat and visualize the number three three times. Take another deep breath. And as you exhale, mentally repeat and visualize the number two three times. Take another deep breath. And as you exhale, mentally repeat. And visualize the number one three times. To help you to enter the alpha level of mind, I’m going to count from ten to one. On each descending number, you will feel yourself going inward. And you will enter a pleasant, a meditation level of mind. A level of mind where you’ll be able to concentrate fully on one subject. Ten. Nine. Feel going deeper. Eight. Seven. Six. Deeper and deeper. Five. Four. Three. Deeper and deeper. Two. You are now at a pleasant level of mind where you’re able to concentrate fully on one subject. At this time, concentrate on my words. You are now and always in complete control of your state of mind. You can open your eyes. You can be fully alert. anytime you wish to be. Every time you enter this relaxed state, know that you’re getting better and better in every way. Whenever you enter this relaxed meditation state, mentally say, every day, in every way, I’m getting better and better. When you say these words, sense yourself improving in all areas of your life. Sense yourself getting better and better. Visualize improvements in your life as you mentally repeat the words. Every day, in every way, I’m getting better and better. Relax. Relax your eyes. Relax your lips. Relax your jaw. Relax your entire head and your neck. Relax your body. Relax your arms and hands. Relax your legs and feet. You are now completely relaxed. Repeat mentally. My body rests and refreshes itself when I consciously relax. I am relaxed now. Repeat mentally after me. Every day my image of myself improves. Every day my image of myself gets better. I can do anything I have a desire to do. I am a wonderful human being. There’s no one else on earth exactly like me. Every day I grow stronger knowing that I can. I can think. I can create. I can do. I can do anything I have a desire to do. At this time, concentrate on the image of you, relaxed and at ease. Get a sense of yourself sitting comfortably, eyes closed, at the meditation, at the alpha level. With that thought, you are as comfortable as you can possibly be. Still holding that image in your mind and with your mouth closed, touch the roof of your mouth with the tip of your tongue and hold it there while I count from one to three. One, two, three. That’s fine. You may release your tongue now. In touching the tip of your tongue to the roof of your mouth, you were just programmed and reprogrammed that whenever you do touch the tip of your tongue to the roof of your mouth, you are striving for success in something. Each time you are programmed for the bhaga, it is reinforced. Use it when you wish to strengthen intent. The bhaga is a means of telling your mind to come to attention. You want something. There are many choices that appear in your life. Some of them are clear. Some of them are purely guesswork and made spontaneously. When you’re relaxed and stress -free as you are now, inspiration often helps you to make the right choice. The choice that you will be happy with later on in life. Now just relax. And with this jump… you will go to a twin self who has a unique ability, the ability to taste the flavor of the thoughts. This may well be a new idea for you, but by tasting the thought and comparing it with a positive or a negative, you can often predict whether the thought will have a positive outcome or a negative one. Sophisticated psychics do this naturally. By observing your twin self taste thoughts and then merging, you will enhance your ability to utilize this very powerful resource. In a moment, you will jump to the twin self who is most adept at getting the most out of the exotic flavor of thought. I’m going to count from one to three. A door will appear in front of you, the transit door. One, two, three. Imagine now that there is a door in front of you. This is the transit point. The jumping -off place to get you wherever your intent directs you to go. Beyond the door, there are an infinite number of dimensions, an infinite number of universes. And one of those universes is your twin self, who is most skilled. in the art of tasting thoughts to predict a favorable or unfavorable outcome, thereby making more and more correct choices. I’m going to count from one to three, and at the count of three, the door will open, and you will jump or step through whatever you’re comfortable doing. You will then observe your twin self, who uses a sixth sense, a sense of tasting the exotic flavor of thought. One, two, three. The door is opening. And now just jump through. View the scene as an observer only. You are now with your twin self. Imagine it. Know that you’re there. Watch your twin self. Observe your twin self. And now get a sense that your twin self is explaining to you how to taste your thoughts before you make any major decisions. Before you make a decision, think about the taste of the decision. And what are you attracted to? Is it something that you enjoy tasting or something you don’t care for the taste? Allow your twin self to explain that to you. Think now about something that is coming up in this reality. Something that you want to make a decision about before you take an action. Think about that. Something that’s coming up. Something that you have to choose before you act. Think about that. Now imagine you have the ability to taste that thought. And now while thinking about the decision and about the action, taste the thought. What do you sense? What does the thought taste like? After tasting the thought, how do you feel about the decision to take the action? What direction would you take if there are two choices? Taste both of them. Now imagine your twin self doing the same thing for the same action. Your twin self is an expert at tasting thoughts. Your twin self has done that many times. Your twin self does it naturally. Now merge with your twin self. Now your twin self and you are one. And now you’re getting the rhythm of your twin self. You’re getting the rhythm of the manner in which the tasting sense is used. And now that your twin self and you are one, you can act. You don’t have to observe now. Act. Taste the thought. What do you sense? Is it a positive taste or a negative taste? This will help you to decide. Whenever you have a choice or a decision to make, use your new sixth sense and taste the thought. Relax. was fine. Now I will count from one to three and you’ll be back on this side of the transit door. One, two, three. You are now back on this side of the door, back in this dimension but with the rhythm of your twin self who is expert at tasting thought. Relax. In a moment I’m going to count from one to three. That moment you’ll open your eyes, be wide awake and alert, feeling better than before. One, two, three. Eyes open, wide awake, feeling wonderfully refreshed, feeling better than before.

A gentle breeze speaks of something kind and easy. And that’s what this jump will be. A kind jump. And one that’s the easiest jump of all. Also, a breeze that will help you along this sea of life. Helpful in taking actions. Helpful in making good decisions. And helpful in having what everyone ultimately strives for. A good life. A good and gentle life. A sailboat at sea looks for the wind at every opportunity, but the degree of wind, ah, the degree of wind is all important. Too much wind is a storm, and the boat gets difficult to steer. Too little wind, and the ship goes nowhere. Every sailor looks for the perfect day of wind, a gentle breeze. Those are the best days at sea. The best way to ease into the comfort of a day’s sailing. With a gentle breeze, the boat moves in the direction you want it to go, and the time it sees easy, comforting, and calming. That’s the way that we would want life to go as well. Just a gentle breeze to push us along in ease and comfort. No stress, no problems, no cares, but a calm, Good life. With a jump into gentle breeze, you’re going to visit your twin self who is metaphorically sailing easily through life. Your jump will take you to a sailboat. No matter whether you have ever sailed or not, this sail will represent your journey through life. It’s the ultimate metaphor. And after gathering in the rhythm of your sailor twin self, you’ll find your own life. growing gentler, easier, and better.

With this jump, You’re going to visit a twin self who sails along life’s stream with ease and with a gentle breeze always there to help. Imagine a twin self on a sailboat. A sailboat is a metaphor that represents your reality, your life. A sailboat was a goal, a destination. Your intention is to get to that destination, help throughout your journey, by a gentle breeze that carries you forward. After jumping through the transit door, you’ll find yourself observing your twin self steering the boat with a big smile. The boat skims along the water easily just as your life will skim along easily, pushed forward constantly by the gentle breeze. Relax. I’m going to count from one to three, and a door will appear in front of you, the transit door. One, two, three. Imagine now that there is a door in front of you. This is the transit door. The jumping -off place to get you wherever your intent directs you to go. Beyond the door, there are an infinite number of dimensions, an infinite number of universes. I’m going to count from one to three, and at the count of three, the door will open, and you will jump or step through it, whatever you’re comfortable doing. You will then find yourself on a sailboat, observing your twin self at the helm, at the wheel. One, two, three. The door is opening, and now jump through. Imagine the scene. View the scene as an observer. Imagine now you are on a sailboat with your twin self. Relax. Watch your twin self. Observe your twin self smiling and steering the boat as you feel a gentle breeze fill the sails. Look about you. Get a sense that you can see the ocean, the lapping waves. Gentle. See your twin self, happy, as your twin self steers the boat, catching the gentle breeze in the sails. And now merge with your twin self, and imagine that you are now steering the boat. Get a sense that you are being pushed along by a gentle breeze. When you come back to this reality, you will bring that rhythm back with you. From now on, everything that you attempt, you will succeed at because you will have that gentle breeze always there, helping you along. You will succeed and you will learn, and learning is success. You are now steering the boat. You are now being directed by the breeze, Push gently forward. Forward. Forward. Relax. Enjoy the sail. I will be quiet for a while as you go deeper into the jump and enjoy the breeze carrying you along. Relax. That was fine. Now I will count from one to three and you’ll be back on this side of the transit door. Back with the rhythm of the gentle breeze. One. Two. Three. You are back on this side of the door, back in this dimension. Relax. In a moment, I’m going to count from one to three. At that moment, you’ll open your eyes, be wide awake and alert, feeling better than before. Feeling that you have successfully merged with your twin self, who is carried along in life by a gentle breeze. Helping. One, two, three. Eyes open. Wide awake, feeling wonderfully refreshed, feeling better than before.

Meditation: Moving Forward
--------------------

Relax. Find a comfortable position. Close your eyes. Take a deep breath. And as you exhale, mentally repeat and visualize the number three three times. Take another deep breath. And as you exhale, mentally repeat and visualize the number two three times. Take another deep breath. And as you exhale, mentally repeat. and visualize the number one three times. To help you to enter the alpha level of mind, I’m going to count from ten to one. On each descending number, you will feel yourself going inward, and you will enter a pleasant, a meditation level of mind, a level of mind where you’ll be able to concentrate fully on one subject. Ten. Nine. Feel going deeper. Eight. 7, 6, deeper and deeper. 5, 4, 3, deeper and deeper. 2, you are now at a pleasant level of mind where you’re able to concentrate fully on one subject. At this time, concentrate on my words. You are now and always in complete control of your state of mind. You can open your eyes. You can be fully alert. anytime you wish to be. Every time you enter this relaxed state, know that you’re getting better and better in every way. Whenever you enter this relaxed meditation state, mentally say, every day, in every way, I’m getting better and better. When you say these words, sense yourself improving in all areas of your life. Sense yourself getting better and better. Visualize improvements in your life as you mentally repeat the words. Every day, in every way, I’m getting better and better. Relax your eyes. Relax your lips. Relax your jaw. Relax your entire head and your neck. Relax your body. Relax your arms and hands. Relax your legs and feet. Relax. Repeat mentally. My body rests and refreshes itself when I consciously relax. I am relaxed now. Repeat mentally after me. Every day my image of myself improves. Every day my image of myself gets better. I can do anything I have a desire to do. I am a wonderful human being. There’s no one else on earth exactly like me. Every day I grow stronger knowing that I can. I can think. I can create. I can do. I can do anything I have a desire to do. Relax. At this time, concentrate on the image of you relaxed and at ease. Get a sense of yourself sitting comfortably, eyes closed, at the meditation, at the alpha level. With that thought, you are as comfortable as you can possibly be. Still holding that image in your mind and with your mouth closed, touch the roof of your mouth with the tip of your tongue and hold it there while I count from one to three. One, two, three. That’s fine. You may release your tongue now. In touching the tip of your tongue to the roof of your mouth, you were just programmed and reprogrammed that whenever you do touch the tip of your tongue to the roof of your mouth, you are striving for success in something. Each time you are programmed for the bhaga, it is reinforced. Use it when you wish to strengthen intent. The bhaga is a means of telling your mind to come to attention. You are about to do something. And you want something. There are many choices that appear in your life. Some of them are clear. Some of them are purely guesswork and made spontaneously. When you’re relaxed and stress -free as you are now, inspiration often helps you to make the right choice. The choice that you will be happy with later on in life. Relax. In a moment, you will jump to a large room. with a mastermind table in the center. Seated at the table will be all the twin selves you visited. Imagine that. Know that they will be there. Create them. Your abundance selves will be there. As will your healthy selves. Your selves with successful relationships. Your twin selves with career. and success, your happy home selves, your spiritual selves, and your adventurous selves. They will all be sitting around the mastermind table waiting to offer you advice and options. You will be the leader of the group and you may ask questions. Then clear your mind and imagine answers floating into you. Relax. I’m going to count from one to three and a door will appear in front of you, the transit door. One, two, three. Imagine now that there is a door in front of you. This is the transit point, the jumping off place to get you wherever your intent directs you to go. Beyond the door are an infinite number of dimensions, an infinite number of universes. In one of those universes, your mastermind group is waiting for you. All the twin selves who can offer help will be there. Imagine that. Imagine also that when you jump through the door, you will be at the head of the mastermind integration table. I’m going to count from one to three. And at the count of three, the door will open and you will jump or step through it, whatever you’re comfortable doing. You will then observe your twin selves at the table, and you will take a seat at one end of the table as the leader of the group. One, two, three. The door is opening, and now jump through. Imagine the scene. Your twin selves are sitting at the mastermind integration table. Imagine that. Know that they are there. Create it. Take a seat at the head of the table. Imagine that you are sitting at the head of the table. A mastermind integration table. Also at the table are many of your twin selves. Your abundant selves are there, as are your healthy selves. your selves with successful relationships, your career and success selves, your wise selves, your happy home selves, your spiritual selves, and your adventurous selves. All these twin selves of yours are around the Mastermind Integration Table. They’re there to help you. Imagine now that one of them is speaking to you. What is that self of yours saying? What do you sense? Think now about a problem that you have that you’d like to have resolved. After thinking about the problem, imagine putting the problem to all the selves of yours who are at the mastermind integration table. Imagine that you are telling yourselves the problem that you’d like a solution for. Now imagine that you’re getting good advice as to find a solution to the problem. Take your time. Begin. Relax. That was fine. Whenever you need advice, whenever you have a problem, whenever you have choices to make, you’re welcome to come back to the integration table and consult with your twin -self doppelgangers. In a moment, I’m going to count from one to three. You’ll be back on this side of the transit door. One, two, three. You’re now back on this side of the door, back in this dimension. Now in a moment, I’m going to count from one to three. At that moment, you will open your eyes, be wide awake, feeling better than you did before. One, two, three. Eyes open, wide awake, feeling wonderfully refreshed, feeling better than before. Back with. a possible solution to your problem.

--------------------
Audio 1: The Little-Known Secret of Quantum Energy
--------------------

Quantum Jumping 2, CD1, The Four Levels of Quantum Jumping. This is Burt Goldman speaking. I will be with you for this entire series. Module 1, The Little Known Secret of Quantum Energy. I was lecturing before a group of people in New York. Everything is energy, I said, in one form or another. We were at the Gramercy Park Hotel Ballroom. Someone had just asked about the fact that you couldn’t see energy. But you can, I said. Everyone has a field of energy that surrounds them. That energy is called different things by different people in different cultures. But here in the United States, we simply call it the energy field. You may also have heard of it referred to as an aura or an auric field. Saying that, I proceeded to show people how to see an aura, and I put mine on display. Here’s how I did it. I like to demonstrate this energy that surrounds each person. First of all, I stand in front of a bare wall, and I have all the students stare at the center of my forehead, while at the same time, they should be aware of the outline of my head and shoulder area. So they’re looking in the center of my forehead. Some of them look at the tip of my nose. Doesn’t really matter. But what does matter is they should be aware of the outline of my head and shoulder area. Because at first viewing, the aura is best seen from your peripheral sight. While they’re staring, I kind of squeeze very slightly on the physical level, but quite strong mentally. I imagine a fog-like light oozing out of my body from my stomach area to the top of my head. My eyes are closed when I’m doing this, and I hold a squeeze until I hear something. What I usually hear is, oh my God, I see it, said one person. I see it, and then I see it rings out from all over the room. It’s like a shimmering of a highway on a hot day, says one person, and pretty soon they all see it. My aura. Just about that time, energy, that unseen force, becomes a real thing, a real object. Wow! Comes from the throats of the participants there. But what use is it? Asks one of the participants. Let me show you one use, I say. Now, energy is everything. Not just the energy that causes you to get out of bed in the morning or the energy that enables you to run a mile or work all day. But energy is the thing that causes cohesiveness and interconnection, keeping the cells of your body active. It’s the thing that enables your mind to come up with creative ideas. And it’s the thing that draws one person to another or that draws things, people. and events to you. Energy is what determines the law of attraction. Energy is what creates your world. But it was time for me to demonstrate energy a bit further. And pretty soon I would show them how to use energy to heal, to create, to attract success. But first, I want to show how real this energy is, and that anyone could create and manipulate it. i walked over to a young man in the front row and i whispered in his ear imagine a wall somewhere in this room a mental wall that you create going from ceiling to floor and wall to wall just think about it but you do create it i asked him if he understood and he nodded while he’s mentally building the wall i took a wire coat hanger out of my briefcase and with a pair of cutting pliers they made two cuts so that now the coat hanger was in the shape of an l i then told the group that the young man had created a wall of energy somewhere in the room and i would find it holding the coat hanger there was now a dousing rod in front of me small end loose in my hand long end straight forward i slowly walked from one end of the room to the other about three-quarters of the way the wire suddenly moved abruptly to the right. I looked at the young man and I said, the wall is right here. He smiled. And then he laughed and he shook his head. That’s right, he said. I can’t believe it. I mentally put a wall right there on that exact spot. And then just about everyone in the group was asking the same question. How did I do it? Well, I wanted to give them a little background first so they could see that energy. can be put to good use. I told them that everything was energy and that as everything is energy, it’s all connected. At the quanta level, the very smallest of the smallest of levels, there is an intercommunication that takes place among all the levels of fundamental particles of matter consisting of neutrons and protons. But aside from that, what you might think of as gobbledygook that few people understand, let me say this. Let me put it a different way. If a person can build a mental wall that can be detected, then it is, to some extent, real. Now, building a wall with your mind might not be the most important item on your list of things to do today, but consider this. If you can build a wall with your mind, what else can you use that energy for? My friend, Uri Geller, taught me that particular technique. He uses that same energy to sprout seeds in his hand. He causes broken clocks and watches to work, and he bends spoons with his mind. He uses that same energy to do all that and more. I know that for a fact because Uri and I used to do seminars together. During one of those seminars, SONA, an acronym for Secrets of the New Age, Uri demonstrated using the quantum energies to sprout seeds in his hand and read people’s thoughts, while I used it to heal all those who applied. We were a great team, but Uri changed direction and began to douse psychically for oil in Mexico, parts of the Middle East, and parts of the U.S. He found many sites for oil companies in the 80s and 90s and grew quite wealthy using these quantum energies. But what can you use it for? Well, when we utilize the energy of infinity that I call a quantum energy, you discover that the universe is one big hologram. Now, why do I say that? What is that? You’ve heard that word before, I know. And you probably think that a hologram is like a three-dimensional photograph. Well, my friend, it’s much more than that. Let me explain. Say that on a piece of celluloid, you had your hologram. And the hologram was a picture of Napoleon, a three-dimensional hologram. All holograms are three-dimensional. Because it is a hologram, the entire picture of Napoleon. is impressed on every molecule of the celluloid. So if you were to trim off one inch of the end of the celluloid, the entire picture would be there. If you were to trim off a tenth of an inch, the same picture would be there. Or if you were to have a three foot by three foot, which would be the original size, let us say, the entire picture would be there. At the quantum level, everything exists. simultaneously because the hologram’s particles are in communication with each other. There’s no time on the quantum energy base level. This you prove mentally every time you think of a past thing or a future occurrence. The universe and all things it contains is just one vast hologram with all the information everywhere. We don’t call it a hologram except to explain it in terms that are easily understood. And so we call this vast hologram quantum energy. When you put that together with quantum jumping, you get a resource of such value that you’ll be utilizing its benefits all of your life. We accumulate a great base of knowledge over the years. Some of it is acted on, while the rest is simply stored away somewhere in the recesses of the brain. This stored and buried material affects your everyday life, but as it is masked by overlapping data, it isn’t noticed. And because it’s not observed, it can’t be acted upon. Most personal development organizations call this buried material past programming. Past programming or past programs are simply things that have happened or not happened in your past that have an effect on your attitude and your actions in the present. In the quantum world, these past programs are called source programs. These foundations of future happenings are stored quantum energies. In the quantum world, each time a decision is made, each time a choice presents itself to you, there is a branching off of realities. You might say that a new energy is added to the hologram. Each time there is a decision to be made, a road opens in front of you that branches off in different directions. The branch of the road that you didn’t take is also valid, as when the choice is made, another is set in place on the road you didn’t take as well. Each branch, and there are many, create a new energy source. Maybe a little difficult to comprehend, but pretty much accepted as standard theory of many eminent quantum physicists today. With quantum jumping, we design each jump to get to one of those branches or sources of energy where you are successful in the thing that you’re looking to enhance, in the endeavor that you’re looking to enhance. When you consider the branches that you make every day, and extend that to a week and a month, you can see that by the end of the year, your choices are practically infinite. With this module, we’ll examine the branching concept, and by applying it to source foundations, you will discover all you need to know about past programming and how to correct it. Let me refresh your memory as to what a source foundation is, as the material that follows uses the source foundation premise as a basis for overcoming problems. In Quantum Jumping 1, you learn that a source foundation was an insignificant event that causes a significant effect. The example was that of a person, let’s call him Harry, who’s going to a New Year’s party. The host wants Harry to contribute $20 towards the food and drinks. Harry is insulted as he feels if he’s invited to a party, he shouldn’t have to pay for it. And so he leaves. He goes to another New Year’s Eve party and while there meets Ethel, who ultimately becomes his wife. They have three children. One of them studies law, becomes a renowned attorney, and ultimately becomes the governor of the state. All those effects. The meeting of Harry and Ethel, their marriage, the three children, the governor, all are branches of the road that came into being because of a single source foundation, the $20 bill that Harry was asked to pay for that New Year’s party. Had he paid it and gone to the first party, none of the other effects would have happened. But all were possibilities. That $20 created a quantum energy. Recall that quanta is the very smallest of particles. The $20 bill is an important factor in the life of Harry as it affects his future in every way. And even though it is a tiny energy source, it has significant consequences. In a quantum world, those effects and many more would and did take place. All those branches exist in a multidimensional holographic universe. In one of the branches, Harry went to the first party. In another, he went to the other party. Going further, at the second party, he didn’t meet Ethel, he met Maria. In another branch, he went home without going to any party. And on and on ad infinitum. Each decision he made led to a parallel universe. One of the infinity of universes where anything that could be imagined, anything that could be imagined taking place, did take place. I realize that some of these ideas boggle the imagination. But just listen to this. The year, let us say, is 1960. Democrat Ronald Reagan, rather, was a somewhat mediocre actor featured in B-movies, and Ronald Reagan was also on TV. If you were to say that one of his decisions would lead to the presidency of the United States as a Republican, you would have been thought of as crazy. And yet it was there. We all have somewhat bizarre branches of the road. The first step in controlling them is the knowledge that they exist at all. I don’t know what Ronald Reagan’s source foundation was or what the first decision that brought him on the path to the presidency was, but I would bet it was something as insignificant as him being late for dinner somewhere one day. Source foundations are the things that hold you back in life, that create poverty, poor relationships, self-sabotage, illness, stress, overweight conditions, addictive personalities. fears, early demise, and virtually all the negative conditions of life. Source foundations are also the things that create wealth, good relationships, success in all things, good health, a relaxed attitude, confidence, self-esteem, youth preservation, and all the positive conditions of life. Once a source foundation is set, It creates a quantum energy that influences attitudes and behavior. If you could identify a source foundation, you could change its outcome. If you knew how to set a source foundation, you could change your life. You would have control over your life, and you’d be able to move in the direction that you choose, not the directionless way of the unknown. Every branch of the road. Every decision that you make leads to a different you, a doppelganger, a self in an infinity of selves, in an infinity of occupations, with an infinity of personalities. But before I get into that, let me speak of the many yous there are right now, right here, in this universe, in this dimension. Within each one of us are many people, many different selves. We live in a world with many mansions, but most have not the slightest clue as to where they are or how to find them. You’ve probably noted yourself that at times you’re happy, and there are times when you’re sad. Sometimes you’re serious, sometimes you’re playful. I’m sure there have been times in your life when you were adventurous, just as there were times in your life when you were an old stick in the mud and were quite happy with the status quo. Sometimes it’s chemical. You see a beautiful or handsome member of the opposite sex and suddenly endorphins start firing off and you feel as though spring has sprung. Other times it’s an attitude or something that you see or hear or smell that reminds you of a long ago scene and a good or a bad feeling suddenly comes over you. Point being, it’s sometimes difficult to find the real you, that hidden, deep-within-you guy or gal who you really want to be, the real you. Where is that person? How can I find him or her? Well, my friend, you’ll discover that you, the real you, that is, during this series of Deepening Quantum jumps. You’ll get to know the real you. And you know something? That person is a champion in every way. That person looks to hit the ball out of the park with every swing. That’s the person you’ll find by the time we come to the last module of Quantum Jumping 2. During this continuation of the Quantum Jumping series, we’ll be going deeper into the premise. with mental conditioning exercises designed to not only take you on a trip to a parallel universe, but to jump into a self that will help you get through the day with energy, vigor, creativity, and a passion for the things you do. You’ll start your day with a morning quantum jump to get those quantum energies flowing, to get the day started with a bang. And then… you’ve gone through the day and made the thoughtful choices with the help of your wisdom jump into a parallel wherein dwells the wisest you of them all, you’ll go for the evening jump to clean up all the mistakes, if any, of the day. Those things you said you wish you hadn’t said, and those things you did you wish that you hadn’t done. During the modules, as you listen and act on the information, You’ll discover not only the real you, but you may well discover the you who suddenly discovers his or her life’s purpose. Yes, you do have one. A life purpose, that is, but you may not know it yet. Discover your life’s purpose, and you may well prove to be a person you knew was deep within you, always trying to get out. And finally, you letting that person out. Discovering your life’s purpose may well prove to be the highlight of your year. The target jump will get you to a place where the greatest goals and objectives of them all reside. Your target doppelganger self will help you to decide on not only the goals in your life, but the controls as well. In Module 3, the one after the meditation that follows this module, you’ll learn about out-of-body experiences and how to use this resource to learn many things about yourself and others. And after that, you’ll meet your past self and your future self. Get ready for major surprises with that module. We call that the Self-Reflection Jump. You’ll find that you can look back on your life thus far, and the glimpse that you will get will be an astounding resource in your life forevermore. The healing jump is one that everyone will find useful at one time or another in their lives, different from any other, and yet similar to many, because for this one, we go back to the person who really began the New Age philosophy. The man who coined the phrase, better and better, and who healed many thousands of people during his sojourn on earth. A man’s name, Emile Couet. But Couet lived and practiced in the late 19th and early 20th century. Are his methods, you might ask, still applicable to our modern world? Well, you be the judge, especially as we have updated and utilized much new material in the healing jump, even to using this powerful resource to help others. And then there’s a reverse jump. In our infinite universe, there is a you, a doppelganger self, who wants to talk to you. You’re the doppelganger in the reverse jump, and so during that jump, get ready to help your counterpart. You have information, and you have energies that your counterpart doesn’t have, and you get lots of benefits after helping your twin self. The Midas jump will be quite interesting if you are still looking for that sometimes elusive money consciousness. Only one person can turn you into a money magnet, and that person is you yourself. You may have heard that if you give a person with a poverty consciousness a million dollars a year later, that person won’t have any of it left. Whereas if you take a million dollars away from a person with prosperity consciousness, a year later they’ll have it all back. Well, you know something? That’s right. That’s so. But what exactly is a poverty consciousness? Your Midas Doppelganger knows, for him or her, making money is like taking candy from a baby. The Midas jump is designed for you to attract affluence and money instead of scarcity and hardship. It takes a bit of work on your part, but how hard did you work to get to where you are? The Midas quantum energy source is what creates that prosperity consciousness. Quite possibly the one thing that affects everyone at one time or another, both on the physical and mental, are the cells that make up each individual. We see each cell on the quanta level as a tiny generating plant that charges and stimulates every organ of the body. With a cellular jump, this is taken into consideration. Our goal is that of recharging the cell for youthful exuberance and good health. If all that seems too ambitious, Just buckle up and get ready because starting with the next module, you’re going on the ride of your life. And may you never be the same again. A positive ride. In the next modules, you’ll learn our four levels of meditation. So find yourself a comfortable place where you’ll be undisturbed for, oh, 10 minutes or so. Relax and allow yourself to get to that comfortable jumping off place that we call quantum meditation. You won’t be jumping into a parallel yet. Just getting your mind relaxed, your immune system strengthened, and you’ll be letting all that stress in your life disappear. So just concentrate on my words and occasionally the light musical background. Before each of the meditation levels, I will explain the exact method that we will be using to get there. There’ll be a short introduction with a story or two about how other people have used the meditation. And on the following module, then will come the meditation. But first, following this module, a description of the four levels of meditation.

--------------------
Audio 2: Identifying the 4 Levels of Quantum Jumping
--------------------

Module 2. Identifying the four levels of quantum jumping. Like any skill, quantum jumping should be honed and sharpened. As you get closer to mastering the material, you’ll find that there are four basic levels to quantum jumping. First, there is the basic jumper. Then there’s the novice jumper. Third, the master jumper. And the fourth stage is the quantum jumper. There is a fifth stage, that of master quantum jumper, but no one I know of has reached that particular state as yet. The master quantum jumper can hallucinate a scene, jump into it while fully aware, and going about their regular business, act in their jump. Sort of doing two things at once. Kind of like combing your hair and thinking about a mathematics solution. or a lucid dream where you can control the events. You might say the master quantum jumper is everyone’s eventual goal. Now, along with the four levels of jumping, there are also four levels of meditation. Meditation is the jumping -off place, so to speak. And the deeper the relaxation, the more concentrative the meditator, the more successful the jump. Here are the distinctions to quantum jumping. One, the basic jumper. The basic jumper basically reads about and gets used to the idea that maybe there’s something to this quantum jumping. The basic jumper thinks that it may be psychological or some exotic metaphysical technique that makes it work. But whatever it is, the basic jumper is going to try it a few times. The basic jumper may not quite… quite get the picture as strongly as, let’s say, the second distinction, the novice jumper. The novice jumper has done the meditation exercise at least three or four times and has taken a simple jump into a twin self and has received vague information that leads the novice to believe that maybe there’s something to this quantum jumping business. And then three. A master jumper starts the day with a jump into a parallel where a twin self has already completed the day and goes over the things that were done to make it a success. The master jumper uses jumping to set goals for the week, the month, and the year. And four, the quantum jumper. The quantum jumper has experienced successes with creativity, success, relationships, and life in general. The quantum jumper uses jumping all the time. When a situation comes up, the quantum jumper will consider the twin self in a similar circumstance and go over the situation, considering all the consequences before making any decisions. I’m going to advise you to stick with basic jumping for a week or so. Do it at least seven times during that period. You may get a good result the first time. Many do, but don’t be concerned if you don’t. It’s not unusual. It’s primarily the way that you accept the premise of quantum jumping and how deeply you meditate. In the beginning, a light state of meditation will take you to the jumping -off place. Then as you progress and go deeper, it gets easier. Just think. Think this. What if? What if? What if there were an infinity of universes and dimensions, as many physicists believe? What if in one of those universes there was a duplicate you, a you exactly the same, except that you made different choices and you got to a different spot? I once did a class in the town of Kona on the big island of Hawaii. Bob Gilchrist was one of the participants. Bob told me that he’d been through silver, went through a few trainings with Tony Robbins and a few others, but still hadn’t found what he was looking for. Well, quantum jumping was new to him, and as he had been through the Robert Monroe seminar, he was familiar with out -of -body experiences, and he asked if that was the premise of quantum jumping. Well, Bob took to quantum jumping like the proverbial fish takes to water. He saw a connection between jumping and out -of -body experiences that he had experienced. Bob wanted to get right into being a quantum jumper. He felt he could skip over the basic novice and master jumper stages and get right to being a quantum jumper as he did out -of -body work for some time, and he had had many successes. Quantum jumping was perfect for him, as with the OBEs, the out -of -body experiences, he saw himself from kind of a fly -on -the -wall perspective. Sitting on his couch, he saw himself humble. on the wall looking at his body. Many times he felt as though he were floating out and away from his body. But there were no gains. There were no real gains for him there. He couldn’t use that. There was no benefit there. But now with quantum jumping, he could actually get some benefit out of his OBEs, his out -of -body experiences. Deep into meditation he went. Lower brainwaves took him to a deep alpha state. He was hoping for theta, but as he had no mechanism such as an EEG to measure his brain, his brain waves, he just assumed he was there. He reported seeing the door quite clearly as he went deeper into the relaxed meditative state, deeper than he’d ever been. Opening the door, he imagined himself just floating past the threshold into a parallel universe where his twin self was an inventor. and had come up with a new method of getting energy from the currents of the ocean. It was apparently a series of vanes, similar to a windmill that was attached to a platform like those oil platforms in different parts of the oceans. The current, running steady, turns the vanes and generates electricity, which is stored in the platform and transferred to ships and then to cities. He imagined himself getting all this information, which was quite enterprising because the success of this particular venture would literally change the world and the domination of the oil markets. Well, Bob is currently working on the idea. He’s quit all other things to concentrate on this vision he got from his doppelganger. Now, not everyone gets anything quite so grandiose out of a jump, but even a jump that was reported by Millie Lester can be exciting. Millie didn’t know what she should prepare for dinner on Sunday for her family. Being a basic jumper, having only jumped once before, she thought she’d see what her counterpart had for dinner. And so she went to a twin self who’d already had Sunday dinner to see what she had prepared. Millie went to a light meditation and then threw the door, not knowing what to expect, but she saw her twin self preparing for bed. She asked what she had had for dinner. and thought she heard her twin self say a great salad with lettuce, olives, cherry tomatoes cut in half, anchovies, and basil leaves. Well, Millie thought that wasn’t exactly a mind -blowing experience, but it did give her an idea for dinner. Now she had a goal. And before you knew it, her family was sitting down to dinner that featured a large salad with anchovies, lettuce, basil, olives, and cherry tomatoes neatly sliced in half. To give the salad… little more body, Millie put slices of seared tuna on top of it. She actually wrote me of her first success and asked, did all that really come from a twin self in a parallel universe? Or, she said, did I just daydream it? And my answer was, what’s the difference? The idea is to get something that’s helpful to you. And whether that information is earth -shattering or just a simple idea for a salad, it is information. Once you get used to the fact that you can get that information inspirationally, you get better and better information to help you make better choices and attract more and more positive experiences. On the next module is the basic meditation designed to take you to that hallway and door that we call the jumping off place to get to your twin self. So find a relaxed place where you’ll be undisturbed for a few minutes and we will begin with the basic jump meditation.

--------------------
Meditation: The Basic Jump Meditation
--------------------

Module 3. The Basic Jump Meditation. Find a relaxed place where you’ll be undisturbed for 10 minutes or so and we will begin. Make yourself comfortable and of course do not play this or any other meditation in a moving vehicle. Close your eyes. Take a deep breath. While exhaling, mentally repeat and visualize the number 3 three times. Take another deep breath. And while exhaling, mentally repeat and visualize the number two three times. Take another deep breath. And while exhaling, mentally repeat and visualize the number one three times. You are now at a deeper, healthier level of mind. To reach a deeper, healthier level of mind at any time, just take an occasional deep breath. Relax. You are now at a deeper, healthier level of mind. You are now and always in complete control of your state of mind. You can open your eyes. You can be fully alert anytime you wish to be. Every time you enter this relaxed state, you know that you’re getting better and better in every way. Whenever you enter this relaxed state, you’ll mentally say every day in every way, I’m getting better and better. When you say these words, sense yourself improving in all areas of your life. Sense yourself getting better and better. Visualize improvements in your life now as you mentally repeat the words. Every day, in every way, I’m getting better and better. Relax. Relax your eyes. Relax your lips, your jaw. Relax your head, your neck. Relax your chest, your stomach, your back. Relax your body. Relax your arms and hands, your legs and feet. We’re now completely relaxed. Repeat mentally after me. Every day I am improving my image of myself, my self-esteem. I am a unique human being. There’s no one else on earth exactly like me. Every day I grow stronger in the realization that I can. I can think. I can create. I can do. Relax. This is being at a basic level of mind. This is basic meditation. Whenever you wish to relax and take a break from the stress of the outer world, recall what you feel at this moment. Recall how you feel at this moment. How relaxed. How at ease you are. Relax. Repeat mentally, my body rests and refreshes itself when I consciously relax. I’m relaxed now. My body is resting and refreshing itself, and I feel better and better. Visualize a small hallway with a door at one end. I’m going to count from one to three, and on the count of three, the door will appear, and you will be in the hallway. One, two, three. You’re in the hallway. A door has appeared. The door is closed. On the other side of that door are an infinity of places, of times, of events, and of selves of yours. On the other side of that door are parallel universes. Anything that can be imagined is on the other side of that door. At this time, you will just imagine what could be on the other side of that door. Only good things, only positive things. On the other side of the door are uncountable numbers of universes, like sands on all the beaches on Earth. Grains of sands on all the beaches on Earth, like molecules, like endless atoms blown up into universes by incredibly powerful forces. And also on the other side of that door are twin selves of yours who live, they live their own lives. They live out their own lives in their own dimensions on their own planets. Earths, just like our own Earth, but with differences. For now, just be aware that all that exists on the other side of the door. Relax. This meditation is simply to orient you and get you used to the fact that you can create a door that leads to interesting and helpful places. During the next meditation, you will go through the door, but for now it has been only an introduction. This is the basic step. First stage. Meditation. Whenever you wish to relax and take a break from the stress of the outer world, recall what you feel at this moment. Recall how you feel at this moment. How relaxed, how at ease you are. Repeat mentally, my body rests and refreshes itself when I consciously relax. I’m relaxed now. My body is resting and refreshing itself, and I feel better and better. In a moment, I’m going to count from one to three. At that moment, you will open your eyes. You’ll be wide awake, feeling fine and in perfect health, feeling better than before. One, two, coming out slowly now. At the count of three, you will open your eyes. You’ll be wide awake, feeling fine and in perfect health, feeling better than before. Three, eyes open, wide awake, feeling fine, feeling better than before. I recommend that you go to the basic stage of meditation, as you’ve just done, twice a day for 15 minutes each time if you have a health problem or if you work in a stressful environment. Five minutes a day meditating is very good. 15 minutes is even better. To go to your first stage meditation once a day is good. Twice a day is very good. It’s a wonderful feeling to be deeply relaxed. A very healthy state of being. Thank you.

Lesson 31: How to Jump Further

How to Jump Further Beyond the Basic Jump
You have learned how to access the energy and vibrations of infinite dimensions. Can you also transfer energy from other dimensions?

Listen to how Burt used Quantum Jumping to get Stevie Wonder’s backup band out of a fix. He will explain the techniques he used to not only access the energy of other dimensions, but how to transfer it into your current reality.

Audio 1: Beyond the Basic Jump
--------------------

Quantum Jumping CD2, How to Jump Further, Module 4, Beyond the Basic Jump. Now that you’ve experienced the basic meditation, it’s time for the next step. The steps are taken from basic meditation and jumper to the quantum level of jumping. By taking these steps one at a time, you’ll find yourself more prepared for successful outcomes. Each of the meditations takes you deeper and closer to your goal. With a novice meditator, your concentration is fixed on a black velvet screen. You’ll be imagining yourself next to a box filled with white plastic numbers, ten of them. You’ll visualize as best you can yourself taking the numbers in order from ten to one, placing them on the black velvet screen. Person number ten, then the number nine, and so on, until all the numbers are on the screen. This takes you to a deeper, a more concentrative level of mind where you’ll be more successful in your jump to visit your twin self. During this jump, it’s not important to get any earth-shattering information. Just imagine that your doppelganger, your twin self, is there to greet you. As there are an infinite number of universes, pick one where your twin self knows that you’re coming, and will greet you with respect. These modules are to lead you, step by step, to that area of mind where you’ll be most successful in your quantum jumping. I like to tell a story of Stevie Wonder’s backup band. They all came to a seminar of mine in the San Fernando Valley. We had finished about 7 in the evening, and everyone in the class left the hotel. I stayed behind to help my people pack up equipment and to just relax. After a while, the four members of the band came back and one of them was grinning. Looked at me and he said, our car won’t start. I found out why they were grinning when they asked the next question. How about you coming out and starting it with your mind? I’d been training the group in some advanced jumping techniques. The four of them were on the cusp of being masters themselves, but it seemed they needed one more proof that this was not just talk on my part. The car battery apparently had died, and they wanted to see if those energies I’d been talking about could be brought over from another dimension to this one to reactivate the battery. Well, during the seminar, I had used the energy to start a few old watches that hadn’t worked for years, but they thought that could have been coincidental. Ah, well, was my thought. Why not? I’ll give it a shot. I have to admit, I didn’t have a whole lot of confidence in my mind starting their battery. But why not? What have I got to lose? Worst that could happen is nothing will happen. So getting into the car, I turned the key. Nothing. Pressed on the horn. Didn’t even make a bleep. Looked at the lights. Nothing. Lights wouldn’t go on. The battery was a goner. Well, they surrounded the car all grinning like a bunch of Cheshire cats. I closed my eyes and went into a deep meditative state. Imagining myself in front of the doorway, I said mentally, I want to go to the universe where my twin self has the information I need to start this car. And I visualized myself opening the door and jumping over the threshold into I knew not where. I suddenly had the impression of a twin me telling me to bring over a generator and to charge the battery. It wasn’t a clear impression. It was just kind of a feeling. I imagined the generator. What did I imagine? I don’t know what a generator looks like. I just imagined a big piece of equipment. And then I imagined the generator attached to the battery of the car I was sitting in. In my mind, I heard the generator buzzing and imagined the battery charged with energy. I was just playing, actually, kind of daydreaming. And all that took about three or four minutes. The four of them just stood around waiting. Well, I opened up my eyes, and I reached for the key again. I turned it. There’s a vroom! And I stepped on the gas and gunned the engine. The four guys just shook their heads in wonder. One of them laughed. I must admit, the most amazed person there was me. Later on in this series, I’ll teach you how to bring energy over from a parallel universe to this one, although I just mentioned the exact technique. Not that you’ll have many occasions to start cars with your mind, but the energy can be useful for many things. This will be after you become a quantum jumper. It’ll take a bit of work, but it’ll be worth it. And now for the second lesson in meditating for the jump. Find a comfortable place and I’ll guide you through the novice meditation. This time, you will meet and greet your twin self. Relax, and we’ll begin shortly.

--------------------
Meditation 1: The Eye-Opening Novice Jump Meditation
--------------------

Module 5. The Novice Jump Meditation. To take you into deeper levels of meditation, make yourself comfortable. We’ll start this exercise with the 3 to 1 method. So find a comfortable position, close your eyes, take a deep breath, and while exhaling, mentally repeat and visualize the number 3 three times. Take another deep breath, and while exhaling, mentally repeat and visualize the number two three times. Take another deep breath, and while exhaling, mentally repeat and visualize the number one three times. You are now at a deeper, healthier level of mind. To reach deep, healthy levels of mind at any time, just take an occasional deep breath. To help you to enter a deeper, healthier level of mind, imagine that you’re sitting in front of a black velvet curtain. You’re very comfortable. Alongside your chair is a box with 10 white plastic numbers in it. The numbers are from 1 to 10. When you place one of these numbers upon the black curtain, the number sticks until you remove it. You’re going to take these numbers one by one and put them on the velvet curtain. First, you’ll put the number 10 on the curtain. Then you’ll remove it and replace it with the number 9, and so on until you’ve put up and taken down the entire 10 numbers. First, the number 10. Take your time. You will have plenty of time. Relax. Begin. Relax. If you’ve not yet reached the number one, take away whatever number you have on the curtain and replace it with the number one. Relax. You are now at a deeper, healthier level of mind. You are now and always in complete control of your state of mind. You can open your eyes. You can be fully alert anytime you wish to be. Every time you enter this relaxed state, know that you’re getting better and better in every way. Whenever you enter the relaxed state, you will mentally say, every day, in every way, I’m getting better and better. When you say these words, sense yourself improving in all areas of your life. Sense yourself getting better and better. Visualize improvements in your life as you mentally repeat the words. Every day, in every way, I’m getting better and better. Visualize improvements in some aspect of your life. Relax. Relax your eyes. Relax your lips, your jaw. Relax your head and your neck. Relax your chest, your stomach, your back. Relax your body. Relax your arms and hands. Relax your legs, your feet. You are now completely relaxed. Repeat mentally after me. Each day I improve my image of myself, my self-esteem. I am a unique human being. There’s no one else on earth exactly like me. Every day I grow stronger in the realization that I can. I can think. I can create. I can do. Relax. This is the novice state of meditation, deeper than the basic meditation. Whenever you wish to relax and take a break from the stress of the outer world, recall what you feel at this moment. Recall how you feel at this moment, how relaxed, how at ease you are. Now, with that relaxed feeling, touch your tongue to the roof of your mouth, just for a moment. That’s fine. Now relax. Repeat mentally, my body rests and refreshes itself when I consciously relax. I’m relaxed now. My body is resting and refreshing itself, and I feel better and better. Now visualize a small hallway with a door at one end, the quantum door. I’m going to count from one to three, and at the count of three, the door will appear. One, two, three. The door has appeared. The door is closed. On the other side of that door are an infinity of places, times, events, and twin selves, twin selves of yours, counterparts, doppelgangers. On the other side of that door are parallel universes. Anything that can be imagined is on the other side of the quantum door. On the other side of the door are uncountable numbers of universes like the sands on all the beaches on earth, like molecules, like endless atoms blown up into universes by incredibly powerful forces, and on the other side of the door are twin selves of yours who live out their own lives in their own dimensions on their own planets, earths just like our own earth, but with differences. For now, just be aware that all that exists on the other side of that door is everything, an infinity of existences, experiences, and events. In a moment, that door will open, and on the other side, you may take a quantum jump into a parallel universe, if you wish, a parallel dimension. But before you do, imagine a different you. Imagine now a you that has taken a different path, a different road than you did. Imagine a you who made different choices. Think back on a time when you made a decision that caused a turning point in your life. It might have been something small. It might have been something major. But it was a time in the past when you were confronted by a choice. What if? What if you had chosen differently? On the other side of the door is a you who did make a different choice. In a moment, I will count from one to three. At the count of three, the door will open, and you will be with a twin self, another you who made different choices. For now, simply imagine that you’re meeting with this self. Your twin self may speak or may not. Your twin self may give you advice or may not. This meditation exercise is simply to meet one of those twin selves of yours, and you have vast numbers of them. When the door opens, just greet your twin self and introduce yourself. Imagine that. Visualize that. Create it. Pretend that it’s happening. It may seem like it’s just a daydream, but it’s a daydream that you are in control of. At the count of three, the door will open and you will step through. One, two, three. The door is open. Step through and greet your twin self. Take your time. Relax. That’s fine. In the next meditation exercise, your twin self will help you, help you to set and to get your goals. In a moment, I’m going to count from one to three. At that moment, you’ll open your eyes. You’ll be wide awake, feeling fine and in perfect health, feeling better than before. One, two, coming out slowly now. At the count to three, you’ll open your eyes. You’ll be wide awake, feeling fine, and in perfect health, feeling better than before. Three, eyes open, wide awake, feeling fine, feeling better than before. I recommend that you go to the basic stage of meditation twice a day if you have a health problem or if you work in a stressful environment. To go to your first stage meditation once a day is very good, but twice a day is even better. It’s a wonderful feeling when you’re deeply relaxed. It’s a very healthy state of being. Thank you.

Audio 2:Going Deeper With the Master Jump
--------------------

Module 6, going deeper with the master jump. Reaching the master jumper level, you’ll start your day with a jump into a parallel where a twin self has already completed the same day, and that self will be going over the things that you did that day. This accomplishes two things. One, it gets you more into the master mode of quantum jumping, and two, you will find yourself expecting things that happen during the day. By doing that, whether the outcome is as you have foreseen through your twin self or different, you’ll find a new energy for every day. As you progress, you’ll find that by getting with your twin self and going over the day, you’ll stimulate clairvoyance and intuition. After using this mode on a daily basis for a while, you’ll begin to control your day to the point where your confidence and self-esteem will grow, and you’ll find yourself attracting the things you want to happen. The master jumper uses jumping to a twin self to set goals for the day, for the week, and for the month. Joe Garcia is a painter, a house painter, who worked in construction painting, painting new homes for a major builder in the Bay Area of California. And then the recession hit in the United States, and in 2007 he found fewer and fewer jobs. He left the union after three months of no work, and a bit depressed, he sat around the house imitating a couch potato. Having been through an earlier class of mine, he was aware of the procedures of jumping. He found them interesting, but he’d never felt the need to do any of the meditations. After sitting around the house, watching television, reading, taking walks around the block, Joe figured one day, what the heck, I may as well try a quantum jump. It can’t hurt. He didn’t even know what he would be jumping for or to. He remembered the master meditation. And one day, alone in the house, he sat quietly and went deep into the alpha level of mind. He imagined the quantum door in front of him. At that point, Joe wondered what he would find when he did make the jump. What could a twin self tell him? If the premise was correct, then he was a doctor, a lawyer, an actor, a judge, and a million other things. But how would that help him? He didn’t want to be any of those things. He was a painter. So where should he go? For him, the jump was a big question mark. But he had nothing better to do. And so he mentally opened the door and he strolled through. He thought for a minute that he’d switched into the daydreaming mode. Because there in front of him, he imagined that he saw a man sitting on a swing, like a child’s swing. There were two of them, and the man, who turned out to be Joe’s twin self, motioned to the other swing alongside. They sat that way for a moment, and Joe reported that they didn’t speak, just slowly kind of swung a few feet forward and a few feet back. He just let the daydream take place, and after a bit, he thought he heard his twin self say, paint a wall free. Now, that didn’t make any sense. But he was deep into the meditation, and he asked his twin self, what do you mean free? That was it. There was nothing more. Joe stayed in the meditation, swinging, having his pleasant daydream for a few more minutes. And then he came up from his alpha level to mull over the words of his doppelganger. Paint a wall free. What in the world did that mean? Well, with that in the back of his mind, he went to the newspaper, and he looked through the services directory of the Help Wanted ads. And he saw there were 10 ads from painters who were offering their services. Lots of them were out of work as well. He decided to put his own ad in, and suddenly the thought came to him. He got out a pencil and a piece of paper, and he wrote a headline, I will paint your wall free. And under it, he put the body of the ad. Painter with many years of experience will paint one wall of your room free of charge. If you like my work, I’ll paint the rest of the walls for a modest price. If you don’t, you’ve got a wall painted free. Well, Joe told me he didn’t know how many calls the other painters got, but he had so many calls that he eventually had to hire two other painters to help him with the work. To get those other painters, he went into a master meditation once again, and this time with the intention of seeing a twin self who was a good goal setter. He did, and he started setting all kinds of goals for himself. He set a goal to have three painters working for him steady, and that was for three months from the time he started. After that, he set yearly goals with his twin self. Well, needless to say, Joe no longer relied on an employer for work. He was no longer an employee. He was the employer now. He was stimulated and motivated by his counterparts. I’ve heard a lot of similar stories from graduates of the seminars I’ve presented over the years. Occasionally, someone will ask if they’re really going into a parallel universe, and are they really talking to a twin self? My answer is always the same. What’s the difference? If it works, it works. When it works, it works. If it’s working, don’t fix it. Quantum jumping stimulates, invigorates, energizes, and motivates. And that’s where the power is. The next module will direct you to a master meditation, deeper than the novice meditation and a whole lot deeper than the basic meditation. This time, you’ll be guided to a twin self who’s already been successful with what you want to be a success with. So then, before you do the next meditation, what is it that you want to be successful doing? If nothing comes to mind at the present, then go to your twin self who’s already completed doing whatever you will be doing that day and allow your twin self to tell you about the things you did or will do that day. For now, find a quiet place where you’ll be alone for, oh, 10 minutes or so, and I will help you to go and guide you through a master meditation. Relax. You may begin with the next module anytime you wish.

--------------------
Meditation 2: The Master Jump Meditation
--------------------

Module 7, the Master Jump Meditation. Well then, make yourself comfortable. And this is not to be played, of course, in a moving vehicle. We’ll start this exercise with a 3 to 1 count once again. So find a comfortable position, close your eyes, take a deep breath. And while exhaling, mentally repeat and visualize the number 3, 3 times. And take another deep breath. And while exhaling, mentally repeat and visualize the number two three times. Take another deep breath. And while exhaling, mentally repeat and visualize the number one three times. Relax. You are now at a deeper, healthier level of mind. To reach a deeper, healthier level of mind at any time, just take an occasional deep breath. For now, to help you to enter a deeper, healthier level of mind, imagine that you’re sitting in front of a black velvet curtain. You’re very comfortable. Alongside your chair is a box with 10 white plastic numbers in it. The numbers are from 10 to 1. When you place one of these numbers on the black velvet curtain, the number sticks until you remove it. You’re going to take these numbers one by one and put them on the velvet curtain. First, you’ll put the number 10 on the curtain and then you’ll remove it and replace it with the number 9 and so on until you’ve put up and taken down the entire 10 numbers. First, the number 10. Take your time, relax, and begin. Relax. If you’ve not yet reached the number one, take away whatever number you have on the curtain and replace it with the number one. Fine. You are now at a deeper, healthier level of mind. You are now and always in control of your state of mind. You can open your eyes. You can be fully alert anytime you wish to be. Every time you enter this relaxed state, you know that you’re getting better and better in every way. Whenever you enter this relaxed state, you’ll mentally say, every day, in every way, I’m getting better and better. And when you say these words, sense yourself improving in all areas of your life. Sense yourself getting better and better. At this time, visualize improvements in your life as you mentally repeat those words. Every day, in every way, I’m getting better and better, and visualize improvements in some aspect of your life. Relax. Relax your eyes. Relax your lips, your jaw. Relax your head and neck. Relax your chest, your stomach, your back. Relax your body. Relax your arms and hands, your legs, your feet. You’re now completely relaxed. Repeat mentally after me. Every day I improve my image of myself, my self-esteem. I am a unique human being. There’s no one else on earth exactly like me. Every day I grow stronger in the realization that I can. I can think. I can create. I can do. Relax. This is the master stage of meditation, deeper than the basic novice and much deeper than the basic. Whenever you wish to relax and take a break from the stress of the outer world, recall what you feel at this moment. Recall how you feel at this moment, how relaxed, how at ease you are. Relax. Repeat mentally, my body rests and refreshes itself when I consciously relax. I’m relaxed now. Imagine now that a great light is beginning to engulf you. Suddenly you are surrounded by a bright fog-like light, a brilliant bright white fog. Imagine that this fog, this light, permeates everything. You are surrounded by this bright white light. Allow the light to enfold you. Concentrate on the light, the bright white light. You are now in the center of a vortex of light, a great fog of light. It is almost as though you are floating in the center of a cloud, a bright white cloud that is brightened by the sunlight. Relax. Now visualize a small hallway with a door at one end. I’m going to count from one to three, and you will leave the light. And at that count of three, you will project yourself into the hallway, and a door will appear in front of you. One, two, three. A door has appeared. The door is closed. It’s the quantum door. On the other side of that door are an infinity of places and times, events, and other selves, twin selves of yours. On the other side of that door are parallel universes. Anything that can be imagined is on the other side of that door. On the other side of that door are uncountable numbers of universes, like sands on all the beaches on Earth, like molecules, like endless atoms blown up into universes by incredibly powerful forces. And on the other side of that door are twin selves of yours who live out their own lives in their own dimensions on their own planets, Earths, just like our own Earth, but with differences. For now, just be aware that all that exists is on the other side of that door. In a moment, the door will open and on the other side, you may take a quantum jump into a parallel universe, a parallel dimension. In a moment, I’m going to count from one to three and at the count of three, the door will open and you will be with a twin self, another you, a doppelganger, your counterpart who will advise you on the problem that you are presenting. When the door opens, just greet your twin self and introduce yourself. Imagine that. Just visualize it. Create it. It may seem as though it’s just kind of a daydream, but it’s a daydream that you are in control of. At the count of three, the door will open, and then you will step through. One, two, three. The door is open. Step through and greet your twin self. Take your time. If you have a problem, now is the time to ask your twin self for advice. Your twin self has already gone through the day that you’re going through. Allow your twin self to tell you of the day that your twin self had. You may use your twin self’s day as a blueprint for your own. Was there anything done or said that you wish you hadn’t done or said? Will there be any consequences to anything that you’ve said or done? Now is the time to go over that material to bring it out into the open so that you will not repeat it at another time. It’s good to go over your day with your twin self, especially so when you do it in the morning. It will be your morning but your twin self’s evening as the twin self has already finished the day. At this time, go over your entire day, even if you have not yet completed the day. What will you be doing? What will you be saying? What would you like to be doing? What would you like to be saying? Imagine all the things that you’ll be doing this day. Relax. In a moment, I’m going to count from one to three. At that moment, you’ll open your eyes. You’ll be wide awake, feeling fine and in perfect health, feeling better than before. One. Two, coming out slowly now. At the count to three, you’ll open your eyes, be wide awake, feeling fine, and in perfect health, feeling better than before. Three, eyes open, wide awake, feeling wonderfully refreshed, in perfect health, feeling better than before. Thank you.

Audio 1: Using the Quanta for Unbreakable Concentration
--------------------

CD3, The Highest Level of Quantum Jumping, Module 8, Using the Quanta for Unbreakable Concentration. Now we come to the Quantum Meditation and the Quantum Jump. By now, hopefully, you have experienced the basic meditation, which is a light relaxation, a relaxation where you are concentrative on the practice of just letting go of worry and stress. You’ve also gone into a deeper level of concentration and relaxation with the novice meditation that takes you a bit deeper into that stress-free zone. And then you immersed yourself in the master meditation, and that took you still deeper into the meditation state with the bright white light as a helpful resource. Scientifically, we would say that the basic meditation is a light alpha, where your brain waves are resonating to, oh, 11 or 12 vibrations per second. The novice meditation is a lowering into the alpha band, where your brain waves would be resonating to 9 or 10 frequencies per second. And the master meditation would be just at the borderline of the theta frequencies. With the quantum meditation, your brainwave production is in the theta band, or should be, where all outside interference is non-existent so far as you, the meditator, is concerned, and you are totally concentrative on the subject that you’re seeking to experience. There are still lower brainwave frequencies that get into the delta band, but as this is not practical for meditation or any programming, I won’t get into the delta area, except to say that this is the area of very deep sleep and is not useful for our present purposes. Quantum meditation is designed to help you to concentrate solely on the crossing over the threshold of getting information from your counterpart, your twin self, in an alternate dimension or universe, if you will. When you reach the quantum, the deepest meditation, your concentration is at the extreme. Here you have what is virtually a controlled daydream, but it’s more, much more than that. When you reach this concentrated state, this concentrated state of meditation, the door to the parallel universes and your infinity of selves becomes clearer. And when you make your jump, whether it’s a step over the threshold, a floating over the doorway, a stroll through the doorway, or a jumping through, you find clarity and the great resource of your counterpart, your twin self. During the next meditation module, I will help you to program an anchor for the quantum jump, whereby you may use it at any time. You’ll be able to use it while in deep meditation or while walking down the street during an afternoon. At this point, I should tell you how I personally use quantum jumping. The first time I used the quantum meditation and the quantum jump, I was experimenting. That was many years ago. I believe the year was 1979. At the time, I had just watched the movie The Jolson Story, and I guess I had his voice in my mind. Now, I had never sung before that, nor did I have any desire to, but somehow I wanted to see just where a directed mind could take me. I’d been reading about parallel universes and dimensions and doppelgangers, and the fact that in an infinite universe, there were many other selves, I should say, that we all had. Well, my goal was to go into a deep meditation and see if I could get to one of my selves, the one who could sing. At the time, there was no door I could jump through. That came later, when I was working out the details of quantum jumping. I did use the bhaga, however. Touching the tongue to the roof of my mouth while deep in alpha, I had a desire to meet my twin self, who was a professional vocalist. I suddenly found myself kind of daydreaming on a stage, watching a man in a tuxedo in front of an orchestra singing. It was like a daydream. After the song, I walked over to the singer in my mind, and I told him who I was and that I wanted to be a vocalist also. I’ll jump into my body, he said. And I did. I kind of just merged with him. I put his body over mine, or I slipped into his. I don’t even recall what I did. I just felt that I was in his body, though. But it was me. I felt his voice and his motions, and I thought how interesting this daydream was. Because that’s all I thought it was at the time, a daydream. Well, after that, I bought some music, picked out a few tunes on the piano, and I started to sing. My voice amazed me, but I didn’t want any kind of a career, and I just put it down as a successful experiment. Well, just to give you an idea of how my voice sounded at that time. Now, this is, of course, some time ago. I did make a few records. Here’s one that I made of an old time song, You Made Me Love You. Now, remember, I’ve never been a singer and didn’t know how to sing at all, at least I thought I didn’t, until I visited that doppelganger. But let me play you just a few seconds of one of the first songs that I recorded. Well, that’s enough of that. I just wanted you to get an idea that I was just as surprised that I could sing as I was when I became a photographer or an artist or anything else that I’ve done. Because after the singing experiment so many years ago, I used the concept for other things, for setting goals, for new cars, successful seminars. Everything seemed to work. I was explaining the concept to a class in San Diego one day, and somebody said, ah, you probably could always sing. You just never tried. Well, I thought that was logical. Maybe the guy’s right. So I decided to test it again. This time I went into a parallel dimension with a touch of the tongue on the roof of my mouth again. And this time my intention was to be a photographer because I knew nothing about photography. Deep into level alpha once again, and here comes the daydream. And I hopped into a twin photographer’s self. This time, I imagined I saw a man stooped over an old-fashioned camera with one of those black velvet things over his head, as they used to have many, many years ago. My twin self, well, I didn’t know. I thought I heard the words, take a lot of pictures. Well, that was it. And so I went out and took a lot of pictures with a camera that I got. And when I got through, I had a lot of pictures, nothing unusual. I went back into the deep meditation, and I complained to my doppelganger, who then said, at least I thought he said, I heard two words from him, plant yourself. Well, that made no sense at all. Anyway, I went to a marina in San Diego, and I was standing on some rocks to get a good view, a bit slippery. And so I put my feet down heavily. I just slammed them down as though I was planting myself. Maybe that’s what he meant, I thought. And so I stood in the one spot and took a lot of pictures. I put them together like a jigsaw puzzle, and just like that, I had a new profession, a photographer. What in the world is going on, I thought. I knew there was something there, something great, but inexplicable at the same time. Years passed, and I started to teach the method all over the world. Personally, I used the quantum jumping through the door all the time. Every night I jumped into a parallel to go over my day and see what the next day would bring. And if I did anything wrong that day, if I felt I could have done something better, I focused on that because I wasn’t going to make that mistake again. If I said anything to anybody that I wish I hadn’t said, I wasn’t going to do that again. In the morning, I would visit a twin self who’d already finished the day to see how I could be better. I even jumped into a parallel at a restaurant one day when I couldn’t decide what to order. Others who have learned the method use it in all kinds of ways. Now, what do I mean by that with the business of the restaurant? Well, I was sitting at a table with some friends, couldn’t decide what to order, and I kind of defocused my eyes. I didn’t want to close my eyes and go into a meditation. I’m sitting at a table with some friends in a restaurant. But I kind of daydreamed. I was with my doppelganger, and I imagined him picking out a dish. And I let him pick it out, and that’s what I had. It was a small thing, but it was a choice. And so I started to use the doppelganger all the time. Whenever there is a choice, many people, many of the graduates of quantum jumping, will go to a future self and see how the choice turned out. Well, at any rate, getting back to this photography business and the singing, more years passed because this was some time ago. And then in 2005, I was 78 years old. I decided to take a major jump once again to see if I could become an artist, mainly because I was more and more excited about the concept. And I knew I couldn’t paint. Maybe I was a photographer. Maybe I could always sing. But I knew I couldn’t paint. For me to draw a person’s face, it would be like a stick figure, like a five-year-old. That’s my skill at painting. So I was pretty skeptical in spite of all my successes and in spite of the successes of other people who had reported them. I wondered, is it truly stepping into an alternate universe, a parallel, or is it just psychological? Or perhaps it was something else. Maybe it was metaphysical, coincidental, an uncovering of long buried talents or something else. The one thing I went by was that it did work. Not every time. I don’t know of anything that works every time. But it works enough of the time to make me believe that there was something there. And then came the art of painting. I knew I wasn’t an artist, as I’ve said. And when suddenly I was turning out work after work of art, well, that was the final proof to me. Something is going on. It was then that I decided everyone should know about this quantum jumping business. And so here I am offering it to you. Now, I don’t know what hidden talents you may have. Quite frankly, neither do you. But here’s your chance to find out. The following module will hopefully take you to the deepest meditation of all, quantum meditation. From there, you jump, or walk if you want, or float, doesn’t matter, over the doorway into a parallel universe and meet with the twin self of your choice, a self who may well help you with your heart’s desire. Good luck, good programming, and good jumping.

Meditation 1: Visiting the Other Side – The Quantum Jump Meditation
--------------------

Module 9, Visiting the Other Side, the Quantum Jump Meditation. So, make yourself comfortable, and we’ll start this exercise with the 3 to 1 count. So, find a comfortable position, close your eyes, take a deep breath, and while exhaling, mentally repeat and visualize the number 3 three times. Take another deep breath, and while exhaling, mentally repeat and visualize the number two three times. Take another deep breath. While exhaling, mentally repeat and visualize the number one three times. You are now at a deeper, healthier level of mind. To reach a deeper, healthier level of mind at any time, just take an occasional deep breath and relax. Relax your eyes. Relax your lips. Relax your jaw. Relax your head and your neck. Relax your chest, your stomach, and your back. Relax your body. Relax your arms and hands, your legs and feet. You are now completely relaxed. Imagine that you’re in an elevator. You’re on the top floor. Now the elevator is going down from the 30th floor all the way down past the 20th, the 10th floor. Now it’s on the ground floor. Now the elevator is in the basement. The elevator has gone deep within the building just as you are going deep within yourself. Totally relaxed. Relax. Relax your body. This is the deepest state of meditation for you, the master stage of meditation, deeper than the basic, deeper than the novice, and deeper than you’ve been before. Just imagine it. Know that you are at a deep state of meditation and relaxation. Whenever you wish to relax and take a break from the stress of the outer world, recall what you feel at this moment. Recall how you feel at this moment, how relaxed, how at ease you are. Repeat mentally, my body rests and refreshes itself when I consciously relax. I’m relaxed now. Imagine that a great light is unfolding you, engulfing you, surrounding you. Imagine that you’re surrounded by a bright fog, a brilliant bright white fog. Imagine that this light permeates everything. You are surrounded by this bright white light. Allow the light to unfold you. Concentrate on the light that surrounds you. The light is above you, below you, and all around you. Concentrate on the light, the bright white light. Imagine now that you’re in the center of a vortex of light, a great fog of light. It almost feels as though you’re floating in the center of a cloud, a bright white cloud that is brightened by the sunlight. Relax. And now imagine that you’re standing at the top of a stairway. There are 15 steps leading to a small hallway. At the end of the hallway is a large door, the quantum door. The door is closed. On the other side of that door is a parallel universe, a portion of an infinite universe, where there is a twin self of yours, a self that can help you with those things that you desire. Relax. You’re now going to walk down the steps, one step at a time. You’re at the top step. Now step down to the 14th step, now the 13th, the 12th, 11th, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, and now the bottom step, one. Now walk to the end of the hall facing the large door. The door is quite large, made of carved wood. It has a brass doorknob. This is the quantum door. The door opens outward. Reach out and touch the doorknob and the door will slowly open. The door is opening. The door is open. On the other side of this door, there are an infinity of places, times, events, and twin selves of yours at every age and every occupation. On the other side of that door are parallel universes. Anything that can be imagined is on the other side of that door. On the other side of that door are uncountable numbers of universes like sands on all the beaches on Earth, like quantum molecules, like endless atoms blown up into universes by incredibly powerful forces. And on the other side of that door are twin selves of yours who live out their own lives in their own dimensions on their own planets, Earths just like our own Earth but with differences. For now, just be aware that all that exists is on the other side of the door. In a moment, that door will open, and on the other side, you may take a quantum jump into a parallel universe, a parallel dimension. In a moment, I will count from one to three. At the count of three, the door will open, and you will be with a twin self, another you, who will perhaps advise you on the problem that you are presenting. When the door opens, just greet your twin self and introduce yourself. Imagine that. Visualize that. Create it. It may seem like it’s just a daydream, but it’s a daydream that you are in control of. One, two, three. The door is opening. The door is open. Step through and greet your twin self. Take your time. Just daydream it. Relax. If you have a problem, now is the time to ask your twin self for advice. Whenever a situation comes up that you want advice about, advice that may well be deep within your own subconscious, go to the twin self that has already resolved whatever that problem might be. Or if you wish to uncover any hidden talent you might have, use quantum meditation and the quantum jump as you are doing now to get information from your twin self. At this time, see if your twin self can offer any useful information for you to act on. Take your time. Begin. Relax. Now it’s time to come back to this reality. I’ll count from one to three. You’ll be back in the hallway. The door will close. One, two, three. Back in the hallway, the quantum door is closed. Now, time to come back. In a moment, I’m going to count from one to three. At that time, you will open your eyes. You’ll be wide awake, feeling fine and in perfect health, feeling better than before. One, two, coming out slowly now. At the count of three, you’ll open your eyes. You’ll be wide awake, feeling fine and in perfect health, feeling better than before. Three, eyes open, wide awake, feeling fine, in perfect health, feeling better than before. Thank you.

Audio 2: How to Create Insignificant Events (Ies) & Manifest Your Goals
--------------------

Module 10, how to create insignificant events and manifest your goals. Okay, you have now experienced the four meditations. You may use any of the four at any time, but for the first time, do use the basic meditation, even if you’re comfortable with the others. Start with the basic. When you do the meditations by yourself, choose whichever you fancy at that particular time. Sometimes you’ll want to go really deep and sometimes just a light meditation. This time for the meditation, I’m going to use a deeper meditation because we’re going to set an insignificant event with a twin self for the manifestation of one of your goals. As I mentioned in the first module, a source foundation is an insignificant event that leads to a major effect. There are many insignificant events that take place with the passing of every day of your life, every minute of your life. Most of them are overlooked. I used to tell a story during the seminars on this particular subject. I love this particular story. It’s metaphorical, of course. It was a story of a leaf that changed the world. It went like this. Now, I’m talking about an insignificant event having a major effect, of course. One sunny day in Yorba Linda, a small suburb just south of Los Angeles, in California, of course, there’s a park. On this particular day, a caterpillar was inching along the ground when it came to a leaf. Now, it couldn’t climb the leaf because the leaf fell over with the weight of the caterpillar. And so the caterpillar turned away from the leaf and crawled up a bench that was in the park. The bench was for people to sit on and to rest for a while. Just as the caterpillar reached the seat of the bench, a man came and sat down. Squish! He had seated himself on the caterpillar and squashed it. Reaching down to the back of his pants, he felt the residue of the caterpillar. Yuck! He went home to change his pants and then took them to the local cleaners. While there, he met a young lady, and they started to talk. Finding that they had much in common, they went out for lunch and soon started to go steady. They dated, married, and had a child. The child was very bright and breezed through school. He then went on to university and law school, then into politics. End result is that because a caterpillar bumped into a leaf, Richard Nixon became President of the United States. Now that was a source foundation. The insignificant event was the leaf. As far-fetched as that story seems, it isn’t. Something in Mr. Nixon’s past was as insignificant as that leaf. There are many things of that nature in your past as well. Because of their insignificance, it’s difficult to think of any of them. And so in the meditation that follows this module, you’re going to create one. You’re going to create an insignificant event. The next module is a quantum jump meditation about creating a new source foundation. That’s the insignificant event, to manifest a goal that you want to happen at some future time. Because we can’t follow every insignificant event to its conclusion, we use the quantum jump to set our own conscious events. A conscious event is insignificant, but as it is consciously laid down as a programming device, it’s designed to have a significant effect. A few years ago, tens of thousands of people who were trying to sell their homes buried a statue of St. Joseph on their front lawn with St. Joseph facing the street. Some people buried the statue upside down. Now, that was a conscious source foundation. The burying of the statue was an insignificant thing. It was an insignificant event. Now, does that sound silly? Superstitious? Maybe. But then again, a lot of houses were sold, believe it or not. Even today, if you search the internet for St. Joseph sells houses, you’ll get a ton of information about how so many people were successful in selling their homes after burying the statue. People who buried the statue of St. Joseph were setting a conscious event, a conscious, insignificant event. Nonsense? Probably. But what if it isn’t? What if there is some universal energy at work that we know very little or nothing about? I believe it exists, and I’m not talking about the St. Joseph statue now. I’m talking about any icon of a similar nature. I believe not only that it exists, but I believe it can be useful. Now, is that bad? It just is. Energy just is. Energy itself is neither good nor bad. It only becomes as it relates to you. You can use energy for good things and for bad things. An example would be a rainstorm. The rain is good for the farmer, good for replenishing the city’s water supply, but bad for the person drowning in a torrent of a river that’s caused by the rain. Fire is good when it cooks your food and heats your home, but very bad when it burns down your house. Fire and rain, like all things, are neither good nor bad. They just are. They become as they affect you. Now, this is the energy that we bring back from a parallel universe. The energy is universal. Therefore, it’s there with your twin self as well. The difference being your twin self has already used the energy available and succeeded. How do I know he succeeded or she succeeded? Because that’s the universe you’re going to. That’s your intention. That energy is what you want to bring back to this dimension, this universe, for your success. In your life, as I’ve said time and again, there are many insignificant things that caused great effects. What are some of those things in your own life? Think now, as you listen to me, about any little thing that happened when you were younger, things that ultimately proved to have detrimental effects. It might be something that happened between you and your parents, or your brother and sister, or cousin, or any other relative. It may be something that took place between you and one of your teachers, or priest, minister, pastor, imam, or rabbi, or maybe something that you did or said or didn’t do or say. It may be something that took place that you’re not proud of, or something that you feared. Whatever it is, you’ll find happening right now in a parallel universe. It’ll be taking place between your twin self and another, as it did for you. But this time, you can intervene. You can learn from it, and you can be helped by it. Those events are the ones that control you. Those are the ones that create unhappiness, fear, anger, resentment, failure, negative images, self-sabotage, and a host of negative things. Things are different now. Instead of being controlled by outer forces that you know nothing about, it’s your turn to be in control. It’s time to set your own conscious events, insignificant when instigated, but having far-reaching beneficial results. For this quantum jumping meditation exercise, we’re going to use the basic jump to go to your twin self to set the event, or rather, you will use the basic jump to go to a twin self who has already set the event. Think now about going to a parallel universe, a parallel dimension, as some would call it, to visit a twin self of yours. But it will be a twin self of many years ago. Remember that in an infinite world, there’s no time, as all conceivable times are happening right now. All conceivable times are available. You can go to a twin self of any age. I’ll guide you through the meditation. Remember, please, when you visit a twin self, it may seem like a daydream, like something that you’re making up as you go along. And that’s fine. But each thought you have contains an energy. This energy can be like a will-o’-the-wisp, like a cloud that’s dissipated by a breeze. Or it can be an energy that runs a locomotive or a jet plane. It all depends on you. Just by creating the scene, you will generate, you will build this energy. How strong the energy will be is solely dependent on the belief that you have in the quantum jumping technique. Just go along with it and act as if you are going through the situation that comes up during the meditation. I suggest creating your insignificant event. Just imagine yourself creating some event. What kind of an event? Recall the words, insignificant event. Insignificant could be anything. Now, your twin self will first go through the scene, set the insignificant event, and then you will act out the scene in the same way as did your twin self. The more of these events we set, the brighter your life will be and the healthier your body will be. Okay, now here’s how the next module goes. This one, you can play it often. As a matter of fact, I recommend that you play one of the meditation modules every day until you begin to use the resources whenever choices come up, whenever they present themselves. After a while, you won’t even have to jump to your twin self. You’ll just draw the right information and right energy to you automatically. That’s because the energy buildup is cumulative. It builds. I was working on a painting the other day, and after trying a few different colors for a background and sky, I grew a bit frustrated, and I gave up. I was just sitting and staring at the canvas when a thought came in from nowhere. It’s a famous story about Robert the Bruce, who, when forging his empire, was beaten back six times in a row. Finally, he gave up. Sitting dejectedly in his tent, he saw a spider spinning a web. It swung itself from one strand to another but couldn’t reach it. The spider swung again and again and again. This went on for six swings, missed every time. And then on the seventh try, the spider reached the strand and then proceeded to build the web. Well, Robert the Bruce took heart from the persistence of the spider, and he attacked one more time. And with that drive, he won the battle and went on to become king of Scotland. Why I thought about that story, I don’t know. But going back to the painting, I used still another blend of color. And the result was astonishing. The work is titled St. Patrick’s Street, and you can see it at burtsart.us. Where that story of Robert, King of Scotland, came from, I don’t know. But I believe it came from a doppelganger who can contact me just as easily as I can contact him. When you’ve done quantum jumping for a while, a door is opened, and it swings both ways. And as I’ve mentioned before, the entire concept of my art is due entirely to a quantum jump I personally made some years ago. Some may call that intuition. But I believe that intuition is an energy that can be strengthened. And one way to do it is to utilize the quantum jumping concepts. Point being, after you use the concept of reaching into another dimension, many things come to you spontaneously. I recommend that you do the meditations, go into different twin selves, a variety of selves. Keep at it, and eventually you will come out ahead. And now for the insignificant event meditation. During the following module, you’ll be setting an IE, IE of course being insignificant event. Of course, before you create this event, you must have something in mind that will be the ultimate result of your IE. Intent is vital. Just listen to the module after finding yourself a relaxed place where you’ll be undisturbed for 15 minutes or so. And of course, you don’t want to play any of the meditations in a moving vehicle. So just listen to the module and I will guide you through until you yourself have to take over. Because I’m not going to create this insignificant event for you. You must do it. Do it again, and you can do it once again at other times. Okay, we’ll now begin. So just relax, and here comes the next module.

--------------------
Meditation 2: The Insignificant Event Meditation
--------------------

Module 11, the Insignificant Event Meditation. Make yourself comfortable. We’ll start this meditation by my counting backwards from three to one. So find a comfortable position. Close your eyes. Take a deep breath. And while exhaling, mentally repeat and visualize the number three, three times. Take another deep breath. And while exhaling, mentally repeat and visualize the number two three times. Take another deep breath. And while exhaling, mentally repeat and visualize the number one three times. You are now at a deeper, healthier level of mind. To reach a deeper, healthier level of mind at any time, just take an occasional deep breath. To help you to enter a deeper, healthier level of mind, imagine that you’re sitting in front of a black velvet curtain. You’re very comfortable. Alongside your chair is a box with 10 white plastic numbers in it. The numbers are from 1 to 10. When you place one of these numbers on the black velvet curtain, the number sticks until you remove it. You’re going to take these numbers one by one and put them on the velvet curtain. First, you’ll put the number 10 on the curtain. Then you’ll remove it and replace it with the number 9 and so on until you’ve put up and taken down the entire series of 10 numbers. First, the number 10. Take your time. Begin. Relax. If you have not yet reached the number 1, take away whatever number you have on the curtain and replace it with the number one and relax. You are now at a deeper, healthier level of mind. You are now and always in complete control of your state of mind. You can open your eyes. You can be fully alert anytime you wish to be. Every time you enter this relaxed state, you know that you’re getting better and better in every way. Whenever you enter this relaxed state, you’ll mentally say, every day, in every way, I’m getting better and better. When you say these words, scent yourself improving in all areas of your life. Scent yourself getting better and better. Relax. Relax your eyes. Relax your lips. Relax your jaw, your head, your neck. Relax your chest, your stomach, your back. Relax your body. Relax your arms and hands. Relax your legs and feet. You are now completely relaxed. Repeat mentally after me. Every day I improve my image of myself, my self-esteem. I am a unique human being. There’s no one else on earth exactly like me. Every day I grow stronger in the realization that I can. I can think. I can create. I can do. Imagine now that a great light is engulfing you. Imagine that you’re surrounded by a bright fog, a brilliant bright white fog. Imagine that this light permeates everything. You are surrounded by this bright white fog-like light. Allow the light to enfold you. Concentrate on the energy of the light, the bright white light. You are now in the center of a vortex, a whirlpool of light, a great fog of light. It almost feels as though you’re floating in the center of a cloud, a bright white cloud that is brightened by the sunlight. Relax. Visualize a small hallway with a door at one end, a quantum door. I’m going to count from one to three, and at the count of three, you’ll project yourself into the hallway, and the door will appear. One, two, three. You’re now in the hallway. Imagine that. Create it. In front of you is a door. The door is closed. On the other side of that door are an infinity of places, times, events, and other selves of yours. On the other side of that door are parallel universes. Anything that can be imagined is on the other side of that door. On the other side of that door are uncountable numbers of universes, like sands on all the beaches of Earth, like molecules, like endless atoms blown up into universes by incredibly powerful forces. And on the other side of that door are twin selves of yours, counterparts, who live out their own lives in their own dimensions on their own planets, Earths, just like our own planet Earth, but with differences. For now, just be aware that all exists on the other side of the door. Consider what it is that your heart desires. What is your heart’s desire? What would you like to happen? What would you like to program for? If you had a wish, what would that wish be? But as we’re going to be setting an insignificant event, make the wish realistic. What would a realistic wish be for you? That wish is going to be your intention, your intent. That is what you will be setting the foundation for in a parallel universe with a twin self. Think now for a moment of the thing that you’re wishing for. In a moment, that door will open, and on the other side, you may jump into a parallel universe, a parallel dimension. In a moment, I will count from one to three. At the count of three, the door will open. You’ll step through, and you’ll be with a twin self, another you, who will be setting a source foundation, an insignificant event to ultimately end with you getting the thing that you are wishing for. I’m going to count from one to three, and at the count of three, the door will open. When the door opens, just walk through, and you will be with your twin self. Create that image. Know that it is happening. Imagine it. Daydream it. During the scene, you may go over to your twin self and talk. Tell your twin self of your heart’s desire, of your wish. Tell your twin self about the thing that you are wishing for. Imagine it. Visualize that. Create it. It may seem like it is just a daydream, but it’s a daydream that you are in control of. At the count of three, the door will open and you’ll step through. One, two, three. The door is opening. The door is open. Step through and greet your twin self. Take your time and now mentally speak to your twin self. Tell your twin self what you’re wishing for and then talk about setting an insignificant event. That event could be you mailing something to a friend or it could be you creating some sort of a doodle or giving some money to a stranger or some money to a family member or friend. That event could be you sending a card to someone. The event could be you sending an email to someone. The event could be anything at all, so long as it is a minor thing. It could even be you changing the position of a picture hanging on your wall. But while you are setting the insignificant event with your twin self, it is imperative that you are thinking about what it is you’re wishing for, thinking about the thing that you are programming for while you are setting the insignificant event. Begin. Take your time. Whenever you think about the insignificant event you and your twin self has set, think about the end result of your wish fulfilled. Relax. Now that the energies have been set in motion, reproduce the insignificant event after you come out of the meditation. I will count from one to three and you’ll be back in the hallway on this side of the quantum jumping door. One, two, three. You are now back on this side of the door. Relax. In a moment, I’m going to count from one to three. At that moment, you’ll open your eyes. You’ll be wide awake, feeling fine and in perfect health, feeling better than before. One, two, coming out slowly now. At the count of three, you will open your eyes. You’ll be wide awake, feeling fine and in perfect health, feeling better than before. Three, eyes open, wide awake, feeling fine, feeling better than before. Thank you.

Audio 1: The 3 Phases of Wisdom
--------------------

CD 4, An Infinite Well of Wisdom, Module 12, The Three Phases of Wisdom. Our quantum jumps so far require a meditation as that relaxes you and it prepares you for a concentrated effort. Concentration, that’s the key. Think back on your school years. Do you remember ever staring out the window and your teacher or professor’s voice was kind of dim in the background? That was the time your thoughts made you a hero or an idol, and you were just enjoying your daydream. If you recall that state that you were in then, you know exactly what we’re looking for, what we’re seeking to achieve with the meditations. That daydream state of total concentration on one subject is the state that we’re looking for. But for now, we want to control that state of mind. Control, that’s the key. With this module, we’re going to quantum jump into the world of wisdom. And that begs the question, what is wisdom? Is it anything like intelligence, being smarter than the next guy or gal? If it isn’t, what is it? Could it be like that old homily, I can’t define it, but I know what it is when I see it? Well, it has to be more than that. Let’s just say that one isn’t born with wisdom, but wisdom must be learned. It’s learned through reflection, by imitation, and experience, with a bit of empathy thrown into the mix. Well, if it can be learned, then it begs another question. Can it be taught? Let’s just see. The first phase would be reflection. That’s what we’re going to address with the meditation module that follows this segment. Making wise decisions and understanding that we’re confronted by choices every day of our lives, that’s essential when you’re in the reflective mode. Begin by reflecting on your entire day. Now, this can only be done at the end of the day, in bed just prior to going to sleep. And this is best done by jumping to a parallel where your twin self has gone through the same kind of day, but has made a few different choices. How would it have been had you made those same choices? By thinking about your day and considering all the aspects of it, and then mentally changing the things you regret or unhappy about, you’re taking the first step towards true wisdom. Once you go over each day for two weeks, you’re well on the way to creating a new you. By jumping into a parallel and going over the day with your twin self, you’ll find yourself being more and more comfortable with the process. As your twin self has already gone through the day, as you have or you will, choices are obvious. Remember that you have other selves, doppelgangers, counterparts of yours, who have made different choices. You can visit them as well to see how that turned out. Just daydream your twin self. See that self as having made the choices you wish you had made. This is to be done every evening. Soon you’ll find that you have less and less to regret. When you reach the point where you feel that you’ve made all the right choices that day for a full week, in other words, after a week of meditating at night prior to sleep, going through the day and finding nothing that you’d change, then you’re well on the way to a new, refreshing insight. Using the quantum jump and your twin self every evening is the road to a new understanding of yourself, and therein lies the wisdom that you’re seeking. Now for the second phase, imitation. Think about the wisest person you know. That’s the person you’re going to impersonate. But then again, think about it. In an infinite universe, you are the wisest person. In one of that infinity of universes, that unending variety of parallel universes that the quantum physicists speak of, there’s a twin self of yours who fits the bill. A twin self who’s the wisest of the wise. Why not pay that person a visit? How? Why just daydream it? Imagine that you’re in the hallway in front of a closed door. And on the other side of that door is a parallel universe with a twin self of yours who’s waiting for you to impart some wisdom. What would that self say? What advice would that self give to you? Why not just sit quietly, go into your meditation state of relaxed comfort, and daydream your way to that twin self and find out? You may be surprised. And then, of course, there is still another path to wisdom. The third phase, and that is the path of experience. Think about your life. What have you experienced? There are many facets to your life. One part is the economic part. What have been your experiences with regard to money? Another is the relationship part. How have your relationships been with your family, with friends, with teachers, employers, employees, with strangers? How has your health been? What have you experienced with respect to health? What was the worst meal you’ve ever had? What was the best one you’ve ever had? All these things are part of your life experience. What was the best vacation you ever had? Who was the most important person in your life? All that and more are part of your experiences. When you examine each one in turn, you discover wisdom. For in retrospect, when you look back at all your experiences, you find they are what has made you the way that you are. Wisdom comes out of experience, especially so when it builds an emotion of empathy. It’s difficult for the person sitting on a grassy lawn in the shade of an old oak tree sipping a lemonade to understand what a person bent over in the sun working in a field or on the burning sands of the Sahara is feeling unless that person has been overheated as well. You cannot know of the depleted energy of an ill person who hasn’t the strength to move from their bed unless you’ve felt that weakening effect of illness as well. Experience builds empathy, but only in good people. The evil ones do the things they do because they have no empathy. Good people do good things because they feel the pain of others. Indeed, a definition of evil is a lack of empathy. A definition of goodness and decency would be an abundance of empathy. Empathy, as defined by Webster’s dictionary, is the projection of one’s own personality into the personality of another in order to understand the person better, the ability to share in another’s emotions, thoughts, or feelings. That’s empathy. This is exactly what you do when you quantum jump. You project your personality into the personality of another. That other, however, is not a stranger, not anyone you know or have heard of, but yourself, your twin self, who has your basic personality but with a different set of experiences. About this time, many ask, are we really going into an alternate reality? Are we really visiting a parallel universe? Am I truly getting help from the other side, in this case, a doppelganger copy of myself? Look at it this way. Every religious person expects that through the agency of prayer, someone on the other side answers them. There’s a story that I’ve heard comedians tell regarding this, so just allow me a moment. George Dunlap gets word from his doctor that he only has two weeks to live. He was a good man, a very good man all his life. He prayed to God to allow him to win the lottery so he could leave his money to his family. He didn’t have any. The lottery was the way for him to get the money. Well, days went by and nothing. Again he prayed. Nothing. A week went by and still nothing. Frantic with only two days left to live, he prayed harder than ever before explaining once again how he kept the commandments and did good works all his life. Why wasn’t he getting any answer and why didn’t God let him win the lottery? Suddenly a voice boomed out through the room he was in. George, the voice said, do me a favor, buy a ticket. Maybe, just maybe, the quantum jumping is your ticket. Sometimes ritual can be helpful as it establishes a rhythm. This rhythm builds an energy that often manifests into the thing that you desire. People often ask me if I really believe that I jump into a parallel dimension and meet with a twin self and if I really believe that twin self can help me. My answer is, I can’t say for sure, but the evidence that I have is that it seems to work. Does it work all the time? No, nothing works all the time, but it works often enough to allow me to have, let’s say, a step ahead. I can attest to the fact that it has worked for me. I found I had a singing voice through a jump. I became a somewhat renowned photographer after a jump. Did I really get advice from the vocalist and the photographer twin self, or was it coming from deep within my own subconscious? What’s the difference? It worked, and that’s all I’m interested in, and that’s all that you should be interested in. Is it possible that there are other dimensions with an infinite number of twin selves? Well, some of the most educated, dedicated scientists, the quantum physicists, say that it is. Who am I to dispute them? I believe that it’s possible, and I prove it to myself every day. In 2005, on my 78th birthday, I decided to see if I could develop a skill that I just did not have, painting, art. I bought some paints, brushes, a few canvases, and I was ready. I used quantum jumping to visit a parallel universe and speak to a me that was an established artist. Now then, I’m sure you’d like to know just exactly what happened. All right, allow me to walk you through it, as this module is about wisdom. And through imitation and experience, you may gain a bit. You see, you can also gain wisdom from another person’s experience if you use your empathetic sense. Empathy, remember, is seeing from the other person’s point of view. Now, I had no experience with respect to painting, so I couldn’t reflect on past paintings that I’d created. I could only use the experience of another and imitate what I sensed. Knowing that, I went into the meditation state of concentration, visualized the hall, the door, and then imagined the door opening and my stepping through. I know we call this the quantum jump, but I usually just step over the threshold and imagine I’m in another dimension. I know that the dimension I’m in is a right one because that’s my intent. I then imagine that I’m meeting a self that’s an artist. I imagine watching the artist’s self, myself, paint, all the while knowing that it’s me painting, but a me that could have been. While I’m watching, I get a sense of the energy of my counterpart self. I then jump into his body and start painting on his canvas. Now, the entire thing could rightly be called a daydream, because in a way, that’s exactly what it is. But it’s a controlled daydream. A quantum jump is a very different thing than the usual daydreams that just come. Now, when I come out of the meditation, I have something to reflect on, and I visualize myself as an artist. At this point, I felt that I should really read a book or a magazine on art and take a lesson or two. But then I think, let me see, if I just use the energy of my doppelganger, maybe that’ll do it. Well, I start with the blank canvas, no knowledge of technique, color, or anything, and a few brushes. I figure the easiest thing to paint is a bowl of flowers. And so I paint a bowl of flowers. Not bad. I painted another one, and then another. I learned from myself as I did. And that was three years ago. You can see the result by going to burtsart.us. That’s B-U-R-T-S-A-R-T dot U-S. The point of that is, once again, wisdom. How, you might ask. Well, wisdom consists of reflection, imitation, and experience. The quantum jump provides you with the situation you want to happen. You see it as already having happened. After doing that, you have something to reflect on, something to think about. The quantum jump also provides you with someone to emulate, to imitate, yourself as a master of the objective you’re trying to reach. And the actual doing provides you with experience. The quantum jump is your ticket. Experience is important, as without it, you can’t learn what to avoid, what to change, what to enhance or diminish, and a hundred other things that you wouldn’t know without having done it. There’s no such thing as failure. There are only learning experiences. The next module will provide you with a quantum jump for you to go to a parallel and visit with a wise you, a you who has already accomplished what you want to accomplish. So when you’re ready, find a comfortable place where you’ll be undisturbed for, oh, 15 or 20 minutes, and we’ll go into the wisdom meditation.

--------------------
Meditation: The Wisdom Meditation
--------------------

Module 13, the Wisdom Meditation. Make yourself comfortable, and we’ll start this meditation with a three -to -one count. So, close your eyes, take a deep breath, and while exhaling, mentally repeat and visualize the number three three times. Take another deep breath, and while exhaling, mentally repeat and visualize the number two three times. Take another deep breath, and while exhaling, mentally repeat and visualize the number one three times. You are now at a deeper, healthier level of mind. To reach a deeper, healthier level of mind at any time, just take an occasional deep breath. To help you to enter a deeper level of mind, imagine that you’re sitting in front of a black velvet curtain. You’re very comfortable. white plastic numbers in it. The numbers are from 1 to 10. When you place one of these numbers up on the black velvet curtain, the number sticks until you remove it. You’re going to take these numbers one by one and put them on the velvet curtain. First, you’ll put the number 10 on the curtain. Then you’ll remove it and replace it with the number 9 and so on until you’ve put up and taken down the entire series of 10 numbers. First, the number 10. Take your time. You’ll have plenty of time. Relax and begin. If you have not yet reached the number 1, take away whatever number you have on the curtain and replace it with the number 1. You are now at a deeper, healthier level of mind. You are now and always in complete control of your state of mind. You can open your eyes. You can be fully alert anytime you wish to be. Every time you enter this relaxed state, you know that you’re getting better and better in every way. Whenever you enter this relaxed state, you’ll mentally say, every day, in every way, I’m getting better and better. When you say these words, sense yourself improving in all areas of your life. Sense yourself getting better and better. Relax. Relax your eyes. Relax your lips. Relax your jaw. Relax your head, your neck. Relax your chest, your stomach, your back. Relax your body. Relax your arms and hands. Relax your legs and feet. You are now completely relaxed. Repeat mentally after me. Every day I improve my image of myself. my self -esteem. I am a unique human being. There’s no one else on earth exactly like me. Every day I grow stronger in the realization that I can. I can think. I can create. I can do. Relax. Whenever you wish to relax and take a break from the stress of the outer world, recall what you feel at this moment. Recall how you feel at this moment, how relaxed, how at ease you are. Repeat mentally, my body rests and refreshes itself when I consciously relax. I’m relaxed now. My body is resting and refreshing itself, and I feel better and better. Positive thoughts help me through the day. Imagine now that a great light is engulfing you. Suddenly you’re surrounded by a bright fog, a brilliant bright white fog. Imagine that this light permeates everything. You are surrounded by this bright white light. Allow the light to enfold you. Concentrate on the fact that you’re surrounded by the light, the bright white. Light. Relax. Visualize a small hallway with a door at one end. I’m going to count from one to three, and at the count of three, you’ll be in the hallway, and the door will appear. One, two, three. You’re in the hallway. A door has appeared. It’s a quantum door. The door is closed. On the other side of that door are an infinity of places, times, events, and twin selves of yours. On the other side of that door are parallel universes. Anything that can be imagined is on the other side of that door. On the door is written the word wisdom. On the other side of that door are three things for you to see, three selves to hear. Those three subjects are the keys to the kingdom of wisdom. They are reflection, imitation, and experience. With them, you find a wiser, a better equipped for the world, you. I’m going to count from one to three. At the count of three, the door will open, and you will imagine that you’re walking through it. You’re going to meet your twin self who has just completed the same day that you have just completed. Your twin self and you will have a mental conversation of all the things you did today that you could have done differently and better. This part of the quantum jump is, of course, reflection. One, two, three. The door has opened. Go through it. Meet your twin self who has gone through the same kind of day as have you. Mentally talk about it. Imagine your twin self. is answering. Take your time and begin. That’s fine. Relax. In a moment, you’re going to initiate the imitation factor of wisdom. Who is the person you would most like to imitate? Would it be a smart person, a rich person, a good -looking person, a vital, healthy person, a well -known person? What kind of a person would you imitate if you were to impersonate someone? I’m going to count from one to three, and at the count of three, the twin self of yours, who has all the attributes of the person you would most want to imitate. That twin self of yours is smart, rich, good -looking, healthy, and all of the good, positive things that you would prefer in an individual. One, two, three. You are now with the twin self you would most like to imitate. Now merge. with that twin self, and act as if it has already happened. That’s fine. And now we will initiate the experience factor to begin the wisdom conception. For with reflection and imitation and experience, you do indeed become wiser, and you begin to use more of your mind. In a moment, I will count from one to three, and you will be with a twin self. who’s been doing and being what you would like to do and be. That self has experience. Watch that twin self as you run a mental movie of that self as an earlier self of yours. But knowing that it’s your movie, and you can run the scene however you want, in our quantum world of infinity, whatever you can conceive is already taking place in a parallel universe. One, two, three. You are now with a twin self who has had the experience that you’re seeking. Get a sense of that self’s good experiences. As you run the mental movie with your twin self, allow the energy of the images to saturate you. Take your time. Relax. You have now started on the road to true wisdom. As you continue to do this mental conditioning exercise, you will find the wise parts of your intelligence blooming. I will now count from one to three, and you will be back in the hallway on the other side of the quantum door. One, two, three. You are now back on this side of the door. Repeat after me. Positive past thoughts and memories bring me great benefits. Relax. In a moment, I’m going to count from one to three. At that moment, you’ll open your eyes. You’ll be wide awake, feeling fine, in perfect health, feeling better than before. One, two, coming out slowly now. To count to three, you’ll open your eyes. You’ll be wide awake, feeling fine, and in perfect health, feeling better than before. better than before. Thank you.

Audio 2: How to Make Massive Change With Wisdom
--------------------

Module 14. How to make massive change with wisdom. There are many definitions of wisdom, but the one that most people would relate to would probably be that a wise person has the ability to know the difference between an action that will provide a better life from one that would not. Choice, then, would be a prerequisite to wisdom. Not choice alone, but choosing the thing that will provide a better outcome. When a choice is made that upsets the way things are, then you run headlong into change. And therein lies the rub. Change can be upsetting. The wise person knows that there are always choices available for just about everything. The choices that you make put you on the road that you will wind up on. Choose mediocrity and you’ll have a mediocre life. Reach for the stars and who knows, you may well wind up covered in stardust. Every successful person can look back and say to themselves, it’s the choices that I made that put me here. And the choices you made put you in the place that you are at present. Are you happy with where you are? If so, you made the right choices, the wise choices. Are you unhappy with where you are? If so, you made the wrong choices, the thoughtless, foolish choices in some cases. Think now for just a moment. Consider the major decisions that you’ve made in your life, things that you chose that relate to business, relationships, or raising money, or perhaps raising a family. Also, there are family decisions, not to forget them. Choices within the family. There are health decisions, investment decisions, and decisions that seemed minor at the time you made them, but that reached into your future and had a major effect on your life. Think how those choices would have been different if you had considered all aspects, both positive and negative and neutral. When you decided to do, to marry, to go into business, to invest, to move, to start, or to change something in your life, think how those choices would have been different if you had considered all aspects. Change is growth. To prove this, reverse it. Growth is change. Can you even imagine something growing without changing? All growth is change. Everything is constantly changing. Is that good or bad? Well, that depends entirely on the attitude of the individual. Say that you’re going through a transitional time in your life and you’re not sure about what to do. It’s a major turning point. Whatever you decide will affect the rest of your life, as well as the lives of other people, some of whom you know and some of whom you do not yet know. You must determine whether this change will be a benefit for you and for your loved ones. There will be an effect on your future, even if you do nothing. If you do nothing, things will continue as they are. Now think about that. Do you want things to continue as they are? Look at your current situation in two ways, from a positive perspective and then from a negative perspective. A wise person looks at all sides and then considers the consequence of their action. Imagine the present continuing as it is now, but sense yourself accepting conditions. Imagine yourself seeing the positive nature of all the things that are disturbing at the present time. Imagine the way things will be if you allow them to continue with no changes. What are the positive aspects of that eventuality? Next, view the negative side of the things that disturb you at present. Imagine your circumstances if you allow them to continue the way they are now. What will be the outcome? of the continuation of the negative side of the things that disturb you. Now think back to a period in the past when the problems that you’re looking to resolve first developed. Was your viewpoint different then? Do the things that disturbed you then leave you unconcerned today? Have you yourself changed? Change is growth. If you have changed, Consider the fact that you may have matured and outgrown your old needs. Project yourself into the future. Imagine what would it be like with an entirely different situation. Will you be happy with this new situation? Would your loved ones be happy with this new situation? Change involves establishing new patterns and breaking the old. An established pattern or habit, it’s comforting because it’s familiar. Even when there are unwelcome results, it’s easy to attach yourself to comfort. In addition, familiarity brings a measure of security. You feel secure because you know the territory. Repetition of any activity breeds familiarity. When you do a job you’re familiar with, it becomes routine. Routine is comforting because you know what’s ahead. Just as a child who undergoes constant change and growing awareness requires a familiar object about at all times, so does the adult. The only difference is in the type of object. It takes a great deal of maturing before the child is willing to let go of the familiar object. It doesn’t matter in the least that the object may be an old towel or a doll that’s unwashed, smelly, scratchy, and full of lumps. What does matter is that it’s familiar, and that’s comforting. Any attempt to remove the familiar before the child is willing to let go leads to chaos. But if you allow the child to develop to a point where the letting go becomes a plateau of growth, Then you’ll see a beneficial crossroads in the life of the youngster. We all have security blankets that we hang on to with fists of iron. Fearful of letting go of the familiar, we accept the controlling routine of things that someone outside might see as unacceptable. The outsider, not understanding that the seemingly negative experience represents security, will come up with false conclusions. Lacking information, the outsider cannot possibly understand what’s going on. Even the person with the problem may not realize that the situation is necessary, that it represents the security of the familiar. Most of us attribute to outside agencies the forces that direct us to failure or success. When we feel that we have no control over these forces, then change becomes a throw of the dice. Not wanting to gamble on change and perhaps lose the security of the familiar, we remain in the comforting place known as The status quo. The existing state of affairs. Actually, there’s no sense in worrying about or concentrating on past mistakes. For given the same information and the same you of that time, you’d find that if you could relive the event, you’d do it the same way and the same thing all over again. The reason you’re seeing it as an error is that you’ve grown and are… mature, you’re no longer the same person you were then. Look at things not as mistakes, but as guideposts, showing you the way to a better place. See all things as experience. Your mistakes are only things that didn’t work. Learn from them. The only way for you to know what works is to do. If something doesn’t work. It’s up to you not to do it that way again. Keep at it until you discover what does work. Persistence is the key. Here’s how we ensure wise decision making. Meditate and then take a quantum jump into a universe where your twin self has made the decision that you’re not sure of. Jump into the universe where a year has passed after the decision has been made. What were the consequences? Quantum jumping can be an extremely valuable resource in your decision -making bag of tricks. Use it often. Go to a twin self who’s happy about the change. Then go to a different twin self who’s unhappy about the change. The information that you receive could be… Very valuable. Thank you.

Lesson 34: Quantum Relaxation
--------------------

The Elusive State of Quantum Relaxation
Discover how to use Quantum Jumping to enter "Quantum Relaxation" – the ultimate state of relaxation, which is beyond the alpha level.

You'll also find out what you must know about the different states of the mind and how to lower your brain waves at will, so you can instantly enjoy a surge of clarity, creativity, and relaxation.

--------------------
Audio 1: The Elusive State of Quantum Relaxation
--------------------

CD5, Quantum Relaxation, Module 15, The Elusive State of Quantum Relaxation. Of all the things that you can do to enhance your immune system, relieve yourself of stress, be more productive, stimulate creativity, and in short, inspire and encourage all the good and positive things in your life, A deep state of relaxation would be on top of everyone’s list. The very deepest state of relaxation would take you to the theta area of brainwave production, which is less than that most spoken of alpha region of the mind that you may have heard so much about. Less meaning the brainwave activity, the frequency, would be lower. Briefly, Your brain produces waves of measurable energy. The medical community has shown that those waves go from one cycle a second on up. The waves have been assigned names. They’re delta from one to four cycles, theta four to seven, alpha seven to 12, and gamma 30 to 100. It’s not the function of quantum jumping to get into brainwave theory or practice. only to say that the higher the brainwaves, the less likely you are to think in a creative, constructive manner. In other words, the lower your brainwave activity, the more of your mind is put to use. Proof of this is the emotional state’s bearing on brainwave activity. The more emotional you get, the higher the brainwave activity. Think about a time when you were angry or fearful. Both of these emotions will raise the frequency of your brain. The more anger, the higher the frequency. The highest frequency would be when anger turns into fury or when fear turns into panic. When you’re in a state of fury or panic, your brainwave frequencies shoot upwards and thinking goes out the window. In a state of fury, consequences are given no thought at all. And people do things they later regret. When in a state of panic, thought again flies away and… People run into walls and get into life -threatening situations. That’s what high brainwave frequencies will do. But there’s light at the end of the emotional tunnel, because the opposite is true as well. Lower your brainwave frequencies, then you’ll find yourself using more of your mind. If bad things happen with high brain frequencies, the opposite is true as well. Good things will happen with low brainwave frequencies. If you were to ask me if any of the quantum jumping techniques could help you to be more productive, healthier, sleep better, be more creative, and in short, do better with family relationships and in your occupation, I would say yes, they can. The key to all that is simple. It’s learning to utilize the method of lowering your brainwaves so that you’re always in a general state of relaxation. even if you’re involved in a physical activity, such as swimming, football, basketball, or any other sport. Anyone can lower their brainwaves by simply relaxing. Meditation is important, as that’s the universal way to lower brainwaves. Our technique, for all you quantum jumping students, has been developed over the years by my observations of what happens to people during light, medium, and deep. meditation. Also, the research I’ve done over the years with respect to hypnotic trance, which is a form of meditation in that it is relaxing and a concentration of attention. I’ve learned how to deepen trance and carrying that over to the meditation side, how to deepen meditation as well. I call the deepest state of meditation quantum relaxation. That’s what this module and the one following is all about, getting you to the ultimate stage of relaxation and concentration so that you too will be able to use more of your mind. Use more of your mind and you find a new world, a world of delight, of success, health, and choice. But first of all, that deep, deep state of relaxation. I actually learned the process while training hypnotists in the art of hypnotherapy. There’s a standard method of deepening a hypnotic trance for therapeutic purposes. It’s a simple process, easy to teach and easy to learn. It consists of putting a subject into a light trance and then bringing them out of the trance and putting them right back into it. Take them out. Put them back. Each time this is done, the subject goes into a deeper trance. A skilled hypnotist can get a person to the exact level that will be most conducive to the therapy of that moment. Usually three times will do it, although I have gone as many as five with a few subjects. By now you probably have the idea. Getting to the proper relaxed state so that all those good things I spoke of will happen is important. You see, the mind is the problem, but the mind is also the solution. What I mean by that is that the body is equipped to heal itself of all ills when the mind stays out of the way. But alas, that’s the most difficult thing to do. Hundreds of books and thousands of articles have been written about how the mind is a slayer and that the mind is the ultimate healer. What drives the mind? The biggest single factor is the way you look at the world, your attitude. But allow me to simplify it by defining the word emotion. And emotion is any thought that has like or dislike attached to it. The more like, the more emotional. The more dislike, the more emotional. Anger is a dislike emotion. A little bit of it really won’t bother you. Say a degree or two on the dislike scale. won’t even affect your brainwave activity. But a lot of anger is a lot of dislike and a lot of high brainwave activity. You are, to some degree, emotional about everything. Granted, most things are low on the scale, but anything that affects you, to some degree, either with a feeling of dislike or like, will have an effect on your attitude. The things that you’re neutral about, not a drop of dislike or like, Well, you don’t think about those things at all. That’s the place where the mind is separated from the body and the body can do its job. That of keeping itself in repair. To eliminate emotions from your mind, put it neutral. How do you do that? Well, you think about nothing. Easier said than done. How do I achieve enlightenment, the disciple asks his guru. Easy, the wise man answered. Just don’t think about monkeys for the next 30 seconds. Of course, that was all a disciple could think of. Monkeys. You can’t not think about something because to not think about it, you have to think about what you’re not supposed to think about. Now, there’s a better way. One way that we use is to think about a structured pattern designed to take you deep into… and lower your brainwaves. You think about a small hallway with a door that’s closed, a quantum door. You see how easy it is? I can’t tell you not to think about a thing, and so I guide you to think about something specific. And to further the thought on the other side of that door is anything you can imagine. You want to go deeper into the relaxed state? Why, it’s right there on the other side of that door. Open it, go on through, and there you’ll find what you’re looking for. Yes, we’re about to utilize the quantum jump to get to the state of quantum relaxation. Not once, but three times. Remember what I said. Every time a person came out of trance and went right back in, it went into a deeper trance than before. Well, it works the same way on the quantum level, so you’ll be going to a twin self who solved the riddle of deeper and deeper levels of the mind for better programming and all those good things that come with it. Here’s how to utilize the quantum jump technique to deepen your relaxation and to eliminate any emotional constraints to getting what you want out of the process. What’s the benefit of going into a deeper state of relaxation? Well, with your mind out of the way, your organs relax. The very cells of your body replenish their energies. The immune system is strengthened. All your natural rhythms, like blood pressure, heartbeat, and brainwave activity, works as they all should to protect your body against outside influences. A friend of mine is deeply spiritual and uses the quantum relaxation method to get closer to God. He says that after the third dip into the quantum stream of consciousness, he truly feels his oneness with the Almighty. During the next module, which is for deep relaxation, I’ll guide you to the quantum door and ask that you step through into a universe of calmness and relaxed attitudes. Just imagine, whatever you will, that you believe will in fact be calming for you. You might imagine a park or a forest or an ocean scene. You might sense yourself on a lounge chair watching the sunset. Whatever you imagine will be for you that calming influence. Then I’ll ask that you go back into the hallway and out of the quantum area. Wide awake and aware. Immediately you’ll again be guided to the quantum doorway to visit the calmest universe. then back again to full awareness. And after that, for a third time, back to the quantum door in the universe of calm. This time, the third time, you’ll stay for a while. You will find yourself in a deep state of relaxation, a quantum relaxation. So, now, please find a place where you’ll be undisturbed for 20 minutes or so and get comfortable. And we’ll soon begin. Quantum. Relaxation on the next module.

Meditation: The Quantum Relaxation Meditation
--------------------

Module 16. The Quantum Relaxation Meditation. This is the quantum relaxation method of deepening your meditations. Use the technique of going into and coming out of the meditation three times consecutively, and you’ll find yourself more concentrative and better able to relax and allow your body to adjust itself to a better place. For this meditation and some of the following meditations as well, we will have music from the spheres, a very light background sound that is designed to deepen your meditation. For now, find a comfortable position. Close your eyes. Take a deep breath. And while exhaling, mentally repeat and visualize the number three, three times. As you mentally repeat each number, mentally repeat it at lesser and lesser volume. Three, three, three. Take another deep breath and while exhaling, mentally repeat and visualize the number two three times in the same manner. Take another deep breath and while exhaling, mentally repeat and visualize the number one three times in the same manner. To reach a deeper, healthier level of mind, I’m going to count from 10 to 1. On each descending number, you will feel yourself going deeper, and you will enter a deeper, healthier level of mind. When we reach the count of 1, the music of the spheres will begin very lightly in the background. 10, 9, feel going deeper. 8, 7, Six, deeper and deeper. Five, four, three, deeper and deeper. Two, one. You are now at a deeper, healthier level of mind. To reach a deeper, healthier level of mind at any time, just take an occasional deep breath. You are now and always in complete control of your state of mind. You can open your eyes. You can be fully alert anytime you wish to be. Every time you enter this relaxed state, know that you’re getting better and better in every way. Whenever you enter this relaxed state, you’ll mentally say, every day, in every way, I’m getting better and better. When you say these words, sense yourself improving in all areas of your life. Sense yourself getting better and better. Relax. Relax your head. Relax your jaw, your neck. Relax your shoulders, your arms, and hands. Relax your body. Relax your legs and feet. You’re now completely relaxed. Repeat mentally, my body rests and refreshes itself when I consciously relax. I’m relaxed now. I will now count from one to three. At the count of three, you will project your mind to imagine that you’re in the hallway in front of the quantum door. The door is closed. One, two, three. You’re now in the small hallway. In front of you is the quantum door. On the other side of that door is the relaxation site. a parallel universe in which your twin self, the most relaxed, healthy, and very successful person, lives. After the door opens and you step through, you too will find a new relaxation. As soon as you step through, you’ll find a more relaxed state of mind. Imagine that. Daydream it if you must. But imagine a you who is as relaxed as you have ever been. I will now count from one to three and you will open the door and step through to that most relaxed of all dimensions. One, two, three. Open the door and step through. I will again count from one to three and you’ll be back in the hallway. One, two, three. You are now back in the hallway. At the count of three, you will open your eyes and be fully alert. After which, I will count once again from one to three, and you will project your mind to imagine that you’re back in the hallway in front of the quantum door. One, two, three. Eyes open. Fully alert. Relax. I will now count from one to three. At the count of three, you will again project your mind to imagine that you are in the hallway in front of the quantum door. The door will be closed. One, two, three. You are now in the hallway. In front of you is a quantum door. On the other side of that door is the relaxation site, a parallel universe, your twin self, the most relaxed, healthy, and very successful person lives. After the door opens, you step through, you too will find a new relaxation. Relax. I will now count from one to three, and you will open the door and step through to that most relaxed of all dimensions. One, two, three. Open the door and step through. Relax. I will once again count from one to three, you’ll be back in the hallway. One, two, three. You are back in this dimension, in the small hallway. At the count of three, you will open your eyes and be fully alert. After which, I will count once again from one to three, and you will project your mind to imagine that you’re back in the hallway, in front of the quantum door. One. Two. Three. Eyes open. Fully alert. Relax. I will now count from one to three. And to count to three, you will project your mind to imagine that you are in the hallway in front of the quantum door. The door is closed. One. Two. Three. You are now in the small hallway. In front of you is the quantum door. On the other side of that door is a relaxation site. I will now count from one to three, and you will open that door and step through to that most relaxed of all dimensions, the quantum relaxation. One, two, three, open the door and step through. Relax. It’s most refreshing to be completely relaxed, to allow your body to make any repairs that are necessary. At this time, you may use this state of total relaxation and concentration to program for a goal that you’d like to achieve, or to simply imagine that you’re surrounded by a bright white light. Relaxation with intent can also bring you into the spiritual kingdom. So just relax and enjoy the comfortable feeling that you feel now. I will be quiet to give you plenty of time to enjoy and relax. Relax. It is now time to open your eyes and come back to full awareness. I will count from one to five, and at the count of five, you’ll be wide awake, fully aware, and well-rested. One, two, three. At the count of five, open your eyes. Four, five. Eyes open, wide awake, fully aware, well-rested, and feeling better than before. Thank you.

Audio 2: What You Can Really Do With Quantum Jumping
--------------------

Module 17. What you can really do with quantum jumping. A few things. With this module, you’ll find a few different ways that other people have used quantum jumping. Jerry Feldman was in my quantum jumping class. Actually, it was one of the earliest classes before it was offered to the general public. It was a seminar for some friends and their friends to try out the concepts on people who would keep in touch with me and tell me how it worked for them. Jerry wanted some inspiration, wanted to know if there was going to be anything in the class that might inspire him to figure out a way to double the production of his company. Jerry had a telemarketing business in the San Fernando Valley. Actually, he was in the Encino area, for those of you who know the area. And San Fernando Valley is kind of a suburb of Los Angeles. Actually, it’s a major city of itself with over a million people. Jerry had 10 people working for him and had ambitions of growing larger. His business was pretty much dependent on his 10 salespeople who were paid by the hour. He couldn’t afford to hire any more people, and the business seemed to be at a stalemate. His goal was to double the production of his crew, but so far nothing worked. He offered bonuses, he offered prizes, he had company picnics. Everyone loved Jerry and they liked what he was doing, but production suffered. It stayed the same. He decided to use the quantum jumping technique and jump through the quantum door and go to the twin self who was having the same problem and see how he was going to get out of it. Maybe, he thought. Jerry, too, as he called his twin self, had ideas that he didn’t have. As a matter of fact, he said, I’m going to go to a twin self who has the exact problem, but who has different ideas than I do. I’m going to go to a twin self, he thought, who had a flash of insight and doubled his business. That was a unique idea. Go to a twin self who was going through the same problem, but who was inspired to come up with a solution. Anything that can be imagined is in an infinite universe. So long as his intent is clear, and apparently it was, it should work. But here’s something else that Jerry told me. He got an impression of his twin self going through the same situation, and actually he mentally described the problem. He said to his twin self, well, I have the same ten people you have. And I know the business would thrive if I can get them to double their sales. But how can I do that? How are you going to do it? Then after posing the question, Jerry waited for an answer. He suddenly had a flash of inspiration. He thought he heard two words, hire tigers. Well, that got him to thinking. And then he wondered, did that come from somebody else or was it in me all the time? Told him a dozen times, it really doesn’t matter. He thought about the ten people he had working. No tigers there. He’d placed an ad in the paper and hired whoever applied. His budget at the time was for ten people. Coming out of his meditation, he thought over those two words, hire tigers. But how can he find tigers? Sitting at his desk, doodling and thinking about the advice he’d received, he wrote, From now on, we’re going to go over the production of everyone here every month. The person with the least production will have to get a job somewhere else. He looked at those words and he thought about them. Hmm, how’s that going to get me tigers? Well, he didn’t consider that. He thought he’d let the worst producer go again at the end of the month and hire another new person. Whoever was the worst producer, he’d let them go. Now, what would happen was obvious when he thought about it. He put the crew into a hierarchy with the top producer for the month being number one, the second producer number two, and so on. Whoever was number 10 would be terminated. Everybody knew about this. He put the people’s names on the board with the top person number one, the bottom person number 10. His entire crew was stimulated, and the talk during their breaks was always about increased production. Number 10 knew days before the end of the month that he or she was through. But that was okay, because they all knew the rules. And when the new person was hired, well, that person was seldom number 10, usually wound up somewhere in the middle, about six or seven. Once, he told me, he hired a new one, and they immediately became number one. Well, he wrote another ad looking for a replacement for the person who would be let go every month. The thing worked like a charm. Jerry went back to meditation in the hallway. Stepping over the threshold of the quantum door, he found himself with his doppelganger who had been doing just that for two years. That’s the parallel he wanted to go to. He mentally had a conversation asking how it worked out. He imagined his twin self saying, every month I let the person with the least production go and hire somebody else. After a year, he said, there was only two people from the original crew still working for me. Both of them had been top producers when we started. And after a year, they were still producing as well as in the beginning, but they were both at the low range of the crew. Six months later, only one of the original crew was left, and I had my crew of Tigers. No more hiring and firing. Time for the next step. And that’s to hire another 10 people and do the same thing. Well, that was a different way to use quantum jumping. And very creative. Just go to a place where your twin self has the same problem and see how they handle it. See how they solve it. Well, great. Now that gave me an idea. Go to a twin self who’s confronted with the same problem that I have, except the twin self always has an inspirational answer. Now, quantum jumping can be used in so many ways. After a while, you’ll discover a few of your own. Of course, that’s my goal, to have you set your goal to discover your own ways of using quantum jumping. It’s virtually unlimited. The concept is that inspiration is there. It only requires some kind of a catalyst to bring it out. Some catalysts are psychological. Some are mental. Some are physical. We use the quantum jump as it only requires using your daydream mechanism. That’s the catalyst, the daydream mechanism. So by using the daydream mechanism and just a bit of creativity, but intent above all, if your intention is that you use the jumping technique to inspire you, then you’ll jump into an inspirational twin self. So, your daydream mechanism, combined with a bit of creativity, and overall, your intention. Now, speaking about the various ways to use quantum jumping, I have a suggestion. You’ve learned here think about how many ways you can use quantum jump technique. And then, after considering the different ways, write them down on a piece of paper. It might help if you were to jump to a twin self and discuss the different ways before you wrote them down. Most of the ways will bring about choosing one way or another, because there are always choices, always. Your life is pretty much based on the choices you made in the past. Now, wouldn’t it be a great advantage to you? If you could have intuition working for you every time there was a choice to be made, well, that’s what quantum jumping is all about. Say that you have a choice to be made. Say that there’s a path opening on your road of life, but you’re unsure of whether to take that path. What would the right path for you be? That’s the question. Well, a quantum jump may well give you the answer. Just jump through the quantum door to a parallel where your twin self is the most intuitive person on that planet, going through the exact same thing you’re going through. What does your twin self do? Many answers come when you have been using quantum jumping for a while. Get used to considering different aspects of your goals, different aspects of your problems, and by all means consider consequences of each choice, solutions of each choice. What was the ultimate solution for the choice that you made? Was it one that you’re satisfied with? Pretty soon you’ll find more and more intuition becoming a valuable resource in your life. As example, I once jumped to a doppelganger and asked, what should I do next? And the answer I got, inspirationally, it just came to me, was to write down nine things I most appreciated about quantum jumping. And so when I came out of my meditation, I sat down and quickly wrote the things that I most appreciated about the quantum jump, nine of them. What I wrote was, number one, well, that would be the relaxation in getting there. Two, it gets me focused on what it is that I want. Three, I wrote that it enables me to clarify my goals. Four, it’s a fun way to daydream my way around with no limitations. Five, it allows me to help other people by seeing them in a parallel universe as solving their problems successful or healed if illness was a problem for them. Six, it stimulates my creativity. Seven, it allows me the motivation to do things I’d never have tried without seeing how my twin self does it. Eight, and most important to me, it allows me an avenue to reach the spiritual plane and talk to loved ones who have passed on. And nine, I get my best ideas from my successful doppelgangers. Now then, how about you doing it? After you’ve taken a few jumps, write out nine things that you like about the technique. You may well get a few very helpful ideas. Trust me on this. It will help. Write down nine things. Not right now if you’re just starting with this. Just do a few more jumps first. Have a couple of successes. You’re not going to be successful every time. No one is, nor am I. But you’re successful enough so that it will put you a giant step ahead of where you were. So do that. Write down nine things that you like about the quantum jumping technique and do it. Thank you.

Quantum Jumping Towards Your Goal
Burt will be talking about the single most important step you must take before you can change your life with Quantum Jumping II.

Are your visualizations not working as well as they should? Find out what happens to 9 in 10 people when it comes to their jumps.

You will also learn how to get all 3 levels of your consciousness working together so you can achieve the dreams you desire.

If left unchecked, the deadly trifecta of limitations – the sin, guilt and punishment factor – could be keeping you from your goals.

Finally, Burt will explain the "Rhythm Principle", which is the shocking culprit behind Adell’s mysteriously aching hand.

Audio 1: Quantum Jumping Towards Your Goal
--------------------

CD6, Achieving Goals with a Target Jump, Module 18, Quantum Jumping Towards Your Goal. Quite possibly among the most important thing that you can do with quantum jumping, or with any other philosophy or self -development process, would be that of setting goals for yourself. Setting up a target, so to speak. But it doesn’t do any good to set up a target if you just set it up and then forget about it. The target must be used, and that too is an issue we’ll be addressing here, that of action. Objectives and actions must, of a necessity, go along side by side. Here’s where the quantum jump comes in to stimulate both the objective and the action. Lester Sindelar was a student of mine who complained that he set many goals, but none of them seemed to come to fruition. What? he asked, was he doing wrong? He used one of the standard goal -setting devices, that of creating an image of himself with his goal completed, and then whenever he thought about his goal, he thought about the successful outcome, just as he understood he was supposed to do. But alas, nothing ever came of it. When Lester came to my class, I asked him for specifics. What was his goal? Exactly what actions did he take? and was the goal realistic. His goal was a luxury automobile. He’d heard that simply by visualizing it, the car would come to him. And I’ve known a lot of people who, after learning the visualization process, have done exactly that. One friend, Helene Hatzel, had even written a book about it, The Name It and Claim It Game. This was about how she entered contests, visualized the end result of herself winning, and did indeed win many of the contests that she entered. So why wasn’t Lester’s visualizations working for him? Or was there more to it than that? Well, first of all, the goal should be somewhat realistic. Programming for a $10 million boat, because you saw a picture of Tiger Woods’ yacht, That’s fine if your income warrants it, but not if you’re making $70 ,000 or $80 ,000 a year. But why is that, you may ask? If it works, why not for any number? The main reason is that there’s a little voice in your subconscious saying something like, who are you kidding? A $10 million yacht? No way. Most people don’t feel deserving of the things that they’re setting goals for. Oh, I know you may think, well, I deserve the best. But that’s on the outer conscious level. There are many levels of consciousness. The three best known are the physical, the mental, and the spiritual. When all three are in concert, you will get the things that you want. As a matter of fact, when all three levels are in correspondence, say, You won’t have to program for anything. Things just come to you automatically. Now we have a new question. Now the question is, how do you get the physical, the mental, and the spiritual levels of consciousness working together for the things that you want? The mental level is the easiest to handle. You just see yourself, you visualize yourself with the thing you want in hand. That’s what everybody teaches, isn’t it? Ah, if only it were that easy. If it were that easy, there’d be no poverty in the world, there’d be no illness, there’d be no unpleasantness. But it’s not that easy for a reason. And for that, we would have to address the issue of the spiritual plane of consciousness. But before that, what would be the job of the physical level? Not hard to figure that out. It’s action. I’ll get back to that in a bit. Let’s tackle the spiritual level for a moment. This is where most events that cause problems are forever stored. I relate that to a computer server and email. Say that the computer itself is representative of the physical level, and the email you write is the mental level, while the server who stores the email is responsible for the spiritual level. Okay, then the email you write is like a problem that you had. creates a feeling of guilt or regret. Those feelings are the sources of limitations. You’ve been a bad girl, a bad boy, and you don’t deserve whatever it is that you’re programming for. But you’ve managed to suppress the regret and it’s out of your mind. You can delete the email you wrote, but it’s always there with your server. And just as the erased email is there with your server, the original incident that caused the problem is sitting there in your spiritual consciousness. That you can’t erase. Well, then how do you deal with it? How do you deal with an event in the past that you feel guilty about or that you regret? Or, for that matter, why should you have to? And what does this have to do with goal setting? Patience, please. Let me get a bit further into limitations. The problem is with the sin -guilt -punishment factor. To simplify, Sin is a missing of the mark, a mark that other people have set for you, authority figures in your youth generally who lay down a set of rules, things that you should do, things that you shouldn’t do, things that you have to do, and things that you do not have to do. Well, say that you do something that you feel you shouldn’t have. You missed the mark, so to speak. A feeling comes over to you that’s hard to define. It’s a feeling that you should go back over the thing and correct it. That feeling we call guilt. Guilt is an urge to go back and do it right. But what if you don’t or can’t go back and do it right? Well, then you’ve been bad and your inner conscious comes into play with the next member of the trio, punishment, which quite simply is a reminder that you have not corrected yourself. But you can’t, because the person that you disrespected, say, is no longer among the living. Or the one you spoke unkindly to won’t talk to you. What then? Well, then punishment comes into play in the form of limitations. You’ve been bad, so you only deserve so much. You only deserve so much in the way of income. You only deserve so much in the way of health, of relationships. of knowledge, of whatever. Well, you get the point. Limitations will hamper every goal -setting program ever conceived, and that includes the laws of attraction that have been made so popular of late. These are not the insignificant events that I spoke of, but rather something else entirely, as they’re seldom insignificant when they happen. With respect to Lester Sindelar and his programming for a luxury automobile, I found something rather interesting when we were working out some of the material of quantum jumping. He said to me once, Bert, when you were talking about doing things in the past that causes problems, like me not getting the things I programmed for, would something like being in a car wreck be stopping me? It turned out that when Lester was still learning to drive, he was 16 at the time, he had borrowed his father’s car without telling anyone and he and his cousin went joyriding. Unfortunately, Lester lost control of the car and flipped it. His cousin was killed in the accident. 20 years later, he had all but forgotten the incident. It was brought back to him when I discussed guilt and programming. Now, this is almost a classic example of limitations. If ever anyone thought they didn’t deserve a fine automobile, this was it. All the programming in the world wouldn’t get Lester’s car. And if by some chance it happened, he wouldn’t feel comfortable with it. Before Lester worked with another goal -setting process, he had to unburden himself of that emotion, the emotions that were tied to the accident that killed his cousin. With an understanding of quantum jumping, And the idea of infinite universes, the answer, to me at least, was obvious. I say obvious because what Lester has to do is to go over the incident of the accident and change it. In a world of infinity where everything that could be imagined is, all Lester has to do is to jump into one of the millions of universes where the accident didn’t happen. Meet his twin self, meet his cousin who was not in an accident and therefore wasn’t killed. Now then, you might ask, well, wait a minute. How can simply imagining he’s meeting his twin self and cousin in another universe help him to get his goals and objectives? I actually can answer that, not with guesswork either. As you may be aware, I’ve been a hypnotist for more than 50 years. I’ve also taught others for many years the art of hypnotherapy. I’ve had a good deal of experience in that line. And I found something interesting while teaching past life therapy, which entails taking a person to a past life that is having an effect on the problem at present. Just simply by walking them through it and then bringing the person out of trance, the problem was resolved. That was through hypnotherapy. Now, the first time I noted that, I thought it was pure coincidence. But it happened again and again. In a class in Paris, France, I did a hypnovision training, and one of the trainees had a problem with her arm. The woman, we’ll call her Adele, asked to be the subject for the demonstration. Her problem was that her right hand and arm had pained her for most of her life. Doctors could find no physical cause for the pain. Her fingers were extremely weak, and she could barely hold a pen to sign her name. She was in a trance, and I regressed her and asked where she was. She responded that she was in a crowd. Everyone was much bigger than she was, and a lot of shouting was going on. It turned out that she was a six -year -old child, and her mother was being hung for stealing milk from a cow. It seemed as though she was in a small village in France around the 17th century. Now, do remember, this is a regression, a past life regression. Her father was holding onto her hand tightly so that she wouldn’t get lost in the crowd. And she was frantic with fear. There were hundreds of people around her shouting and jostling. Her father was crying and had a grip of steel almost crushing her right hand. When the woman was hanged, her mother, the crowd surged forward and the grip was gone. Her father’s hand wasn’t there any longer. She was torn away from her father by the milling crowd. Her father was then taken by the crowd and he was beaten to death. The six -year -old that had been Adele was picked up by a soldier who protected her and carried her away from the mob. The last thing that Adele said while still in trance was, The soldier! It’s Edouard! Edouard was her husband who was in the class. She came out of trance, ran to her husband crying and hugged him. The pain… In her hand and arm was gone and didn’t come back. I’ve told that story almost exactly as it happened, except for her name. I don’t recall her name. Now, I don’t know why that happened. I only know that it did. And so perhaps, just perhaps, quantum jumping gets us the same result as past life therapy. Well, then again, maybe past life therapy gets the same result as quantum jumping. Don’t question it. Just use it. That was a pretty typical case of regression, past life regression. Most of them are similar to that, and I’ve been involved literally with hundreds. Now, does that prove reincarnation? Not necessarily. No one can actually prove it. One just takes it on faith. But if a billion people believe in something, doesn’t that prove its existence? Well, what about the other billion who believe the opposite? I do believe that the end of life is the beginning of something else. One of our great principles, the principle of rhythm, establishes that when something ends, something always begins. An afterlife, if you will. Reincarnation? Maybe. Morantia worlds where souls evolve into greater entities? Perhaps. Oblivion? No. That I do not believe. Nature doesn’t act that way. When something ends, something else begins. That’s the law of the universe. As I mentioned, it’s the principle of rhythm. All things are cyclical. When your day ends, night begins. When night ends, day begins. When you go to sleep at night, your day, you might say, died. Then your sleep cycle is born. When your sleep cycle dies, ends, then your day is born. It’s a law of nature. When something is born, something else has died. There is no death without birth, and no birth without death. I choose to believe that we’ve had past lives, and that we will have future lives. Now, what’s the value to that? Well, let’s see. In an infinite world with an unending number of universes parallel to our own, your past lives are now. If it’s infinite, then anything is possible. That’s the key to seeing who you were. And if it’s of interest, who you will be. In one respect, in an infinite universe with an infinite number of parallel universes, there would be no time conception whatever. Let me explain that. Infinity is limitless, endless, and all -encompassing. In an infinite universe, whatever can be imagined is. Therefore, in one of the parallels, It will be what we see as 900 BC. In another, it’s 3500 AD. In another, the Big Bang is just banged. And in another, well, you get the idea. Whatever you can imagine is in a limitless parallel universe, in an infinite universe. That being the case, there are a limitless and infinite number of u’s as well in all that vast mass of galaxies. solar systems and how many planets are there i don’t know if you’re aware of it but the scientific community the astrologers now pretty much assume that there are a trillion a trillion with a t a trillion planets in our galaxy alone. Now, not only are you everything that everyone is, you are in every time as well. Now, this concept takes a bit of thought. And if you believe me to be exaggerating or maybe off my rocker, there are many highly specialized quantum physicists who accept this concept. Indeed, at the level of quanta, the smallest particles, actions can only be explained by a parallel world. At any rate, the parallel universe concept, as scientifically bizarre as it might sound, is the closest that science gets to spirituality. For if, in a parallel universe, everything imaginable is possible, then the spiritual nature of man exists as well as the physical. But back to the time concept in a world of infinities. Your past lives are being lived right now. On a parallel world, just like this one, your future lives as well. But we’re only addressing the past life for now. That being so, you need not go into any regressions to discover what your previous life was like. Your previous life can be discovered simply by tapping into a parallel universe where you’re living that life. Now, in a parallel infinite universe, to get to a past life, you don’t regress. You jump. But the effect is the same. You’re getting a sense of a past life. Karma, that ancient philosophy that speaks of the apparent fact that the quality of your life is determined by your behavior in a previous one, is the concept that reincarnationalists pretty much all believe in. What you have sown in a past life you will reap in your present one, or a future one. A friend of mine always had trouble with her right knee. Once she sprained it, another time she broke it, it would heal, something else would happen. She’d skin it or trip and land on it. Always something else, always the right knee. One day I saw Barbie, after she had returned from Arizona where she lived. She was limping. Seeing me, she laughed and said, boy, I must have kicked a lot of ass in my last life. That pretty much sums up karma. A billion or more people believe in that concept. As you believe, so it will be. If you have a karmic debt, it will be paid. But what if? What if the concept of parallel universes is valid? Then you’d have a choice of seeking a past life. You could either go into a past life by regressing or go to a past life in another dimension, a parallel universe, where you are presently living that life that is having an effect on your present one. One of the things that I have found after years of regressing people into past lives was that it didn’t seem to matter what was done in the past life. Just by going there seemed to relieve the problems of the present. Perhaps it was simply a release caused by the visit. I don’t know. Now the question will arise, well, how do you do it? Is there some kind of a technique involved? When projecting oneself into a past life or a parallel mirror image in a different time, the technique is similar. Intent and imagination take you there. Scientists would rather consider parallel and infinite universes than past lives. Meditation is involved, as is the Baga technique of getting the mind ready by touching the roof of your mouth with the tip of your tongue. You must want to go into a past life for some reason, presumably to resolve a problem. That should be your purpose and intention to get rid of the thing that’s bothering you. All that Lester did was to go to his twin self that was in a universe where he did not borrow his father’s car. And so didn’t cause the accident that killed his cousin. Here his cousin was alive in that particular universe. And that was where Lester jumped. And the aftermath was that now we could set up a goal that may well come to pass. I say may well because there’s never an absolute guarantee to something working at a specific time. We can use the material and at the very least we will generate energies that will help us along. in life. Now then, you might think, but Lester’s cousin is not alive, and going to a parallel where he is alive won’t bring him back to this universe. No, it won’t. But that’s not the point. The point is that Lester was bothered by the guilt attached to the incident, and the guilt was relieved when he walked through the parallel universe where his cousin was alive. The next quantum jump will be for a goal. Something that you want or something that you want to happen. What will your goal be? Think about that. Because during the next jump, you’ll be going to a universe where you already have it, or at least your twin self does. When that door opens, imagine that you know where you want to go. You want to go to that universe where you already have what you’re programming for. Just imagine that you’re there and create a scene that you would want for yourself. Okay? Right. Now just relax and find a place where you’ll be undisturbed for 15 minutes or so, and we will begin.


--------------------
Meditation: The Goal Jumping Meditation
--------------------

Module 19, The Goal Jumping Meditation. Make yourself comfortable and do not play this or any of the meditations in a moving vehicle. We’ll start this meditation by helping you to count backwards from 3 to 1. Find a comfortable position, close your eyes, take a deep breath, and while exhaling, mentally repeat and visualize the number 3 three times. Take another deep breath, and as you exhale, mentally repeat and visualize the number two three times. Take another deep breath, and while exhaling, mentally repeat and visualize the number one three times. You are now at a deeper, healthier level of mind. To reach a deeper, healthier level of mind at any time, just take an occasional deep breath. To help you to enter a deeper, healthier level of mind, imagine that you’re sitting in front of a black velvet curtain. You’re very comfortable. Alongside your chair is a box with 10 white plastic numbers in it. The numbers are from 1 to 10. When you place one of these numbers on the black velvet curtain, the number sticks until you remove it. You’re going to take these numbers one by one and put them on the velvet curtain. First, you’ll put the number 10 on the curtain. Then you remove it and replace it with the number 9 and so on until you’ve put up and taken down the entire 10 numbers. First the number 10. Take your time. You will have plenty of time. Relax and begin. Relax. If you have not yet reached the number 1, take away whatever number you have on the curtain and replace it with the number one. Relax your eyes. Relax your lips. Relax your jaw. Relax your head and your neck. Relax your chest, your stomach. Relax your body, your arms and hands, your legs and feet. You are now completely relaxed. Repeat mentally after me. Every day I improve my image of myself. my self-esteem. I am a unique human being. There’s no one else on earth exactly like me. Every day I grow stronger in the realization that I can. I can think. I can create. I can do. Relax. Whenever you wish to relax and take a break from the stress of the outer world, recall what you feel at this moment. how relaxed you are. Now you’re going to imagine that you’re in the small hallway in front of the quantum door. On the other side of that door is a parallel universe with the situation that is keeping you from your goal. Your goal, your objective, may be something that you’ve wanted to do, or it may be something that you want to have. The goal you have in mind could be anything. Think now of a goal. something that you want to happen, something that you’ve wanted for a long time but don’t seem to be able to get. It might be that there’s something in your past that is keeping you from that goal. On the other side of the quantum door is an event. This event has something to do with whatever is preventing you from attaining your goal. When the door opens, just step through it and imagine that something is happening. It may seem to have nothing whatever to do with the goal that you’re striving for. Whatever scene comes up, just walk through it or view it. But let the scene play out. Scene will be something like a daydream. So just daydream it. I will now count from one to three. And at the count of three, you will be in the small hallway in front of the quantum door. One, two. 3. You are now in front of the quantum door. Imagine that. Pretend if you must, but visualize the door. I’m going to count from 1 to 3 once again, and this time the door will open, and you’ll step through to the parallel universe where the situation that is preventing you from attaining your goal is taking place. 1, 2, 3. The door is open. Imagine now that you’re jumping, floating, or stepping over the threshold into the universe where the scene that is keeping you from your goal is happening. It may seem that it has nothing to do with your goal, but just walk through the scene. Imagine that you’re there as an invisible observer. Sense that. Walk through the scene. Take your time. I will allow you plenty of time. Begin. Whatever is happening, just allow it to happen. Don’t try to control the scene. Just observe. What is your imagination bringing up? Whatever you sense is what’s keeping you from your goal. So just allow it to happen. Just kind of walk through it. Relax. Now, think about that scene again, but differently. In a moment, you will again go through the scene of whatever is keeping you from your goal. But this time, you’ll see the same scene, but speed things up. Sense the scene as though it were speeded up 10 times. Almost like you’re fast forwarding the scene. At the count of three, begin. Sense the scene. Speed it up as though it were speeded up 10 times. Everything much, much faster. And begin. Relax. You have now released those negative energies that have kept you from your goal. Just by going through the situation from long ago, the negative energies are released. Use this method of resolving problems whenever they are seemingly irresolvable. And now, relax. In a moment, I’m going to count from one to five. At that moment, you will open your eyes. You’ll be wide awake, feeling refreshed, feeling relieved, almost as though a great weight has been lifted from you, feeling better than before. One, two, three, four, five. Eyes open, wide awake. Now, let me speak just for a moment about the reason that we get so many good words about this goal-setting technique. Most goal-setting techniques require you to imagine your problem and then imagine the solution. Some use a bridge, some a mirror, some a stage. We use the stage sometimes. some a mantra, to accompany the visualizations. But this is different. We do imagine the problem, but more than imagine it, we create whatever has happened in the past to hamper the manifestation of the goal. But is it imaginary? In an infinite world, it has already happened. And that’s not make-believe. That’s reality. And then you just view or walk through the scene to release whatever forces are holding you back this quantum technique is a powerhouse and it’s automatic energies are being set for successful outcomes so use it often it’ll stand you in in good stead now the next module goes right along with this one it’s titled radiance and vitality and the meditation after that will be similar to this one It will be taking you, however, to a past life situation that you’re going to be walking through. And that one should be listened to after you’ve used this meditation. Thank you.

Audio 1: Clearing Up Your Past Lives
--------------------

CD 7, Discovering Yourself with a Self -Reflection Jump. Module 20, Clearing Up Past Lives. Some years ago, I was in Europe training hypnotists in the art of hypnotherapy. The seminar was called HypnoVision. Part of the course was involved with past life therapy. The idea was to put a person in a trance and then direct them to the past life that was having an effect on the present one. Oddly enough, it didn’t take a belief in reincarnation to be successful in the process, just to do it. At the time of this particular story, it was in Amsterdam, Holland, or the Netherlands, if you will. It was a young woman in the class who was there to learn hypnosis and to see if there was anything in the class that could help her. Her problem was that she would take small patches of hair in her fingers, her hair, and rip it out, take it out of her head and eyebrows and anywhere else hair grew. She’d been to psychologists and medical doctors. Nobody seemed to be able to help. And I had since discovered that this is not uncommon. There’s even a name for the problem. Trick. And it means hair -pulling frenzy. Well, I hypnotized her and I guided her to a past life. She gave an account of being in a cellar with a soldier during one of the world wars. We didn’t know which one. She was wearing his cap. And that was about it. She was in a cellar with a soldier wearing his cap. She was walked through the scene a few times. And that was it. She reported a week later that her compulsion to pull her hair out seemed to have been gone. She didn’t have to pull her hair out, which was quite a thing. Well, after doing this type of a process a few times, I came to the conclusion that the scenes seem to have nothing to do with the problem. That doesn’t matter. Whatever emerges during the trance, is what is dealt with. Another case was a woman who was afraid of heights, deathly afraid of heights. One visit to a past life that was having an effect on the problem, and her fear was gone. Another case was a person who couldn’t look up, a psychological affliction that responded well to past life therapy. Again and again, past life therapy seemed to be the answer to just about any problem that resisted the efforts of the healers. Now then, you might ask, what has this to do with quantum jumping? Well, let’s just see. I can’t honestly say that there is such a thing as reincarnation, even though billions of people believe it, any more than I can say that we’re really going to a parallel universe, although many eminent scientists believe it. But there are no actual facts to support it. There are no facts to support any religion either, just faith. And so let us see what happens when we rely on faith and the belief that there are parallel infinite dimensions in universes and that going to them mentally can actually help with problems. Actually, I find that in using the quantum jump and going through the scenario that you kind of daydream things happen. As long as you have some sort of intention before you meditate and step through the doorway to a parallel universe and a twin self, then you’ll succeed. Jerry Goldsmith was having a problem with his wife. Fairly typical family squabbles were taking the couple to a point of no return. Jerry wanted to know if quantum jumping could help in a relationship. If it could, where could he jump? What self? Where would he wind up? And what could he say when he got there? This was during a seminar I was holding, and so I was there for the entire process. I told Jerry that first of all, he had to have intent. Before he would go through the door, his intent would be to go to the parallel universe where the answer to his relationship was and just walk through it. Jerry went into a meditation, imagined the door, stepped over the threshold. and he saw himself with his wife, as though you’re watching a play or a movie. After a bit, he merged with his twin self and just kind of hung out. Nothing elaborate, no big deal, just kind of a walkthrough, similar to the past life walkthroughs. When he came out of the meditation, he was quiet. The next day, back at the seminar, Jerry was all smiles. He didn’t know exactly what had happened. but he’d spent a very satisfying evening with his wife, and they decided to take another crack at keeping the marriage together. I did hear from Jerry a few months later, and he was raving about how happy he was, and now use quantum jumping for just about everything. To simplify it, ask yourself prior to every jump, what is your intent? Is it just to relax, to solve a problem, to overcome a situation, to get rid of anger? Is it for information that’s buried in your subconscious? Whatever it is, have that intention in your mind when you first meditate before the jump. You might think about it while you’re in the hallway in front of the door. And then, wherever you imagine yourself to be, just walk through the scene like a daydream. and you should see positive results. Now, let’s get back to this past life business. Due to the unlimited variety of scenarios in an infinite universe, not only are you everything that can be imagined, but every life of yours, past, present, and future, are there as well. Infinity is an endless production. Do recall our theme. Whatever can be imagined, is in an infinite universe. Do you believe in past lives? You’re right. You’ve lived them. Do you believe that there’s no such thing as a past life? You’re right. You see, in an infinite universe, everyone is right. Because in one of those universes, whatever it is you believe is. But for this module, we will assume that there have been past lives and that you have lived them. Also that some of those past lives have had and are having an effect on your present life. Which past life? Well, let’s see. I mentioned before that when a person is in a trance and they go through a past life that is having an effect on the present one, all they have to do is to walk through the scene. Pretty much the same thing happens when quantum jumping. For this process, instead of trance, we use meditation. First of all, you decide on what you intend to accomplish with the quantum jump. Say that you’re unhappy about a situation you’re involved with. The issue could be… a relationship, an anger issue, it could be a health problem, just about anything. Your intent is to go to a twin self in a parallel dimension who has resolved that same problem. That’s all. You have set intent and it only remains to meditate. Imagine the door opening, walk through it, and just go with whatever comes up. There will be some sort of a scene. Create it. Daydream, whatever. Whatever scene comes up will be right. And just imagine going through whatever comes up. Walk through the scene. Your intention that wherever you are will relieve the problem you’re facing will take you to the place that you should be. To use the quantum jump as I do, as I do with hypnotherapy and past life therapy, the quantum jump… virtually the same thing. You go into the meditative state. When you’re totally relaxed, you say to yourself, I want to go to a past life that is having an effect on this one. Or if you have a specific problem, say your foot hurts. You say, I want to go into a past life that is having an effect on my foot hurting. Then open the door and you’ll be in a past life that’s creating the problem of your foot hurting. Just walk through the scene. And if the scene is fuzzy and unclear, it doesn’t matter. Go through whatever. As it comes, whatever comes up is correct for you. Fred Barron had a foot problem that caused a slight limp. He jumped to a past life and found himself as a soldier in the American Civil War. He went along with the scene that seemingly had nothing to do with his foot. But when he came out of the meditation, his foot was fine. No more pain. No more limp. Here’s one that many of you will love. Weight control. Pauline Fargo was overweight. She was always on a diet, but nothing seemed to work. She’d lose 30 pounds after tormenting herself with food she didn’t like. And then when off the diet, she put the weight back on with an additional five pounds added for good measure. Would a quantum jump into a past life help her? Why not? It’s a problem, and past life quantum jumping is to solve problems, isn’t it? Well, deep in meditation she went. And she said, I want to go to a past life that is having an effect on my weight. I want my weight to be what it was last year, as she imagined herself in front of the quantum door. Going through the door, she found herself in a forest. She was nibbling on something she picked up from the forest floor. That was as clear as she could make the images. But she went along with it. And after a while, she came out of her meditation. She went off her diet after that, just eating what she considered healthy food. Somehow, she’d lost her appetite for sugared desserts and starches. But she ate just about everything else. And wonder of wonders, she began to lose weight. A pound here, a pound there, and pretty soon she was at the weight that she wanted. Now, what is it that causes this seemingly magical effect? You just walk through a scene that you daydream, that sometimes seems to have nothing to do with the problem. As a matter of fact, most of the time, it seems to have nothing to do with the problem. And you just walk through it, you daydream it. And the problem is resolved? Now, how can that be? Well, I’ve got to be honest with you. I’m not sure. I don’t know. I know it works time and again. I’ve seen it work. Not every single time. I’ve said again and again, I don’t know anything that works every single time. But it does work enough of the time to put you a giant step ahead. Quantum jumping into a past life to solve a problem in this life. can be one of your best resources. Use it whenever you have a problem that seems difficult to solve. In one of the following modules, I’m going to be discussing a unique concept that I doubt very much you’re familiar with, or indeed have ever even heard anything about. And that is going to a future self, a future life, and getting help from that side of the universe. Remember again the concept of quantum physics with respect to the infinity of universes. Whatever can be imagined is in an infinite universe. But before that, I’m going to introduce you to a quantum jump into a past life. A life that’s having a negative effect in some aspect of your present life. You don’t have to concern yourself with where you’re going, as it will all be at the meditative level where you’ll kind of daydream. as I guide you. For now, just think about a problem you have. Might be a business problem, a relationship problem, a personal problem, anything that you believe you can be better or do better at. Think about that problem. And when you hear me on the next module, I will simply refer to it as the problem. So, find a place where you’ll be undisturbed for 20 minutes or so. Relax. And here comes the next meditation on Module 21.



--------------------
Meditation: The Past Life Cleansing Meditation
--------------------

Module 21, Past Life Cleansing Meditation. This is a different type of meditation. It’s shorter. We don’t use the same method of getting to the meditative state. So just close your eyes and relax. And in a few moments, I will guide you to the quantum jumping door. You know that we believe in the quantum physics idea of infinite universes. In one of those infinity of universes, there is a past life of yours, a life that’s having a negative effect on your present life. By going to that past life and seeing what is happening that has an effect on your present life, the burden is lifted. but invisible. Just imagine that you’re in a past life, a past life that’s holding you back because of some karmic condition. Now, there are those who say, if it’s karma, then nothing you can do will stop it. To which I would say, maybe it’s your karma to listen to me now to overcome the problem. And who’s to say it isn’t? So for now, just kind of go with the flow and pretend. And if it works for you, well, Isn’t that all we’re really looking for? Okay. Right now, pretend or daydream, if you will, that when I count from one to three, as I’m going to now, you get more and more relaxed. So just pretend that each number will relax you more and more. One, just allow yourself to relax. Two, just… Allow yourself to relax and listen to my words. Three, you are now more and more relaxed. So you may now close your eyes if you haven’t done so. And now relax your head and your neck. Relax your shoulders and arms and hands. Relax your chest and stomach. Relax your legs and feet. You are now entirely and completely relaxed. I’m going to count from one to three, and you’ll be in a hallway in front of the quantum door. Before I do, think about a particular problem that you have. And relax. One, two, three. You are now in the small hallway. In front of you is the door, the quantum door that opens to infinity. In a moment, you’ll be walking through that door into a universe where a past life of yours is now going on. There is no time in infinity, as everything that can be imagined is happening now. The past life is a life that’s holding you back in some way. It’s a life that had instigated a problem for you. When you go through the door, you will see a scene with you as the main actor. Whatever your imagination brings up will be the right one. If it wasn’t, it wouldn’t have been brought up. So just view the scene. It may be a scene from another country. It may be a scene from another time. And it may not. Anything that you imagine will be what you are supposed to be viewing. Whatever you see, whatever you sense, just kind of walk through the scene as though you were an invisible observer. And observe. Take your time. And now the door is opening and the door is open. At the count of three, jump or step through the door. and you’ll be at a past life experience. A life that’s having a negative effect on your present problem. Imagine that. Know it. Create it and daydream that you’re walking through the scene. Just relax. Whatever the scene is, it will have an effect on the problem. That’s your intention. Okay? One, two, three. You are now there. Relax. Take your time. You will have plenty of time. Begin. Relax. And now once again, visualize the scene, but this time at 10 times the speed. Go through the scene again as though you’re fast -forwarding very, very quickly. Just imagine you’re going through the scene at 10 times the speed. Same scene. Begin. Relax. I’m now going to count from one to three, and you’ll be back in this universe, back in the small hallway. One, two, three. You are now back in the small hallway. The quantum door is closing. The quantum door is closed. I will now count from one to five, and at the count of five, you’ll be wide awake, feeling wonderfully refreshed. two, three, coming out slowly now, four, and five. Wide awake, feeling wonderfully refreshed, feeling better than before. Thank you.

Lesson 37: Instant Rejuvenation With Quantum Healing

--------------------

The Story Behind Quantum Healing
Burt will be sharing with you the story of Dr. Emil Coue, the French pharmacist and psychologist.

You will discover how his ultimate healing exercise successfully cured tens of thousands of people of physical and mental illnesses.

--------------------
Audio 1: The Story Behind Quantum Healing
--------------------

CD 8, Instant Rejuvenation with Quantum Healing, Module 22, The Story Behind Quantum Healing. The question may come up as to what to use quantum healing for. Seems obvious, actually, but allow me to make a few suggestions. This is a technique that I’ve taught to professional healthcare providers for many years, indeed decades. to relax a person so that all emotions are more or less neutralized. Now that can be a valuable asset to both the provider and the patient or the client. When the person comes out of meditation or trance and goes right back in the second time, they go deeper. I’ve referred to this in a previous module. The third time, deeper still. What about a fourth time and a fifth? Well, that’s not necessary, nor do I recommend it. I found three times to be the optimum depth for whatever it is that you’re working on. If you’re ill or in any pain, then it is recommended that you use quantum healing. Because so many people at some time in their lives do go through a trying period. I’ve included here a meditation from the original master of the alternate healing school, Emile Couet. I’ll tell you a little bit about Couet in a moment if you have not heard of him. This takes nothing away from the medical profession and should not replace standard medical care. We always suggest, first and foremost, to go to your doctor when you have a medical problem. Alternate… Healing methods such as quantum healing should only be used as an adjunct to medical care. The creator of alternate healing methods was Emile Couet. Couet was a French pharmacist and psychologist who practiced over a hundred years ago. His book, Suggestion and Autosuggestion, caused quite a stir in Europe and in the United States. And the phrase he coined is used even today. You may have heard it. Every day, in every way, I’m getting better and better. And that was Emil Coué. Aside from that, and not generally known, Dr. Coué had a long mantra, if you can call it that, that healed tens of thousands of people and made him an international personality and celebrity. More on that in a little bit. Suffice it to say at this time that on the next module, you’ll find the best way to use quantum healing to its utmost benefit. I’m going to use the depth of meditation to get the most out of Emile Kuei’s ultimate healing method. Now, thousands of people, tens of thousands of people have attested to its effectiveness, and none of them had the opportunity that you have, that of combining the master healer’s method with quantum jumping. But before we get into that, I’d like to tell you a little story about how one of my graduates used Kuwait’s method in a different manner. I was told this story many years ago in the early 80s. I was talking about the seeming miracles that Kuwait had accomplished, oh, around the year 1910, when a woman in the class held up her hand. The woman, Gladys was her name, A member of an international tire family, she was a story in herself. At the time of the seminar, she was 99 years of age, just shy of 100. And she surprised everyone in the class as to her interest in new things. I nodded to Gladys, and she said, I knew Emile Coué. It was through him that I found the man I was to fall in love with and be with all of my life. Well now, that was a story the whole class wanted to hear. It’s not often I have someone in the class who has actually seen and spoken to one of these giants that I occasionally speak of. Gladys’ eyes half closed as memories poured over her and she softly spoke. I was in France, in the town of Nancy, where Dr. Couet lived and practiced. I had gone to him for a pain in my back, and he gave me a cord with 21 knots in it. I was to take the cord in my hand and use it like prayer beads or a rosary. Each time I felt a knot in my fingers, I was to say, every day, in every respect, I am getting better and better. until I had said it 21 times. The knots were to keep track. Well, I did that for three days, and suddenly my back pain was gone. I went back to see Dr. Couet and told him the pain had gone, but he only gave me kind of a Gaelic shrug, as only the French can do, as though to say, well, what did you expect? Oh, she said. I was so young then, so filled with hope and wonder. I don’t know why, but I asked. I said, oh, Dr. Kuwait, if only these knots could help me find the love of my life, I would be forever grateful. He smiled at that, and he said, but it can. My dear young woman, it is not the knots that do it, but your intent. The knots are like a magnifying glass that brings your intention to the notice of hidden energies. Each time you make a suggestion and feel a knot, a veritable storm of energies fly out into the ether to seek out a like energy to manifest. It’s strange, she said. but I seemed to recall very clearly his words. A veritable storm of energies fly out into the ether. I didn’t understand a word of it, but I wouldn’t have parted with that knotted cord for anything. On the ship back to the United States, I played with that knotted cord every day. About halfway home, we were three days out. A thought suddenly came to me. It was almost as if Kuwait was sending me his thoughts. I took the cord in my hand, felt the first knot, and I said, Every day the love of my life is getting closer and closer. I moved the cord through my fingers until I got to the second knot and repeated the words, Every day the love of my life is getting closer and closer. I did that three times a day for the rest of the journey. Finally, we arrived in New York and docked. There on the dock waiting to meet me were my friends and a few relatives. Among the group was a young man I did not know. He turned out to be the brother of a friend of mine who wanted to see the ship come in. I stood at the rail and waved at my friends, but my eyes were only for the young man standing beside them. Gladys’ eyes. closed and she was quiet for a long moment. Not a person in that room said a word, all waiting for the end of the story. Finally, her eyes misting, opened, and she continued, I know it’s hard to believe. But I fell in love with that young man before I heard him speak, before I knew him, before we were introduced, while I was standing at the rail of the ship, waiting to disembark. Well, we were married and stayed in love for more than 50 years. And I should also tell you that the cord that Dr. Emile Couet gave me a lifetime ago is still one of my most precious possessions. Well, friends, that was a class that’s hard to forget. I often think about Emile Coué and the methods he used a century ago. Many of the techniques of mine came from his methods. Oh, they’ve been upgraded and modernized, but the principles are the same. I don’t know what Coué would have said about quantum jumping, but I’m pretty sure. He would have understood it in principle. I did a lot of research on Emile Coué, read everything by and about him, and taught his methods for many years. I even wrote a book about some of his work in 1979 with a graduate and friend. The title, Better and Better. At one point in my investigations, I came upon something that had apparently worked to keep people in good health and overcome many physical as well as more than a few mental problems as well. It was a suggestion meditation that Kuwait had developed somewhere around 1898. Basically, his argument was that when the will and the imagination were in conflict, imagination would invariably win. And so if you wanted to be healed, but your imagination was telling you it was useless, unless you got your imagination working with you, you were doomed to be ill. And of course, quantum jumping does take that into consideration because what we do is work with your imagination. Now, my friend, you are going to be privy to Kuwait’s original clearinghouse of ills. And even better, we’re going to visit Dr. Emil Kuwait, who is still alive and well in a parallel universe. Remember. that in an infinity of universes, everything can be imagined is happening now. One of those universes, Emile Coué, is at the height of his power. In another, he’s a child. In another, well, he is as he is now. So, in the following module, we will jump to a parallel universe, but this time, not to a twin self, but to Emile Coué’s class that he held in the backyard. of his home in Nancy, France, under the big tree where he sat while reading the clearinghouse of ills to his patients. Just imagine it all as I guide you to the hallway and back three times and then through the door and into a universe where Emile Coué is still actively practicing his alternate methods of healing and staying in good health.

Meditation 1: The Coue Quantum Healing Meditation
--------------------

Module 23, Quantum Healing, the Coue Quantum Healing Meditation. This is the quantum healing method of deepening your meditations. Use the technique of going into and coming out of the meditation three times consecutively, and you’ll find yourself more concentrative and better able to relax and allow your body to adjust itself to a better place. Find a comfortable position. Close your eyes. Take a deep breath. And while exhaling, mentally repeat and visualize the number three, three times. As you mentally repeat each number, repeat it at less volume, like this. Three, three, three. Take another deep breath. And while exhaling, mentally repeat and visualize the number two, three times, in the same manner. Take another deep breath and while exhaling, mentally repeat and visualize the number one three times in that same manner. I will now count from one to three and you will project yourself to the hallway that contains the quantum door. One, two, three. You are now in the hallway. In front of you is the quantum door. Relax. Now at the count of three, your eyes will open. You’ll be wide awake. One, two, three. Eyes open, fully aware. I will now count from one to three, and you will project yourself back to the hallway that contains the quantum door. One, two, three. You are now in the hallway. In front of you is the quantum door. Relax. Now at the count of three, your eyes will open. and you will come to full awareness. One, two, three. Eyes open, wide awake. I will now count from one to three, and you will project yourself to the hallway that contains the quantum door. One, two, three. You are now in the hallway. In front of you is the quantum door. Relax. To count to three, your eyes will open. You will come to full awareness. two, three. Eyes open, wide awake. Now, once again, I will count from one to three, and you will close your eyes and project yourself to the hallway that contains the quantum door. One, two, three. You are now in the hallway. The quantum door is closed. In a moment, the door will open, and you’ll step through into a parallel universe. You will step through and be in a universe where Emil Kuwey is alive and well and is about to read to his friends and patients his ultimate healing exercise. One, two, three. The quantum door is opening. The door is now open. Step through and imagine. You are in the backyard garden of Dr. Kuei. Dr. Kuei is sitting under a tree, sitting on a bench, about to read his exercise for health and vitality. Imagine it. Know that you’re there. Create it. Now imagine the words you hear are coming from the mouth of Emil Kuei. Relax. Find a comfortable position and close your eyes. Your eyes are closed so that your attention will not be distracted by any outside stimulus. Tell yourself that every word I say is going to be fixed and impressed in your mind. It will be engraved on your mind so that your imagination can create the positive result that you are seeking. that without your will or knowledge, and unconsciously on your part, yourself and your entire physical and mental being will obey. Tell yourself that the words you are about to hear will be programmed on your mind. Three times a day, in the morning, at midday, and in the evening, at your usual mealtimes, you will feel hungry. You will experience the agreeable sensation which makes you think of something nutritious to eat. You will learn about the nutritious foods and enjoy eating what you know is good for you. You will eat and enjoy your food without overeating. You will be careful to chew your food well so as to pre -digest it before swallowing. You will digest your food properly and feel no discomfort, no inconvenience or pain of any kind, either in the stomach or intestines. You will assimilate what you eat and your body and cells will make use of it to make blood, muscle, energy and strength. Because you will have digested your food properly, the elimination of waste material will be normal. and every morning after rising you will feel the need of evacuating the bowels, and without ever being obliged to take medicine or to use artificial methods, you will obtain a normal and satisfactory result. Every evening when you wish to go to sleep until the time you wish to wake the next morning, you will sleep deeply, calmly, and quietly. with pleasant and creative dreams, and on waking you will feel well, cheerful, and active. If you occasionally suffer from depression or if you are gloomy and prone to worry and look on the dark side of things, from now onwards you will stop doing that, and instead of worrying and being depressed and looking at the dark side of things, You’re going to feel perfectly cheerful even if you have real reason to be worried and depressed. You will look at the positive side of things and you will be cheerful. If you are subject to occasional fits of impatience or ill temper, you will stop having them. On the contrary, you will always be patient and the master of yourself and the things which… Worried, annoyed, or irritated you will, from this time forward, leave you indifferent and calm. You are sometimes haunted by bad and unwholesome ideas, by apprehensions, fears, aversions, temptations, or grudges against other people. All that will gradually be lost sight of by your imagination and will melt away and lose itself as though in a distant cloud, where it will disappear completely. Just like a dream vanishes when we awake, so will all these vain images. disappear. Your organs are performing their functions properly. Your heart beats in a normal way and the circulation of the blood takes place as it should. The lungs are carrying out their functions as is the stomach, the intestines, the liver, kidneys, gallbladder, and bladder. If at present any of your organs is acting abnormally, that abnormality is becoming less every day, so that quite soon it will have vanished completely and the organ will have recovered its normal function. If there should be any lesions on any of these organs, they will get better from day to day and will soon be entirely healed. It is not necessary to know which organ is affected for it to be cured. Under the influence of the auto -suggestion, every day, in every respect, I am getting better and better. The subconscious acts upon the organ, which it can place to self -confidence, based on the knowledge of this force of unlimited power which is in each one of us. It is absolutely necessary for every human being to have this confidence. Without it, one can accomplish nothing. With it, one can accomplish whatever one likes. That is within reason. You are going to have confidence in yourself, and this confidence gives you the assurance that you are capable of accomplishing perfectly well. Whatever you wish to do, on condition that it is reasonable and whatever it is your duty to do. When you wish to do something reasonable or when you have a duty to perform, always think that it is easy and make the words difficult, impossible, I cannot, it is stronger than I, I cannot prevent myself from, disappear from your vocabulary. They are not your words. What are your words is, it is easy, and I can. By considering the thing easy, it becomes easy for you, although it might seem difficult for others. You will do it quickly and well and without fatigue, because you do it without effort. If you had considered it as difficult or impossible, it would have become so for you simply because you would have thought it so. And so from every point of view, physical as well as mental, you’re going to enjoy excellent health, better health than you’ve been able to enjoy up to the present. Relax. Relax. Repeat mentally. I feel better and better. I see the good in myself. I have a positive viewpoint toward myself. Every day I get more and more confident. in my own abilities. Relax. In a moment, I’m going to count from one to five. At the count of five, you’ll project yourself back to the hallway, and then you will open your eyes. You will be wide awake, feeling better than you did before. You will be more and more able to see the good side of things and of people. And every morning, you will feel better than you did the day before. One, two, three, four, five. Eyes open, wide awake, feeling better than before.

Audio 2: Helping Others With Quantum Healing
--------------------

Module 24, Helping Others with Quantum Healing. We all have someone in our lives who would like to help, but quite often don’t know how. Just how do you extend that help? People may resent the fact that you’re trying to lend a hand, feeling embarrassed at the fact they need help in the first place. Of course, if it’s someone who’s ill, help is always welcome. But aside from that, think of the people in your life who would profit if you had a magic wand that you could wave over them and take away their pain. Oh, perhaps they’re low achievers or seem accident prone or maybe they’re always in the wrong place at the wrong time or dissatisfied with life or generally just don’t feel like life is treating them the way they should be treated. Well, to some extent, you can help them. by utilizing the energies of quantum jumping. We find that this helps in your own growth as well. To help another person, especially anonymously, is the highest form of altruism and will support and enhance your own spiritual nature and bring about many good things to your true self. Occasionally, there may be someone that you’d like to connect with, but don’t quite know how. Or there may be someone you know who is ill, who’s sick, who you want to help, but don’t quite know how. I should say that at this time, I’ll be working on a new quantum jumping program to launch sometime in 2010. You’ll be notified when it’s available, but that program will be strictly for those of you who’ve gone through the QJ1 and 2 material, as quantum jumping 3 will be a bit too much. for anyone unfamiliar with the concepts. As an example, I’m going to show you now how to utilize the quantum jump to help a person in need, and also to kind of peek into tomorrow. What I’m now working on is the psychic side of quantum jumping. After all, in an infinite universe, whatever can be imagined is somewhere. Should prove to be interesting. But let’s get back to now. In the meanwhile. Let’s get back to helping others with a quantum jump. Let me tell you how Harriet Trejo did it. Harriet’s dog Wolfie was ill. He was listless, wouldn’t eat, and was seemingly just wasting away. She went into her meditation level and imagined herself at the hallway in front of the quantum door. She mentally formed the words, I want to go to a parallel universe where the world’s greatest veterinarian is curing my dog Wolfie. The door opened. She stepped through and imagined herself with Wolfie and the vet alongside her treating Wolfie. He sprayed an elixir over Wolfie, and he got up and ran off and ran around in circles. Wolfie did, not the vet. He was full of life. He came back to Harriet, who then imagined them both walking off and playing. She sustained the image for quite a while, she said. And when she came up out of her meditation, Wolfie licked her face and went to his bed to go to sleep. The next morning, it was his old self again, eating and barking to be let out into the backyard. Harriet told me it may have been a coincidence, but whatever it was, he was his old self again. Then she asked me a very pertinent question. Can I do that for a human also? Well, of course, that’s what it was for. She just happened to use it for an animal. If it can be used for a human being, it certainly can be used for an animal, because that’s what you’re going to do right now, use it for a human being. The next module is really just a practice module for helping and healing other people. I’ll guide you through this one, but you can easily do this yourself. And, of course, after you’ve become more familiar with the concept of quantum jumping into someone else’s reality, Then you’ll be better equipped and more familiar with the true power of the quantum jump. The idea behind the healing jump is to go to a universe where the healers are so advanced, they just wave an energy rod over the problem area of the person and that’s it. You may have your own ideas to the universe that you want to travel to. Perhaps a different method of healing. For this practice run, we’ll use the energy rod. When you step over the threshold of the quantum door, you’ll find yourself in the operating room of a hospital of the future. There’ll be a table there. On that table, you’ll imagine the person you pick to be involved with the healing. Get a sense that you’re watching. You’re an observer only. But you can see the doctor looking over the person on the table, taking the energy rod and waving the energy rod over the body of the person being healed. After that, visualize the person getting up from the table, shaking the doctor’s hand, and then shaking your hand and smiling. See the person walking briskly away, and that’s it. Simple, but effective. A quantum healing. Before you listen to the next module, please have someone in mind who you would like to help.

Meditation 2: The Quantum Healing Others Meditation
--------------------

Module 25, The Meditation for Quantum Healing Others. This is the quantum healing method of deepening your meditations. Use the technique of going into and coming out of the meditation three times consecutively and you’ll find yourself more concentrated and better able to relax and allow your body to adjust itself to a better place. For the quantum healing, You want to be very deep. And so we’ll use the three in and three out method of deepening. So find a comfortable position. Close your eyes. Take a deep breath. And while exhaling, mentally repeat and visualize the number three, three times. As you mentally repeat each number, mentally repeat it at lesser and lesser volume. As example, three, three, three. Take another deep breath, and while exhaling, mentally repeat and visualize the number two in the same manner. Take another deep breath, and while exhaling, mentally repeat and visualize the number one three times in the same manner. I will now count from one to three, and at the count of three, you will project yourself to the hallway that contains the quantum door. One, two, three. You are now in the hallway. In front of you is the quantum door. Relax. Now at the count of three, you will leave the hallway, open your eyes, and come to full awareness. One, two, three. Eyes open, wide awake. I will count from one to three, and you will project yourself back to the hallway that contains the quantum door. Close your eyes. One, two, three. You are now in the hallway. In front of you is a quantum door. Relax. At the count of three, you will open your eyes, leave the hallway, and come to full awareness, wide awake. One, two, three. Eyes open, wide awake. I will now count from one to three, and you will project yourself to the hallway that contains the quantum door. Eyes closed. One, two, three. You are now… in the hallway. In front of you is a quantum door. Relax. At the count of three, you will open your eyes and come to full awareness. One, two, three. Eyes open. Eyes closed. I will count from one to three. You will project yourself to the hallway that contains the quantum door. One, two, three. You are now in the hallway. The quantum door is closed. In a moment, the door will open and you will step through into a parallel universe. You will step through and be in a universe where a great doctor is waiting to help with whoever it is. You have a desire to be of help too. At the count to three, the door will open and you will step through to be in a futuristic hospital operating room. It will be in a parallel. universe. One, two, three. The quantum door is opening. The door is open. Step through and imagine that you’re in the hospital operating room of the future. A doctor is standing by. Imagine it. Know that you’re there. Create it. I’m going to count from one to three, and at the count of three, the person you wish to help. will be laying on the table that is in the center of the hospital operating room. The doctor is standing by. One, two, three. The person you’re helping is now lying on the table. The doctor walks over to the table. In the doctor’s hand is an energy rod. The doctor waves the energy rod over the body of the person that you’re helping. Imagine that. Daydream the scene if you must, but do get a sense of the scene. Now see the person that you’re helping get up and off the table. The person smiles, shakes hands with the doctor, then comes over to you and shakes your hand. And now the person walks away briskly. Relax. You may help as many people as you wish with this method. In a moment, I’m going to count from one to five. At the count of five, you’ll project yourself back to the hallway. And then you will open your eyes, be wide awake, feeling better than you did before. You will more and more see the good side of things and of people. And every morning you’ll feel better than you did the day before. One, two, three, four, five. Eyes open, wide awake, feeling wonderfully refreshed, feeling wonderful because you have done your best. to help someone else in need. You feel better than before. Thank you.

Burt will show you his unusual solution to helping emotionally scarred World War 2 survivor, Ursula Becker overcome a lifetime of crippling trauma.

Are you on your right path? You will learn the indicator to look for that tells you to make a change in your life.

--------------------
Audio 1: How to Find Your True-Self
--------------------

CD 9, The Reverse Jump and Your True Self. Module 26, How to Find Your True Self. Your True Self. Now, what does that mean? Let me simplify that. When you were an infant, you were brought up differently from every other person on the planet. Unless you’re an identical twin. a triplet, etc. But even then, one small event that took place that your sibling was not involved with could have changed everything for you. You were no doubt brought up with love, but even if you had the most loving parents on earth, there was still an influence on your beliefs, on your principles, and on your attitude. Let me tell you a story about a woman who was brought up with love until something interfered to wipe out all the love. all the goodness in her life. I was training a group of hypnotists in how to use hypnosis to overcome trauma, something of a highly negative nature that has happened in the past. This particular seminar took place in Frankfurt, Germany. Ursula Becker was a woman in the class who’d gone through the latter part of World War II as a youngster. She was nine years old in 1945. and went through the bombing of Berlin. The strongest memory was that of being in a shelter. It was an underground train station and jam -packed with people. She recalls her greatest concern was not the bombs, they were all used to that, but of her mother finding her and her two sisters a corner somewhere so that they would be comfortable for the night. The muffled sound of bombs exploding was so constant that no one paid them any mind. But then one night something happened to change her comfort level. The ceiling caved in and there was devastation in the place. She recalled the incident as somewhat fuzzy, running around in a panic, looking for her mother and sisters, but they were nowhere to be found. Three days would pass before they all got together again. Now whatever self she might have been was gone from that incident. What would her true self have been? were it not for that traumatic experience. I found out later that Ursula wasn’t in the class to learn hypnotherapy. She was there because she hoped to receive some. During the five -day class, other students, during the practice sessions, they worked with Ursula and her problems in the present, but to no avail. Nothing seemed to help. Ursula was a mess. She was anorexic, she was a hypochondriac, she was afraid of people, and she’d been a recluse for 10 years. Her younger sister, Alma, who had gone through the same event, didn’t seem to have been bothered by it at all and had a nice family of her own along with a loving and successful husband. Alma is the one who was trying to pull Ursula out of her shell and practically dragged her to the seminar. Now this was a good opportunity for me to see if a quantum jump, or actually at that time I called it a quantum leap, would that work? Hypnosis didn’t seem to have an effect on Ursula. She was just as morose after the third day as she was when she arrived in the class. I was just starting my research into the parallel universe idea and asked both Alma and Ursula, If they would object to my doing something, they might consider a bit unusual. Well, Alma was ready for anything. Ursula just shrugged. I briefly explained the premise of infinite universes and the concept of twin selves and doppelgangers. That’s when I discovered the word doppelganger was of German origin and meant double walker. Ursula perked up a bit when she heard the word as everything I said was repeated by an interpreter. I was working with interpreters there because I don’t speak any German at all. My interpreter was a good one, and I’ve used her many times in the past, both in Germany and Austria and in Zurich, the German -speaking part of Switzerland. But for ease of explanation, I’ll tell the story as though I were speaking directly to Ursula. I told Ursula that her true self, the self that might have been, the one that she would be if there had been no bombing, no shelters, and no war, that self could be brought back, just as if nothing had interfered with her normal childhood. What we were going to do was go to a place where she had a normal childhood with no traumas, a place that still existed in a universe parallel to our own, but could only be arrived at mentally. But there she would find her doppelganger, who had known only sweet words and loving kindness from her parents, from her teachers, from her friends. A world that exists and takes but a thought to get to. I explained that due to the magic of infinity, there is no time. All things are in the now. And that little girl that was the true self of Ursula still existed. at the very age she had experienced all that trauma. But her doppelganger had no such experience. Her doppelganger was her true self, the self that might have been. I then asked Ursula if she would like to visit that nine -year -old self. What do I have to do? She asked. As this was a training class for hypnotherapists, I explained to the class that this was a new therapy I was still working out. and doing research on, but that it had helped many others in different situations. And the idea behind it was to mix up the trauma with the world of the true self, the one that might have been. And during that process, the problems that came about due to the trauma were often neutralized and even erased from the person’s mind. What is going to happen, I explained to Ursula, as well as the class, is that you’ll be going… mentally, of course, to a universe where that nine -year -old you knew nothing about war, nothing about bombings or shelters. The nine -year -old you that you will be visiting, your doppelganger, will be a true self, an untarnished self that has no negative programming at all. Just imagine it as I guide you through the event. Well, aren’t you going to hypnotize me? Ursula asked. No, I said, not for this. For this process, we will only use meditation, as I want you to be free to control the situation yourself and not wait for me to give you direction. What we will do is to take you to two situations, two double gangers. One of them will be the one you remember, that you in the bomb shelter with bombs going off overhead, and you being alone for three days. after the ceiling caved in, scared out of your wits. The other situation will be your true self, the one that might have been had there been no war, no shelters. You’ll visit both places as I guide you, and you’ll switch from one to the other, back and forth, three times. Then I spoke to the class. What we’re doing here is taking the positive energies… one situation and mixing them up with the negative energies of the other situation. When the negative energies blend with the positive, they neutralize one another and dissipate. This technique can be used for all kinds of situations. I recall I used it once for a young lady who was almost hit by a car when crossing the street. And from that time on, she was terrified of crossing any street. By mixing the situation of her close call with another of her crossing streets normally, the trauma dissipated and disappeared after one session. I was trusting and hoping that is what would happen with Ursula. Well, I guided her through the meditation and then had her in the hallway in front of the quantum door. The door opened and she went into the scene of the ceiling caving in with a tumult of the event. She imagined seeing herself crying in a panic. Then I told her to go back to the hallway, and once again she went through the quantum door, but this time on the other side was her true self, in a universe where there was no war, no shelters, no bombs, just a loving family and a happy home. The first universe was called false self. The second was called true self. I then said, Ursula, I’m going to clap my hands, and each time I do, you’ll switch universes. The first time I clap, you’ll jump to your false self in the shelter. The next time I clap my hands, you’ll jump to your true self with your loving family and happy home. Well, I directed her back to the hallway and the following took place. False self, I clap my hands. True self, I clap my hands. False self, I clap my hands. True self, I clap my hands. False self, I clapped my hands. True self, I clapped my hands. Now back to the hallway. I’m going to count from one to three. Your eyes will open. You’ll be wide awake. One, two, three, eyes open, wide awake. And that was it. Now, there wouldn’t be much of a story here if Ursula remained the same. Her entire attitude, along with her countenance, she looked different. She looked relaxed, and she smiled for the first time in months. Her sister said, the next day Alma thanked me for bringing her sister back to life. The things that cover up and hide your true self are the events and the suggestions made by all those authority figures in your life, usually before your teen years. You know what they are. This is outside programming by authority figures like parents, your friends, your religious teachers, educational teachers. the media, and life in general. Now, this is not to say that outside influences are not important. They are. But all of them place some burden on the true self. Somewhere there in a multitude of parallel universes is your true self, the self that was meant to be, unblemished by outside material, looking only within one’s self for direction. For always there are forks in the road, choices to be made. The pure self is your true self and would make the right choices if given the chance. Look at it this way. It’s as though your true self is constantly giving you direction but can’t talk the way that you speak. It kind of speaks in icons and metaphors. I’ll give you an example. Say that as you stroll along your road of life, There’s a metaphorical boulder in the way. You walk around the boulder and there’s a deep ditch. You walk around the ditch. You confront a tiger. You somehow avoid the tiger’s teeth and claws and there in front of you is a body of water. You manage to swim through only to come to a mountain. It’s one thing after another and life is really hard. You know, that’s a message. Your true self, still hidden deep in your subconscious, is telling you, hey, you’re on the wrong road. And so finally you get the message and you change. What do you change? Would that I could tell you. I can’t tell you that. But change you must. Perhaps you become more social or less social. Maybe you call that person you were angry with. Maybe you don’t. Perhaps you take a trip or cancel one. You buy something. You sell something. Whatever you do is something. And after the thing is done, you discover the boulder is still there, but the tiger’s gone. The ditch is there, but the water in the mountain is gone. Well, that too is a message. And that message is saying, now you’re getting the idea. Whatever it is that you did, do more of. And again, and life begins to get easier. Well, that too is a message. When life is filled with difficulties, it’s a message to you saying basically, you’re on the wrong road. Make some changes in your life. They may be minor. They may be major. But change, you must. And after the change, when life gets easier, you know you’re on the right track. Keep at it. Your true self wants life to be easy and you to be happy. And here’s where a quantum jump can help. There are many twin selves who are on the right road. They’re the ones you want to visit, get some energy from. See how they fared by making different choices than you did. And then you may decide to make similar choices. But why would you jump to their reality? How would that help you here in this reality? By seeing how things might have been. you will be better able to adjust your attitude and bring back the energy of that true self, you. By changing your attitude toward things, you’ll find more and more that you will be attracting the things you should have had in the first place. So when you’re guided to the hallway before the door opens, think about an incident in your past where you had a choice, and then go to the twin self who made a different choice. After that, jump to a different twin self who made other choices and then do it again. Now here’s the way you can quantum jump to that true self of yours and uncover a new destiny, a better destiny. On the next module, I will guide you all the way. Just follow along with my words, and when you’re in the small hallway facing the quantum door, then think about that incident that you wish you could have done differently. For now, find a comfortable place, where you can be undisturbed for 20 minutes or so, and we will begin.

Meditation 1: The Meeting Your True-Self Meditation
--------------------

Module 27, the meditation for meeting your true self and using your true self to overcome problems. Make yourself comfortable. We’ll start this meditation by my counting backwards from 3 to 1. Close your eyes. Take a deep breath. And while exhaling, mentally repeat and visualize the number 3 three times. Take another deep breath. And while exhaling, mentally repeat and visualize the number two three times. Take another deep breath, and while exhaling, mentally repeat and visualize the number one three times. You are now at a deeper, healthier level of mind. To reach a deeper, healthier level of mind at any time, just take an occasional deep breath. To help you to enter a deeper… healthier level of mind, imagine that you’re sitting in front of a black velvet curtain. You’re very comfortable. Alongside your chair is a box with 10 white plastic numbers in it. The numbers are from 1 to 10. When you place one of these numbers up on the black velvet curtain, the number sticks until you remove it. You’re going to take these numbers one by one and put them on the velvet curtain. First the number 10 on the curtain, then you’ll remove it and replace it with the number 9, and so on until you’ve put up and taken down the entire sequence of 10 numbers. First the number 10. Take your time. Begin. Relax. If you’ve not yet reached the number 1, take away whatever number you have on the curtain and replace it with the number 1. Relax. Visualize improvements in your life as you mentally repeat the words, every day in every way, I’m getting better and better. Every day, in every way, I’m getting better and better. Relax. Relax your eyes. Relax your lips. Relax your jaw. Relax your head, your neck. Relax your chest, your shoulders. Relax your stomach, your back. Relax your entire body. Relax your arms and hands, your legs and feet. You are now completely relaxed. Repeat mentally after me. Every day I improve my image of myself, my self -esteem. I am a unique human being. There’s no one else on earth exactly like me. Every day I grow stronger in the realization that I can. I can think. I can create. I can do. Relax. Your true self is a self of yours that might have been had there been no negative programming in your past. Negative programming by authority figures when you were very young. Your true self is a happy, content, well -satisfied self with no problems. During this module, you’ll be making two quantum jumps. One to that true self who has had no negative programming to deal with. You might say that self turned out to be a perfect self. The second jump will be to a parallel. and a doppelganger who has the same problems and is in the same situation as you are, has the same life as you do. The first jump will take you to that twin self who is a true self, a self who always does the right thing, always makes the right choice. Life is easy for this self of yours in another universe. The jump after that will be to a self exactly like you are now, with all the past programming that has created problems in your life. Think now about the problems and the choices you made in life. Were the choices about money, a product, a thing, a person, events? What you’re going to do during this quantum jump is to visit your true self, and then your false self. We call this your false self because all the programming that you’ve been subject to has caused you to make many bad choices, false choices that have had an effect on your life. You’ll be switching from your true self to your false self rapidly as I guide you through the exercise. Think now about any part of your life. that you’re unsatisfied with. It may be regarding relationships or health or money or friends or business, your profession or whatever. Whatever part of your life that you’re unsatisfied with, that is going to be your false self. When you jump to your false self, it will be to a parallel universe where your doppelganger has that exact same problem. and is in that same situation. And then when you jump to your true self, it will be to a parallel universe where your doppelganger had no negative programming, and therefore it does not have the problem that you’re looking to overcome. Relax. At this time, imagine that you’re in the hallway facing the quantum door. I will now count from one to three, and the door will open. One, two, three. The door is opening and now the door is open. Step through and imagine that you’re with a twin self whose life is happy and easy. It’s your true self. Now back to the hallway. I will count from one to three and the door will open. One, two, three. The door is opening. The door is open. Step through and imagine that you’re with your false self, the self that has the same problem that you’re looking to overcome. Relax. In a moment I’m going to snap my fingers. When I do, you’ll switch to your true self. When I snap them again, you’ll be with your false self. Imagine that. Get a sense that you’re with each self in turn. Visualize that. Right now you are with your false self with your present problems. True self. False self. True self. False self. True self. Now, imagine that you’re back in the hallway and the quantum door is closing. The door is closed. Relax. Repeat mentally, I feel better and better. I see the good in myself. I feel better and better. I see the good in myself. I have a positive viewpoint toward myself. Every day I get more and more confident in my own abilities. In a moment, I’m going to count from one to five. When I reach the count of five, your eyes will open, you’ll be wide awake, feeling wonderfully refreshed, feeling as though a big weight has been lifted from you, feeling better, much better than you did before. One, two, three, four, and five. Eyes open, wide awake, feeling better. than before.

Audio 2: Could You Be a Doppelgänger?
--------------------

Module 28. Could you be a doppelganger? One way that I found very rewarding is that of helping a twin self in a parallel universe who’s requesting it. After all, in an infinite universe, there is a doppelganger self, a you, who wants to speak to you. You have what that self needs. What is it? Only you can find that out, and to do so… You just have to have the desire and the intent to help that self. This is the highest form of help thy neighbor and encompasses all the aspects of the great golden rule, do unto others as you would have them do unto you. Because by helping your doppelganger, you are indeed helping yourself. In an infinity of universes, there are twin selves that need advice from you. you can help that twin self. You may not even realize what that self could possibly want from you, but you do have a lot to share. In this instance, you are the doppelganger. You are the twin counterpart. By helping your twin self, you will find many doors opening for you in this universe, as the positive energies of the benefits that you offer your twin self will resonate in all universes. You will have a glimmering of what that energy entails if you recall any time in the past that you gave a helping hand to someone. Now, it might have been with money, or it might have been with a word of encouragement, or it might have been with your labor. As example, myself, I carry a small thing, but it’s a big thing in the way that I feel, my attitude. I carry eight or ten. $10 bills in my car at all times. They’re in the glove compartment. When I see a homeless person on a street corner, I take one out and give it to him or her. It’s not much. I agree. But it is something. And the gratification that I receive, that’s priceless. Not to mention the smile on the person’s face. I recall a time in San Francisco I was doing a seminar. And I was strolling along Fisherman’s Wharf in the early morning. An elderly woman dressed in rags was sitting with her back to the wall of a restaurant on the street, fast asleep. I rolled two tens together and slipped it in her hand between her fingers. I crossed the street as she woke up. She stared at what was between her fingers, unrolled it, and the smile that broke out on her face warmed me for days. That’s the kind of energy we’re going to be stimulating with the reverse jump. Here’s how it works. Now, you know the routine to get to the hallway in front of the quantum door. Once you’re there, you concentrate on energy coming to you. That’s easy if you do it this way. Think of someone tossing you a ball. Think of a car driving towards you. Think of a person walking towards you. That will put you in the receptive mode. and the energy flow will be towards you in your direction. And then you think of helping a twin self who has a problem. The quantum door will open, and a twin self will be with you in the hallway. You do not jump into a parallel universe for this one. Your doppelganger is the one who does the jumping into your universe, your dimension, here. Now you’re in the hallway with your twin self who has a problem. suddenly you’re made aware of the problem. It may be that your twin self tells you the problem, or it may be that it just floats into your mind. But suddenly you’re aware of it. Now, you’re the controlling force here. You solve the problem by creating a mental image of the solution and bringing your twin self into the picture with your daydreaming mechanism to work out the solution. Visualize the two of you acting out the solution to the problem. It’ll be easy if you just pretend that you have the solution to the problem. Once you’ve taken your twin self through the solution, then you visualize the hallway once again, hug your twin self, see a smile, and then allow your twin self to go through the doorway to the twin self’s home universe. The door closes, you’ve done the good deed, the reverse jump. Here’s how I used the reverse jump just yesterday. I had just finished one of my photo paintings. I had been driving through the outskirts of Palm Springs last week. I was looking for a subject when I noticed this old house that had been foreclosed. The swimming pool was empty of water, a door was hanging loose, and it was in a general state of disarray. It looked like a good subject, and so I took the photos, had them processed, glued them onto a foam core board, and painted out what I didn’t want and painted in a new background and foreground. After completing it, I left it on the easel and stared at it for a while when the thought came to me that there was a doppelganger of mine who needed something to do, and photo painting might be just the thing for that person. Well, I sat in a chair and I meditated. I imagined being in the hallway. The quantum door was closed. The door opened, and my twin self came into the hallway. We hugged. He said he’d like to learn to do photo painting, but didn’t know a thing about painting. I said that was all right, and neither did I when I started. We went out and started taking photos of a scene. Now, in your imagination, you can project yourself anywhere. I showed him how to stand in one place, to plant himself, and swing the camera around to get the entire scene from side to side and from top to bottom. Actually, I gave him more information than I originally got about this from my own doppelganger. Well, anyway, we went back to my office with a stack of photos. All this is mental, of course. We glued them on a foam core, and then I painted in the background, which was sky and clouds. Then the foreground, and soon there was a completed photo painting. As this was all mental, it only took a few minutes. My doppelganger was happy with the result. and then back to the hallway. We shook hands, hugged again, and my twin self, Bert, stepped back through the doorway into his own universe. And I felt wonderful having helped my counterpart. Now, is all this imagination, am I just fooling myself? Is it just an elaborate daydream? What’s the difference? You know, I mentioned that again and again. It doesn’t matter. The whole idea is for you to help yourself. And this did help me. Every now and again, I’ll do a reverse jump and help a twin self of mine with writing, with lecturing, or whatever else he may want. And I’ve always learned something every time I do that. Kind of stirring up the energy so that when I jump into a parallel, my doppelganger will be waiting to help me. You’re only limited by your imagination. Use your imagination. Use that daydreaming mechanism of yours. Are you really in a parallel universe, a different dimension? Are you really talking to a twin self and helping that self? Is that twin self really helping you, or is the entire process psychological? Kind of a philosophical placebo. Once again, I say, what’s the difference? The only question for you… is, does it work? And when it does, then the concept is real for you and for me. So use the quantum jumping process and have a better and more interesting life. To ease you into the reverse jump on the next module, I’ll guide you all the way. What I can’t do, however, is come up with the project to develop a solution to the problem. As I don’t know what the problem your twin self might have. But when that self comes through the door, remember, you are the doppelganger this time, and you have the answers. So relax, find a comfortable place where you’ll be undisturbed for 20 minutes or so, and on the next module, we’ll begin.

--------------------
Meditation 2: 
The Reverse Jump Meditation
--------------------

Module 29, the reverse jump meditation. Find a place where you’ll be undisturbed for a short while and we will begin the meditation where you will be the doppelganger and you will be helping your twin self. We’ll start with the three to one count. This module is not to be played in a moving vehicle, of course. This is a meditation exercise to help you to get to the hallway of the quantum door, and there you will await your twin self. So, find a comfortable position, close your eyes, take a deep breath, and as you exhale, mentally repeat and visualize the number three, three times. Take another deep breath. And as you exhale, mentally repeat and visualize the number 2 three times. Take another deep breath. And as you exhale, mentally repeat and visualize the number 1 three times. To help you to enter the proper level of mind, I’m going to count from 10 to 1. On every descending number, you will feel yourself going inward and you will enter a pleasant meditation level of mind. where you’ll be able to concentrate fully on the subject. 10, 9, feel going deeper. 8, 7, 6, deeper and deeper. 5, 4, 3, deeper and deeper. 2, 1. You are now at a deeper. A pleasant level of mind where you’re able to concentrate fully on one subject. At this time, concentrate on my words. You are now and always in complete control of your state of mind. You can open your eyes. You can be fully alert anytime you wish to be. Every time you enter this relaxed state, know that you’re getting better and better in every way. Whenever you enter this relaxed meditation state, you’ll mentally say, every day, in every way, I’m getting better and better. When you say these words, sense yourself improving in all areas of your life. Sense yourself getting better and better. Visualize improvements in your life as you mentally repeat the words, every day, in every way, I’m getting better and better. Relax. Relax your eyes. Relax your lips. Relax your jaw, your head. Relax your neck. Relax your body, your shoulders, your arms and hands. Relax your chest, your stomach, your back. Relax your hands and feet. You are now completely relaxed. Repeat mentally, my body rests. and refreshes itself when I consciously relax. I’m relaxed now. Repeat mentally, every day my image of myself improves. I can do anything I have a desire to do. I am a wonderful human being. There’s no one else on earth exactly like me. Every day I grow stronger knowing that I can. I can think. I can. I can do. I can do anything I have a desire to do. Relax. At this time, concentrate on the image of you relaxed and at ease. Get a sense of yourself sitting comfortably, eyes closed, at the meditation level. With that thought, you are as comfortable as you can possibly be. Still holding that image in your mind with a closed mouth, take the tip of your tongue and touch it to the roof of your mouth and hold it there while I count from one to three. One, two, three. That’s fine. In touching the tip of your tongue to the roof of your mouth, you are programmed once again that whenever you do touch the tip of your tongue to the roof of your mouth, you are striving for success in something. This is an ancient technique we call the bhaga. Use it when you wish to strengthen intent. The bhaga is a means of telling you that your mind is coming to attention. You’re about to do something. Now I’m going to count from one to three. At the count of three, you’ll be in a small hallway. There’ll be a door in front of you. One, two, three. Imagine now you’re in the hallway, a small hallway, and in front of you is a door. This is the quantum door, the jumping-off point to get you wherever your intent directs you to go. Beyond the door, there are an infinite number of dimensions, an infinite number of universes. And one of those universes is your twin self, the twin self of the person that you intend to help. This time, however, you will not be jumping through the doorway, but will be waiting for your twin self to come through from the other side. This twin self of yours has a problem and is seeking help from the doppelganger self. That doppelganger of your twin self is you. The person coming through from the other side of the quantum door is your twin self who has a problem that you will help to solve. I’m going to count from one to three, and at the count to three, the door will open and your twin self will be coming through. You are the doppelganger in this case, as your twin self has a problem that you will help to resolve. By helping your twin self, you gain in positive, helpful energies. At this time, to make it easier for your twin self, imagine a ball coming to you. Perhaps someone is tossing a ball to you. Now imagine an automobile coming towards you. Now the automobile disappears and a person is walking towards you. When you imagine things coming towards you, you place yourself in the receptive mode. And now the door will open. One, two, three. The door is opening. Your twin self is… through. Your twin self walks over to you and you hug. I will be silent for a moment and you will imagine your twin self telling you of the problem that your twin self would like to be resolved. Begin. Relax. Now take your twin self to the place where the problem has been resolved and create a mental image of the solution. And imagine that you’re taking your twin self into the picture with your daydreaming mechanism to work out the solution. Visualize the two of you acting out the solution to the problem. It will be easy if you just pretend that you have the solution to the problem. Relax and begin. Once you’ve taken your twin self through the solution, then visualize the hallway once again. You may hug your twin self, sense a smile, and then allow your twin self to go back through the doorway to your twin self’s home universe. The door closes, and you’ve done the good deed, the reverse jump. Relax. Every now and then, do a reverse jump and help out your twin self. Once again, I will count from one to three. And at the count of three, your eyes will open. You’ll be wide awake, feeling vital, refreshed, and restored. You feel wonderfully restored after helping your twin self. All your cells have received a goodly portion of the positive energy that you receive every time you do this meditation. One, two, three. Eyes open, wide awake, feeling wonderfully restored. feeling better than before. Thank you.

Audio 1: The Golden Touch
--------------------

CD 10, Unlimited Prosperity with a Midas Touch. Module 30, The Golden Touch. The Midas Jump will be quite interesting if you’re still looking for that sometimes elusive money consciousness. Only one person can turn you into a money magnet, and that person is you yourself. You may have heard that if you give a person with a poverty consciousness a million dollars, a year later that person won’t have any of it left. Whereas if you take a million dollars away from a person with a prosperity consciousness, a year later they’ll have it back. You know something? That’s pretty much so. But what is a poverty consciousness? Your Midas doppelganger knows. For him or her, making money is like taking candy from a baby. The Midas jump is designed for you to attract affluence and money instead of scarcity and hardship. It takes a bit of work on your part, but how hard did you work to get to where you are? The Midas quantum energy source is what creates that prosperity consciousness. I have two friends that are a case in point. I won’t mention their names, but you’ll understand why in a minute. I’ll call them Al and Bob. And they’re pretty much the same age. Al finished high school but didn’t have any further education. His father earned just enough to keep the family eating and sheltered. Al got a job as a clerk at Macy’s department store shortly after he graduated high school. Bob, on the other hand, came from a family of some affluence. His father was a corporate attorney and they lived in an upper middle class neighborhood. After high school, Bob went on to college and after four years decided to put all that education to use. And out into the world he went. Now that was 40 years ago, which would make both Al and Bob around 60 years old of age today. Al is a multimillionaire with a big home in Beverly Hills. Bob is struggling, living in a modest apartment on the outskirts of Oakland, and he’s working for a credit company soliciting new business over the phone. Why? Well, if I had to guess, I wouldn’t know how to begin. There could be a thousand reasons. Al made millions and Bob struggled through life. But one thing I would bet on, Al had a money consciousness and Bob didn’t. What that means is they made different choices. I know that you’ve heard the term poverty consciousness and money consciousness probably hundreds of times, a few times right here. But what exactly is that? Let me put it in a nutshell. Al and Bob made different choices. I personally happen to know of a few of the choices they made. About 30 years ago, Al told me he had purchased a lot in Anaheim, and he was going to build a house on it and then sell it. It was a safe thing to do as Al figured if he didn’t sell, he’d move in. What was the choice? Well, at the time, he had a steady job at Macy’s, making a comfortable salary. He was doing what he wanted to do. His choice was to quit his job and go into an unknown territory. I say unknown because Al didn’t know a thing about building. But he learned. He hired all the trades and he spent every minute on the job, questioning each craftsman. By the time the house was finished, Al was a contractor. Oh yeah, he did sell the house, needless to say he made some money on it, and he was off and running. But he needed a license, and so he chose to study and go after his general contractor’s license, and he eventually got it. What about Bob? Well, it was about 10 years after Al built his first house that Bob also was confronted by a choice. A friend of his told Bob about a bank president who said that their board was open for a new director. Bob got interested. What would it take to become a bank director and the automatic title of vice president that went with it? Wow. Vice president of a bank. Well, Bob spoke to the president of the savings and loan, who told Bob he would have to buy… $80,000 worth of stock and pledged to purchase $120,000 more in two years. Well, that was no problem. Bob owned a restaurant, and in the worst scenario, he could always sell the restaurant. Bob put in all the spare money he had, $80,000. He was really proud of the fact that he was one of the directors of the savings and loan. Three months later, the savings and loan went under, and Bob’s $80,000 was gone. Obviously, buying into the bank was a very bad choice. But was that just bad luck? Well, maybe. Al and Bob made many choices in their lives to get them to where they wound up. I just happen to know about those two. You can bet, however, that most of Al’s choices were made from a totally different perspective than did Bob’s. Now comes the big question. How do you know if you’re making the right choice? How do you know if you have a poverty consciousness or a consciousness of affluence? It’s easy to say, just look at what you have. If you have everything you want, and if you want everything you have, then the chances are you do have a money consciousness. But there’s a whole lot more to it than that. Once again, attitude comes into the picture. Al’s attitude toward life is totally different than his Bob’s. But how do you develop a money attitude? Well, as this is about quantum jumping, the answer is easy. Just go to your Midas doppelganger. Midas certainly had a money attitude and a money consciousness. After all, the fable of the Midas touch has been told for a thousand years. It’s embedded in the very culture of the world. Everything that Midas touched turned into gold. Now that’s a money consciousness. I actually know someone like that. He has an estate on the Mediterranean that beggars the imagination. 150 prime acres of manicured lawns, lakes, fountains, fruit trees of every description, with peacocks and miniature deer wandering around the walled-in estate. It looks like more of a palace than a home, but a home it is. He asked me to present a private class, and I really didn’t want to. I told him what my fee was for a three-day class, and he didn’t bat an eye when I told him the price. I actually told him a rather enormous figure because I really didn’t want to go. But when he heard the price, he just quietly said, that’s fine. Sent me a check the next day. It turned out that he had a personal fairy godmother tapping him on the shoulder with a magic wand every day of his life. Every venture this man undertook was successful. He was a millionaire at 16. He doubled his net worth every year for 10 years. As a matter of fact, that was his goal, doubling his worth every year. He did it for 10 years, and at the age of 26, he was a billionaire. How did he do it? You may well ask that. Once again, it was choices. He made all the right ones, and he also put himself in the way of big deals, for that’s where the big money was. He was successful in oil, in banking, in cattle, in real estate. He bought an old ferry boat, refitted it, and sold it a year later, quadrupling his investment. Everything he touched turned to gold. I asked him how he did it, and his answer was, well, it’s always been like taking candy from a baby for me. Now, that’s a consciousness that reeks of affluence. But how does a person acquire that type of consciousness? First of all, to acquire a money consciousness, you have to be aware of money and your relationship to money. Educate yourself. If you don’t already know, learn a bit about income and expenses. If your income is $1,000 and your expenses are $1,001, you’ll be unhappy with your relationship to money. But if your income is $1,000 and expenses are $999, you’ll be happy with your relationship to money. You might say that the difference between a happy money relationship and an unhappy one is $1. Learn a bit about investing and what money does. In other words, don’t just think about money by itself, but what money is and does. Many people I know have no idea about money. Oh, they know they bring in so much and they spend so much. But beyond that, nothing. First of all, you should know there are three types of expenses. There are fixed expenses such as rent, mortgage payments, insurance, electric and gas bills and such. You have no control over fixed expenses. Then there are semi-fixed expenses, such as food, clothing, hair care, and such. You have a little control over semi-fixed expenses. And third are discretionary expenses, such as entertainment, restaurant meals, video rentals, a larger car, and such. These you have full control over. Become aware of which of the three categories your money goes. Where is most of your money going? Into fixed expenses, semi-fixed expenses, or discretionary expenses? Just an awareness of this will bring you a bit into the money consciousness area. And if you’ve failed in past ventures with respect to money, analyze every aspect of the failure so that you won’t repeat those same errors. Once you’ve familiarized yourself with your income, your spending habits, and you’ve analyzed any of what you consider errors in the past, then you’ve taken the first step to a money consciousness. The next step is to jump into a twin self who has a money consciousness, a Midas consciousness. What you want is to take the attitude of your doppelganger, the energy of your doppelganger, back to this reality, to this universe. You have a Midas twin self. In an infinite universe, anything that can be imagined is. By going to that self and sensing how he, she does it, you can merge with that self and take back with you the Midas energy. The module following this one will take you to that Midas twin self. In the ancient story of Midas, he was a king. But for our Midas, Midas could be a king or a queen. But whatever the gender, the touch will be that of a golden one. That will turn everything into gold and affluence. Your twin self has the Midas touch. And most important to start you on your way, every morning, upon awakening, take the first finger of your strongest hand and press it gently on the area just above the spot between your eyes for five seconds. That is your Midas touch, and it will be programmed during the following meditation. For now, find a place where you’ll be undisturbed for 15 minutes or so, and we’ll begin the meditation for the Midas Jump. Now, when you use the Midas Touch, remember, this is a metaphor, an icon. You must do something. You must take an action. And what is that action? Ah, that’s for you to figure out. But action, it must be. However, your goal… this particular instance, is to take advantage of the Midas touch.

--------------------
Meditation: The Midas Jump Meditation
--------------------

Module 31, the Midas Jump Meditation. Relax. We’ll start with the 3 to 1 count. This module is not to be played in a moving vehicle. This is a meditation exercise to introduce you to your money consciousness through the self-utilizing power of quantum jumping. Find a comfortable position and close your eyes. Take a deep breath. And as you exhale, mentally repeat and visualize the number three three times. Take another deep breath. And as you exhale, mentally repeat and visualize the number two three times. Take another deep breath. And as you exhale, mentally repeat and visualize the number one three times. To help you enter a more relaxed level of mind, I’m going to count from ten to one. On every descending number, feel yourself going inward and you will enter a pleasant, relaxed level of mind where you’ll be able to concentrate fully on one subject. Ten. Nine. Feel going deeper. Eight. Seven. Six. Deeper and more relaxed. Five. Four, three, relax. Two, one. You are now at a pleasant, relaxed level of mind where you are able to concentrate fully on one subject. At this time, concentrate on my words. You are now and always in complete control of your state of mind. You can open your eyes. You can be fully alert anytime you wish to be. Every time you enter this relaxed meditation state, know that you’re getting better and better in every way. Whenever you enter this relaxed meditation state, you will mentally say, every day, in every way, I’m getting better and better. When you say these words, sense yourself improving in all areas of your life. Sense yourself getting better and better. Visualize improvements in your life now. As you mentally repeat the words, every day, in every way, I’m getting better and better. Relax. Relax your eyes, your lips, your jaw. Relax your head and neck. Relax your shoulders, your arms and hands. Relax your chest and back and stomach. Relax your hips, your legs and feet. Relax your entire body. Repeat mentally. My body rests and refreshes itself when I consciously relax. I’m relaxed now. Repeat mentally after me. Every day my image of myself gets better. I can do anything I have a desire to do. I am a wonderful human being. There’s no one else on earth exactly like me. Every day I grow stronger knowing that I can. I can think. I can create. I can do. I can do anything I have a desire to do. Relax. At this time, concentrate on the image of you at the relaxed level of mind. Get a sense of yourself sitting comfortably, eyes closed. With that thought, you are as comfortable as you can possibly be. Relax. In a moment, I’m going to count from one to three. To count to three, you will imagine that you’re in a small hallway. In front of you is a door, the quantum door, a transit to a parallel universe. By now, you know exactly how to get to your doppelganger, your double, your twin self in another dimension. So just relax and follow along with my words. Relax. I will now count. One, two, three. You are now in a small hallway. In front of you is a quantum door. On the other side of that door is an infinite number of dimensions and universes. When the door opens, you’ll step through and be with your twin self, the doppelganger who has a strong money consciousness and who has the Midas touch. One, two, three. The door is opening. The door is open. Jump or step through and imagine that you are with an affluent twin self, a twin who has the Midas touch and who can lend you the energy of a money consciousness. Imagine it. Create it. Visualize it. Your twin self is you as you might have been had you had a different upbringing and had you made different choices in life. This twin self is affluent and has had a money consciousness for many years. Imagine the home of this twin self, large, filled with expensive wall hangings, carpets, couches, and all of the accoutrements and trappings of wealth. Look at the wall on the left with its expensive works of art. In a corner of the room there’s a grand piano, and on the right a large ornate fireplace. What else would you imagine your twin self should have in this luxurious home? Seated on a plush couch is your twin self. There’s a comfortable chair alongside. Go over to the chair and sit in it and imagine a conversation with this twin self of yours. Your twin self may give you some good advice. Take your time. You will have plenty of time. Begin. Relax. Now, to take on some of the energy of your twin self, imagine that your twin self is standing. And now move closer, then still closer. And now merge with your twin self. And now you’re looking out of your twin self’s eyes. Imagine that you’re absorbing the energy of the twin self and the consciousness of money that your twin self has. Now with the forefinger of your strongest hand, press gently on the spot between your eyes, just a little bit above your eye level. Keep it there while I count to five. One, two, three, four, five. That’s fine. You may take your hand down now. Every morning when you wake up, gently press the first finger of your strongest hand on that spot between and a little above your eyes. This is your icon for money consciousness. Relax. I will now count from one to three, and you will bid farewell to your twin self and back to the hallway in this reality, in this universe. One, two, three. Back in the hallway, back in this dimension, in this reality. Relax. I will now count from one to three. At the count to three, your eyes will open. You’ll be wide awake and fully aware. Relax. One, two, three. Eyes open, wide awake, fully aware, feeling better than before.

Audio 1: Fixing Organic & Cellular Problems Within You
--------------------

CD 11, Unbreakable Health with the Cellular Jump. Module 32, Fixing Organic and Cellular Problems Within Your Body. I’ve been experimenting with different kinds of quantum jumps and during the research have come up with an interesting way to work out physical problems. I was looking for a means to rebalance or energize the good cells of the body and thereby restoring the organ that was affected, restoring it to its normal function. Well, this time the jump through the quantum door is into a universe where your twin self has an unusual set of cells, quanta stem cells. The very word quanta means the smallest particles. You might say the invisible ones. Just as your cells are invisible, except on the microscopic level, so concealed in those cells are the cause of all physical problems. Hidden in those cells is also the means to strengthen and restore the cell, and in turn, of course, restore the organ to its natural functioning. The cells that we’re concerned about are the stem cells that we’ve heard so much about of late. Adult stem cells can renew themselves by dividing and multiplying indefinitely while taking on the attributes of a healthy organ. This enables them to regenerate the entire organ into which they’re introduced. Simplifying the concept, when adult stem cells are introduced into an organ with bad or diseased cells, the stem cell, being somewhat neutral in nature, takes on the attributes of the healthy organ, and by dividing, overwhelms and replaces all the diseased cells. During the cellular jump, you’re going to be going to a doppelganger who’s in a universe where stem cells have been introduced into every organ. Your doppelganger, in this case, has cells that have the ability to divide and create cells that can overwhelm all the bad cells that have caused the problem in the first place. With that, as a brief background, we can now ask the question, Can quantum jumping restore bad cells and recharge the body’s batteries, so to speak? Once again, in an infinite universe, in an infinite number of universes, whatever can be imagined is. That being the case, why not use quantum jumping to jump into a parallel where stem cells are available? Well, now that’s what we’re going to do. The philosophy behind this is that the mind does not know the difference between what is real and what is imaginary. This is best seen in a story that I’ve been telling for many, many years. First of all, let me say that when the imagination and the will are in conflict, imagination will win every time. Here’s an example of that statement. Say that you have a sturdy plank, a foot wide and 15 feet long. This plank is lying across your living room floor. Do you think that you could walk the length of that plank without losing your balance? Of course you could. If you’re a person with normal balance, you could do that a hundred times, a thousand times, and never come near to falling off. Okay, let’s pretend a little further. Let’s bring imagination into the equation. We now have two 20-story buildings separated by a narrow alley. Our foot-wide plank bridges that alley, going from one roof to the next. Now then, 20 stories. Wow, that’s a long way down. People walking the sidewalk below, they look like little bugs. Could you, could anybody, outside of a tightrope walker, could anybody walk on that plank with the same ease and assurance as before? Not likely. What was so easy in the living room now becomes something out of a nightmare. If you really had to cross that height on such a board, it’s doubtful, you’d try to walk it upright. More likely, you’d crawl, perhaps even drag yourself on your stomach, legs hanging and quaking with terror. Same plank, different surroundings. In that situation, what is the common denominator? It’s the mind, the imagination. The imagination has come into conflict with the will. And even if you wanted to walk that board with every fiber of your being, your imagination just won’t let you. The object of quantum jumping is to get the imagination working with and for you instead of against you. Most problems begin in the mind, and the mind is affected by the imagination. Your image of the stem cells of your doppelganger coming into your body when you merge with the doppelganger is what we hope will stimulate the imagination and rebuild a healthy, functioning organ. Instead of having the imagination working against you, through the concept of the quantum jump, the imagination is now working for you. What we are doing is creating a metaphor that helps to create a greater imagination. We can do virtually anything at all as it’s our intent to restore, recharge, and bring the cell and therefore the organ back to its full capacity. First thing, of course, is the relaxing meditation. Then when you’re deep and relaxed, you visualize the hallway and the quantum door. While in the hallway, you think about the organ or the part of your body that has a problem. The image doesn’t have to be exact. If, as example, there’s a problem with, let’s say, the stomach, and you don’t know what a stomach looks like, well, that’s okay. Whatever you sense is correct. You may visualize a deflated or inflated football. That’ll be your representation of a stomach, and it’ll be correct. Whatever you visualize will represent the part of the body you wish to help. All we’re looking to do here is to get the imagination on your side. Now, thinking about the organ, you open the quantum door and step through the doorway. On the other side of the door is your twin self’s part of the body that you want to correct. It’s large, large enough to merge into and look around. All you do then is to see the problem as something. What? It doesn’t matter. Anything. You may see a fire in the organ. Put it out or rain on it. You may see the organ in odd color. Paint it a different color. You may see a nail sticking in the organ. Remove it. Get the idea? It’s all imagination, so it doesn’t matter what you do so long as your intent is to heal and you do something. So go into the organ and fix it. If it’s yourself that you’re working on, just pop out of the organ and view your healthy twin self walking briskly as you merge with your twin self to carry the revitalized cell structure back with you to this reality. Now, please note, you can’t do this wrong. Whatever you imagine, whatever you visualize as an organ or as a stem cell is correct for you. This is a metaphor that helps you to organize your own cells in a healthy, strong, and vital manner. the following module, I’ll guide you through the process. For now, consider what organ or part of the body you’d like to work with. Or if you’re healthy and vigorous but have some person that you know who has problems, you can use this exact same technique on that person. Now, that might seem to be a bit confusing, so let me give you an example. Marjorie Summers brought her 10-year-old daughter, Heather, to an early class of mine. Heather was a bit young for the material, and most of it went over her head. But somehow she took to the cellular explanation completely. I discovered this when Marjorie called me a few weeks after the class. It seems that Marjorie had a maid from Honduras whose name was Maria. Maria had left that day to take care of her mother, who was in the hospital with a stomach problem and was due for a major operation. Before Maria left, Heather told her that she would take care of Maria’s mother’s stomach. Well, what would Maria say to that? She just smiled. Heather reported to her mother that she went into her bedroom and meditated. Then she jumped through the door into Maria’s mother’s stomach. She said it was like being in a big room. One of the walls of the room was all red, and the other walls were green. Heather took a spray gun and sprayed the red wall green so that all the walls matched. Then she saw Maria’s mother get up from her bed and walk around the block with a smile on her face. Well, she told this to her mother and she told it to Maria too. Her mother just smiled and nodded and Maria listened politely and what could she say? Nothing. She just left. The next day, Maria called excitedly. She said a miracle had occurred. When she got to Honduras, her mother had been released from the hospital and was told that on second examination, the problem seemed to have disappeared. When Marjorie told me the story, I said to her, don’t tell that to any of her friends as they’d be mobbing her little girl. Well, she didn’t listen. She told her friends, her friends told their friends, that there was a 10-year-old girl who was a remarkable healer. Pretty soon strangers began to knock on her door asking for Heather. It got to the point where Marjorie was thinking of moving to a different city. Finally, she decided to simply say that Heather no longer lived there, and the last time I spoke with her, things had quieted down. Now, that story seems to have nothing to do with imaginary stem cell balance, but in a way it does. It shows that it’s all imagination at work. Meaning it doesn’t matter what explanation you give it or what you do to correct it as long as you do something. Spraying a wool green when you suspect the red indicates a problem works just as well as anything else you can come up with mentally. Now, was this story that I just told you about Marjorie and Maria and Heather, was that just a coincidence? I don’t know. I’ve been asking myself that question. For many, many, many, many years. As a matter of fact, one of the things I remember about Jose Silva, when somebody told him a story like that, he would always look kind of wise and say, coincidence. But what is coincidence? Something is going on. And at the base of it all is imagination. On the next module is the cellular jump meditation. Use it wisely. Use it well. Thank you.

Meditation: The Cellular Jump Meditation
--------------------

Module 33, the Cellular Jump Meditation. We’ll start with a 3 to 1 count. This module is not to be played in a moving vehicle. This is a meditation exercise to help you to get to the cellular level of a twin self and bring back the energy of the cells and organs, especially the stem cells. Find a comfortable position. Close your eyes. Take a deep breath. And as you exhale, mentally repeat and visualize the number three, three times. Take another deep breath. And as you exhale, mentally repeat and visualize the number two, three times. Take another deep breath. And as you exhale, mentally repeat and visualize the number one, three times. To help you to enter the proper level of mind, I’m going to count from 10 to 1. On each descending number, you’ll feel yourself going inward, and you will enter a pleasant meditation level of mind where you’ll be able to concentrate fully on the subject at hand. 10, 9, feel going inward. 8, 7, 6. Feel going deeper and deeper. Five, four, deeper and deeper. Three, two, one. You are now at a pleasant level of mind where you’re able to concentrate fully on my words. You are now in complete control of your state of mind. You can open your eyes. You can be fully alert anytime you wish to be. Every time you enter this relaxed state, know that you’re getting better and better in every way. Whenever you enter this relaxed meditation state, you will mentally say, every day, in every way, I’m getting better and better. When you say these words, sense yourself improving in all areas of your life. Sense yourself getting better and better. Visualize improvements in your life now. As you mentally repeat the words, every day, in every way, I’m getting better and better. Relax. Relax your eyes. Relax your lips. Relax your jaw. Relax your head, your neck. Relax your shoulders, your arms and hands. Relax your chest, your back, your stomach. Relax your body. Relax your hips, your legs, your feet. You’re now completely relaxed. Repeat mentally. My body rests and refreshes itself when I consciously relax. I’m relaxed now. Repeat mentally. Every day, my image of myself gets better. I can do anything I have a desire to do. I am a wonderful human being. There’s no one else on earth exactly like me. Every day I grow stronger knowing that I can. I can think. I can create. I can do. I can do anything I have a desire to do. Relax. I’m going to count from one to three. And at the count of three, you’ll be in a small hallway. with a door in front of you, a quantum door. One, two, three. Imagine now that there’s a door in front of you. You’re in a hallway. This is the quantum door, the jumping-off point to get you wherever your intent directs you to go. Beyond the door, there are an infinite number of dimensions, an infinite number of universes. And one of those universes is your twin self. Or if it be your intent to help someone other than yourself, the twin self of the person you intend to help. The body of that self is open to you. When you go through the doorway, you are able to get right into the cellular level of the body to pump energy into the cell and restore any organs that are not operating correctly to good health. When you go through the doorway, you are able to get right into the cellular level of the body to pump energy into the cell and restore the organ to good health. When you go through the doorway, you will be with a twin self whose every cell is an adult stem cell that keeps every organ in perfect harmony with the body and is in perfect health. Anything that you can imagine is in one of the infinite number of dimensions now available to you on the other side of that door. Millions upon millions of you, each of these selves is a twin self of yours who is experiencing a different reality than you are now. One of those selves of yours is going to allow you to enter the cellular level of the body, to receive the benefit of stem cells, to stimulate healing, whatever part of the body needs it. I’m now going to count from one to three, and at the count to three, the door will open, and you will step through it. One, two, three. The door is opening, and now just jump or step through it. Relax. Relax. I’m going to count from one to three, and at the count of three, you will project yourself into the body of your twin self. You’ll be inside any organ, any bone, any gland, any tissue, any muscle, any part that needs help. One, two, three. You are now inside the body. Imagine it. Visualize it. Daydream that you’re there. Imagine now that you can spray stem cells on the part and that it can have a good and positive on every part of the body that you’re working on. Imagine that you have in your hand a spray gun that sprays stem cells. I’m going to count from one to three and you’ll be in the part of the body that needs help. One, two, three. You’re in the body. Imagine it. Create it. Look about you. See if there’s something wrong. It may be that the color isn’t right. If so, spray it with stem cells. Imagine that you have a spray gun that is filled with stem cells and that you can spray these stem cells on any part of the body that has a problem. The stem cells will revitalize the part and bring it back to a healthy state. After you’ve done that, imagine that you’re merging with your twin self. to receive the benefit of the new and revitalized body. Take your time. Begin. Relax. Pop out of the body and view your healthy twin self walking briskly. And now, once again, merge with your twin self to carry the revitalized cell structure back with you to this reality. I’m going to count from one to three, and at the count of three, You’ll be back in the hallway of this dimension, this universe. You’ll feel restored and energetic. Your good cells have all been recharged and are doing the work that nature intended for them to do. One, two, three. Back in the hallway. I will count from one to three again. As a count to three, your eyes will open. You’ll be wide awake, feeling vital. refreshed and restored. All your organs are working as they should, and health and vigor are returning to you. One, two, three. Eyes open, wide awake, feeling wonderfully restored, feeling better than before. Thank you.

Audio Module 1: What Are Angels?
--------------------

Module 1. Angels are created beings. Celestial in nature. Designed in part to help humanity. But there are different types of angelic beings. A hierarchy. And like all things, they follow certain set rules and laws. But before I get into that, allow me to take you back in time. Back to the year 19… 29. Long time ago. I had just turned two years of age. My grandmother, I recall, was calling me from the parlor where I usually played. Beryl, come here. I’m translating as my grandmother didn’t speak English. She had emigrated from Eastern Europe and had settled in on East 22nd Street in Brooklyn, New York. I knew my name was Burton, as that was how my mother and aunt addressed me. I just thought that grandmothers were different. To her, I was bare L. My earliest memory is my telling her that I was busy playing with my five companions, cherubs. I had no idea my companions were angels. How could I? I was just learning how to speak. An angel wasn’t even in my rather limited vocabulary. I’m not even sure I had a vocabulary at the time. I do remember my five playmates, though. They were as real to me as my friends of today are. They didn’t have names, as I recall. But whenever I was alone, either in the parlor or sometimes the bedroom or even the bathroom, there they were. They were in my mind, waiting for me. But at the time, I really didn’t know the difference between a mental companion and a reality friend. It was all the same to me. It was many, many years later, many years later, that I discovered they were my guardian angels. They disappeared just about the time I became aware of my surroundings, that the physical world became real to me. I think it was, oh, I might have been four, five years of age. I can’t say. Nor can I say that I miss them. It just never entered my mind. But I can visualize my unseen guides now almost as vividly as I did then. The only difference being that then they were as real as reality is today. But now they’re just in my mind. Esther Hicks of the Abraham Hicks Organization calls those unseen guides and tutors a source energy. And that ancient homily, asking ye shall receive, is updated to summon it and it will come. Abraham calls what I would call angels a group of non-physical entities. And, of course, non-physical entity would most aptly describe an angel. Doreen Virtue calls her group of angels angels. And those not totally comfortable with that label can simply see the unseen guides as Esther Hicks’ non-physical entities. Whereas someone like Neil Donald Walsh in his book, Conversations with God, refers to what I would call angels as simply higher intelligence. And of course, in a general way, that too would describe an angel. Jane Roberts, who I greatly admire, but who unfortunately has left the physical state, she channeled a personality I would call an angel, who called himself Seth. Also in the Seth material, an angel could be seen as one’s oversoul. That being said, allow me to offer a few of my thoughts on channeling. I recall a time one of my students, Dr. Eugene Jussick, a medical doctor who specializes in hypnosis and author of Reaching for the Oversoul, a book about one of his patients, he was channeling an entity who called himself Yon Sulu, Wan Sulu. Dr. Jussick, or Gene as I call him, was and is a good friend. He invited me to hear the channeling process. Gene lived in… at the time, whereas I was in the next town of Tarzana. I must admit to being mightily impressed by the information coming out of his patient, Charles Roberts. The material the gene got out of Roberts while he was deep in trance seemed to be beyond Charles’s capacity to know. And like Seth, Juan Sulu expounded reams of material far beyond the capacity of his host. I decided to explore this business of channeling a non-physical entity. At the time, I was a trainer of hypnotists. I had plenty of subjects with whom I could experiment. And as I had a training class every other month, there was the opportunity to receive a lot of important material. It appeared that most people could do channeling, giving the proper guidance. My method, similar to Dr. Jussik’s, was to put a person in a deep hypnotic trance and ask them to bring forward the wisest soul, the wisest soul available. And soon the subject would speak, usually in a voice other than their own. And out would come startling information. I offered classes in channeling during the 90s in Switzerland, Holland, France, the UK, Greece, with a few notable classes in Ohio, New York, Chicago, Florida, Texas, and California. Channeling always surprised me, and I decided to investigate further. Finally, it became clear. Channeling was one of the means angels could speak through their host. However, channeling isn’t the only means of communicating with your unseen guides. As I’ll show you later in the program, there is a way you can actually meet your guides and communicate with them directly. But let me tell you now about an interesting time. It was the day I was working out some more of the quantum jumping concepts and how to use them more effectively. I thought that I’d do a quantum jump to a universe where I could see my angels. Now, there are an infinity of universes, and all things are possible in one of those universes. So that part was simple. And as it was the mental universe that I was visiting, I was utilizing the first principle of Hermes, that of mentalism, where we’re told that the universe is mental. The way to touch the varieties of universes is through mental means. And I chose the quantum jump to manifest my desire to view a variety of angels in the greater universe or multiverse, as some scientists would call it. And one of those limitless places was a universe where angels were visible. And so I soon found myself in a duplicate universe with my twin self, or a doppelganger, in a doppelganger world, a twin world, with only one exception from this one. I had the ability to see not only my angels, others as well. Now, I wasn’t exactly out the angel concept, but the thought did come to me that maybe I could use the quantum jumping technique that I was always working on improving to visit a universe where I could actually see my angels. Now, as I said, all this is on the mental plane, and so I thought that in satisfying my curiosity, I’d gather more information. So, jumping through the doorway, or I should say more accurately stepping through it, as I’ve long ago just stepped through, although many students of quantum jumping do actually jump over the threshold. Anyway, after stepping through the doorway, I found myself seated in my living room, where I actually was, and there in front of me smiling was an angel, my angel. My body was in deep meditation, but my mind was flowing in another universe through the mystery of mental imagery and imagination. In the universe I jumped into, angels were visible, and I have to say it was confusing. Wherever I looked, I saw angels. Even my dog, a mini schnauzer named Baby, had his own little dog angel hovering near him. I walked along the street, and everyone had an accompanying angel that they occasionally spoke with. I shortly found out that every angel on the planet knew everything that happened to every other angel. What my angel knew, every other angel knew as well. As everyone was aware of this, the world was different. It was pretty different. Just imagine if you were aware that everything you did was noted by an angelic host of billions of angels as soon as you did it. I call that one my angelic jump. And the universe and world was my angelic world. No wars here. Not when every angel became aware immediately of the thought of war. In my angelic world there were no religions as we know them either. Everyone was aware of their celestial guardians just as everyone was aware of a creator and the supreme being. There were no churches. There were no temples. No places to worship as everyone carried their temples with them. There were no beliefs in the spiritual world as everyone knew it existed. When you know there’s no reason to believe it’s a fact. There were no sadists, no masochists, no warmongers, no troublemakers of any sort on angel world. Angels do not have the ability of recreating themselves, but they do understand the human and animal methods of recreation, of course. And so every human, when the time comes, has a curtain of privacy that angels do not intrude upon unless they’re invited to do so. In angel world, people do eat meat, but the animals that are available, each with their own basic angel, they know that their function is to merge their consciousness with the human consciousness at a certain period, and they fully accept that role. Animals are treated with respect and kindness until the time they’re mercifully put to rest with their bodies creating sustenance for the highest form of consciousness, the human. There are businesses and governments and salespeople and politicians on Angel World, but it’s unique in that there’s no lying. And so exaggeration takes the place of untruths, and metaphors abound. But people understand this, and elected officials are given leave to rule, not so much as what they promise, but their actions prior to taking office. These are just very general descriptions of angel world. If it seems like a heavenly universe, it’s pretty close. But there are also polarization worlds where the opposite is true. And although there are angels there as well, they’re invisible to all. And in those worlds, there are wars, rumors of wars, lying, deceit, and general turmoil. But enough about other universes. You can mentally take a quantum jump into any world that can be imagined. That’s the whole idea. That’s the premise of quantum jumping. So let’s get back to this world and my angel. I say my angel, and I often say hello to her, but she usually just smiles and nods. I say she, but I have no knowledge as to whether my angel is male, female, or even has a gender. I believe that angels have no gender. They don’t reproduce. They don’t require gender. But I will refer to her as a she. May I know your name, I asked. Coraline was the reply. Rather than go through the entire communication, which was lengthy, I would simply tell you what knowledge I received from Coraline that day. Now, at this point, I’d like to add something. Believe what you’re about to hear or don’t believe it. If the information comforts you, if it helps you, then I’ve done my job. Coraline knows that my mission on earth is to help and to comfort and above all to teach. Utilize the material that you’ll be learning. And if your life gets better for it, then the time and energy you spent hearing me out will be well worth it to you. Every significant religion that I’m aware of believes that angels exist. Angels are mentioned in the Bible, both New and Old Testaments, in the Koran, in the Book of Mormon, in Jehovah’s Witnesses literature. Virtually all major religions, angels are mentioned. Angels come in many guises. The first time I noted that was in 1975 when I joined the Silva organization as an instructor. During the latter half of the course, we introduced our students to their counselors, one male, one female. I immediately thought, what a novel way to get people to their personal angels, because there was very little difference between angels, as I knew of them, and counselors, as all the instructors of Silva taught. And for people whose beliefs wouldn’t allow them to see angels, counselors was a perfect replacement. Now, as we continue on with the modules, I will have an answer for many of your questions. What’s the difference between the communicating with your angel and quantum jumping, you might ask? When your angels are assigned to you, your personal angel, the hierarchy of angels, the creation of angels, and so on, as much as I know, you will know. Know now, however, that as you get further into this discourse, your mind is going to open more and more to the possibility that there really are supernatural, let me say celestial beings, whose only purpose here on Earth is to help those they’re assigned to. Why, then, is there so much difficulty and so many problems in the world? Why, you might ask, why don’t the angels all get together and solve mankind’s problem in one fell swoop? Well, perhaps you’ll understand the answer to that riddle before we reach the last module in this series. But first, how do angels come to be in the first place? Created by God, there is an infinity of angels, just as there is an infinity of solar systems, of planets and people. A never-ending parade. You do have an angel. She is with you every moment of your life. Like myself, you probably saw your angel the first few years of your life. But if you’re like most people, you forgot about her as soon as you became aware of other things that interested you. You may ask, why do you need an angel? Well, let me tell you what I feel makes for a perfect relationship. A good relationship is a filling of needs. If you have a strong need and the other person in the relationship fills that need, then you have a good relationship. The stronger the need that is filled, the better the relationship. I want a good relationship with the inspirational side of me. That creative portion is easily tapped into when I communicate with my angel. My angel has a name, as I’ve said, it’s Coraline. Using her name makes it a bit more accessible, makes her a bit more accessible and, of course, friendly. When I’m reaching for a theme or painting a canvas or playing the piano or whatever I do, I will sometimes close my eyes for a moment and mentally say, Coraline, give me a hand here. And then clearing my mind, things usually come to me. And if you don’t believe in angels, it doesn’t matter. I know that some of you may have been raised to believe that there’s no such thing as angels. And when I say it doesn’t really matter, what I mean is that it’s the result that matters. You’ll hear me say it again and again. If it works, use it. Maybe there are no such things as angels. Maybe it’s just wishful thinking, and we’re talking to ourselves, our inner consciousness. Maybe. But then again, maybe not. I feel more comfortable believing that angels exist. And if some people don’t believe and won’t use our techniques, then it just makes it a bit more difficult for them to communicate with their angels. Except when deeply asleep or dreaming. A belief that they exist, even a minor belief, will open a channel, and you will get a message occasionally, usually as an inspirational thought. Now, as I said, angels do not have physical bodies, but they are definitely beings of a spiritual nature, invisible to you, yet they are totally visible to them themselves, and you are, of course, are totally visible to them. Your angel loves you, as do all angels love you, and your effort to love and to somewhat understand their natures can only result in good happening. However, one doesn’t worship angels. They’re servants, as are you, and commanded only to worship God. Angels do not judge or accuse, no matter what the cause. And although superior to the human race and spiritual status, they never, ever judge the human race. It’s where our free will comes in. It wouldn’t be free if we were constantly being judged all the time and condemned all the time. Free will is just that. Although angels can and do work alone with their hosts, they also have a counterpart. And all angels are actually pairs, not male and female, as they have no gender. One angel is positive, the other negative, but don’t think this means good and bad. It’s simply a polarization that fulfills the universal law of gender that requires a positive and negative in all things, save the Creator Himself. When you’ve taken it upon yourself to seek out and to work with your angelic counterpart, you will have taken a giant step toward the crystallization of your spiritual being and becoming. Working with your angel is really a simple thing, having as its first component the desire to do so. Often easiest in meditation, I will help you in this first step with the meditation on the third module of this series. In meditation, you’re totally concentrative with the normal minutia of the world at bay, and only one thought comes in. Now, this allows your angel easy access to you, where you may speak and be spoken to. However, like all things, the more you practice speaking to your angel, the easier it becomes until, hopefully, as it is with me, it becomes second nature for you. And in a moment, with your next module, I’ll get into it a little bit deeper. But for now, just relax and think about the words that you just heard.

Audio Module 2: How to Start Communicating With Your Angel
--------------------

Module 2. Your angel is always close by, nearer to you than can be imagined. Let’s see if we can discover how to use that great imagination of yours and see how close they can be. How close is the person who calls you on your cell phone? Now, your cell phone is a device that allows the person calling, allows that voice to manifest. But where is that voice? that you hear if you don’t have the phone. The voice, just like a radio wave, permeates the universe. Let’s imagine a radio wave. Say that you have a mini radio, size of a lima bean. There are such things. And let’s say further that you were to swallow that radio that is the size of a lima bean. Now, you know that radio, it’s going to play in your stomach. Because radio waves, they go right through you. They permeate you. That’s science. Now consider this. Is a radio wave stronger than an angel? I think not. Imagine an angel who is an energy form, a spiritual energy form, just as we humans are physical energy forms. When you go to the extreme microcosmos, the microcosmic, level of the human and get beyond the cellular, beyond the atomic, beyond the charms and quarks that make up the atoms that bind us, you find ultimately the strings of vibration that energy is made up of. One of the absolute principles is that of as above, so below, as below, so above. This gives us a clue that the angelic energy form is similar, but at a higher level of vibration. When you ask where your angel is, the answer is the same as if you were to ask where the waves of energy of a radio broadcast are. The answer is everywhere. There was an ancient conundrum that asked how many angels could fit on the head of a pin. And the answer, once again, is to compare the question to something of a scientific nature, a scientific nature that we’re aware of, and that would be radio waves. How many radio waves could fit on the head of a pin? And the answer to both questions is as many as there are. An infinite number of angels would be the answer. Therefore, do not look out there for your angels because they’re within as well as outside you. Now the question comes up as to how do you open yourself to angels and how do you communicate with your angel? Well, to open the door, you have to have a desire to do so. You must want to communicate with your angel. But remember, your angel is on a higher plane, the spiritual plane. And so that brings up a different question. How do I reach the spiritual plane? Well, the first step is to quiet the mind. There are three planes of existence that we’re familiar with, that we’re aware of. The physical, the mental, and the spiritual. We often move from the physical plane to the mental many times during the day. Before every physical action, there has to have been a mental directive to instigate that action. Sometimes thoughts are instantaneous, but most mental commands come after some time in thought. Before you do anything, you have to will yourself to do the thing. That’s scientific fact. And if you consider it, you’ll find that it’s true. Reading or listening to me now is a conscious choice that you’ve made. If you hadn’t made the choice, if you didn’t have the will or the desire to hear me, you wouldn’t be listening. You eat when you’re hungry. But hunger doesn’t cause you to eat. Your desire caused by the hunger is what motivates you to eat. A person who’s ill, depleted of energy, may feel hunger pangs. But enervated by the illness has no desire to eat and doesn’t eat. Whereas a person who isn’t hungry but desires a piece of candy or an ice cream or chocolate will eat. People who don’t believe in angels and have no desire to see or to hear or even to imagine them, they won’t see them. Those who believe in angels and have built a desire to see their angel, they only require some means of stimulating that desire through the agency of a catalyst or channel. I’m going to be providing that channel for you in the next module via a special meditation designed to help you to communicate with your angel. Now, don’t be concerned if you’re not adept at meditation or, for that matter, feeling your spiritual side. Many people feel that way, and utilizing our unique methods have, in fact, they felt as though they communicated with their angel at the very first try. And if you’re skeptical, that’s all right, that’s fine. Anything that has not been definitely proven through science should be greeted with a degree of skepticism. All that I ask is that you withhold judgment and follow along with me as your guide. With respect to facts, well, they’re in the main anecdotal. To my knowledge, no angel has ever broadcast themselves to the world. That’s not their function. If it were, there would be neither wars nor rumor of war. During the next module, which is a meditation designed to chip away at that skepticism of yours, if indeed you have any, and bring you to a peek at your personal angel. What about bad people? Do they speak with their angels as well? Well, the really bad news people wouldn’t dream of having a personal angel. Angels don’t interfere with the free will of the human race, and so they wouldn’t give any help to their patron in any case. Angels don’t attempt to chip at or enter the wholesomeness of the human mind, nor do they influence human will, and under no circumstances do they interfere with the action of a human being. Free will is exactly that. and you do what you do as you do it without celestial influence. Saying that, however, there is a difference in your communicating with and asking for help in your free will actions. Angels do not have the power to change any of the choices their human makes. They can, however, when asked, provide the power necessary to help the human they’re assigned to with their human’s desire, providing the human is moral and has good purpose at heart. Angels are nearer to you than your skin. They deeply care for you, so much so that they’re saddened by intolerance and obstinate and inflexible desires that they know will be harmful to you. Here’s how to use your angel best. First of all, be more open and accessible. To do that, you have to get your emotions out of the way. You chart your own course. Then your angels act to make the best possible use of that course. There are always choices that are available to you. If you look back on your life, you’ll discover choices that you made to get where you are were always one of many that you had. Let me give you an example. Oh, let’s take Sheila Wagner. Sheila Wagner was at a party. And when she grew thirsty, she went to the open bar and ordered a drink. While at the bar, she met Tom Wilkins. The first choice she made was going to the party. She didn’t have to go to the party. Before going, she thought about staying home and reading a book. But she decided she needed some excitement, so her second choice was going to the bar. At the party, she was bored and decided to stand at the bar to see if she might meet someone interesting. That was her third choice. Third choice was when she spoke to Wilkins, Tom Wilkins. He asked her what her name was, and as he looked nice, she told him, and then she figured, what the heck? May as well talk to somebody. That’s what she was there for after all. Well, they made a date to meet for dinner the following Saturday. That was her fourth choice. She left her last boyfriend and figured she’d learn more about the new guy. You begin to see the sequence? Now, there were a whole lot of choices. There were many minor choices made. Could have walked this way. She could have gone to the bathroom. She could have gone out earlier. One choice after another. Always choices. Well, eventually she had a bad experience with Tom and she broke up with him after spending a year and a half in his company. Now, she put it all down to experience, but it was really a sequence of choices. She wouldn’t have had the bad experience had she not dated him in the first place. She wouldn’t have had the bad experience had she not gone to the bar or had she not gone to the party. All the while, her angel was hovering nearby, immersed in all the experiences. Now, her angel knew that Tom was bad for her, and indeed that she shouldn’t have been at the dance at all that night. But angels don’t interfere, not when they are not asked. Had Sheila communicated with her angel prior to going to the dance, there may well have been a different outcome. And Sheila would have saved herself 18 months of misery. Now, allow me to get to the present. This present. As I write this, I’m thinking of a few choices that I have. I can continue writing this or speaking this, or I can take a walk around the block. The walk is exactly a mile and a quarter. Now, I can use the exercise, but it means stopping work and walking. Well, I do a lot of thinking while walking. Should I put on my walking shoes, get the dog, and go? Well, the dog loves to walk. He runs madly all over the house at the mention of the word walk. Well, I’ll consult my angel Coralie. I close my eyes. I call her. She knows what I want. She just smiles and nods her head. And so I leave the keyboard and go for a walk. That’s my decision. Okay, well, I’ve taken a walk. I’m back. I just walked my mile and a quarter. No big deal. But, you know, I do a lot of thinking while I walk, kind of setting up of choices. Now, all that may seem to be making mountains out of molehills, insignificant and meaningless things. But they’re examples of how your angel can be contacted and used, even for things as simple as taking a walk. Yeah, that’s a choice. Will your angel speak to you as I’m speaking to you now? Will your ears hear her voice? Well, think about this. Your ears hear due to vibrations on the physical plane. I speak, and that speech creates a sound wave. Your ears contain tiny little bones that cause your eardrum to vibrate. This is basically how you hear. The sound of your voice vibrates the bones in your eardrum, called the cochlea, and you hear. To hear, you have to have a physical vibration to energize and vibrate those bones of hearing in your eardrum. Your angels on the spiritual plane can only be contacted mentally, therefore cannot cause a physical vibration. So it’s impossible to hear her as you would hear someone on the physical plane. To hear your angel, you must do that on her plane of existence, the spiritual. When I speak to Coraline, she usually answers and I do hear her. But mentally, the mental plane is a little closer to the spiritual, a whole lot closer than is the physical. So I hear her mentally and on the spiritual plane. Now, sometimes it does seem as though I’m making it all up and I’m talking to myself. But when that happens, as it does, it’s her influencing me to think the thoughts that I’m thinking that I’m making up. She has no influence on the physical plane, but the spiritual plane, that’s her turf. When a person on the physical plane reports getting information from the other side, as many do, take Edgar Cayce or Jane Roberts’ example, the entity or angel that appears to be speaking will utilize the physical aspects after establishing a connection on the spiritual side, and only then. A state akin to hypnotic trance is often used, but meditation operates in the same manner. To get information from the other side, you must first open that channel, and you must be on the other side. That’s what our meditation modules are about, taking you to the dimension where you’ll be able to communicate with your angel. At first, you won’t be sure. Are you talking to yourself and answering yourself? Maybe. Are you speaking to a celestial being who wants to speak with you and help you in your life? Maybe. Are you speaking with your personal angel? Maybe. Why do I say maybe? Because no one can tell you that scientifically an angel even exists. Yes, they are in the holy books of most religions, and yes, billions of people believe they exist, but it’s all taken on faith. So? Have faith. The easiest way for you to begin the process is to act as if it’s true. Act as if you’re really speaking with your angel. Ask your angel her name and then ask her a simple question. What question? That’s up to you. I’ll help in the following module. Just go along with my guidance and act as if it’s all true. Act as if you are indeed really speaking with your personal angel. Now, before listening to the next module, find yourself a comfortable place where you can be quiet and undisturbed for 20 minutes or so, and we’ll begin. Your angel is waiting to communicate with you. And your angel knows many good things about you. Your angel knows everything about you. But your angel is there to help you in every way. So just relax. and you’ll soon discover how much easier it is to communicate with your angel than you ever thought it would be.

Audio Module 3: The Openness Angel Meditation
--------------------

Module 3, Meditation, Meeting Your Angel. At this time, relax. We’ll start with the 3 to 1 count. This module is not to be played in a moving vehicle. This is a meditation exercise. Find a comfortable position. Close your eyes. Take a deep breath. And as you exhale, Mentally repeat and visualize the number three, three times. Three, like that. Take another deep breath. And as you exhale, mentally repeat and visualize the number two, three times. Take another deep breath. And as you exhale, mentally repeat and visualize. the number one, three times. To help you to enter a more relaxed, meditative level of mind, I’m going to count from ten to one. On every descending number, feel yourself going inward, and you will enter a pleasant, a relaxed level of mind, where you will be able to concentrate completely on one. The meditative level of mind. Ten. Nine. Feel going deeper. Eight. Seven. Six. Deeper and deeper. Five. Four. Three. Deeper and deeper. Two. One. You are now at a relaxed, a very pleasant level of mind. where you are able to concentrate fully on one subject. At this time, concentrate on my words. You are now and always in complete control of your state of mind. You can open your eyes. You can be fully alert anytime you wish to be. Every time that you enter this relaxed meditation state, Know that you’re getting better and better in every way. Whenever you enter this relaxed meditation state, you will mentally say, every day, in every way, I’m getting better and better. When you say these words, sense yourself improving in all areas of your life. Sense yourself getting better and better. Visualize improvements in your life as you mentally repeat the words. Every day, in every way, I’m getting better and better. Relax. Relax and direct your attention to your eyes. Now relax your eyes. Relax your lips and jaw. Relax your head and your neck. Relax. your body. Relax your shoulders, your arms and hands. Relax your hips, your legs, your feet. Relax your stomach. You are now completely relaxed. Repeat mentally, my body rests and refreshes itself when I consciously relax. My body rests and refreshes itself when I consciously relax. I’m relaxed now. Repeat mentally after me. Every day my image of myself improves. I can do anything I have a desire to do. I am a wonderful human being. There’s no one else on earth. Exactly like me. I am unique. Every day I grow stronger knowing that I can. I can think. I can create. I can do. I can do anything I have a desire to do. Relax. Imagine now that there is an elevator. in front of you. Create an elevator. To help you to visualize this elevator, I will count from one to three. And at the count of three, there will be an elevator in front of you. Know that. Imagine that. Create it. Use your great imagination. One, two, three. An elevator has appeared. The door to the elevator. is closed. There is one button on the door. It is an up button. Press the button. Good. Now the door to the elevator is opening. Step into the elevator and the elevator will take you to the top floor where the spiritual dimension is and where your angel is waiting to introduce herself to you. The angel is already close to you and has been since you were an infant, but she’s chosen this means of greeting you to make it easier for you to reach the spiritual plane where you will be better able to communicate. You’re now in the elevator, and now the door is open. closing. The door is closed. In front of you is a button that simply says, to the top. Press the button and then relax as the elevator takes you up to the top, to the spiritual dimension where your angel is waiting to reveal herself. Relax. And now, imagine the elevator is going up, up, up. Enjoy the ride. Soon you will reach the top, the spiritual dimension. The elevator is going up and approaching a different dimension, the spiritual dimension. Now the elevator is slowing down. In a moment, the elevator will stop. The elevator is stopped. Relax. The door is slowly opening. The door is open. There on the other side of the door, is the spiritual dimension. Imagine that. Know that. Use your great imagination. Spiritual dimension. All things are beautiful here. Colors are brighter. Sounds are clearer. All your senses are sharper. And your imagination is greater and more creative. Relax. And now it is time to meet your angel. Relax. Step out of the elevator and ask your angel her name. No need to tell her yours. She knows it. Relax. I will be quiet for a moment while you act as if you are actually speaking with your angel. Your angel is there to help you. To help you in making choices. to help you in setting goals, to help you in relationships, to help you with your attitude, to help you to be a better person, and to help you to be a better person in all things. Your angel is here to guide you, and you’re here to establish a relationship with your angel. A relationship is based on needs. Your angel has only one need with respect to you, the need to help you in all aspects of your life. Your needs are known to your angel. This is the basis for a successful relationship. Relax. This is an introduction to your angel. Your angel may be clear in your visualization, or your angel may be formless and hazy. But however you sense your angel will be correct for you. Sometimes your angel is there as an entity, sometimes as a fully formed being. Your angel is here to guide you. Mostly the guidance will be as an intuitive thought, insightful and perceptive. Sometimes it will simply come as a feeling. a good feeling about the choice that you’re about to make. Life is a series of choices. Before you make any choice, consult with your angel. Imagine that your angel is laying out different choices for you to make and put those choices in a hierarchy with a choice you would have made without guidance as the number one choice. And then bring in other choices. and see how you would feel about them. To help you to communicate with your angel, we’re going to create a means of calling that your angel will respond to. Whenever you think you need help from your angel, touch your thumb to the little finger of either hand and mentally say, Angel, come. And that will be your signal to your angel. to be there, to help you in whatever situation you require help. Relax. We will now program that signal with the help of all the angels. I’m going to count from one to three. At the count of three, you will touch your thumb to the little finger of that hand, either hand, and repeat the words, Angel, come. And imagine that your angel is there with you to help you in the situation you would like to be helped with. One, two, three. Touch your thumb to the little finger of your hand and say, Angel, come. Now act as if you can sense your angel. Very good. Now relax. I will be quiet for a short while. Relax. You have now been introduced to your angel. Use your signal whenever you feel like it. Your angel is always willing to help you. Your angel is always there. You cannot overdo it. Your angel has been created to help you. That is her main function. In a moment, I’m going to count slowly from one to five. At the count of five, you will open your eyes and come back to the physical world in full consciousness. You will remember all that you have just heard and just imagined. And you will put the knowledge… of how to contact your angel to good use, for your benefit and for the benefit of all mankind. One, two, three, four, coming out now, and five. Eyes open, wide awake.

Audio Module 4: Ask & You Shall Receive
--------------------

Module 4. The biblical homily, ask and ye shall receive, comes into play more with respect to getting help from your angel than perhaps any other. But how, you might ask, how does a person ask an angel for anything? Or to put it in another way, how does a person communicate with an angel? Well, before you ask, you have to decide. what it is that you’re going to ask for. What is it that you want? Also, a question is going to come up with respect to angels as a metaphor. A metaphor is a word or a phrase that’s not meant literally, but only as an example of. For instance, if I were to say that I have a friend who’s strong as a bull, you immediately know that my friend is pretty strong, but you also know that he’s definitely not as strong as a bull. but it’s easy to visualize the strength of the person with the image of a bull in your mind. Other models use metaphors that many people view as angels. For example, there are organizations that use the words higher intelligence to indicate their view of angels. The silver organization, since its inception, has used what they call counselors that many feel is a metaphor for an angel. And of course, the channeling process that’s so popular is also looked on as a metaphor for angels. Again, you’ll find people who believe that Esther Hicks’ channeling of Abraham and Jane Roberts’ channeling of Seth are metaphors for the supposition that both Abraham and Seth are angels. One thing that everyone will agree on is that they are getting help from the other side. We’re not… using a metaphor, but the angels themselves. No need to channel if you can speak directly to your personal angel. Now the question is going to come up. Well, how do I know if I’m actually speaking with my angel, or with any angel for that matter, and when it comes time to make a decision, an important decision, how do I know I’m making a good one, the right one? Well, let me tell you the story of Steve. A man whose angel was a bean. Yeah, you heard me right. A bean. A small, dried bean. The kind you might find in a bowl of chili and beans. But I get ahead of myself. I heard the story from a friend who taught the Napoleon Hills course in Illinois. He told me about Steve, who was a captain of industry, and the self-made man who stood at the top of the heap. of industrialists, and who received accolades from the community of successful business people. Steve was intelligent, knowledgeable, charismatic, and handsome. But what he was best known for was his ability to make instant decisions every single time. Whenever he was confronted by something where he had to choose one thing or the other, he’d lift his chin as though he was looking for advice from above. His eyes usually turned upward. He’d put his right hand in the pocket of his jacket, think for a moment or two, and then bang, just like that. He’d make his decision. Yes or no, go left or right, do this or do that, whatever it was. And one time when he was interviewed by a reporter, the question of his instant decision-making came up. Steve just winked and he said, well, I’ve got an angel on my shoulder. And that’s what was printed in the newspaper. The man with the angel on his shoulder. Well, Steve’s decision pose was so well-known that when he had his portrait painted by a well-known artist, That was supposed to hang in the company rotunda, and in fact did. The pose was him, Steve, with his chin tilted up, eyes looking up to the sky, and right hand sunk deep in his jacket pocket. But one day, it came time for Steve to retire. His immediate subordinate, Tom Castleton, was due to become the new chairman. Tom called Steve aside, and he asked for his secret. How in the world, whenever he had choices to make, whenever there was a yes or a no involved, how could he just come up with a decision in seconds, every single time? Steve laughed and said, okay, Tom, as long as you’re replacing me, I’m going to tell you the secret. It’s beans. I don’t understand, Tom said. Do you remember the story the examiner wrote up about me that I had an angel on my shoulder? Tom nodded. Well, Steve said, it’s true. There is an angel on my shoulder, and whenever I have to make a decision, I call on her. But what’s a bean got to do with it? Tom asked. Steve put his hand in his famous pocket and pulled out a handful of dried beans. After showing them to Tom, he put them back and he said, whenever an event or a question comes up where a decision has to be made, I reach into my pocket, grab some beans, with my hand in my pocket, I count them. No one sees me do this. And if the number of beans in my hand is even, I say yes. If it’s odd, I say no. Or if there’s more to it than that, I will think one way if odd and the other if even. You see, Tom, I discovered a long time ago that it really didn’t matter in the long run which decision I made. What did matter was not deciding at all. Now when I’m counting the beans, I always ask that angel at my shoulder to guide the count. And she generally does. She must. Because my decisions are right a whole lot more than they’re wrong. Remember this, Tom. Indecision. is your enemy. It stands right alongside a procrastination to hold you back in life. And with that, Steve left the building. Well, I thought about that story quite a bit over the years, and I found it to be true. So that when you have a few choices to make, ask your angel to lend a hand. Remember, she’s always there, always waiting, but she won’t act on her own. You have to ask your angel. And when you do, Your angel will help you. Don’t be worrying if you made the right decision at the time. Right or wrong, you’ll only know the answer at some future time when you look back. I’m reminded of my friend Al. He had a furniture store. One day there was a fire and it burned down. Al wasn’t insured and he lost everything. That day was the worst day of his life. He sat around his apartment listless, depressed. But after a year of living from day to day, he was forced into making a decision. He could find work as a salesman for other companies, or he could work in the service field as a waiter or short order cook. Well, he flipped a coin. And he got a job as a waiter. He heard about angels, and although he didn’t believe it, he decided to act as… it were true, and he really had an angel. Every night before he went to bed, he closed his eyes and thought about his angel. Al had a routine that he used to call her. He lit a candle, and as long as the candle was burning, he felt that his angel could hear him and would help him. At first, it seemed as though he was talking to himself, but he listened. Be the best waiter in the world. That’s what he felt his angel was telling him. And he became the best waiter. Save every penny. And he saved every penny. Open a hamburger stand. And after he had enough for a down payment, he opened a hamburger stand. Every night he acted as if he was actually talking with his personal angel. And every morning he acted on the advice that he got. Al now has two successful restaurants, and he speaks to his angel about everything in his life. I asked him if he really believed in angels, and his answer is one to think about. It doesn’t matter whether I do or not, he said, but I act as if there are angels, and that’s enough for me. One thing I do know, the day that fire took my furniture store and I lost everything, I thought was the worst day of my life. At least that’s what I thought at the time. But as it turned out, It was the best day of my life because it led me to where I am now, and it’s a better place. Friends, only when you look back at a thing do you know if it was beneficial or detrimental. Once again, the important thing is to make the decision. More problems come up from indecision than from making a wrong decision. When you decide to do something, You’re going to be right more often than wrong. But when you make no decision, you’re always wrong. How many things in your life are there, let’s say at the present time, where there’s choice involved, where there’s a decision to be made? Your angel can help you to make that decision and to make the correct decision. But you know this. Your angel can peek into the future and see how each decision that you make will affect you in the future. Your angel can inspire you and help to overcome indecision. All you have to do is ask. During the meditation module that follows the next module, I’m going to help you to communicate with your angel once again, to inspire and to create a new decision-making model for you. Wouldn’t life be easier if you had someone at hand to help you in all your decision-making? Wouldn’t you like to do things differently and get a better outcome? Let me tell you a story I first told at the very first seminar I presented a long time ago. It’s about a couple, a couple who just got married. The young man’s wife was cooking a roast for dinner. The young man came into the kitchen and watched. His wife took the meat out of the refrigerator. She put on a little salt, pepper, a few spices. Then she took a knife. And she cut an inch off the left side and an inch off the right side. And she put the meat in a pan and into the oven. Honey, why did you do that? The young man asked. Well, because that’s the way you cook a roast, was the answer. No, no, no, he said. I understand the salt and the pepper and the spices. But why did you cut an inch off each side of the meat? Well, I told you, she said. That’s the way you cook a roast. But that’s crazy, he said. And his new bride started to cry. Well, he calmed her down and thought, well, if that’s her only craziness, it’s okay. I’ve got a few friends who have to contend with a lot more. Well, a few weeks passed. And they went to her mother’s for dinner. And she happened to be cooking a roast. The young man came into the kitchen and watched. His mother-in-law took the meat out of the refrigerator. She put on salt, pepper, and a few spices. And then she took a knife and cut an inch off the left side, then an inch off the right side. Put it in a pan, then into the oven. Now he’s really bewildered. The young man, he just shook his head. Sometime later, they were over her grandmother’s house. And coincidentally, she was about to prepare a roast. The young man. determined to get to the bottom of this wackiness, asked if he could watch. Well, the old lady was delighted in his interest. He watched as she took the meat out of the refrigerator. She put on salt, pepper, and a few spices, put it in a pan, and then into the oven. Didn’t you forget something, Grandma, he said. She shook her head and answered, No, I did what I always do to make a roast. Yeah, but you forgot to cut an inch off each side of the meat, he said. Oh, I stopped doing that years ago, she answered. Why did you stop, he asked. She looked at him and smiled. Well, because I got a bigger pan. You know, people are often stuck doing things the same old way, in the same manner. as their parents, their friends, and dozens of other influences in their lives. They never realize that there’s a better way, a different way, because it’s easier to go along with what you are comfortable with, doing it the same old way again and again, never making a decision, never wanting to change, always taking the easy path. But that’s where your angel can help you. All you have to do is to communicate. In the next module, you’ll learn how angels can guide, protect, and to help you to resolve many of the issues that cause you distress. Remember, when you do it the same old way, you’ve got to expect the same result.

Audio Module 5: Nipping Internal Conflict in The Bud
--------------------

Module 5. You’ve learned that there’s often a struggle between making a good decision as opposed to making a bad one, but that bad decisions can only be recognized after the fact, sometimes long after. Bad decisions, they usually come about because of some internal conflict, this tension that comes up due to preconceived notions. such as ideas, opinions, and the way you look at the world. That’s what creates this discord and stress. Internal conflict causes more health problems, as well as problems with the real world, than you can imagine. When you believe that things have to be a particular way, but they do not appear to be that way with respect to your reality, that creates inner conflict. Inner conflict also comes about when you’re facing a problem with choices, and choices seem to be difficult. But you must, you absolutely have to make a decision one way or the other. Now, the easiest way to get around the conflict is to just assume that the stress of the conflict is caused by forces outside yourself. But this is never the case. It’s never the event. that creates a problem. It’s your attitude towards the event. This is so important, I’m going to repeat it. It’s not the event that causes problems, but how you perceive the event. Allow me to tell you about a friend who used her angel to create an attitude that cut off her inner conflict before it began. She didn’t allow the conflict to come into the picture at all. The story, though true in essence, it’s also metaphorical in that it’s an example of how you can deal with your own conflicts. Let’s call my friend Leona. Leona had a shop. What kind isn’t important? One day after a hard weekend storm, she came into her shop and she found it flooded. The roof had given way in one particular spot. and it rained all the weekend into her place of business. When she walked into the place, the water was up to her ankles. Her immediate reaction was that of stress. Her stomach felt as though it had bounced on the ground a couple of times, and a lump formed in her throat, she said. And she started to cry. She was ruined. Everything she’d worked for was gone. Oh, she got back in her car, and she drove off, still crying. After a few minutes, she tapped her little finger with her thumb three times as she was taught in one of my classes, and she signaled her angel, whose name was Sonny. Sonny, she asked, what am I going to do? Leona pulled over to the side of the road and parked her car. Heaving a big sigh, she closed her eyes and she thought about her angel. Her mind opened as she sat there with closed eyes and went into a light state. of meditation. That light state of meditation in of itself was very, very helpful because you can’t be relaxed and stressful at the same time, and the meditation immediately got rid of the stress. Well, she thought she heard the words, take a vacation. Take a vacation? That was something she hadn’t thought of. Her shop was gone. She was out of business. How could she take a vacation? But suddenly her thoughts were not on the event. She wasn’t thinking about the flood. She was thinking about the mountains and then the beach. She thought about laying in the sun. She thought about flying to New York or San Francisco or Los Angeles. As she sat in her car at the side of the road, she thought about all the places she could visit to relax. When her thoughts came back to her business being gone, she was better able to cope. She now saw the loss as an opportunity. She would take a few weeks off and then decide what to do next. Leona, like Al, had transformed the inner conflict to peace and looking forward to new things. She’d do it in a new way. She’d figure something out. What had actually happened was that she was in control of her attitude. And instead of bemoaning her fate and blaming bad luck, she used it as a springboard to something else. Once again, she spoke to her angel. What she did next and how she got on with her life, well, that’s not important to the point I’m making here. The point being that when something comes along to create conflict in your life, Don’t allow the event to define you. Use the event to create a new you with decisions that you choose. Leona’s angel helped her to resolve the inner conflict before it took hold by inspiring her to take a different path, a different road. Angels speak to their humans all the time, but not in the manner you’d think. They speak by making life easy or difficult to show the way. Let me give you an example, and metaphorically speaking. Let’s say that you’re walking along the road of your life, and life is difficult, it’s hard. You go along, and there’s a storm that comes up. Well, you get through the storm, and then there’s a river in your way. You cross the river, and then there’s a boulder in front of you. You go around the boulder, and there’s a tiger there. You move around the tiger and there’s a fence you have to climb. And it’s just one thing after another. And life is hard. And each hurdle that you cross creates more stress and inner conflict. Well, that’s a message. That’s your angel talking to you, telling you you’re on the wrong road. How do you get on the right road? Well, you have to change. You have to do something different. And so you do. You make different choices. You make decisions. And the storm is gone. The boulder is gone. The tiger is no longer there. The river still has to be crossed. And the fence is there. But the road is a little easier. Well, that too is a message. It’s your angel telling you, now you’re doing the right thing. You’re making the right decisions. And so you keep at it. Changing direction. Being kinder to people. consulting your angel about every decision. And suddenly the road is clear. The river’s gone, the fence is gone, and with it all the stress is gone. Well, that too is a message. Life is supposed to be easy. The road ahead is supposed to be clear of obstacles. Your attitude is what’s blocking you. With new decisions, your attitude changes. And like Leona, you use seemingly negative events to propel you to new heights, new places. Now, I mentioned that Leona tapped her little finger with her thumb three times to call her angel. Perhaps I should expand on that. People use different… to call their angels. It seems to make it easier to communicate. I personally use the baga. That’s touching the roof of your mouth with your tongue. You know that by now. I use the baga, and then I touch the little finger of my right hand with my thumb, with the thumb of my right hand. I use the right hand, but either will do. And I think the word coralline. Coralline, of course, is the name of my angel. And I imagine she’s there. Now, do I see her as clearly as I see someone on the physical plane, as I would see you if you were in my presence? No, of course not. It’s more of a feeling, an intuition, if you will. Occasionally, I’ll just act as if she’s in my presence. But it’s all mental. There are three planes of existence. The physical, the mental, and the spiritual. The mental is of a higher vibration than the physical, and the spiritual is a higher vibration than the mental. Therefore, the mental plane is closer to the spiritual and angels than is the physical. I would guess we go somewhere in between the two planes, the spiritual and the mental, to meet. The bhaga, in case you want a little more information, in case you didn’t know, is an ancient yoga technique. It consists of just touching the tip of your tongue to the roof of your mouth for a moment, as I’ve mentioned, and that’s the trigger. I use it for just about everything. It kind of tells my mind, hey, get ready, we’re about to do something. Now, you can, of course, create your own calling card for your angel. But to make it easier for you, I’m going to help you to create a trigger during the next module, which is a meditation exercise. for communicating with your angel, as well as creating a decision-making model. But before we get to that, let’s examine the good and the bad decisions. According to quantum jumping, I say jumping and not physics, because although the premise is the same, quantum physics works on the physical plane. That’s where the word physics comes from, physical. And quantum jumping works on the mental plane. We feel in quantum jumping that there are an infinite, that means absolutely limitless number of parallel universes. And in each of them, remember they’re infinite, there’s a counterpart, you. Now that every time you make a decision, you split off into a different dimension. Now you don’t know you’re splitting off, as it’s the reality that you’re in, that you’re aware of, that’s your norm. Let’s say you decide not to take your car to the store, that you’ll walk. Normally you take your car, but this time you decided that you’re going to walk. Well, you’ve made a decision, and there’s a split off. One self will walk, and in another dimension, a twin self will be taking the car. In the universe where you took the car, you met someone in the store, and you were directed to a new relationship. And the universe where you walked, you didn’t meet that person as you arrived after the other person had left. And the split you will have an entirely different life than you will. Let me clarify that a bit. It may be a little confusing. I want to tell you a story. I probably told the story a thousand times without exaggeration. And it’s a good example. It was New Year’s Eve, 1948. My friend Jerry and I… had just turned 21 years of age. We were going to a party we were invited to. When we got to the house, the young lady who had invited us asked for $20 to cover the food and drink. Well, we were insulted by this, not expecting to have to pay for a party we were invited to, and we left. We went to another party that we knew about, and there my friend met Lorraine. It was an instant match. Jerry and Lorraine started to go out together and soon they were married. They had four children. One of the children became a major factor in the building industry. He put up many of the high-rises in Los Angeles and San Francisco. The cause of all this was $20. Because if that young lady did not ask us to pay to attend the party, we would have stayed. Jerry would not have met Lorraine. The builder would not have been born. The high rises would not have been built and on and on and on. Cause and effect. But in another universe, a quantum jump away, we did pay the $20 and Jerry and Lorraine didn’t meet. None of those children were born. Jerry lived a totally different life. Well, which life would prove to be the better one for Jerry? There’s no way to know. Maybe his angel would know. But then again, Maybe his angel inspired him not to pay the $20. The point of the story is that every time you make a decision, there is a self that made a different decision and went off in another direction. Your angel’s greatest asset to you is to inspire you to make the best decision for you at the time so that you will have a better and better life. Now, in the next module, I’m going to guide you on how to call your angel and how to communicate with your angel to make better decisions. Before listening to the next module, as I hope you will do with all of the modules, find yourself a comfortable place where you can be quiet and undisturbed for 20 minutes or so, and we’ll begin. Your angel is waiting to communicate with you, and… angel knows many good things about you. Well, your angel knows everything about you. Your angel is there to help you. Your angel is there to help you in every way. So, just relax, and you’ll soon discover how much easier it is to communicate with your angel than you thought it would be. We’ll begin shortly.

Subject, the meditative level of mind. Ten, nine, feel going deeper. Eight, seven, six, deeper and deeper. Five, four, three, deeper and deeper. Two, one. You are now at a relaxed, a very pleasant level of mind. where you are able to concentrate fully on one subject. At this time, concentrate on my words. You are now and always in complete control of your state of mind. You can open your eyes. You can be fully alert anytime you wish to be. Every time that you enter this relaxed meditation state, Know that you’re getting better and better in every way. Whenever you enter this relaxed meditation state, you will mentally say, every day, in every way, I’m getting better and better. When you say these words, sense yourself improving in all areas of your life. Sense yourself getting better and better. Visualize improvements in your life as you mentally repeat the words. Every day, in every way, I’m getting better and better. Relax. Relax and direct your attention to your eyes. Now relax your eyes. Relax your lips and jaw. Relax your head and your neck.

Every day my image of myself improves. I can do anything I have a desire to do. I am a wonderful human being. There’s no one else on earth. Exactly like me. I am unique. Every day I grow stronger knowing that I can. I can think. I can create. I can do. I can do anything I have a desire to do. Relax. Imagine now that there is an elevator. in front of you. Create an elevator. To help you to visualize this elevator, I will count from one to three. And at the count of three, there will be an elevator in front of you. Know that. Imagine that. Create it. Use your great imagination. One, two, three. An elevator has appeared. The door to the elevator. is closed. There is one button on the door. It is an up button. Press the button. Good. Now the door to the elevator is opening. Step into the elevator and the elevator will take you to the top floor where the spiritual dimension is and where your angel is waiting to introduce herself to you. The angel is already close to you and has been since you were an infant. But she’s chosen this means of greeting you to make it easier for you to reach the spiritual plane where you will be better able to communicate. You’re now in the elevator and now the door. closing. The door is closed. In front of you is a button that simply says, to the top. Press the button and then relax as the elevator takes you up to the top, to the spiritual dimension where your angel is waiting to reveal herself. Relax. And now, imagine the elevator is going up, up, up. Enjoy the ride. Soon you will reach the top, the spiritual dimension. The elevator is going up and approaching a different dimension, the spiritual dimension. Now the elevator is slowing down. In a moment, the elevator will stop. The elevator is stopped. Relax. The door is slowly opening. The door is open. There on the other side of the door, is the spiritual dimension. Imagine that. Know that. Use your great imagination. Spiritual dimension. All things are beautiful here. Colors are brighter. Sounds are clearer. All your senses are sharper. And your imagination is greater and more creative. Relax. Soon the door will be fully open and on the other side will be your angel. Here communication is easy. Here you can speak mentally to your angel. And as you listen or reply, think how the advice you get can be used to make your life better. What would you expect a celestial being, an angel, A pure being to say to you when you ask for advice. Think now about something in your life that you have to make a decision about. Something where there are choices involved. Consider the choices you have. Consider the first choice. How will that affect you in a week? A month? What if you didn’t choose that one? What if you did nothing? If you do nothing, how will that affect you in a week, in a month? Consider the second choice. How will that affect you in a week or a month? What if you didn’t choose that one? What if you did nothing? How will that affect you in a week, a month? Now, ask your angel for advice. What does your angel recommend? Think about that. What would your life be like if you took your angel’s recommendation? How will that affect you in a week, in a month? Is there anything in your life that is causing you distress? If there is, consider alternatives. What could you do to relieve that distress? Now ask your angel if that would be the best thing for you. Consider the consequences of each of the choices that you have made. When you make your decision, always consider consequences. Consider the consequences of each of the choices that you have. When you make your decision, consider the consequences to yourself Consider if your choice will have a consequence for someone else. What would your life be like in a year if you decided on your best choice? Consider that. Relax. Whenever you have a decision to make and you are unsure of the results or the consequences of that decision, whenever you have choices, Take the elevator up to the dimension of the spirit and imagine that your angel is waiting to help you to decide. It is now time to end the meditation for now. In a moment, I will count from one to five. With the count of five, you will open your eyes. You’ll come back to the physical world and full consciousness. You will remember all that you’ve just heard. and you’ll put the knowledge of how to contact your angel to good use for your benefit and for the benefit of all mankind. One, two, three, coming out slowly now, four, and five. Eyes open, wide awake, feeling wonderfully refreshed.

Audio Module 7: Getting Guidance on Demand
--------------------

Module 7. At this point, you’re probably thinking, am I really getting advice and guidance from my angel, or is it just made up things that I did with my mind? And further, how do I know it’s an angel? You may well ask, let’s see, is there a difference in the sound? Or you may ask, is there a difference in the tone? Or the information that you get from an inner voice that tells you it’s an angel? How do you know? Well, let me tell you something. Something that took me more than 50 years to learn. Something that you’re going to learn in about 50 seconds. That angel, or inner voice as some will call it, has always been with you. How do I know? Well… I only recently realized that was the case with respect to some of the things that I’ve been doing and have done in the past. And I imagine the same thing could be said with many of the so -called lucky people of the times. You know, people who suddenly find themselves in a better place, successful, accomplished, talented. For me, I actually became aware of my angel’s presence with piano playing. I suddenly realized that the same thing had taken place with my photography, my writing, my singing, and my painting. Now, a lot of people, most people will probably say it’s just serendipity. Serendipity. Let me define that word, serendipity. Serendipity is a natural gift or talent for discovering things that are useful to you or to others. but discovering them by coincidence, by luck, or what seems like an accident. In other words, some people just seem to pick up things by accident. That’s serendipity. Well, I had thought it was serendipitous in that one day I discovered I could heal people. Yeah, you heard right, heal. I was kind of amazed myself. I was in a small stationery store. And when I paid for the thing that I bought, the clerk asked me if I had any aspirin on me because she had a bad headache, she said. Now, I’m not sure to this day what made me do it because it was unusual. But I said to her, now here, I’m a total stranger. I said to her, bend over. And she gave me a funny look. And, you know, when you command somebody to do something, strangely enough, they usually do it. She gives me a funny look and she bends over. with her head touching the counter. And again, I wasn’t even sure what I was doing, but I waved my hands over her head. And I asked, how’s your head feel now? Well, she picked her head up and kind of moved it around. Then she said, hey, my headache’s gone. What did you do? Now, I didn’t think that I had done anything. As a matter of fact, I thought I was just kind of fooling around. I was more surprised that her headache was gone than she was. But that was the beginning. Serendipity. After that, anytime anyone was in pain, I offered to heal them. Mainly because I was trying to figure out what was going on. And more often than not, they were healed. I investigated at every opportunity. Until many years after that incident, I was training other people in the art of healing. And I had a reputation for being a… renowned healer. I now believe that my angel was instrumental in my telling that young lady to bend over so I could wave my hands over her head. It was unlike me. Inspiration, you might say, but it turned me in a new direction. And it was pretty much the same thing with respect to my painting, my writing, and more recently, really recently, piano playing. The serendipitous occurrence, as an example with regards to the piano, was when one of my associates in marketing, marketing my web sales, that is, my web sites, Vishen Lakhiani, was visiting my home in Rancho Mirage. He was asking about my paintings. Now, I should say that my home resembles an art gallery. I’ve got 62 of my canvases. on my walls. I told him that when I started to paint, when I was 78 years of age, with no training at all. As a matter of fact, when I started to paint, it was like an addiction. I painted 110 canvases in like six months. That’s all I was doing. Now, I’d never had, I’d never studied, I’d never had any training in art, never even read a book about art. I mean, about artists, yes. I was familiar with Van Gogh. He’s one of my favorite painters. But what happened was I just got the feeling and I just bought some brushes and paint one day. And again, as I said, I was 78 at the time. And I began with my angel at my shoulder, of course, I began painting. Now, Vision, he was amazed, as most people who visit me are, because… I said, it’s like an art gallery in my house. Wherever you look, you see one of my paintings. Well, anyway, he noticed kind of a toy keyboard that I played around with sometime. One of those keyboards you get at Costco or Walmart or, you know, one of those places. And he asked if I played, and I said no, I wished I could. And suddenly a thought popped into my mind. My angel choraline at work again. Give me three numbers from one to seven, I asked. And I was just fooling around. I do that pretty often. And Vishen said a two, five, and six. Okay, so I counted the notes on the keyboard. Two was B, that much I know. Five was G, and six was A. Just, you know, one, two, three. So B, G, and A. Well, that was about the extent to my knowledge. But I picked out a tune using those three notes, and we all kind of laughed. That started it. Serendipity again. The next day, the thought came to me that I should get a real piano, not one of those $80 things that have hundreds of voices like trumpet and violin and animal noises and such. And anyway, I went to a piano store and I bought a piano. I mean, a real one. The day it was delivered, I sat down and started banging away. Hmm. Not bad. Then I discovered something that changed my life again and didn’t know it when I bought the piano. In came serendipity again, like a cyclone this time, because the piano had a record button so that when it was pushed, everything that I played was recorded and it played back. So I would play it and then I would push the button and the piano would play back what I just played. Wow. You know something? You can’t really hear yourself when you’re playing. But when it’s played back, you can critique your mistakes and you get to know yourself. Here comes my angel again. Well, Vision’s visit was just about a year ago, maybe a little less. Since then, I’ve composed and recorded over 200 songs. to record them because I can’t write them down. I don’t know how to write music. I don’t know how to read music. 50 of those 200 are in the app store. Matter of fact, you can hear them if you’ve got an iPhone. Just go to the app store and search Burt Goldman and you’ll see 50. They’re free, by the way, 50 apps. Each one’s got a song that I composed. So now we got painting, singing, photography, writing, the internet, apps, piano. all things that I do nothing about, and now I’m considered pretty good at. The number of coincidences were too coincidental to be coincidental. Now it was getting mysterious. Well, I thought I’d put an end to all the mystery and test out this relationship with Coraline. I figure if my angel could help me to compose a piano concerto, when I don’t know a thing about concertos, that would prove… to me at least, that there was really an angel at my shoulder and that I could get help from her when I needed it. And I would even name the piece. Before I started playing, I would call it Coraline’s Concerto. And so I sat down at the piano and without a smidgen of practice and not having a clue as to what I was going to play, I just started whacking away at the keys, making it up as I went along. Now, I’ve added this four and a half minute piece. Coraline’s concerto as an extra audio, so you can hear it for yourself. It’s one of the modules. I just played, asking Coraline to inspire me until I finished. That’s my first concerto. And knowing nothing about concertos, well, that did it. My angel inspired me. You could say that I got help from the other side. When I listen to it, and I’ve listened to it a dozen times, I can hardly believe it’s me playing. Now, I’m sure if you’re a competent pianist, or if you know a competent pianist, I’m sure they’ll no doubt find a lot of flaws in the number. Probably say that’s not a real concerto. I don’t know. It is for me. But as you’ll discover when you listen, it’s a musical number that’s coming from somewhere outside myself. So, could I have done it without the help of my angel? Well, that’s hard to say, because she’s always with me now. I suspect that my angel also helped me when I started to paint a few years ago. Like the music, I’d never in my life attempted to paint a canvas. Never thought that I could. Now that you can see the result of by going to www .burtsart .us. B -U -R -T -S -A -R -T dot U -S. Same with my writing. Some of the writing is also at Burt’sArt .us. It’s at the bottom of the page. Now, I don’t know where any of these things come from, but my angel seems to be directing me along the road of creativity. And when you speak with your angel, and I suggest that you ask your angel what her name is, just imagine that you are really communicating with an entity from the other side, a celestial being. whose sole purpose is to guide you with inspiration and the motivation to take on tasks and to steer you in the right direction for a better, more satisfying life and lifestyle. But don’t expect a vision. Don’t expect a hallucinatory experience. Talking with your angel, it’s more of a feeling, an inspired feeling that she is really there with you. It’s different from the normal minutia of small thoughts that constantly flit through your mind, through everyone’s mind. With your angel, it’s immediate concentration, almost as though you can actually sense her presence. But don’t expect your angel to do all the work. When people do that, they misunderstand the personal motivation or desire that you need to keep communication open. Motivation in this context really means desire. The stronger your desire, the more motivated you’ll be and the more guidance you’ll get. Sometimes people feel frustrated when they think they aren’t getting guidance from their angels. But it really has to do with emotions, with feelings. As example, when you’re angry, it’s not the best time to try to contact your angel. Fearful? Well, that’s another story. Definitely contact your angel when you expect something bad to happen. She will very often help you to overcome the fear. Same goes for depression. If you get depressed, meditate. Or stressful, meditate. And just communicate with your angel. That alone will help you. But when you’re angry, you don’t want to bring that emotion to your angel. So if you feel anger, meditate before communicating. You know, you can’t be angry when meditating. Of course, you’re relaxed when you’re meditating. I like to tell stories when applicable as the images of the tale of the story, although generally metaphorical, they really get the point across. Here’s a story I’ve told many times over the years. I first heard it at an ashram that I attended in the early 50s. It concerns a disciple who went to his guru and asked, Master, How do I achieve enlightenment? Well, simply desire it, the wise man said. Just desire it, and it shall be yours. But master, said the disciple, I do desire it. Well, the wise old guru said, come with me. And he directed the disciple to the banks of the Ganges River. He then had him kneel with his face over the water. Then the guru put his hand on the young man’s head and pushed his face below the surface of the water. Well, after a minute or so, the young disciple was frantic. He pulled and heaved and flailed his arms, but the grip was like iron. He couldn’t get his head out of the water. A minute and a half went by, and then when it seemed as though the disciple’s lungs would burst, the guru released his grip. The young man’s head jerked out of the water. And he took great gulps of air into his lungs. Guru smiled. Tell me, he asked gently, what was your greatest desire when your face was in the water? To breathe, the young disciple stated emphatically. Ah, said the Guru, when you desire enlightenment to that degree, it shall be yours. Now. There are degrees of desire. I’ve said that motivation is simply strong desire. When you’re indecisive, it’s because you have no motivation to choose or to act. Allow me to give you a few more examples. There are things you need that you’re always motivated to act to get when they’re taken away from you. The disciples’ need for breath was one example. Another would be water. Go without water for a day or so, and you won’t need a process to motivate you. You see a faucet behind a window of a locked store, you’ll break a window to get at the water. Go without food for two days, you’ll be so motivated, you’ll dig in trash for someone’s day -old sandwich. You can’t sleep on a hard bed, go without sleep for two days, and your desire for sleep will be so strong, you’ll sleep on a plank of concrete. At the other end of the scale is weak desire. Oh, you may be watching TV and you’re comfortable on your couch. The program ends. Another comes on. But it’s one you don’t want to watch. You don’t like it. But you don’t have a remote. And you’re so comfortable that you don’t get up to change the channel, but watch something you don’t like because your desire is so weak. That it won’t motivate you to get up from your chair and walk across the room to change the channel. That’s a weak desire. Once again, motivation is simply strong desire. To have a better understanding of desire, sense it. Imagine it on an ascending scale like a giant thermometer. At the bottom of the scale is zero. And at the top, 100. When your desire is weak near the bottom of the scale, You’ve got a five or a six. It’s unlikely that anything will motivate you to activate your will and accomplish the object of that desire. When your desire is near the top of the scale, 80, 90, or 100, nothing can keep you from success in attaining that desire and getting the thing you want. Working with angels is similar to working with the law of attraction or vibrations. When you have that desire, Then your angel can help you motivate, motivate you to take action and guide you to end indecision. Now to enhance desire, use the bhaga. Touch the roof of your mouth with the tip of your tongue and visualize the positive end result of what you desire to happen. Use your angel, visualize her, bring her into your mind. She’s there anyway, like a radio wave. She’s in your vicinity all the time. just as everyone’s angels are. But they only come when they’re called for, when bidden. Create your own imagery, your loving imagery, because your angel is loving. She’s good, and she wants to communicate with you. But she won’t do it on her own. You do have an angel. We’re all in agreement as to that. Now, what does the story about the disciple and the guru have to do with an angel? Your desire to bring your angel to you, to inspire you, should have a high degree of desire. If you really don’t care one way or the other, you don’t desire it, it won’t happen. There is a difference between the thoughts of your ego and the intuitive thoughts of your angelic guidance. But the angel must be called on. That’s the basic difference between those who receive that help from the other side and those who just plot along haphazardly. My desire for my angel’s help is strong, so much so that it’s a pure fact. Right now, as I write these words for the audio portion of this program, when you’re hearing it, of course, you’re hearing the audio. But when I was writing it, I was thinking about my angel alongside me, nodding and smiling, helping me with every word. Well, when I wrote those words that my angel was helping me with every word, I just stopped for a moment. And I closed my eyes, I leaned back my head for a moment, and I mentally said, isn’t that so? Directing it, of course, to Coraline. And I imagined her nodding and smiling back at me. It will help if you have something in mind for your angel to help you with. And in the beginning, here’s a technique you can use. Just repeat three times. Angel, come. Angel, come. Angel, come. And then clear your mind and allow your angel in. When you sense your angel is there, ask her for inspiration, for help, for the things that you need. And we’ll have a few other techniques for you in subsequent modules for you to call your angel. But just angel come, angel come, angel come. Now, you’ve been getting messages from your angel all your life. You just were not aware of it. Now that you are, consider this. All those really good things you were involved with all your life, well, there was an angel involved. You’ve been getting messages from your angel all along, but you weren’t aware, so you just blocked it. Open the door. Let your angel in. And soon you’ll be getting as much help as you need. In the next module, you’re going to discover how to open yourself to attract your angel even more and how to tap into the quantum world and jump to your more spiritual self and to meet and greet your angel unconcealed. We’re going to visit the spiritual dimension in the next module.

Audio Module 8: The Quantum Angel Introduction
--------------------

Module 8. There’s a theory in the field of quantum physics that there are an infinity of universes. This is called the multiverse, and that whatever can be imagined is real in one of those universes. The innumerable, uncountable number of universes contained in the multiverse are known as parallel universes. Infinity being the case, then in one of those parallels, you are so spiritually connected and aware that your angel is actually physically visible to you and helps guide you along the path of life in that universe. But that’s there. You can only get there mentally. That’s the catch. How about here and now, physically? How would you like to do a bit of evolving here, in your present universe? Well, let’s just see what we can do about that. There are, as you know, three levels of consciousness. The physical, the mental, and the spiritual. We know very little about the spiritual, only that it’s peaceful and close to that which we all strive. Angels are, of course, spiritual beings. In the spiritual dimension, there’s no disease, nor is there suffering as we know it. No despots, no evil dictators, no oil -based economies. In growing more spiritual, one grows nearer to the divine power, or what some people refer to as God. And spirituality becomes a measure. of how useful you are to your fellow human being. Spirituality is relative to the elimination of selfishness from one’s emotional frame. On the plane of the spirit, there is no resentment. There’s no jealousy, no hate, no selfishness, no wanting of things others have. When you raise your spiritual nature, you find truth in meanings. You find goodness in the things that you value and the natural beauty in what was previously overlooked. In other words, become more loving and open in each moment. In achieving spiritual growth, you’ll find yourself imbued with a desire to take your personality to a new direction. and the development of a new standard for the things you value. Your fresh spiritual state will drive you to new motivations so that you may well find yourself standing above shattering events that formerly would have disturbed your well -being. Spiritual growth depends on association with spiritual forces. And so we bring in the concept. of your personal angel to help steer you in the right direction. I say all that because in going to the spiritual plane, all those things tend to develop in a person. In going to the plane of the spirit and meeting and greeting your angel, you will feel all that I’ve said. So only if you’re ready to begin the journey to a new, evolved you should you take this quantum jump trip. to the spiritual plane, assume that there is an infinity of universes, just as do a great many distinguished quantum physicists who believe in the concept of a multiverse with an infinite, unending number of universes. That being so, then anything that you can imagine is in one of those universes. Let’s take the pairing of angels with quantum jumping to a further degree. Let’s say that in one of those infinity of universes, you are more spiritual, and you live a life that’s guided by angels. I’m going to pursue this idea for a while, but first allow me to clarify the concept of spirituality as we are using it. To be spiritual doesn’t mean you have to live like a 15th century monk, sparse and meager with possessions and relationships. An example would be one of my long -standing friends, Father Justin Bellitz, who’s been a Franciscan monk for over 30 years. He loves to do masses on cruises, and he takes at least one a year. In addition, he invariably is the hit at every wedding he officiates or is a guest at, as he’s usually the most sought -after dancer there. He has fun. He has fun out of life, and yet he’s a highly spiritual person. To be spiritual is just to be better balanced and to take life as it comes, making the best out of whatever the fates throw at you. Let me tell you of a shattering event that happened to me some time ago. It was a time that I was in business many, many years ago. I had a shop in which I stored a great deal of merchandise for other people. This was long before I was aware of angels, much less my own personal angel. But due in the main to my earlier yoga period, I was, even then, of a highly spiritual nature. Well, as I approached my shop, I saw great plumes of smoke pouring into the sky. And getting closer, I saw fire engines, police vehicles on my street. I stopped at the corner and saw, to my horror, that firemen were running in and out of my shop. They had hoses and axes in their hands, and there was a general melee. A thousand thoughts shot through my mind. The merchandise wasn’t insured. I was ruined. What to do, what to do. I closed my eyes, relaxed, and I repeated the mantra, OM, again and again. Finally, calm, I continued to drive, but in a different direction. I was just aimlessly driving around and around the block, avoiding talking to the firemen. The thought came that I would have to speak to all those people who had merchandise in my warehouse. I would have to speak. with an attorney about what to do. I’d have to speak with my accountants. And then I thought, boy, I’m going to be a mess. I’d better take a few weeks off so that I could deal with this with a calm mind. Where can I go for two weeks? I thought about that. I’ve always wanted to go to Jamaica. That’s what I’ll do, I thought. I’ll go to Jamaica, lie around the beach for a while, and I’ll deal with this when I get back. Well, with that thought in mind, I drove back to the shop and spoke with the fireman. As it turned out, there was no damage to anything in the warehouse. The fire people were fantastic. The smoke I saw pouring into the sky came from the holes they chopped in the skylight to let the smoke out. And then they sandbagged. merchandise prior to pouring water on one area that was burning, I would have worried for nothing. Point being that some people seeing what I saw when I drove up to the place would have had a heart attack, whereas I, with my spiritual training, was ready to lie down on a beach in Jamaica and relax. Now, what that means, once again, is that in gaining a spiritual nature, you don’t lose the joy and the fun of life. Just the opposite. They increase and you find pleasure in things. There is a way for you to utilize the power of your angelic attendant to discover your instinctive loving nature. It’s generally accepted that attitude is what makes the person who they believe themselves to be. Loving people generally have a loving attitude. Evil people have a poor attitude. Walking along a busy street, a loving person sees happy people, whereas a pickpocket only sees pockets. In this physical life, things we’re involved with are brought to us by our five senses. That’s how we recognize the existence of things. We see, hear, taste, smell, and feel them. Therefore, they are. Your mind, however, differentiates between what you feel is real and what isn’t. Therefore, reality to one person could very well be another person’s fantasy. With the spiritual experience, the true values of life are revealed. That’s why most, if not all, of the great spiritual masters recommend meditation as the doorway to the spirit. The injunction, man cannot live by bread alone, tells us that there’s more to life than what is brought to us by our senses. To transcend the selfishness of personal interest, it’s incumbent upon us to attempt to transfer our consciousness to the kingdom of the Spirit, even if but for a short while. The manner in which to do this is through the state of meditation. The meditation exercises incorporated in this program are designed to help you to achieve that relaxation state that is the first step to the spiritual kingdom. Now, here’s a technique for you that will allow you that first step towards the spiritual nature and a better, brighter here and now. Imagine that you have a pair of spiritual glasses, like sunglasses. All you have to do to use the glasses is to say, spiritual view. and imagine the glasses coming down over your eyes like a pair of sunglasses. When the imaginary glasses are on, you can see only the good, only the positive, only the beauty in everything, just as your angel would. Try it for an hour or two and watch what happens. The first time I used my spiritual glasses, I was driving along the highway in the late afternoon. I remember thinking, there’s really nothing that’s particularly nice or positive or beautiful around here, but I’ll give it a shot. Touching my tongue to the roof of my mouth, using the baga, I said, spiritual view, and imagined the glasses on. Suddenly I noticed a hawk flying overhead, and I thought, he looks like he’s swimming through the air. The grass suddenly was beautiful. so pleasantly green. And there were beautiful, fluffy clouds as far as the eye could see. A plane flew by, and I imagined the people in the plane, all excited as they were going visiting. And on and on it went. Everywhere I looked, things were beautiful. Colors were brighter. Even the hum of my car was pleasing to me. To test my glasses further, I said, spiritual glasses off. And suddenly, the world was once again bland. and ordinary. I use my spiritual glasses all the time now, and I have for years. I know that you will as well, once you get used to using them. When you get ready to jump into the spiritual plane, do take advantage of your spiritual glasses. They will help you immeasurably when you visit the spiritual plane, or the spiritual dimension, as some would call it. When you do connect, with the plane of the spirit, and meet your angel, you will have a better understanding as well as an experience of all that I’ve been talking about. So, if you’re ready to begin the journey to a new, evolved you, or you want help communicating with your angel, that help will come when you connect with the spiritual plane and quantum jump to your more spiritually connected self for help.

Audio Module 9: The Quantum Angel Meditation
--------------------

Module 9, the spiritual dimension. At this time, relax. We’ll start with the 3 to 1 count. This module is not to be played in a moving vehicle. This is a meditation exercise. Find a comfortable position. Close your eyes. Take a deep breath. And as you exhale, Mentally repeat and visualize the number three, three times. Three, three, like that. Take another deep breath. And as you exhale, mentally repeat and visualize the number two, three times. Take another deep breath. And as you exhale, mentally repeat. and visualize the number one three times. To help you to enter a more relaxed, meditative level of mind, I’m going to count from ten to one. On every descending number, feel yourself going inward, and you will enter a pleasant, a relaxed level of mind where you will be able to concentrate Completely on one subject. The meditative level of mind. Ten. Nine. Feel going deeper. Eight. Seven. Six. Deeper and deeper. Five. Four. Three. Deeper and deeper. Two. One. You are now at a relaxed. A very pleasant level of mind where you are able to concentrate fully on one subject. At this time, concentrate on my words. You are now and always in complete control of your state of mind. You can open your eyes. You can be fully alert anytime you wish to be. Every time that you enter this… relaxed meditation state, know that you’re getting better and better in every way. Whenever you enter this relaxed meditation state, you will mentally say, every day, in every way, I’m getting better and better. When you say these words, sense yourself improving in all areas of your life. Sense yourself getting better and better. Visualize improvements in your life as you mentally repeat the words. Every day, in every way, I’m getting better and better. Relax. Relax and direct your attention to your eyes. Now relax your eyes. Relax your lips and jaw. Relax your head and your neck. Relax your body. Relax your shoulders, your arms and hands. Relax your hips, your legs, your feet. Relax your stomach. You are now completely relaxed. Repeat mentally. My body rests and refreshes itself. When I consciously relax. My body rests and refreshes itself. When I consciously relax. I’m relaxed now. Repeat mentally after me. Every day my image of myself improves. I can do anything I have a desire to do. I am a wonderful human being. There’s no one else on earth exactly like me. I am unique. Every day I grow stronger knowing that I can. I can think. I can create. I can do. I can do anything I have a desire to do. Relax. Imagine now that there is an elevator in front of you. Create an elevator. To help you to visualize this elevator, I will count from one to three. And at the count of three, there will be an elevator in front of you. Know that. Imagine that. Create it. Use your great imagination. One, two, three. An elevator has appeared. The door to the elevator is closed. There is one button on the door. It is an up button. Press the button. Good. Now the door to the elevator is opening. Step into the elevator and the elevator will take you to the top floor where the spiritual dimension is. and where your angel is waiting to introduce herself to you. The angel is already close to you and has been since you were an infant, but she’s chosen this means of greeting you to make it easier for you to reach the spiritual plane where you will be better able to communicate. You’re now in the elevator, and now the door is open. The door is closed. In front of you is a button that simply says, to the top. Press the button and then relax as the elevator takes you up to the top, to the spiritual dimension where your angel is waiting to reveal herself. Relax. And now, imagine the elevator is going up, up, up. Enjoy the ride. Soon you will reach the top, the spiritual dimension. The elevator is going up and approaching a different dimension, the spiritual dimension. The elevator is slowing down. In a moment, the elevator will stop. The elevator has stopped. Relax. The door is slowly opening. The door is open. There on the other side of the door, is the spiritual dimension. Imagine that. Know that. Use your great imagination. Spiritual dimension. All things are beautiful here. Colors are brighter. Sounds are clearer. All your senses are sharper. And your imagination is greater and more creative. Relax. Soon the door will be fully open and on the other side will be your angel. Here communication is easy. Here you can speak mentally to your angel and as you listen, think how the feeling that you get can make your life better. This is a spiritual dimension, a universe of peace where everyone is equal. No races, social levels, economic groups or classes to contend with. All are equal here at the dimension of the spirit. And now the door is fully open. Step out and you are now in the spiritual dimension. Imagine that. Know that you’re there. The kingdom of heaven is in the spiritual dimension. and is neither material or cerebral, but rather a link between God and mankind. Here in the spiritual dimension, you surrender all negative emotions. In the spiritual dimension, there are no jealousies, no resentments, no fear, no hatred, no anger. Here there is no need to have what others have. Just a calm peace and a willingness to accept what is. Have no concerns about what isn’t. And to stimulate with love what can be. Your angel is here to greet you and to help you to be a better person. A person who sees the beauty not only in a rainbow or a sunset, but also in a dark cloud and rainfall. Here on the spiritual plane, you transcend the selfishness of personal interests, and you understand that successful ventures are meaningful and helpful to others as well. On this plane, your personal angel will help to steer you in the direction most advantageous to your spiritual growth. Spiritual growth depends on association. with spiritual forces. And so we bring in the concept of your personal angel to help to steer you in the right direction. Your angel, like all angels, reside in the spiritual dimension and there radiate peace and love. Here you too can absorb all that is radiated by your angel. From the vantage point of the spiritual dimension, imagine now that your angel is alongside you, permeating the vicinity with her loving emanations. Imagine that you are surrounded by the bright white fog -like light that emanates from your angel. Now, just sit quietly. and enjoy the presence and the companionship of your angel who loves and looks over you. Relax. Imagine that you’re surrounded by the bright white fog -like light that is emanating from your angel. Just relax and take your time. Relax. Imagine that your angel will always be there at your side. All you need to do to activate her interest and to communicate is to touch your thumb to the little finger of either hand and say, Angel, come. And your angel will be there to help you, to guide you, and to inspire you. At this time, let us program this trigger. Touch your thumb to the little finger of either hand. Do it now. Touch of the thumb to the little finger. And that will be your trigger to call your angel. Whenever you require inspiration, whenever you feel the need of peace, whenever you feel stressful, and want to relax, just touch your thumb to the little finger of either hand and say the words, Angel, come. And imagine that your angel is there to help you, to inspire you. And just bathe in the light. of your angel. Relax. In a moment, I’m going to count from one to three. At that time, your eyes will open. You’ll be wide awake, feeling wonderfully refreshed, feeling at peace, feeling better than before, feeling uplifted after your short visit to the spiritual dimension. One, two, three. Eyes open, wide awake.

Audio Module 10: The Angel of Healing Introduction
--------------------

Bonus module, the angel of healing. And now for what many believe to be, if not the top concept, certainly right there among the top three. And that is your angel of health and well -being. And healing, of course. Now, let’s get into the spiritual you. I won’t say your spiritual angel, because all angels are spiritual. After all, they are celestial beings created whole. as fully developed entities that cannot reproduce themselves. So let’s examine your angel of healing and well -being. Would that be the angel that we’ve been speaking of all during this program? Not necessarily. The angel of healing is the one angel that virtually all who use the concept report, they are fully aware of. But the angel of healing doesn’t appear in a human form. nor what many people think of as an angelic form, as shown by most of the Renaissance artists depicted as angels with wings and white robes floating about and such. Your angel of healing is surrounded by an intense white light, much too bright to pierce. So when you see the angel of healing, all you can see, even mentally, is this bright white light. So very bright that it can’t be looked at directly. It’s more of a feeling of immersion in the light. Now, when you require a healing, you want to call on the angel of healing. Here’s how. Make yourself comfortable where you’ll be undisturbed for 15 minutes or so. Now, some people like to use candles. It’s not necessary, but for those of you who do, here’s the technique. You require two candles. When I do this, I prefer a blue candle and a red candle. But if you can’t find colored candles, then use two white ones. They’ll do as well. Two, because one represents the negative force, the other the positive. Negative is not meant as a bad emanation, nor is positive meant as a good. They’re just necessary to produce a circle of healing. When you light the candle, say, I now call on the angel of healing. Simply that. You can also say it mentally. And as a matter of fact, some people have reported using the candles mentally, a mental candle, and it’s worked for them as well. But if you use the mental broadcast, be sure to enunciate each word very clearly. I now call on the angel of healing. Do that as you light the candles. You place the candles at your side, one on the left side of you, the other on the right side. and put them safely in a holder or on a plate. And now you’re ready to begin. Go into your meditation state and relax. When you’re completely relaxed, you mentally say, Angel of Healing, come to me. Say that three times. Angel of Healing, come to me. Angel of Healing, come to me. Angel of Healing, come to me. And then imagine that you’re immersed in the bright light of the angel. Get a sense that the angel has approached you, and although you cannot see the angel due to the brightness of her light, imagine the light, a kind of a fog of bright white light, and immerse yourself in that light. Sit quietly, concentrate on the light surrounding you. Do not concentrate on the problem or the healing. That’s already in motion. Just sit quietly and imagine that you’re encircled by the light. Some people have reported getting a sense that the angel has a cape of even brighter light and that the angel swings the cape over them as they sit and meditate. As a matter of fact, we’re going to do that in the meditation exercise module that you have. Now, you sit in the light for 10 minutes or so and then slowly open your eyes. Take the two candles, either physically or mentally, and after blowing out the flame, put them under your bed at approximately under where your heart would be, and expect the healing at that time. Now, for the best good use of your angel, allow her to accompany you to the plane of the spirit. The spiritual plane is a plane of celestial peace and music, but unfortunately celestial music is beyond human conception. Spiritual melodies are not material sound waves as we know them, but pulsations of a vast range beyond, beyond our ability to imagine, much less hear. And with a grandeur of execution that brings about a sublime ecstasy for those that can hear those marvelous melodies. The finest composers and musicians on earth can produce just a fleeting echo of the magnificence of the celestial producers of melodic lines and melodies that can only be dreamed of. Some of our, let us say, genius composers do get a glimmering of this music. That’s where they get their inspiration from. Now, I say celestial peace, but I don’t mean indolence or lethargy. Angels are anything but lethargic in that they never get weary, and the music of the spheres elevates them constantly. You can get a glimmering of what I’m speaking about if you just allow yourself to immerse yourself in the light of the angel of healing for 15 minutes or so. Then you’ll perhaps understand a grain, a glimmering of it. The best earthly sound would be the vibrations of the word OM. This too, along with the help of your angel and the angel of healing, can kind of whisk you to the spiritual plane and a type of peace you may only be involved with at that level. When you meditate and you feel that you’d like to be involved in that radiance, just imagine being immersed in the light and listen for the sound of OM. Let’s do it now. Let’s give it a shot. Do it now for a moment to show you how serene and calm you can be when you approach the spiritual world. Close your eyes and imagine now that you’re in a bright white light. Now, this isn’t a meditation. This is just a very short auming here. Now, think the word aum and draw it out like this. Aum. And again. Aum. And once more. And notice how relaxed you get as you aum. Om with me. Take a deep breath and one more time. Imagine the white light. Now that’s just a taste. During the next module, we will get more into the angel. of healing when you step out of the elevator we’ll have a different type of a sound not a celestial sound a physical sound but just allow yourself to be immersed in the light and visited by your angel of healing so make yourself comfortable put on the next module and we will begin

Audio Module 11: The Angel of Healing Meditation
--------------------

Bonus module, your angel of healing. At this time, relax. We’ll start with the three to one count. This module is not to be played in a moving vehicle. This is a meditation exercise. Find a comfortable position. Close your eyes. Take a deep breath. And as you exhale, mentally repeat. And visualize the number three. Three times. Three. Like that. Take another deep breath. And as you exhale, mentally repeat and visualize the number two. Three times. Take another deep breath. And as you exhale, mentally repeat and visualize the number one. Three times. To help you to enter a more relaxed, meditative level of mind, I’m going to count from ten to one. On every descending number, feel yourself going inward and you will enter a pleasant, a relaxed level of mind where you will be able to concentrate completely on one subject. The meditative level of mind. Ten, nine, feel going deeper. Eight, seven, six, deeper and deeper. Five, four, three, deeper and deeper. Two, one. You are now at a relaxed, a very pleasant level of mind. where you are able to concentrate fully on one subject. At this time, concentrate on my words. You are now and always in complete control of your state of mind. You can open your eyes. You can be fully alert anytime you wish to be. Every time that you enter this relaxed meditation state, Know that you’re getting better and better in every way. Whenever you enter this relaxed meditation state, you will mentally say, every day, in every way, I’m getting better and better. When you say these words, sense yourself improving in all areas of your life. Sense yourself getting better and better. Visualize improvements in your life as you mentally repeat the words. Every day, in every way, I’m getting better and better. Relax. Relax and direct your attention to your eyes. Now relax your eyes. Relax your lips and jaw. Relax your head and your neck. Relax. your body. Relax your shoulders, your arms and hands. Relax your hips, your legs, your feet. Relax your stomach. You are now completely relaxed. Repeat mentally. My body rests and refreshes itself when I consciously relax. My body rests and refreshes itself when I consciously relax. I’m relaxed now. Repeat mentally after me. Every day my image of myself improves. I can do anything I have a desire to do. I am a wonderful human being. There’s no one else on earth. Exactly like me. I am unique. Every day I grow stronger knowing that I can. I can think. I can create. I can do. I can do anything I have a desire to do. Relax. Imagine now that there is an elevator. in front of you. Create an elevator. To help you to visualize this elevator, I will count from one to three. And at the count of three, there will be an elevator in front of you. Know that. Imagine that. Create it. Use your great imagination. One, two, three. An elevator has appeared. The door to the elevator. is closed. There is one button on the door. It is an up button. Press the button. Good. Now the door to the elevator is opening.

Audio Module 12: Love & Relationships Introduction
--------------------

Bonus module, Love and Relationships. To truly understand love and relationships, you have to really understand viewpoint and need. For an angel to be non -judgmental and simply be there takes an attitude that only a celestial being can possibly have. One can only hope to emulate an angelic attitude, but few succeed. Those who come closest are those who love one another and love unconditionally in the true sense of the word. No conditions, zero. And then need and viewpoint come into the highest degree. This is best understood through metaphor, a story. Let’s hear one. An often told one by me. Two young people fall in love and marry. He sees her only through a positive viewpoint that hits the 100 degree mark on an arbitrary scale of degrees. That means he can’t see any negatives, no matter what happens, no matter what she does, no matter what she looks like. No negatives. And she feels the same. True love. and a perfect relationship. Because in addition to their viewpoint being at the 100 degree mark of the scale, both of them have their emotional needs filled to the brim. Well, let’s get back to them now. They’ve just been married the first night. They’re alone together. They can only see the positives, unconditional love, only the positives in one another. The young wife, the young woman, is brushing her teeth. She has on a raggedy bathrobe. The door’s ajar. She’s drooling as she brushes. The young groom looks at her and smiles. She, he thinks, she even looks good when she’s drooling. And that bathrobe, it’s a rag, but she wears it like a queen. And she has the cutest walk. She kind of hops every other step. The perfect love. He can only see positives. Unconditional love. But then, as happens, time goes by. And we hear him say, Honey, would you close the bathroom door when you brush your teeth? I know you don’t realize it, but you know you drool. And I wish you’d buy a new bathrobe. The one you have is embarrassing. Now what’s changed? She hasn’t changed. His attitude has changed because love, or rather his viewpoint, has a few negatives creeping into it. And a little more time goes by, and sweetheart, we hear him say, I’ve enrolled you in a charm school. You got the craziest walk, you know, you hop. Now what’s happened again? She hasn’t changed. His viewpoint. has changed and more negatives creep in. Now, this is pretty standard. Few people have a relationship that is unconditional, but those things that bother you about the person must either be accepted or overlooked, or there will be problems. Now, with respect to your relationships, think about them and ask yourself where you stand on that arbitrary scale. If you see more negatives in the person, then positives, then perhaps you should rethink your relationship. Either that or change your attitude. Think about a few things you like about the person, and then think about a few things you dislike. And then ask your angel what you should do. In the next module of this bonus, the meditation, will help you to get an answer from your personal angel. So, before you play the next module, Find yourself a comfortable place and get ready to speak with your personal angel.

Audio Module 14: Wealth & Finances Introduction
--------------------

Angel bonus, wealth and finances. I only know one billionaire. He read one of my books and invited me to his home for a private session. I taught him many things about attitude, progressions of life, spirituality, and during our many conversations, I asked him how he achieved his great wealth, for he was successful in so many fields. Banking and oil. Land, real estate development, cattle, finance, and on and on. His answer wasn’t one that I expected. He said, making money for me is like taking candy from a baby. Whatever he did, in whatever country, for his interests are international, he was successful. His attitude was that of a winner, and win he did, always. But taking candy from a baby, what does that mean? Certainly it means he was successful and it was easy for him. But then once during one of our conversations, it kind of came out. He said, you know, I do have an advisor, Bert. She sits on my shoulder and whispers in my ear. I call on her whenever something of important comes up, like stocks or property or some commodity. You mean an angel? I asked. He just shrugged and looked embarrassed. But he answered, something like that. An angel whispering in his ear. Now, that was interesting. And whatever it was, it worked fabulously well for him. Now, he does appear to be blessed, as do most of the extremely lucky people of the world. Sometimes it hardly seems fair. to see one person with everything imaginable while at the same time thousands live in the street or under a bridge without means, without the simplest of needs. I asked my friend, how his angel worked with him? He said, well, take the stock market as an example. I just asked my angel for advice, and then I would suddenly be inspired to buy something or sell something. And more often than not, my inspiration appeared to be correct. Well, that was interesting, I thought. So I decided to do the same. Not then, but right now as I write the script for this particular program. I went into my meditative state and I asked my angel. I asked Coraline about the market. And she said, sell everything and buy Apple. Well… And now I just wanted to test the waters. And I’m not really involved that much in the market. But I thought I’d follow the thought. Well, I saw that Apple AAPL, which is the symbol for Apple computers, was $355 a share, as I said, as I write this. Now, it’s going to be interesting to see where it goes. The billionaire would have bought probably 10 ,000 shares that he’d been around. That would have been an investment of more than $3 million, but for him, that was nothing. Now, you can look up the stock when you hear this to see how he would have fared and see how I would fare at $355 a share. Now, I’m not advising anybody to buy, understand. I’m just telling you what I did. So then, what kind of financial advice would you be getting from your angel? During the next module, you’ll be talking to your angel. Make it a game. This is just an example of how my angel sometimes communicates with me. In no way am I suggesting that you buy Apple stock or any other stock. That’s entirely your own decision. However, if you do decide you want to invest in the stock market, well, do it. My recommendation would be to use someone like Fidelity, who charges a very nominal fee for each transaction. And online, you can see your stock’s activity in real time. It looks pretty good. But use your angel. Start small. And as you gain the experience, increase your investment. And maybe one day you too will find that making money and developing wealth is as easy as taking candy from a baby.

These decisions often have far-reaching consequences, and that’s the key to the answer, consequences. Before making a decision, that may well affect the family unit for years, perhaps even generations, ask yourself this vital question. What will my life be like if this decision is made? What will my spouse’s life be like, my child’s life? Should we move? Should we stay? Should we look for a better school, a better job, a different job? Should I invite a friend or relative over? Should we stay away? All those decisions can be answered most effectively if you get together with everyone who will be affected by your decision and ask all of them the same question.

Audio Module 18: Personal Success Introduction
--------------------

Bonus, personal success. Mary Sims was ambitious, but ambition without the means to express it, that’s a lonely thing. Mary was a single woman, 32 years of age, and she worked as a maid in a small motel in a small town in southern Oregon. She’d left home as soon as she graduated from high school and hadn’t been back since. Mary had heard about a seminar I did at the time called Supermind Express Train to Success. And she later told me that her life had changed after she listened to one of the stories that I told during the class. It attracted her attention because it was about another maid. The maid’s name was, last name that is, was Patel. The story was about the Patels, a husband and a wife. his wife, who worked in a motel as a maid and a houseman. Ultimately, the Patels went from maid and houseman to manager and then owner of the motel. And eventually, the Patel family became the owners of more motels than any other group on earth. More than 40 % of the motels in the United States were Patel properties. Well, one day, Mr. Patel was being interviewed by a TV anchor person. And one of the questions asked was, did you feel demeaned when you were a houseman making beds and your wife was a maid? The answer that Patel gave changed Mary Sims’ life forever. He said, but we weren’t making beds. We were buying a motel. That answer, summing up an attitude, was like a bright bulb lighting up Mary’s mind. She’d always felt rather humbled by the fact, that every day she went to work to make up someone else’s bed, vacuuming someone else’s floor, cleaning up someone else’s mess. Right then and there, she decided to change her attitude. Never again would she make up a bed. Instead, she would be buying a motel, just like the Patels in the story. Yeah, she still made up beds, but in her mind, she wasn’t making up a bed. She was buying a motel. And that simple change in thinking made all the difference. From that moment on, Mary had a goal. And you know something? It doesn’t matter whether she made her goal and bought her motel or not. Because suddenly work became a career. And she started each day with a different attitude and a firm goal. One fellow in the class jumped up and said, I’m not a waiter, I’m buying a restaurant. And everyone laughed. but they also got the concept. Attitude is everything when it comes to career and success. In the next module, you’ll be visiting your angel who will help you to adjust your attitude and make you a good candidate for personal success.

The meditative level of mind. Ten. Nine. Feel going deeper. Eight. Seven. Six. Deeper and deeper. Five. Four. Three. Deeper and deeper. Two. One. You are now at a relaxed. A very pleasant level of mind where you are able to concentrate fully on one subject. At this time, concentrate on my words. You are now and always in complete control of your state of mind. You can open your eyes. You can be fully alert anytime you wish to be. Every time that you enter this… relaxed meditation state, know that you’re getting better and better in every way. Whenever you enter this relaxed meditation state, you will mentally say, every day, in every way, I’m getting better and better. When you say these words, sense yourself improving in all areas of your life. Sense yourself getting better and better. Visualize improvements in your life as you mentally repeat the words. Every day, in every way, I’m getting better and better. Relax. Relax and direct your attention to your eyes. Now relax your eyes. Relax your lips and jaw. Relax your head and your neck. Relax your body. Relax your shoulders, your arms and hands. Relax your hips, your legs, your feet. Relax your stomach. You are now completely relaxed. Repeat mentally. My body rests and refreshes itself. When I consciously relax. My body rests and refreshes itself. When I consciously relax. I’m relaxed now. Repeat mentally after me. Every day my image of myself improves. I can do anything I have a desire to do. I am a wonderful human being. There’s no one else on earth exactly like me. I am unique. Every day I grow stronger knowing that I can. I can think. I can create. I can do. I can do anything I have a desire to do. Relax. Imagine now that there is an elevator in front of you. Create an elevator. To help you to visualize this elevator, I will count from one to three. And at the count of three, there will be an elevator in front of you. Know that. Imagine that. Create it. Use your great imagination. One, two, three. An elevator has appeared. The door to the elevator is closed. There is one button on the door. It is an up button. Press the button. Good. Now the door to the elevator is opening. Step into the elevator and the elevator will take you to the top floor where the spiritual dimension is. and where your angel is waiting to introduce herself to you. The angel is already close to you and has been since you were an infant, but she’s chosen this means of greeting you to make it easier for you to reach the spiritual plane where you will be better able to communicate. You’re now in the elevator, and now the door is open. The door is closed. In front of you is a button that simply says, to the top. Press the button and then relax as the elevator takes you up to the top, to the spiritual dimension where your angel is waiting to reveal herself. Relax. And now, imagine the elevator is going up, up, up. Enjoy the ride. Soon you will reach the top, the spiritual dimension. The elevator is going up and approaching a different dimension, the spiritual dimension. The elevator is slowing down. In a moment, the elevator will stop. The elevator has stopped. Relax. The door is slowly opening. The door is open. And here on the spiritual dimension, Your angel is awaiting you. Greet your angel. You need advice from your angel regarding attitude, regarding success, regarding career. The angel is telling you a story about a person who hates to wash dishes. The angel gave advice to that person. telling her not to wash dishes if she hates to do them. And then she asked, What is it that you love about your kitchen? And the woman said, I love a sparkling, clean kitchen. And the angel responded by saying, Never do dishes again. The next time you plunge your hands into the water and scrub your dishes clean, sparkle up the kitchen. Change your attitude. Life is an attitude. Successful people have an attitude of success. Don’t wash dishes. Sparkle up the kitchen. Don’t do the things you hate. Do the things you love. If you hate to study, don’t study. Learn. Some people would say that it’s the same thing. But how can it be the same if you hate one? and love the other. Learn to love by seeing the end result of it, of what it is that you are attempting, what it is that you’re doing. Change your attitude. Always look to the side wherein the ultimate goal resides. Love what you do. As your loving nature grows, so… your success grow? Relax. Relax. And now speak to your angel. Speak to your angel about attitudes that you have. Ask your angel for guidance and see what she says. Do it now. Take your time. I will allow you plenty of time. Relax and begin. Relax. Always consult your angel. whenever you’re doing something you dislike, to see about changing your attitude. And every night, while lying in bed, think about the things that you did during the day wherein your angel could have been of help to you in restoring the proper attitude. Relax. In a moment, I’m going to count from one to three. At the count to three, your eyes will open. You’ll be wide awake. feeling wonderfully refreshed, considering the consequences of your attitude. Relax. One, two, three. Eyes open, wide awake.

Audio Module 1: Moving With the Moon
--------------------

Part 1, Module 1. Fishing is better during the three days of the waxing of the new moon. Hunters do better going after quarry during the three days of the waxing of the new moon. Wounds heal faster during the waxing of the new moon as blood flow is stimulated. A cut will bleed more during the waxing of the new moon. The ocean is lifted and produces the highest tides during the waxing period of the new moon. And good people are better during the waxing of the new moon. And the reverse is true. Bad people get worse during the waxing period of the new moon. In other words, the waxing period of the new moon has an effect on virtually all things on the planet Earth. Sound like something from out of a science fiction book? Well, it’s not. It’s actually scientific fact. There are two basic periods of the moon, waxing and waning. The way we look at it, the way that I’m going to be describing it is, that when the moon is waxing, it’s coming in too. When it’s waning, it’s going out of. It takes a bit less than 28 days for the moon to orbit the Earth, and so there’s a change from waxing to waning every 14 days. At the height of the full moon, the moon begins to go into the last quarter phase. The full moon is waning, going out of. Now it’s seven days, and the waning of the full moon is complete, and the coming into, or the waxing of the new moon begins. Now, three days prior to the height of the new moon, the waxing phase produces a stronger and stronger pull. This is the period and the facts that you want to know about. There are many other scientific facts regarding the moon that have an effect not only on your daily life, but also on your consciousness. So let me explain the phases of the moon as we know it through the science of astronomy. We’re basically interested in four moon phases. The full moon, the new moon, and the two quarter moons. There are more. Other phases are known as crescent moons, as every hour that passes puts the moon in another position with regards to the Earth. This is due to the moon constantly moving around the Earth. When the moon is aligned on the same side of the Earth as the sun, in other words, the moon is between the Earth and the sun, the sun is shining on the side of the moon away from you, and you can’t see that side. The side towards you is dark and can’t be seen. That is called the dark of the moon, the old moon, or more commonly, the new moon. When the moon is alongside the earth, either on the left side or the right side, the sun shines on the side facing it and we see only half of the moon. This is known as the half moon or the quarter moon. When the moon is on the opposite side of the earth with respect to the sun, the sun shines on the face of the moon that we see. This is, of course, the full moon. To simplify, moon, earth, sun, full moon. Earth, moon, sun, new moon. Moon on either side of earth, quarter moon. But instead of racking your brain about that, just download the lunar chart from the New Moon program. It’s in the members area, and that way you’ll get a graphic representation of these lunar phases. The reason we’re interested in the phases of the moon is for the same reason that fishermen, farmers, boat owners, and so on are interested. And that is because the moon has an effect on things on Earth. We all know that the moon has an attraction or pull on the Earth. That’s what causes the tides. There are higher tides during the new moon than there are during the quarter moon phases, as example. This is due to the gravitational pull of the moon attracting the waters of the ocean. This pull affects all things. During the new moon, the pull is strongest because you have the pull of the sun. Now, that’s constant. Plus the pull of the moon when it’s between the sun and the earth. Consider this. A farmer plows his field. Then he plants a seed and waters it. The moisture softens the coat of the seed, the outer layer. Now, if he does this during the waxing of the new moon, when the moon is getting stronger and stronger, he will get a better yield than doing it during a quarter or even a full moon. Now, why would that be? Well, allow me to use a metaphor. You’re walking up a hill. It’s getting steeper and more difficult. Suddenly, you feel a hand at your back, pushing you gently. The hand is at the small of your back, pushing you forward, and the walk gets easier. Well, it’s the same thing with respect to that seed the farmers put into the ground. It’s easier for the root tip to break through the coat of the seed if there’s a force pulling from outside the seed. The root and tip, when breaking through, will automatically head in the right direction. The root towards the gravitational pull and the tip in the opposite direction of the gravitational pull of the Earth. That’s nature. With the additional pull of the new moon, when the pull is strongest, the root grabs hold, the tip heads upward more quickly, and like a newborn who’s nourished well grows into a bigger, a healthier plant. An old veterinarian friend told me something I wasn’t aware of. He said, as I explained the new moon concept to a class some time ago, that he would never dehorn an animal during the new moon because, in his experience, the wound would bleed too much. Apparently, the pull of the moon would cause the blood to flow too freely. The facts that arise, that come about from this knowledge is that the moon, especially during the phase when it’s between the Earth and the sun, has a strong attraction for all things on Earth. Knowing that, you can use this knowledge to your advantage. Now, let’s get into a bit more scientific fact. Not only the moon, but all things that occupy space attract all other things. That attraction is known as gravity. To put it in its simplest form, it is that mass attracts mass. The greater the mass, the greater the attraction. The Earth has a great mass, and that mass attracts a lesser mass, a satellite that we call the moon. In turn, the sun has an even greater mass, and that mass attracts all the planets in our solar system. But a person has mass also. So does a lima bean or a grain of rice. Infinitely smaller, but then the attraction is smaller as well. All physical things have a mass. Mass is any body of matter, or to put it in a way that’s more understandable, anything that occupies space. A lima bean occupies space. A grain of rice occupies space, as does the sun, as do you. A seed occupies space, and so it has mass. Small, yes, but it is there. Now, that’s scientific fact. Gravity affects all things in the universe, and it always has, from the instant of the so-called Big Bang to the present. The closer you are to the greater mass, the stronger the pull of gravity. When you’re standing on the Earth, the pull of the sun and the moon is constant and not noticeable. However, when an astronaut, many miles away from the massive pull of the Earth, well, then gravity is seemingly gone and the astronaut floats. He’s not bound by the pull of the Earth that’s far below him. And then landing on the moon with its lesser mass, the pull of gravity is less. And the muscles of the astronaut, used to the stronger pull of the mass of the Earth, make him seem like a Superman. And he can take great leaps into the distance with ease. But what about the mind? And what about this law of attraction that we hear so much about? A mind doesn’t have any mass, doesn’t occupy any space. So how can adjusting thoughts be the cause of attracting something? If mass attracts mass, and if the mind has no mass, then logically this law of attraction coming into play by thinking about a thing must be a bunch of hogwash. Now this brings up an interesting question. Because we know that often thinking about something does cause it to happen. So now the question is, if the equation of mass attracting mass is correct, and thinking about something can attract that thing, then does the mind have mass? And that’s the big question. Now, the answer is very important to you. It’s important to your lifestyle, to your attitude toward things, and it’s important to life in general. The answer is yes, and I can show you simply by applying logic. We know that the brain, stimulated by thoughts of the mind, creates waves of energy, brain waves, brain energy, measurable electromagnetic energy. That energy has mass. Or does it? Brain waves don’t transmit mass. A wave transmits energy, sometimes an immense amount of energy, without transmitting mass. And as an example, the water that an ocean wave travels through. Now, the water that the wave travels through, the water itself, It doesn’t move forward. It only moves up and down as the wave creates a second generation of energy, the movement of the water. But the wave itself is without mass. And so we see how the wave can create a new generation of energy through its receptor. In this case, the receptor is water. In the case of the wave produced by an earthquake, The receptor would be the land. The land doesn’t move, it just goes up and down. The wave of energy, however, that does move. The wave produced by the slippage of an earthquake fault creates a wave that travels through the earth for sometimes hundreds of miles. The mass is the earth itself, which moves but doesn’t travel. The pull. or attraction of the moon has no mass. It does, however, like the wave of the ocean, travel, sent out by the mass of the moon itself seeking a receptor. That receptor can be the ocean, the cut horn of a bull, a seed, or your mind. This energy formation can’t be seen or felt, only the result of it. When you utilize this wave of energy created by the mass of the moon and control it even to a small degree, you have a better chance of seeing your goals and desires come to fruition. By utilizing this energy form coming from a particular phase of the moon, you have a new and powerful resource at your disposal. Now then, here are the dates of the new moon for the next year. The times are within the half hour. Now I suggest you make a note of all these dates as you’ll soon be looking forward to each one so that you can do the new moon programming.

Audio Module 2: Harnessing the Power of the New Moon
--------------------

Part 1, Module 2. The ancient Greeks, who had a hand in the business of the moon’s effect on us Earth creatures, believed that all the stars and planets in the universe revolved around the Earth. They were correct only with respect to the moon, which is the only celestial body to revolve around the Earth, aside from our satellites that we shoot up into space now. Aristotle, Plato’s pupil, believed the heavens were composed of spheres to which the stars and planets were attached. And Plato called the planets great visible gods who existed in the dimension of the ether. Now, these were pretty smart guys, but not having our technological skills, they were also ignorant with regards to the basics of astronomy. Socrates, the teacher of the great Greek philosophers, and one of the wisest men throughout the ages, at least considered so, he believed that the sun and the moon were gods, and later on he suffered for that belief. The skies at the time of these giants of 0470 BC, or thereabouts, were viewed only by the means of the naked eye. No telescopes then. And only the most visible planets were studied and seen. And then usually during the time of the new moon, when the background wasn’t diluted with the reflected light of the sun. According to the best thinking of the time, the gods of the moon, to irritate Neptune, the god of the sea, created the tides, keeping the creatures of the earth. both confused and busy trying to figure out how to get their boats out of the harbors during an incoming tidal flow. These beliefs, primitive and quaint though they might have been, gave some sort of meaning to all those things of mystery that mankind were confronted by. They created metaphors to allow them to… to specify the abstraction. In other words, they had to see something there. And so they made things up to the best of the knowledge of the time. That didn’t make them any less clever. It simply made them ignorant about the things that we know now through our technological advances. And who knows, at some time in the future, some of the things that we do now may be laughed at as ignoramuses. But for the present, we do have science. And science shows us how the mass of the moon sends out an energy flow, waves of energies that attract all things physical, gravity. This is science. We know that the moon has a definite pull on the earth and on the waters of the earth. That being so, consider what you’re made up of. Consider what I’m made up of. Consider what any person is made up of. Organs and veins and bones and fats and blood and muscle, yes. But the primary ingredient to every human is water. Take out all the water in a human being and you’d fall into a pile of dust. That being the case. And with the knowledge. that the moon has an effect on all the waters of the earth. It would stand to reason that the moon also has an effect on the waters of a person. I recall a morning in Athens, Greece, that is, of course. I was strolling along a street in the Plaka. That’s an area of coffee shops, restaurants, tourist shops, generally small shops, just below the Acropolis. I was nibbling on a chunk of bread and a few olives, thinking that Plato may well have walked along this same street, eating the same thing, thinking great thoughts. But what I had that Plato did not have was the knowledge of modern science. Whereas to him the moon was a place where gods resided, to me it was an airless, barren place that man had already walked on and investigated. I knew the moon was just an empty globe stuck by gravity to a particular position in the sky. I also knew that the moon’s pull on our planet did more than try to confuse mankind. I have to admit, though, that just being in Greece got me to thinking about how those ancient beliefs brought about our present ones. When I’m in another city in the United States or in… In Europe, I’m generally in a hotel, and I usually feng shui the hotel for particular purposes. Generally, the purpose I’m feng shuiing it for is for a very successful seminar. One of the things I do is hang posters. One of the posters that I hung on the wall of my hotel room there in Athens was that of the planets and the moons of the planets. I remember thinking, how would the moons of Jupiter affect us if indeed they did at all? Now, Jupiter has 63 moons, all in orbit. Some of them would be considered planets if they revolved around the sun instead of a planet. Two of them, Ganymede and Callisto, Each are larger than our own moon. Would they have any effect being so far from us? Ganymede has twice the mass of our moon, but the distance would prevent anything but a metaphysical attraction. I decided there in my room, as I looked at the Acropolis sitting on the highest point in the city, that I would investigate this business of the moon’s pull on all things on Earth, just to see if that information could be useful. And so when I returned to my home in Tarzana, where I lived at the time, I got together with my good friend, Ovi Sahestad, who had written an encyclopedic work on the basics of astrology and did research on the moon and its effect on Earth. Gathering as much material as I could, I then decided, let me test it. So I held a seminar in New York. That seemed like the likeliest start. And so that month, it was in 1984 we began. 200 people attended. And as there was a new moon that weekend, it was a perfect time for the test. Everyone received a sheet with instructions and were told to send in the results of their programming after a month had passed. I received 42 replies, all of them attesting to the fact that the new moon programming did indeed work. It worked better than programming with no outside influence. One person in particular comes to mind, a fellow named Bill Randall. He called me about three weeks after the class to tell me of a few coincidences that happened after that new moon programming seminar. He’d used the technique he’d learned not only in the class, but actually waited until the 30 minutes before the height of the moon, which happened to be at 2 o ‘clock in the morning. Now, Bill didn’t mind. He told me he wanted to get as much attraction of his message as possible. And so at 1 .30, the moon would be waxing for 30 minutes more. And then after reaching its peak, it would then commence with the waning period. And it would lose power every minute instead of gaining power every minute as it did during the waxing time. Bill used the white velvet method of reaching a deep meditation, and when he was deep and concentrative, he used lunar programming, as he’d learned in a supermind seminar of mine. But that I included in that seminar that he was in, as it was important that everyone use the same technique so we could get similar results. When deep in meditation, Bill stepped through the imaginary door, as he had learned. And he sensed with his daydreaming mechanism, creating a mental image that he was successful at what he wanted. What he wanted and what he was programming for was a house. He imagined or daydreamed himself buying the house. He imagined himself decorating the house with furniture and accessories. Mentally, he went through each room in the yard. He created a scenario that he wanted to come to be, to happen. He observed the scene that he created as though he was the director of a play with himself as the star. So far, lunar programming is similar to a dozen other programs, but here’s where we depart from the norm. After visualizing all of this, Bill imagines the moon, but this time he imagines the full moon. He senses the reflected light of the sun bouncing off the moon, energizing the scene. He bathes everything in the moonlight. And he does all this during the three -day period of the waxing of the new moon. Well, the coincidences that ultimately got him his house were almost exactly as Bill imagined it when he did the lunar programming. But Bill wasn’t the only one. Not everyone programmed for a house, of course, but people started reporting… Having health problems resolved, one person found a job a week after the class. Another woman, after trying for a year, found herself pregnant. Five people reported money coming from strange sources. Another had a brother he hadn’t spoken to for months call, and so on and on it went. Apparently, the new moon programming gave the goal setter a real kick up the scale. Well, after that, I started to teach the concept once a month for years. It works. It doesn’t work every time. Nothing I know is 100%, but it works enough of the time to give hope that all things are possible. But let’s examine why it works when it does. When you want something and you program for that thing to take place, you create an image in your mind, the thought. Always and every single time. Nothing that you do. ever takes place until you have a thought that you’re going to do that thing. This is automatic. Generally happens without your knowledge of the thought. As example, a ball is laying on the floor. You bend over and pick it up. Before you picked up the ball, you had to think about picking it up. Before you thought about picking it up, you had to have a desire to pick it up. You created a thought, a fleeting thought, yes, but it was there. It had to be there. as you directed yourself to pick up the ball. All physical things that you do are preceded by a thought. The thought is preceded by desire. Thoughts have energy in them. We know this because your thoughts can now be measured while you’re thinking them. Modern technology can look into your brain and get a general idea of what you’re thinking. These thoughts happen in wavelengths. And like a wave, it has no mass of its own. but it affects mass by traveling through it. This thought is an energy form similar to an ocean wave that affects the water that it’s traveling through. It disturbs the water, moving it up and down, and it passes through the water, but it travels, but it doesn’t cause the water to travel. The thought, like the wave, just keeps traveling, touching every other mind on the planet. just as a wave moving through the ocean passes through all the water. If a pebble is dropped in the ocean, it causes ripples throughout the ocean, but so small that the furthest rippling can’t be seen. But take something like a great mass, say a meteorite, slamming into the ocean, and the effects of that wave, this immense energy created by that mass, will be seen thousands of miles away. This is seen every time there’s a tsunami. It isn’t a meteorite slamming into the ocean. It’s an earthquake on the floor of the ocean. But the effect is the same. A wave is created. Now, let’s take that same concept and see how the waves of the mind work. Every thought that you have leaves your mind like a wave of energy. Some thoughts are stronger than others and cause a manifestation of sorts. Your desires are the pebbles that create the thoughts. You do nothing until you desire to do the thing. The stronger the desire, the stronger the wave of energy. But you might say, but I have a strong desire to win the lottery. Why don’t I win? Well, you do have a strong desire, but so do a million other people. And those people also produce waves of energy that co -mingle with your own. And like a hurricane of wave action with a disturbed ocean, waves of energy clash and the movement is extreme. First of all, you have to calm the receptor of the energy. With a million people programming for a winning ticket, some are calm, some are disturbed. Your chances of being the key thought are very slim. But now let’s take a thing that you want that only you are programming for. Your thoughts that travel out into the sphere, into the universe, they’re like a key that’s looking for a lock to unlock. The thoughts will only manifest when it gets a fitting. Let me give you an example. Here’s a story for you. Let’s say that you own a paper company in Philadelphia. and you need more business. You program using all your resources, lunar programming and the new moon. Your message goes out almost like the transmission of a radio station that’s broadcasting a news bulletin. But the bulletin is only going to be heard by those people who are tuned into that station. The message is the key to unlock the station frequency that’s tuned to the same channel. Like the radio transmission, your visualization, your daydream mechanism, so to speak, is sent out as waves of energy on a particular frequency. Just as a radio transmission hits all radios, whether they’re tuned in or not, so your visualization hits every person on the planet. But so does every other mind on the planet. makes your visualization different are three things. First of all, your intention. That is, you intend for something to take place when the visualization goes out. That gives it more energy. That enhances the wave. Second, the power of the new moon. The power of the new moon increases the strength of the wave you send out immensely. And the third, meditation. Programming is enhanced when the mind is passive, when the mind is relaxed, when the mind is concentrative, and that’s meditation. That is the meditation state. And that is where the programming and visualizations are their strongest. Here’s something like what happens during the programming. As the owner of the paper company, you program for new business during the height of the new moon. and the waves of energy your visualization has created is enhanced. It covers the globe. And somehow, coincidentally, just about that time, oh, let’s say, a peasant farmer in a small village near Beijing, China, is plowing a field. The plow hits a rock and breaks. The farmer goes to the head of his commune, and the leader notes, that it’s the 10th plow to break that year. He submits an order for more plows. The maker of the plows orders steel from a company in Ohio. The head of that company has been getting a lot of orders from China lately. China demands all orders be confirmed in writing on the original paper. The steel company puts in an order for more paper. But in his haste, he forgets his normal supplier and calls your company instead. Your card has been on his desk for months without having been noticed. The order you receive is the largest in the history of your company. Now, that metaphor seems far -fetched, but programming is like flinging out a web that touches all minds, all events. That broken plow in China appears to be a long stretch from a paper company in Philadelphia, but it’s all connected. And that’s pretty much the way that coincidence and programming work. In the next module, you’ll find our first Luna meditation. It’s a bit different than most, but it’s just a toe dip as you learn this different programming method of utilizing the power of the moon.

Audio Module 3: Your First Lunar Meditation Exercise
--------------------

Part 1, Module 3, Luna Meditation. At this time, relax. We’ll start with a 3 to 1 count. And this module, of course, is not to be played in a moving vehicle. This is a meditation exercise. Find a comfortable position. Close your eyes. Take a deep breath. And as you exhale, mentally repeat. and visualize the number three three times. Take another deep breath, and as you exhale, mentally repeat and visualize the number two three times. Take another deep breath, and as you exhale, mentally repeat and visualize the number one three times. To help you to enter a deeper, a more relaxed level of mind, I’m going to count from ten to one. On each descending number, feel yourself going inward, and you will enter a pleasant, a relaxed level of mind where you’ll be able to concentrate fully on one subject. Ten. Nine. Feel. Going deeper. Eight. Seven. Six. Feel going deeper and deeper. Five. Four. Three. Deeper and deeper. Two. One. You are now at a pleasant, relaxed level of mind where you’re able to concentrate fully. on one subject. At this time, concentrate on my words. You are now and always in complete control of your state of mind. You can open your eyes. You can be fully alert anytime you wish to be. Every time you enter this relaxed meditation state, know that you’re getting better and better in every way. Whenever you enter this relaxed meditation state, you will mentally say, every day, in every way, I’m getting better and better. When you say these words, sense yourself improving in all areas of your life. Sense yourself getting better and better. Visualize improvements in your life now. as you mentally repeat the words. Every day, in every way, I’m getting better and better. Relax. Relax now and direct your attention to your eyes. Relax your eyes. Now direct your attention to your lips and your jaw. Relax your lips and jaw. Relax your entire head and relax your neck. That’s fine. Now relax your shoulders. Relax your arms and your hands. Relax the upper part of your body, your chest, your back. And now your stomach and the small of your back. Relax your thighs. Relax your legs and your feet. Relaxed. Repeat mentally. My body rests and refreshes itself when I consciously relax. I am relaxed now. Repeat mentally after me. Every day, my image of myself gets better. I can do anything I have a desire to do. I am a wonderful, unique human being. There’s no one else on earth exactly like me. Every day I grow stronger knowing that I can. I can think. I can create. I can do. I can do anything I have a desire. to do. Relax. Imagine now that you’re sitting and that there is a white velvet curtain in front of you. Next to you is a box filled with black numbers. The numbers are from 1 to 10. In a moment, you’ll reach into the box and remove a number. The number that you reach will be in sequence. You don’t have to be concerned. At first, when you reach into the box, your hand will pull out the number 10. And then you will take the number 10 and lay it on the white velvet curtain. The number will stick. And then you’ll reach into the box and take out the number 9 and put it on the curtain. And that number will stick to the curtain. and then the number eight, and so on until you’ve taken each of the ten numbers out of the box and placed them on the velvet curtain in front of you. The numbers are made so that they will stick on the velvet curtain. Now then, take the black numbers out of the box one at a time and hang them all on the white velvet curtain. starting with the number 10, and continue until you reach the number 1. Begin. If you’ve not yet reached the number one, imagine that all the ten numbers are on the velvet curtain. Relax. And now, remove the numbers one at a time, starting with the number ten. Reach up to the number ten, take it off the curtain, and put it back in the box. Now the number nine. Now the number eight. Now the number seven. Back in the box. Now the number six. Now the number five. Now the number four. Now the number three. Now the number two. And there’s one number left on the curtain. Now reach up and take the number one and put that in the box. Now allow the velvet curtain and the box to disappear from the scene. Very good. You are now at a deeper. more concentrative level of mind. And now then, as I use the mantra OM, you mentally will follow along with me. Each OM will take you deeper into the meditation and you’ll be more concentrative so that the programming that you will be doing is more likely to be successful. Relax. Just follow along with me mentally. Imagine now the moon. Visualize the great moon that is between the earth and the sun. Imagine the pull of the moon. Imagine the tides of the ocean driving the water higher as the new moon’s gravitational pull attracts. This pull will enhance all of your programming. especially that program that we will now be doing. Think about the program. Think about what you want to come to be, what it is that you’d like to attract or perhaps repel. Think about that now. Relax. Just relax. And for this… first of the new moon meditations will use a standard programming device to enable you to saturate the universe with your thoughts. You needn’t consider the moon at this time because you are in meditation close to the height of the new moon and your program’s energy will float from your mind and saturate the universe automatically. Relax. And imagine that you’re standing in a hallway, a small hallway with a door at the opposite end of where you’re standing. Create the door. Make it ornate. On the other side of that door is your heart’s desire, the thing that you’re programming for. What is it that you desire? What is it that you’d like to manifest? Think about that thing that you want to achieve, to attract. to get, to have. In a moment, I’m going to count from one to three and you’ll walk through the door and you’ll see a scene. Some action will be taking place. You will be part of the action. You will observe the scene as though it were a play. You’re the director of that event as well as the observer. You can watch it as it unfolds. What you create on the other side of that door, is what you are programming for. You will see the goal is already accomplished and you happy with the result. I will now count. One, two, three. The door is opening and the door is open. Imagine it. Now walk through the door and imagine the end result of your goal accomplished. Take your time. I will allow you plenty of time. Relax and begin. Visualize your goal accomplished. Relax. Now imagine the moon, but this time it will be the full moon. Imagine the reflected light of the full moon brightening the entire scene. Imagine the entire scene is bathed in the light of the moon. Allow the light of the full moon to permeate the entire scene. And now back into the hallway and allow the door to close. The door is closed. Imagine that. Whenever you think of the thing that you’re programming for, think of the event as already accomplished. Every morning, when you think of your goal, repeat the phrase, every day, in every way. I am getting better and better. You may program for your goal at any time, but do be sure to program during every new moon. Relax. In a moment, I’m going to count from… five. At that moment, you’ll open your eyes. You’ll be wide awake, feeling wonderfully refreshed, feeling better than before. One, two, three, coming out slowly, four, and five. Eyes open, wide awake, feeling relaxed and comfortable, feeling better than before.

Audio Module 4: Using Lunar Programming to Attract Abundance
--------------------

Part 2, Module 4. There are many different ways and many different things that people program for. Most of them are done subconsciously. But the number one thing that people in general seem to want above all others is abundance. Well, now that’s one of the main things people in general would like. More of things. Abundance. This is one objective that everyone seems to be interested in. Having more. More. More friends. Better health. More acknowledgement. And most of all, more money. Abundance is so often intermingled with affluence that people forget they’re not quite the same. Affluence is wealth, prosperity, riches. Abundance is simply more. More of some things. So let’s see about programming, the programming of more, abundance. What is it you want more of? Let’s say that it’s money. And, of course, the things that money can buy. Aside from health and relationships, where you might think that money can’t help, well, money does help to some degree with health and with relationships as well. Better care is an example. But wealth is what people seem to want, or at least enough money so that it no longer is a concern. So then, as this program is about using the new moon to attract, how about attracting affluence? Well, let’s see how this new resource of programming with the strength of the new moon behind you, how that can pay off. Before we can use it, however, You want to clarify. You must clarify your intent. What’s the purpose of your programming? What do you want out of it? Let’s use the general factor and say that your intention is to send a message to the universe that you want money. Okay, that’s the first step. You want to get the message out so that you’ll attract that affluence through a series of coincidences. Here’s a story that I tell during my seminars of a good man who constantly prays for some money to leave his children, as he’s been told he has only two weeks to live. His time is short, and the only way left for him is to win the lottery. He prays to win the lottery. He says in his prayer that he’s always been a good person, which he has, charitable, with never a harsh word for anyone, and that if anybody deserved good fortune, it was him. Why couldn’t he be allowed to win the lottery so that his children would have more than he did? Why couldn’t he do that before he left the world? Again and again he prays until there’s only a few days left for him on the earth. And then, just before his demise, he hears a booming voice saying, Carl, do me a favor. Buy a ticket. Now, there’s much to that somewhat amusing tale. You must have a ticket if there’s any chance at all of winning. But what’s your ticket to affluence? What you want is the universe to notice you. One manner in which to do that is to broadcast your needs and wants through the faculty of meditation, and then to enhance the outgoing forces with the power of the moon. There are two basic ways in which to send your message out. The message saying that you want something, and can the universe help you to get that thing? Let me compare the thoughts that you send out with a radio transmission. A station that sends out a song played, oh, let’s say a musical group called the Songsters. The Songsters sing into a microphone, and… vibration is sent out via radio waves. But the station that’s broadcasting the song is only operating at 5,000 watts, as the station is a small station in a small town. The radio waves go out, but as it’s only 5,000 watts, it gets very weak with distance and doesn’t get into the large city that’s not too far away. If you were in the city and tuned into that station, you might hear a static-filled song, but barely. And chances are you’ll tune into a different station. The radio waves, they go out, they permeate the entire globe, but they’re so weak, the only people that can hear the station clearly are those in the small town where it’s being broadcast. In the nearby city, the radio station broadcasts at 50,000 watts. That broadcast sends out radio waves in a much wider net. It can be heard hundreds of miles away, and under the right conditions, people tuned into that station thousands of miles away can hear it. And they hear it in the clear. The more wattage, the further the reach, the clearer the sound. In a similar manner, the mind’s transmissions, as indicated by brain waves, Send out messages as you think. Every thought is a transmission, but most of them transmitted as weak emanations. They don’t go anywhere. But every now and again, your thoughts are intensified. How? By your emotions. As example, when you’re angry, when you’re fearful, when you feel guilty about something, when you’re resentful, or as with positive thoughts, when you’re loving, when you’re kindly, when you’re thoughtful. The strength of the thought carries the waves of energy created by the strength, the enhanced degree of the thought. They carry the thought further out into the universe. This is one of the reasons that people who are angry all the time live in a different world than the person who might be right next to them, a family member, as an example, who has loving thoughts. The thought attracts a similar alike response. Change the thought, then you change the reality the thought naturally attracts. All this is done on the outer conscious level. You have thousands of thoughts every day, but most of them, they just dissipate and they don’t attract the response. But when a coincidence or accident or even a deja vu occurrence takes place, you can bet that it was preceded by one of your thoughts. Your thoughts, every single one of them, go out into the universe. Some of them attract the response, and some just keep on traveling, like a pebble dropped into a lake cause a series of ripples. When you consciously create a thought with intent behind it, the thought strengthens and seeks manifestation. The thought touches everyone, but so do all other thoughts. So why should your thought have any more effect than any other thought. Well, first of all, there’s a vehicle the thought is carried on. Our vehicle will be lunar programming, the goal-setting device. Lunar programming will be carried out during a meditation. When you think thoughts at the outer conscious level, those thoughts… are like the 5,000-watt station. But during meditation, when you’re highly concentrative, the minutiae of thoughts that flit through your mind, they’re gone. And that concentrative state that we call meditation enhances your thoughts, strengthens them, and suddenly you’re turned into a 50,000-watt station. And the thought is more likely to manifest as now it touches every person. But this time, the intent is carried along with the thought as well. Remember the story of the paper company business person programming for more business, whose thoughts ultimately reached a farmer plowing his field in China? Let’s extend the metaphor by taking an ordinary thought, and you have tons of them every day, and say that those ordinary thoughts are like the 5,000-watt station. They leave your mind, obviously, because you have thought them. But there are no emotions involved, nor were you concentrated when you thought them. So we’ll call those thoughts the 5,000 watt variety. Now think those thoughts when you’re highly emotional, like when you’re furious, scared, resentful, in a panic, or any other emotional thought, including positive thoughts, then your brainwaves are enhanced. And say like the five, like the, not the five, but the 50,000 watt station. But they’re not in control. They’re out of control. And they may attract things that you really don’t want. But what if that 50,000 watt thought could be controlled? What if you could turn it into a 500,000 watt thought? Wow. You might just surprise yourself with your goal-setting process. Well, let’s see how you can do that. Still using the same metaphor, let’s say that the 5,000-watt thought, the thought that you want to use to attract something to you, is something that you desire, but you don’t have a vehicle to get that thought working for you. Desire can be strengthened by utilizing your daydream mechanism and creating mental images of the thing that you want. That would be the first step. Now then, what do you intend to do with the subject of the thought? Is it money that you intend to attract? What’s the money for? What do you intend to do with the money? Intent and desire intensify the thought. Add the attraction and pull of the new moon, and that 50,000 watt thought is really intensified. Now you may very well be sending out a 500,000 watt thought. A thought that will reach everyone who could possibly be influenced by the thought clear and static free. Now that’s power. And it’s under your control. And your programs are more likely to come to be. Everyone programs. Even people who’ve never heard of the word. Everyone has a goal. For some, in poverty-stricken societies, the goal is to drink clean water or find a few grains of rice. For the affluent, the goal is a larger house, a luxury car, luxurious foods, expensive clothes, and for those in between, they earn for better things than they already have. Behind all those conscious and subconscious programs are two emotions that either help… or get in the way. And those are motivation and resolve. The way that I’m defining the word resolve is that of making a decision. Another word for this is intent. What is your intention? But let’s use resolve in the manner of making a decision. This is most important. Okay, you’ve decided to use the new moon process for your goal. Fine, don’t question it, just do it. But to do it, you have to have a vehicle. You may want to go from New York to Los Angeles, but there are many means for you to use to get there. You can walk, you can run, you can drive a car, take a bus, take a train, or fly. You could even go around and through the Panama Canal by boat. All those means will get you from the East Coast to the West Coast, but in all probability, you’ll fly, because that’s the safest and the quickest way to accomplish your goal. Your goal is to get to Los Angeles. Your intent is that you resolve to fly. And so a jet plane is your means. Now then, your goal is to attract money, affluence, and as you want more, abundance as well. You can use any one of a dozen devices. There’s goal setting through meditation, there’s qigong, there’s feng shui, there’s prayer, labyrinths, candles, icons, and all kinds of material. But they’re only the means. In addition to all those devices, there is intent. Without intent, it would just be a kind of foolish preoccupation, a hobby. Just by utilizing a device indicates intent. And so the device that we’ll be using is the lunar meditation, once again. And so to sum up. When you want to use the law of attraction to bring affluence and abundance to you, the best way to do that is to activate the law. The way to activate the law of attraction is to send out a message that you want something. The most effective way of sending that message out is through meditation. While at the meditation state of mind, with body and mind relaxed and concentrative, you utilize a device to get… message out. The device is a goal-setting channel, Luna Meditation. When you are meditating and concentrative, you’re like the difference between the 5,000 and the 50,000 watt radio station. You’re broadcasting at 50,000 watts, metaphorically speaking, when you do it at the meditation level of mind.

Audio Module 5: Desire, Visualize, Attain: The 3 Steps to Attracting Abundance
--------------------

Part 2, Module 5. The best way to use lunar programming would be to strengthen resolve, enhance your motivation, and energize desire. But first of all, decide on what it is that you want. Before you can program for a thing, you must have a desire for whatever it is that you believe that you want. Say that wealth and abundance is your foremost desire right now. Okay, that’s your goal, wealth and abundance. But just desiring it won’t necessarily bring it to you unless your desire is so strong that you shove everything else out of the way and you make it a need above anything else, above all others. Sometimes a metaphor gets it across. Let me tell you a story about desire so that you’ll have a better understanding of it. A disciple goes over to his guru and asks, Master, how do I achieve enlightenment? And the guru says, well, that’s easy. Simply desire it and it shall be yours. And the disciple says, but I do desire it. At one end of the ashram in which… lived and studied, there was a trowel, a water trowel. And it was brimming with water, the sacred cows that would occasionally stroll over and drink from. It was for them. Well, the guru directed the young man to that place. Come here and hold your head over the end of the trowel. And the obedient disciple did it. And the guru then shoved the young man’s head under the water, holding it there with a grip of iron. The disciple struggled for a moment, and then he was still. He figured, well, he’s being baptized or something, and then he’ll be enlightened. Well, after a minute, he tried to get out. He couldn’t breathe. His head is underwater. And he begins to… His arms are moving all over the place, but it didn’t help. The grip was relentless, and his head stayed under the water. A minute and a half went by, and the young disciple was desperate for breath. He struggled. He tried to withdraw his head. It didn’t help. The hand of the master held him under the water. Finally, the disciple ceased struggling. He stopped struggling. He started to lose consciousness. Right then, the guru released him. And sputtering and choking and taking huge gulps of air, the disciple looked at his guru, feeling an emotion as close to anger as was possible for him. But you can’t get angry with your guru. You didn’t know what to think. Finally, the guru spoke. When your head was under the water, and just before I released you, what was it that you desired? most of all in the world. And the young man, his chest still heaving, replied, to breathe. Ah, said the yogi, to breathe, yes. When you desire enlightenment to that degree, it shall be yours. Now, it’s unlikely that you will ever want anything to so strong a degree. But if you did, you’d get it. At the other end of the scale would be a desire so weak that you wouldn’t walk across a room for the object of the desire. Without desire, achievement is impossible. So first of all, determine how strong a desire you have for your goal. It’s unlikely that your desire for wealth and abundance will ever be as strong as your desire for breath and for food and for sleep. But then again, it has to be stronger than walking into the kitchen for a glass of water. Luna programming helps in that the energy created by a strong desire is implemented by the strength of the pull of the new moon when you use it at the same time. This is the time you may use in whatever time zone that you’re in, as it’s going to vary with your location. But for our purposes, Using universal time as a target is fine. Of course, I’m using this just as an example. You can use the same process for any new moon. For the dates and the times of the upcoming new moons, check the lunar calendar, the calendar that’s included in our online members area. If you were in Los Angeles at 9 .03 a .m. on January 4th, and I was in London, for me the time would be 6 .03. p .m., but the moon would be in a different position relative to my place on Earth. So use the times that you see on the lunar chart that you’ll get with this. Or just check your local newspaper. Almost all of them have the moon’s position, usually in the weather section of the newspaper. Okay, so now we know the time and the date of the apogee, or the height of the new moon. Incidentally, you may have had that word before and not know what it meant. Just in case you’re wondering, Apogee means apex of gravity. If you were to do your programming at, say, 9 a .m. on January 4th, you’d be in the highest stream of gravity with regards to the moon. But you don’t have to be quite that precise. With many of the students reporting, mainly from that original class in Manhattan, I’ve come up with a larger window than that. Let’s say that we have a 72 -hour period. During the 72 -hour period prior to the new moon, you have a good chance of having your program succeed. Personally, I use a 24 -hour window as a programming period. But if for some reason you can’t hit the 24 -hour period, 48 or 72 hours before the time of the height of the new moon, that’ll do. When you program. or pray for that matter, you’re sending out waves of mental energy. These waves of energy have different strengths depending on your attitude, your beliefs, and your desire for success. What I mean by your desire for success is this. Sometimes you’re getting your goal will cause a negative effect in other people, in friends or family members. Say that you’re programming for money and you get it. And because of your newfound wealth, your friends or your family members, they become jealous or resentful. They want things from you. Even on a subconscious level, it could have a negative effect on the program. Before you program, it will be helpful to consider the effect of you getting the thing that you want, the effect that that thing would have on other people. And, more to the point, how you will feel about that. And here as well, you can use one of the phases of the moon. The moon phase for considering other people and the effect that your program will have on those people is the first quarter moon. after the new moon. That would be seven days after the height of the new moon, or with respect to January 4th, 903 new moon, it would be January 12th, 1130 a .m., or seven days after the new moon. Okay, let’s back up a bit. So then, say that it is January 3rd, early evening. Now, that’s well within the strong period of the new moon, into the waxing period. And you’ve decided to do some programming. Let’s just walk through the entire process of lunar programming. You’ve decided, let’s say, to program specifically for money. Say that the amount that you’re programming for is $5 ,000. You might say that it’s kind of a test for you to set the process in motion. But that’s the amount you’ll be setting your goal to get. You find a quiet place where you’ll be undisturbed and you go to your meditation level of consciousness. You can easily do this the first time by listening to the next module, which is a program for money. But before you do that, you want to learn the process so that you may program for money or anything else that you believe you need or will be needing or wanting. As you meditate, think of the moon, a full moon. a moon that is reflecting the light of the sun from where all energies flow. Imagine being bathed by the reflected light of the sun as it’s absorbed by and reflected from the moon. As you visualize the moon, imagine that you’re basking in the light of the full moon. As you sense the light of the moon permeating you, Mentally say, I want $5 ,000, allow me to attract it, or whatever it is that you do want. And then visualize yourself with the money and spending the money. Money is not an end, but a means to an end. What is it that you want to do with the money? Visualize the thing or the things that you want to buy with the money. You are sensing the full moon’s reflection on the mental level. And now you’re going to send out your programming message on the physical level, where the new moon is pulling at its strongest. So you’re working with the mental level and the physical level. The mental level, you’re working with the full moon, and on the physical level, you’re working with the new moon. To do this, imagine your entire program, the $5 ,000, and mentally say, I want $5 ,000, and then fling the thought out into the universe. The general idea of this is that with the help of the pull of the new moon’s attraction, the energy of your thought will leave you and permeate the universe. And that basically is new moon programming. Let me tell you how Paul Campagna, one of my graduates, says it. Sometimes people modify the concept and add a few things that they feel would work for them. As long as you stay within the parameters of the concept, that’s fine. As a matter of fact, I prefer that you work it out yourself. When you do that, the concept really becomes totally your own. Here’s what Paul did. His program wasn’t for money. It was for a car, a new car. He wanted a clear visualization, so he went to a dealer. He looked over the car he wanted. He sat in it. He got a brochure featuring it. He studied the brochure. That allowed him to have a good memory of the auto. He waited for the day of the new moon. When he was ready, he went to a quiet corner of his living room and he meditated as he was taught. Deeper and deeper he went. And when he felt he was ready, he visualized the full moon with its reflected light bathing him. Finally, he felt ready to program. He visualized himself in the car of his choice. He sensed the smell of it, the color. He felt his hands on the steering wheel. And he looked out the window at the familiar landscape he was passing as he drove by. And then he took an objective view of himself driving the car. He switched the scene. He saw friends congratulating him on his beautiful new car. He then did something that he didn’t learn from me. He imagined the entire scene of him in the new car, and he stuffed the scene into a ball like a baseball. He then flicked his tongue to the roof of his mouth in a Baga movement, and he mentally said, multiply a thousandfold. And then he saw thousands of balls, each one with his message on it. And he flung them all out and away from him. And then he imagined each ball splitting open and the image of him and his new car coming out thousands of times, permeating the universe. He imagined the new moon pulling his message out into the universe so that everyone on the planet was affected by it. After he did all that, he asked me if he did it all right because he had made it up while he was in the meditation state. Well, it sounded fine to me. Get creative with your programming. The main idea is to get the message out into the universe at a particular time. And that’s one way to do it. Now, during the quarter moon, while at the meditation state, Paul imagined two of his relatives who needed money badly. and they were resentful and jealous of the fact that he had bought a new car. He saw himself telling each one of them that he had a bit of luck and would like to share it with him. He saw himself giving each of them $500 so that they were then participants in his good luck. That took the guilt out of the equation. I use a different, a simpler method of getting the message out. During the day before the height of the new moon, I go to the meditation state and I visualize the thing that I want. Then I pause for a moment and I visualize things going away from me. I imagine throwing a ball, shooting an arrow, a car rushing away from me, anything that’s moving away from me. That puts me in the outgoing mode. And then I think about the thing that I want. The last thing I do is imagine myself at some future time with the thing that I’m programming for. I see myself from an objective view and then a subjective view. The objective view is when I’m looking at myself doing something. The subjective view, I’m doing the thing. If it were a car, I would see myself in the car from an objective view, and from a subjective view, I would be looking out the window of the car with my hands on the steering wheel. If this sounds familiar, or if it sounds similar, to a technique that you’re already using, it probably is. The beauty of new moon programming is that it enhances whatever programming that you’re using, whatever program you’re using. If you’re happy with the goal -setting technique that you have now, keep using it. But when you do use it, be sure to use it at least once, sometime during the 24 -hour period preceding the new moon. Yeah, you can do it 72 if you want. Most people, they settle into the day before the height of the new moon, that 24 -hour period. People often ask if lunar programming will work just as well when programming for other people. Sure it will. It’s a great way to help other people. Just visualize them having overcome whatever problem they have and do it during the new moon period. In the next module, there’ll be a lunar… an exercise specifically designed for affluence, for money.

Audio Module 6: Lunar Meditation Exercise: Attracting Affluence
--------------------

Part 2, Module 6, Luna Meditation. At this time, relax. We’ll start with a 3 to 1 count. And this module, of course, is not to be played in a moving vehicle. This is a meditation exercise. Find a comfortable position. Close your eyes. Take a deep breath. And as you exhale, mentally repeat. and visualize the number three three times. Take another deep breath, and as you exhale, mentally repeat and visualize the number two three times. Take another deep breath, and as you exhale, mentally repeat and visualize the number one three times. To help you to enter a deeper, a more relaxed level of mind, I’m going to count from ten to one. On each descending number, feel yourself going inward, and you will enter a pleasant, a relaxed level of mind where you’ll be able to concentrate fully on one subject. Ten. Nine. Feel. going deeper. Eight, seven, six, feel going deeper and deeper. Five, four, three, deeper and deeper. Two, one. You are now at a pleasant, relaxed level of mind where you’re able to concentrate fully. on one subject. At this time, concentrate on my words. You are now and always in complete control of your state of mind. You can open your eyes. You can be fully alert anytime you wish to be. Every time you enter this relaxed meditation state, know that you’re getting better and better in every way. Whenever you enter this relaxed meditation state, you will mentally say, every day, in every way, I’m getting better and better. When you say these words, sense yourself improving in all areas of your life. Sense yourself getting better and better. Visualize improvements in your life now. as you mentally repeat the words. Every day, in every way, I’m getting better and better. Relax. Relax now and direct your attention to your eyes. Relax your eyes. Now direct your attention to your lips and your jaw. Relax your lips and jaw. Relax your entire head and relax your neck. That’s fine. Now relax your shoulders. Relax your arms and your hands. Relax the upper part of your body, your chest, your back. And now your stomach and the small of your back. Relax your thighs. Relax your legs and your feet. Relaxed. Repeat mentally. My body rests and refreshes itself when I consciously relax. I am relaxed now. Repeat mentally after me. Every day, my image of myself gets better. I can do anything I have a desire to do. I am a wonderful, unique human being. There’s no one else on earth exactly like me. Every day I grow stronger knowing that I can. I can think. I can create. I can do. I can do anything I have a desire. to do. Relax. Imagine now that you’re sitting and that there is a white velvet curtain in front of you. Next to you is a box filled with black numbers. The numbers are from 1 to 10. In a moment, you’ll reach into the box and remove a number. The number that you reach will be in sequence. You don’t have to be concerned. At first, when you reach into the box, your hand will pull out the number 10. And then you will take the number 10 and lay it on the white velvet curtain. The number will stick. And then you’ll reach into the box and take out the number 9 and put it on the curtain. And that number will stick to the curtain. and then the number eight, and so on until you’ve taken each of the ten numbers out of the box and placed them on the velvet curtain in front of you. The numbers are made so that they will stick on the velvet curtain. Now then, take the black numbers out of the box one at a time and hang them all on the white velvet curtain. starting with the number 10, and continue until you reach the number 1. Begin. If you’ve not yet reached the number one, imagine that all the ten numbers are on the velvet curtain. Relax. And now, remove the numbers one at a time, starting with the number ten. Reach up to the number ten, take it off the curtain, and put it back in the box. Now the number nine. Now the number eight. Now the number seven. Back in the box. Now the number six. Now the number five. Now the number four. Now the number three. Now the number two. And there’s one number left on the curtain. Now reach up and take the number one and put that in the box. Now allow the velvet curtain and the box to disappear from the scene. Very good. You are now at a deeper. more concentrative level of mind. And now then, as I use the mantra OM, you mentally will follow along with me. Each OM will take you deeper into the meditation and you’ll be more concentrative so that the programming that you will be doing is more likely to be successful. Relax. Just follow along with me mentally. Imagine now the moon. Visualize the great moon that is between the earth and the sun. Imagine the pull of the moon. Imagine the tides of the ocean driving the water higher as the new moon’s gravitational pull attracts. This pull will enhance all of your programming. especially that program that we will now be doing. Think about the program. Think about what you want to come to be, what it is that you’d like to attract or perhaps repel. Think about that now. Relax. Now imagine the full moon, for now it will be the full moon. Imagine the reflected light of the full moon brightening the entire scene that you’re imagining. Imagine this entire scene is bathed in the light of the moon. Allow the light of the full moon to permeate the entire scene. As you visualize the full moon, imagine that you’re basking in the light of the full moon. As you sense the light of the moon, permeating you, surrounding you. Mentally say, I want $5 ,000 or whatever amount that you want. Allow me to attract it. Then visualize yourself with the money and spending the money. Money is not the end, but a means to the end. What is it that you want to do with the money? Visualize the thing or things you want to buy with the money. You are sensing the full moon’s reflection on the mental level. And now you’re going to send out your programming message on the physical level, where the new moon is pulling at its strongest. To do this, imagine your entire program, the amount of money you want, and you mentally saying, I want, and then mention whatever the amount is. And then imagine that you fling the thought out into the universe. The general idea of this is that with the help of the pull of the new moon’s attraction, the energy of your thought will leave you and permeate the universe. Very well. At this time, I will count from one to three. At the count of three, visualize the full moon. Imagine bathing in its light. And then mentally… State the amount of money that you want, that you’re programming for, and see yourself with that amount of money. I will now count. One, two, three. Begin. Take your time. Relax. I will allow you plenty of time. Whenever you think of the money that you’re programming for, think of the event as already accomplished. Every morning when you think of your goal, repeat the phrase. Every day, in every way, I’m getting better and better. You may program for your goal at any time, but be sure to program during every new moon. That way you get the physical attraction of the new moon and the metaphysical attraction of the full moon. Relax. In a moment, I will count from one to five. Better than before. One, two, three, coming out slowly. Four and five. Eyes open, wide awake, feeling relaxed and comfortable. You are feeling better than before.

Audio Module 7: The Power of the Super Moon
--------------------

Part 3, Module 7. So far we’ve utilized the best of the scientific world of physics to gain the strength of the new moon, and now we get into the world of quantum physics to utilize the strength of the moon of a different earth, a different world, a different universe, a different dimension. In the world of quantum physics, where anything is not only possible, but a certainty due to the magic, of infinity. To put it in a nutshell, the quantum physicists tell us that in an infinite greater universe that there are other universes, an endless number of universes with galaxies, solar systems, and planets beyond counting. Take all the grains of sand on all the beaches on Earth and multiply that number by a million or a trillion. And you would not even begin to have the number of universes in a greater universe that was infinite. As a matter of fact, the physicists insist that whatever you can imagine is in one of those universes. There are countless yous, duplicate selves of you in those other places. One of you is a king. another a queen, another a billionaire, another homeless. The countless number of yous or selves in that world of infinity contain artist yous, musician yous, politician yous, and every other you that can be imagined. During our quantum jumping course, we tap into those other selves to bring back their energy, their rhythm. We bring it back for talents that we want. Well, for now, we’re not going to address these other selves, but rather the solar system that closely corresponds to ours, except for one thing. The moon on that other solar system in that other dimension is larger than ours is, much larger. The moon in that other solar system is double the size of the moon in our system. Being larger, it has more mass. More mass means more attraction, more drawing power, more of that power to attract that we’re looking for. In an infinity of universes, there are solar systems yet to be developed. There are some already in their prime, contracting, expanding, and all other possibilities that can be conceived. There are duplicate universes exactly like this one that we’re in at present, except the time element is different. In an infinity of universes, every conceivable time period from the Big Bang of our expanding universe to the ultimate snapback of a crashing universe is happening now. That is the concept of quantum jumping, and we’re going to utilize this concept on the metaphysical plane rather than the physical. Here is where we leave the world of physics and enter the world of metaphysics, or beyond physics. For this employment of the moon, you once again utilize the power of your mind, but this time you enhance the pull of the new moon many times. by bringing in the power of an alternate universe moon. Now, this is going to no doubt stretch credibility and batter at the wall of your belief system. I’m going to ask you to imagine the world where the moon is twice the size of the moon revolving around our planet. And you may well ask, and rightly so, how can I believe that? Well, before I answer that, let me explain just what… belief is. A belief is mental acceptance of something as being true. Long ago, I adopted the premise of what you believe to be is, and I even wrote a book titled How to Better Your Life with Mind Control, the first sentence of which are those six words, what you believe to be is. Allow me to go further into this, and then we’ll see how it relates to new moon programming. A belief is mental acceptance of something as being true. That acceptance can be based on trust for an authority, on reason, or on prejudice. A belief can also be a thing that has been programmed or conditioned by outside agencies so that the acceptance is not supported by reason. but it’s acted on nevertheless as though the thing were totally reliable. A belief system is a series of frames of reference by which an individual lives accepting information that reinforces beliefs and rejecting information that conflicts. There have been cases of multiple personality where medical people have found that it isn’t uncommon for one of the multiples of that person to have diabetes, say, and a second or third personality of the same person who displays a normal production of insulin and blood sugar, showing no signs of the disease at all when that multiple comes out. Another case noted is that of a personality, say personality number one, who had a case of the flu with all the symptoms. difficulty in breathing, congested chest, running nose, laryngitis, so on. When personality number two came out, all the symptoms disappeared in about six seconds. No congestion, no running nose, no symptoms of the flu. Same body, two different beliefs. Consider the implications of that. If your mind can clear the flu from your body in six seconds, if your mind can normalize your blood sugar in six seconds, then your mind can free your body of virtually all problems. All you have to do is learn how to control it. Central to that control is an understanding and control of your belief system. Now then, what does that have to do with new moon programming? Well, one of the difficulties that people have with a unique program such as this, a program that defies logic, is one of belief. How do you get the belief that a moon in another world, twice the size of this one, in a world that’s the exact replica or duplicate of this one, how do you accept the fact that it’s believable? Well, first of all, with the trillions of stars in our universe, logically, it would be beyond belief if there weren’t billions of solar systems similar to our own. And with that many solar systems, it would also be logical that there will be larger moons on our own. Mathematically, it does make sense. And that’s in our universe alone. When you add an additional trillions and quadrillions of alternate universes, it’s impossible to believe that there aren’t duplicate worlds out there. That part is definitely believable. Where we bump into belief systems… is you tapping into that alternate universe with the moon that’s twice the size of our old moon. Ah, but that’s where your mind… comes into play, because this is all going to be mental. But what about belief? And you can ask that. Aha, that’s the question. What about belief? Well, I’m not going to ask you to believe it, only to do it. To do the meditation and act as if it was so. That’s it. When you do the meditation on the module following the next one, just act as though it were an exercise that will indeed bring you the thing that you’re programming for because of the enormous pull of that supersized moon. Now, I’m going to explain exactly how to do that during the next module, but for now, just act as if it were so. After all, people act as if things that are unbelievable for some people are perfectly acceptable for them all the time. Just look at the many people who challenge the concept of evolution. In spite of all the scientific evidence, they act as though there were no such thing as evolution, and the world began thousands of years ago, not billions. People have all kinds of beliefs, and they’re correct in their beliefs. Correct, that is, for them, but not necessarily for you. Once again, what you believe to be is for you. So, for the alternate universe supermoon… And it will be at the new moon stage for the most effect. Just go through the meditation. Don’t question it. Just do it. But before we get to the actual meditation, let’s go through the process as this meditation is a bit different than you’re used to doing. With the supermoon meditation, you’re going to get out of the bubble of our universe. The only way possible. With the current state of our technology, there’s only one way that we know of to do it, and that is using your mind to do so. Picture our universe as a bubble floating in a world of universe bubbles. Large bubbles, small bubbles, all sizes of bubbles. Bubbles as far as your imagination can take you. And inside of each bubble, a universe. And our universe is in one of those bubbles. A bubble in a vast ocean of bubbles. Incidentally, this is a concept that is currently held by a number of highly intelligent quantum physicists. Because we’re in a bubble, there’s no way to get out, except with the mind. You can think yourself out of our bubble and into another one very easily. Your mind can do anything. You can think yourself anywhere. As an example, think now about your bedroom. Or if you’re in your bedroom, think about your kitchen. When you do that, you have visited that other world mentally. Quickly. Just took a second. Not even. Now think about a person who’s far away from you, perhaps in another country. Think about a fictional character. See there? You can move your mind around anywhere and belief never enters into it. You just do it. That is how you’re going to reach this alternate universe with its super moon. And that’s how you’re going to get a positive effect from that reaching out mentally. Once you get the hang of reaching out mentally beyond the bubble, you can connect with any place or any person you wish. For now, during this meditation that’s coming up soon, you’ll simply be reaching a duplicate planet, exactly like our own, in every respect, including the people, and of course yourself as well. The only difference in this duplicate planet will be the moon. The moon there is a super moon with super attracting powers. And those powers of attraction will help you to get the message that you are sending out to the universe of the things that you’re programming for, the things that you want. In the next module, I’ll be very specific as to how to reach this alternate universe and to bring back to this one. the power to reach every person on earth who can be of service to you in accomplishing the things that you want and the things that you’re programming for.

Audio Module 8: Harnessing the Power of the Super Moon
--------------------

Part 3, Module 8. Jerry Goldsmith is a friend of mine. When I told him about his business of using the power of the supermoon in an alternate universe to help him to achieve success in his business, he laughed. And then I asked him to suspend his belief and just act as if the supermoon actually had the power to help him. That is, if he used it at the right time. I told him it didn’t matter if he was skeptical. Being a skeptic put him in a place of neutrality with respect to his emotions, and that was a good place to be when programming for a goal to take place. Actually, I prefer it when a student doesn’t feel as though the programming is the most important thing in the world. Be skeptical, so long as he does it. Do it. That’s the important thing. Now, Jerry had been through a number of my seminars, and he programmed all the time, not only for business, but his family, relationships, health, and a lot of other things. And he was happy with his life, but like a lot of people, he wanted more. He may have laughed at the concept of using the power of a supermoon in an alternate universe, but he couldn’t wait to test it out. He did understand that a moon that was double the size of our moon would have an immense mass, and the difference between that moon and ours would have a significant effect on programming, if one could only get to it. And here I was, showing him how. Now, Jerry worked for the city. He had a job as a parole official dealing with released prisoners who were still out on parole, and he overseed them. He wanted to do something else after eight years on the job, and he thought he’d like to own a beauty shop. He didn’t know anything about the business, but he figured he could hire people who did. Well, anyway, that was his goal. Well, fine. I always like it better when a person has a definite and specific goal in mind. I don’t know why he wanted a beauty shop, but that wasn’t important. It was something that he wanted. Now, wanting to program at the best time, we waited for the next new moon, which came about on a Thursday at one o’clock in the morning. I asked Jerry to meet me at eight o’clock, 8 p.m. on Wednesday night. That was five hours before the height of the new moon. We met at my office and Jerry was ready. I wanted as much information as I could get as the process and hopefully Jerry’s success would be in the book that I was going to write about using the supermoon. Now, the moon was new at the time. Jerry knew what he wanted, and he was in a deep meditation after a few minutes. I asked if he was ready. He was comfortable. He just kind of mumbled a grunt. Well, that was good. He was meditating. I told him to relax a little more, and in a moment that I would count from one to three, just to go along with what I said. At the count of three, he would find himself in another dimension, another universe. And just imagine that. A universe where the moon was also a new moon, but that in that dimension, the moon was twice as large as our moon. It was a super moon. Well, I counted and Jerry relaxed even more. I told him to nod when he was there, where, wherever he felt he was deep in meditation. And after a few moments, he nodded. And later he told me that he felt the larger pull. It was almost as if his hair was being pulled slightly. That’s how strong the pull was. Well, good. That was good. I then had Jerry visualize his goal accomplished, the end result of his programming. And here was one of the important parts. He imagined himself getting money from his manager. He saw himself making deposits at the bank. He imagined people happy with the service he was supplying. And with each visualization, he imagined a gigantic moon in the sky. He saw the moon as a supermagnet pulling all things on Earth towards it, the moon. He imagined that things were floating off the Earth towards the moon. He imagined his imagery as an energy form floating out and away from him into the universe. He imagined that every person on earth would feel this energy and be affected by it and was permeated by it like a blanket of energy over the earth. Now, most people would not even know that the energy of his program was getting to them. But those who could be of service to him would be affected in a positive manner. That was basically the premise. I’ll go through the method in a moment, but the end result of the story is that Jerry now has a successful beauty shop in Indio, a suburb of greater Palm Springs. It’s quite a stretch to go from parole officer to beautician shop, but hey, that’s what he wanted, and it came to him in a series of coincidences. Jerry loved basketball and went to every game played in Los Angeles that he could afford. Programming, he was cheering on the Lakers, and a person sitting nearby got to talking to him about the game. Well, one thing led to another. After the game, they went out for a slice of pizza and a drink. It turned out that the fellow Jerry met owned a number of beauty salons, and Jerry said he was interested in getting into the business. Well, the rest of the story could make an entire chapter, if not a whole book, because with the help of Frank, the man he had met, Jerry bought the shop in Indio, and the last I heard was very successful. And where he had dreaded Monday mornings, he now looked forward to them. Now, you might say that it was just a coincidence. And you’d be right. But that’s what New Moon programming is all about. You know, I should say that that’s what all programming is all about. Setting up these series of coincidences for a desired conclusion. That desired conclusion is what you’re programming for. The basic difference between this meditation and all the others is the quantum jump, which is necessary to get to the place of this massive, this double size, this super moon. If you’ve already gone through the course, the quantum jumping course, and are already a quantum jumper, you can skip the next few minutes and get right on to the meditation. If you’ve not been quantum jumping, then this is specifically for you. Here’s how you get to the universe and the planet with the supermoon and its satellite. When you listen to the following module, just go along with it. However, when you’re doing it by yourself, here’s how to take your first jump. You go to your meditation level. And when you’re totally relaxed, imagine that you’re in a small hallway with a large door at one end of the hall. Now, it’s your visualization, and so you make the hallway however you like. You’re totally in control of this. It can be decorated. It can be plain. The color is one of your choosing. Make the door elaborate and concentrate on the hallway. You want carpet on the floor? Put a carpet on the floor. It’s your construction, your mental construction. Your intent is to go through the door at the end of the hall. And then the other side of that door is the dimension in the universe that you’re looking for. That’s your intent. And that makes the act automatic. When you feel like you want to jump into another dimension, imagine going to the door, opening it, and either stepping or jumping through. If you want to float through, do that. You’re in control. It’s your mental creation. On the other side of the door is the dimension that you’re looking for, the one with the supersized moon. It will be the time of the new moon because that is what you want the time to be. That is the dimension you’re going to. Whatever you want with respect to visualization, it will be. It’s your image-making faculty, your imagination that is doing it. You are in control. When you’re on the other side, imagine making yourself comfortable and programming for the thing you want. After the programming process, come back to the hallway, and when you’re ready to come out of the meditation, just squeeze your eyelids together and relax them, and they will just pop open. In the next module, just relax and make yourself comfortable, and I will help you to get to the dimension of the supermoon with a lunar meditation based on quantum jumping. So for now, relax and get ready for the next module, which will be module nine.

--------------------
Audio Module 9: Lunar Meditation Exercise: Entering the Dimension of the Super Moon
--------------------

Part 3, Module 9, Quantum Jumping Luna Meditation. At this time, relax. We’ll start with a 3 to 1 count. And this module, of course, is not to be played in a moving vehicle. This is a meditation exercise. Find a comfortable position. Close your eyes. Take a deep breath. And as you exhale, mentally repeat and visualize the number three three times. Take another deep breath, and as you exhale, mentally repeat and visualize the number two three times. Take another deep breath, and as you exhale, mentally repeat and visualize the number one. Three times. To help you to enter a deeper, a more relaxed level of mind, I’m going to count from ten to one. On each descending number, feel yourself going inward, and you will enter a pleasant, a relaxed level of mind where you’ll be able to concentrate fully on one subject. Ten. Nine. Feel going deeper. Eight. Seven. Six. Feel going deeper and deeper. Five. Four. Three. Deeper and deeper. Two. One. You are now at a pleasant, relaxed level of mind where you’re able to concentrate fully on one subject. At this time, concentrate on my words. You are now and always in complete control of your state of mind. You can open your eyes. You can be fully alert anytime you wish to be. Every time you enter this relaxed meditation state, know that you’re getting better and better in every way. Whenever you enter this relaxed meditation state, you will mentally say, every day, in every way, I’m getting better and better. When you say these words, sense yourself improving in all areas of your life. Sense yourself getting better and better. Visualize improvements in your life now as you mentally repeat the words. Every day, in every way, I’m getting better and better. Relax. Relax now and direct your attention to your eyes. Relax your eyes. Now direct your attention to your lips and your jaw. Relax your lips and jaw. Relax your entire head and relax your neck. That’s fine. Now relax your shoulders. Relax your arms and your hands. Relax the upper part of your body, your chest, your back. And now your stomach and the small of your back. Relax your thighs. Relax your legs and your feet. Relaxed. Repeat mentally. My body rests and refreshes itself when I consciously relax. I am relaxed now. Repeat mentally after me. Every day, my image of myself gets better. I can do anything I have a desire to do. I am a wonderful, unique human being. There’s no one else on earth exactly like me. Every day I grow stronger knowing that I can. I can think. I can create. I can do. I can do anything I have a desire to do. Relax. Imagine now that you’re sitting and that there is a white velvet curtain in front of you. Next to you is a box filled with black numbers. The numbers are from 1 to 10. In a moment, you’ll reach into the box and remove a number. The number that you reach will be in sequence. You don’t have to be concerned. At first, when you reach into the box, your hand will pull out the number 10. And then you will take the number 10 and lay it on the white velvet curtain. The number will stick. And then you’ll reach into the box and take out the number 9 and put it on the curtain. And that number will stick to the curtain. And then the number eight, and so on until you’ve taken each of the ten numbers out of the box and placed them on the velvet curtain in front of you. The numbers are made so that they will stick on the velvet curtain. Now then, take the black numbers out of the box one at a time and hang them all on the white velvet curtain, starting with the number 10, and continue until you reach the number 1. Begin. If you’ve not yet reached the number one, imagine that all the ten numbers are on the velvet curtain. Relax. And now, remove the numbers one at a time, starting with the number ten. Reach up to the number ten, take it off the curtain, and put it back in the box. Now the number nine. Now the number eight. Now the number seven. Back in the box. Now the number six. Now the number five. Now the number four. Now the number three. Now the number two. And there’s one number left on the curtain. Now reach up and take the number one and put that in the box. Now allow the velvet curtain and the box to disappear from the scene. Very good. You are now at a deeper, more concentrative level of mind. And now then, as I use the mantra OM, you mentally will follow along with me. Each OM will take you deeper into the meditation and you’ll be more concentrative so that the programming that you will be doing is more likely to be successful. Relax. Just follow along with me mentally. Imagine now the moon. Visualize the great moon that is between the earth and the sun. Imagine the pull of the moon. Imagine the tides of the ocean driving the water higher as the new moon’s gravitational pull attracts. This pull will enhance all of your programming, especially that program that we will now be doing. Think about the program. Think about what you want to come to be, what it is that you’d like to attract or perhaps repel. Think about that now. Relax. Imagine the full moon, for now it will be the full moon. Imagine the reflected light of the full moon brightening the entire scene. Imagine the scene that you are visualizing is bathed in the light of the moon. Allow the light of the full moon to permeate the entire scene. As you visualize the full moon, imagine that you’re basking in the light of the full moon. As you sense the light of the moon permeating you, mentally say, I want to go to a parallel universe where everything is the same as it is here, except that the moon in that universe is twice the size of the moon in this universe and has twice the gravitational pull of all things on earth, both physical and physical. Now use your great imagination. Imagine that you’re in a small hallway. Imagine a door at the end of the hallway. And when you open the door and step through, you will be in a parallel universe. It will appear that you’re in the same room you’re in now, as it’s a duplicate world in every sense, with the exception of there being a super moon. A moon double the size of our moon on that other world. That moon has a superior attraction. And all the things that you send out through your mental imagery are doubly enhanced. It’s your visualization. And so you make the hallway however you like. It can be decorated or plain. The color of the walls is one of your choosing. Make the door elaborate and concentrate on the hallway. Your intent is to walk through the hallway, reach the door, go through the door, and on the other side of the door is the dimension and the universe that you’re looking for. That’s your intent. That makes the act automatic. When you feel like you want to jump into another dimension, imagine going to the door, opening it, and stepping or jumping through. On the other side of the door is the dimension that you’re looking for, the one with the supersized moon. It will be the time of the supersized new moon, because that is what you want the time to be. Whatever you want with respect to visualizations will be. It’s your image-making faculty, your imagination that’s doing it. I’m going to count from one to three, and to count to three, you will imagine that you’re opening the door and stepping through into the exact same place that you’re in now, except that you’ll be in a parallel universe with a supersized moon. One, two, three. Open the door, step through the door, and sit exactly as you’re now seated. You’re now in a parallel universe with a supersized moon. Imagine it. Act as if it were so. Know now that you are there. You are in this parallel universe because you want something. Maybe money you want. Maybe a relationship. Be friends it may be to resolve a health issue it may be to bring out and enhance a hidden talent whatever it is that you want think about that now. You’ve taken a quantum jump through the doorway now it’s time to meet your twin self your doppelganger who has all the things that you want your twin self in the parallel dimension will help you to get the things that you do want I’m going to count from one to five. At the count of five, your twin self will appear. The self of the parallel universe who has the things that you want. Talk to your twin self if you like and then merge with your twin self. The merger will enable you to bring back your twin self’s rhythm and some of the energy of that self back. One, two, three. Four and five. Your twin self has arrived. Greet your twin self. Use your great imagination. What would you expect your twin self to be like? What would you expect your twin self to say to you? How would you expect your twin self to help you? Relax. Take your time. And now it’s time to program. There’s a new moon in both universes, both dimensions, but the parallel has a supersized moon with a much larger pull. Visualize the things that you want, the things your twin self already has. And after visualizing, imagine the thoughts floating out and away from you, affecting all people on the parallel universe, affecting all people in this universe. Do it now. Visualize the things that you want. Imagine yourself having them. Whenever you think of the things that you’re programming for, think of the event as already accomplished. Every morning when you think of your goal, repeat the phrase, Every day, in every way, I’m getting better and better. You may program for your goal at any time, but be sure to program during every new moon. That way you get the physical attraction of the new moon and the metaphysical attraction of the full moon relax in a moment i’m going to count from one to five at that moment you’ll open your eyes be wide awake feeling better than before relaxed and comfortable one two three coming out slowly four and five eyes open wide awake feeling relaxed and comfortable feeling better than before

Audio Module 10: Quitting Bad Habits
--------------------

Bonus number one, to quit bad habits. At this time, relax. We’ll start with a three to one count. And this module, of course, is not to be played in a moving vehicle. This is a meditation exercise. Find a comfortable position. Close your eyes. Take a deep breath. And as you exhale, mentally repeat and visualize the number three three times. Take another deep breath, and as you exhale, mentally repeat and visualize the number two three times. Take another deep breath, and as you exhale, mentally repeat and visualize the number one. Three times. To help you to enter a deeper, a more relaxed level of mind, I’m going to count from ten to one. On each descending number, feel yourself going inward, and you will enter a pleasant, a relaxed level of mind where you’ll be able to concentrate fully on one subject. Ten. Nine. Feel going deeper. Eight. Seven. Six. Feel going deeper and deeper. Five. Four. Three. Deeper and deeper. Two. One. You are now at a pleasant, relaxed level of mind where you’re able to concentrate fully on one subject. At this time, concentrate on my words. You are now and always in complete control of your state of mind. You can open your eyes. You can be fully alert anytime you wish to be. Every time you enter this relaxed meditation state, know that you’re getting better and better in every way. Whenever you enter this relaxed meditation state, you will mentally say, every day, in every way, I’m getting better and better. When you say these words, sense yourself improving in all areas of your life. Sense yourself getting better and better. Visualize improvements in your life now as you mentally repeat the words. Every day, in every way, I’m getting better and better. Relax. Relax now and direct your attention to your eyes. Relax your eyes. Now direct your attention to your lips and your jaw. Relax your lips and jaw. Relax your entire head and relax your neck. That’s fine. Now relax your shoulders. Relax your arms and your hands. Relax the upper part of your body, your chest, your back. And now your stomach and the small of your back. Relax your thighs. Relax your legs and your feet. Relaxed. Repeat mentally. My body rests and refreshes itself when I consciously relax. I am relaxed now. Repeat mentally after me. Every day, my image of myself gets better. I can do anything I have a desire to do. I am a wonderful, unique human being. There’s no one else on earth exactly like me. Every day I grow stronger knowing that I can. I can think. I can create. I can do. I can do anything. I have a desire. to do. Relax. Imagine now that you’re sitting and that there is a white velvet curtain in front of you. Next to you is a box filled with black numbers. The numbers are from 1 to 10. In a moment, you’ll reach into the box and remove a number. The number that you reach will be in sequence. You don’t have to be concerned. At first, when you reach into the box, your hand will pull out the number 10. And then you will take the number 10 and lay it on the white velvet curtain. The number will stick. And then you’ll reach into the box and take out the number 9 and put it on the curtain. And that number will stick to the curtain. And then the number eight, and so on until you’ve taken each of the ten numbers out of the box and placed them on the velvet curtain in front of you. The numbers are made so that they will stick on the velvet curtain. Now then, take the black numbers out of the box one at a time and hang them all on the white velvet curtain. starting with the number 10, and continue until you reach the number 1. Begin. If you’ve not yet reached the number one, imagine that all the ten numbers are on the velvet curtain. Relax. And now, remove the numbers one at a time, starting with the number ten. Reach up to the number ten, take it off the curtain, and put it back in the box. Now the number nine. Now the number eight. Now the number seven. Back in the box. Now the number six. Now the number five. Now the number four. Now the number three. Now the number two. And there’s one number left on the curtain. Now reach up and take the number one and put that in the box. Now allow the velvet curtain and the box to disappear from the scene. Very good. You are now at a deeper. more concentrative level of mind. And now then, as I use the mantra OM, you mentally will follow along with me. Each OM will take you deeper into the meditation and you’ll be more concentrative so that the programming that you will be doing is more likely to be successful. Relax. Just follow along with me mentally. Imagine now the moon. Visualize the great moon that is between the earth and the sun. Imagine the pull of the moon. Imagine the tides of the ocean driving the water higher as the new moon’s gravitational pull attracts. This pull will enhance all of your programming. especially that program that we will now be doing. Think about the program. Think about what you want to come to be, what it is that you’d like to attract or perhaps repel. Think about that now. Relax. You have a habit that you’d like to break, to quit, to rid yourself of. Ask yourself this question regarding the habit. What would my life be like if I no longer had this particular habit? After asking yourself this question, imagine a you and your life without having the habit. See yourself in different situations. You no longer have the habit. It’s no longer a part of your life. Imagine that. Imagine how different your life would be. Create mentally a different situation. Every time you do this meditation regarding the habit that you’re eliminating, each time you create a different situation, imagine your life without the habit. Hear people talking about the new you and sense how you yourself feel. about your life without the habit. Relax. Imagine a scene where you are with other people, but no longer have a compulsion for the habit that you’re looking to get rid of. And note how your life has changed for the better. Do that now. Imagine that scene where you’re with other people but no longer have a compulsion for that habit that you’re looking to get rid of. Take your time. Begin. That’s fine. Now, at this time, we’re going to establish a mental trash can so that you can throw all thoughts of your former habit into it, into your mental trash can. Whenever you have an urge to repeat a habit, imagine it, picture it, create a mental image of the habit, and then imagine that it’s being thrown into your trash can. Your personal trash can is low down in your mind, low on the right side, around ankle height. I’m going to count from one to three, and at the count of three, you will have created a trash can. This trash can will be low and to the right of your ankles. One, two, three. Create your trash can. Your trash can is low around ankle height, and it’s a mental trash can. Do it. Know that it is there for you to use. Now think about the habit that you’re ridding yourself of. Imagine the habit, and then imagine that you’re throwing it into your mental trash can. Good. Whenever you have an urge to go back to the former habit, throw it into your mental trash can. Relax. In a moment, I’m going to count from one to three. At the count of three, you’ll open your eyes. You’ll be wide awake, feeling better than before, with a positive outlook forevermore. One, two, three. Eyes open, wide awake, feeling better than before.

This pull will enhance all of your programming, especially that program that we will now be doing. Think about the program. Think about what you want to come to be. What it is that you’d like to attract or perhaps repel. Think about that now. Relax. Wisdom is having the knowledge and experience needed to make sensible decisions and judgments. Wisdom is a matter of choices. Wisdom is making a choice that you personally will be happy and satisfied with at a future time. Before making a choice, especially a major choice, think how that choice will affect your life. What will your life be like if you made a different choice? Think about the consequences of that choice. Think about the future. Consider the future. A wise person, a person with wisdom, sees what could be, whereas a simpler person simply sees what is. The road to wisdom is seeing and understanding the choices that you make every day. Tonight. just prior to going to sleep. In your mind, mentally go over the day and consider all the things that you did. Is there anything that you did that you’re sorry about? Are there things that you did that you would have done differently after having thought about them? Go over your entire day. When you come to something that you would have done differently had you given the matter more thought, then you’re well on the way to wisdom. Every evening, just prior to sleep, think about the things you did or you didn’t do that day. If anything comes up that you would have preferred to have done differently or that you believe you should have done differently, that you should have made a different choice, then think about the you that would have been had you made that choice. Do that now while you’re in the meditation state. Think about the day. Or if it’s still early, think about yesterday. What did you do yesterday that now that you think about it, you would have done differently? You would have perhaps made a different choice in the thing that you said or the thing that you did. Do that now. Think about yesterday. Go over your day. And what is it that you can think of that you would have done differently? Had you given it some time and thought about the consequences? Take your time and begin. Relax. Now continue to do this every evening. Do it every evening, every night for 10 days. And see how much your life will change for the better. Wisdom is the application of knowledge that is so necessary to live a good life. You’re well on the road to a wiser, more confident you. Relax. In a moment, I’m going to count from one to three. At the count of three, you’ll open your eyes. You’ll be wide awake, feeling better than before, with a positive attitude forever. and a more confident, wiser you. One, two, three. Eyes open, wide awake.

Get a sense that the job you want has just come to you, and you’re working at it. What kind of a job do you wish to attract? Relax your eyes. Relax your head and your neck. As you relax, create an image of the moon. As you relax, powerful energies are mingling with yours, and so it is important. that you now create a mental image of yourself already working at the job that you desire, the job that you want. Make use of that daydream mechanism of yours and sense yourself with the job of your dreams. See yourself on the job, doing your best. Every day you determine to do better than you did the day before. This will set your energy flow and your rhythm. And as your mind has the attraction energy of the moon to help it to grow and to send out the message of attraction, it is more likely to happen. The moon’s energies will intermingle with your energies. And the result is a stronger attraction for that perfect job that you’re looking for. It will help if you imagine how you would be sitting, what you would be wearing, who you would be with if you had the job of your dreams. Take a deep breath, relax, and enjoy the visualizations that you create, the daydream visualizations that you create of you involved with the job of your dreams. Begin. Take your time. Tomorrow, do something that will bring that goal forward. It may be a minor thing. It may be a major thing. It may be a phone call. It may be an email. It may be a letter. It may be you seeing someone. Whatever it is, begin tomorrow. Determine that tomorrow you will do something to further your goal. of finding your dream job. Tomorrow, you will plant the seed that will sprout and grow into the job of your dreams. Relax. Think about what you could do tomorrow. Set that in your mind now. And tomorrow, do it. Relax. In a moment, I’m going to count from one to three. At the count of three, you will open your eyes. Be wide awake, feeling better than before, with a positive outlook for that dream job of yours. One, two, three. Eyes open, wide awake.

Imagine the tides of the ocean driving the water higher as the new moon’s gravitational pull attracts. This pull will enhance all of your programming. especially that program that we will now be doing. Think about the program. Think about what you want to come to be, what it is that you’d like to attract or perhaps repel. Think about that now and relax. You want to think about reducing weight from this day forward. You are no longer a slave to high -calorie foods. Food is fuel for the body. Yes, you get a certain satisfaction from the tasty foods that you eat, but primarily you will now eat for energy and to maintain good health. You recognize that there are foods that are low in calories, and there are foods like junk foods that are high in calories. From now on, you will be attracted to foods that are low in calories and foods that you know are good for your body. Foods such as fresh vegetables, grains, and fish as well as low -fat meats. Food is for energy and to maintain good health. Repeat these words so that it becomes engraved in your inner conscious. I will eat to maintain health and to rid myself of any overweight condition I may have. Never again will I ever overeat. Moderation is the key. Whatever it was that attracted you to overeat is now gone. It might have been the taste of certain foods that make you want to overeat. Or it might have been that you needed extra weight for some subconscious reason. You might have felt stronger weighing more. It might have been because you felt it was wasteful to leave food. Or it might have been because you felt guilty about not eating what was in front of you. Whatever the reason, that reason no longer applies. You no longer have a need. to overeat. You now have new needs. Your new needs are to reduce your weight to what you consider your ideal weight and size. You will be satisfied with less food than you were formerly. A few bites and swallows of food will take away your desire to eat, and you will only eat what you consider to be necessary to maintain good health. From this day forward, you think about your health when eating. You think about how you would feel after eating what is in front of you. How you would feel an hour later. How you would feel the next day. And you will eat healthy foods. You will eat only the amount of food you consider necessary to maintain health. Relax. Health will be the issue, not weight. You will consider the calories in the food you eat and you will only eat the amount of calories that you have established for your good health and weight for each day. At this time, we’re going to establish a mental trash can so that you can throw all thoughts of high -calorie junk food into it. Whenever you have an urge to eat high -calorie food that you know is bad for you, Just think about the food and imagine it going into your trash can. Your personal trash can is low down in your mind on the right side about ankle height. I’m going to count from one to three. At the count of three. you will have created a trash can, low and to the right of your ankles. One, two, three. Create your trash can. Do it. Know that it is there for you to use. From now on, whenever a food that you have an urge for is bothering you, just imagine it going into your trash can. At this time, Imagine your favorite junk food created in your mind. And now imagine you’re throwing it into your trash can. Urge is gone. Use your trash can any time the thought of food bothers you. Now it’s time to program your refrigerator, your icebox, so to speak. Let’s call it an icebox. In your icebox, you will keep all the healthy foods. Now, you have to be careful with grains, as they are high -calorie foods. But then again, grains are healthy and good for you. Eat rice, wheat, buckwheat, oats, and all grains cautiously, but do eat them. Keep fresh vegetables, fruits, and lean meats and fish also in your icebox. Whenever you have an urge for junk food, pick something out of your icebox. Mentally, of course. and concentrate on that instead. Now it is time to create your icebox. Put it just above your left eyebrow, about that height in front of you. Say it’s above your left eyebrow height and a bit away from you at about the, oh, say the 10 o ‘clock position. I’m going to count from one to three, and at the count of three, you will have created an icebox to the left of and just… your left eyebrow position, about 10 o ‘clock height. One, two, three. Create your icebox. Do it. Know that it is there for you to use. From now on, whenever an urge for high calorie, unhealthy food comes to mind, throw it in your trash can and mentally pick out a healthy food from your icebox and concentrate on that. Health. will be what you consider. Not taste, not a full stomach, not crunch or sweetness. Health and ridding yourself of excess weight will be what you consider from now on. From now on, the fact that food is available will have no effect on you. Just because it’s available is no longer a trigger for you to eat that food. You no longer require junk foods. Your weight will reduce. until you reach your ideal size. Repeat these words so that it becomes engraved in your inner conscious. I will eat only to maintain health. I will eat only to maintain health. And never again will you ever overeat. Relax. In a moment, I’m going to count from one to three. At the count of three, you’ll open your eyes, you’ll be wide awake, feeling better than before, positive outlook for that new, more fit, healthier you. One, two, three. Eyes open, wide awake.

At first, when you reach into the box, your hand will pull out the number 10. And then you will take the number 10 and lay it on the white velvet curtain. The number will stick. And then you’ll reach into the box and take out the number 9 and put it on the curtain. And that number will stick to the curtain. And then the number eight and so on until you’ve taken each of the ten numbers out of the box and placed them on the velvet curtain in front of you. The numbers are made so that they will stick on the velvet curtain. Now then, take the black numbers out of the box one at a time and hang them all on the white velvet curtain. starting with the number 10, and continue until you reach the number 1. Begin. If you’ve not yet reached the number one, imagine that all the ten numbers are on the velvet curtain. Relax. And now, remove the numbers one at a time, starting with the number ten. Reach up to the number ten, take it off the curtain, and put it back in the box. Now the number nine. Now the number eight. Now the number seven. Back in the box. Now the number six. Now the number five. Now the number four. Now the number three. Now the number two. And there’s one number left on the curtain. Now reach up and take the number one and put that in the box. Now allow the velvet curtain and the box to disappear from the scene. Very good. You are now at a deeper. more concentrative level of mind. And now then, as I use the mantra OM, you mentally will follow along with me. Each OM will take you deeper into the meditation and you’ll be more concentrative so that the programming that you will be doing is more likely to be successful. Relax. Just follow along with me mentally. Imagine now the moon. Visualize the great moon that is between the earth and the sun. Imagine the pull of the moon. Imagine the tides of the ocean driving the water higher as the new moon’s gravitational pull attracts. This pull will enhance all of your programming, especially that program that we will now be doing. Think about the program. Think about what you want to come to be, what it is that you’d like to attract or perhaps repel. Think about that now and relax. At this time, your program is to get fit, to be healthier, stronger. So just relax and listen. Every word I say is going to be fixed and impressed in your mind. It will be engraved on your mind without your will or knowledge. And unconsciously, your inner conscious will obey. The words you are about to hear will be fixed in your mind. Every evening when you wish to go to sleep, until the time you wish to wake the next morning, you will sleep deeply. calmly and quietly, with pleasant and creative dreams, and on waking you will feel well, cheerful, and active. You’re going to feel perfectly cheerful, and you will look at the positive side of things. Things that used to worry, annoy, or irritate you will, from this time forward, leave you indifferent and calm. Your organs are performing their functions properly. Your heart beats in a normal way, and the circulation of the blood takes place as it should. Your lungs are carrying out their functions, as is your stomach, intestines, the liver, kidneys, gallbladder, and bladder. If at present any of your organs is acting abnormally, that abnormality is becoming less every day, so that quite soon it will have vanished completely. and the organ will have recovered its normal function. If there should be any lesions in any of these organs, they will get better from day to day and will soon be entirely healed. It is not necessary to know which organ is affected for it to be healed. Under the influence of the auto -suggestion, every day, in every way, I am getting better and better. The subconscious acts upon the organ which it can pick out for itself. You’re going to have confidence in yourself, and this confidence gives you the assurance that you are capable of accomplishing perfectly well whatever you wish to do, on condition that it is reasonable in whatever it is your duty to do. When you wish to do something, or when you have a duty to perform, you will think, That it is easy. And make the words difficult, impossible. I cannot. It is stronger than I. I cannot prevent myself from. Make those words disappear from your vocabulary. They are not your words. What are your words? Are it is easy. And I can. You will do it quickly and well and without fatigue. Because you do it without effort. You’re going to enjoy excellent health, and your attitude will be one of joy and vitality. You will look forward to a brighter and brighter future. Allow these words to lock into your mind. You have a new sense of confidence. You have a new sense of good health. Your body is now balanced, and your energy levels will grow. Every beneficial cell of your body is recharging and restoring itself. You will, more and more from this day forward, concentrate on the pleasures of life. You will find yourself wanting to play more, having fun, knowing that play will enhance your immune system and bring you better and better health. Under the influence of the words, every day in every way, my life gets better and better, you will find yourself getting more and more pleasure from the things that formerly… you pleasure and vitality. You will find more enthusiasm with the things that are pleasurable, and you will enjoy your life as things do get better and better. You begin to see that your attitude was at fault in the past, but now your attitude is that of a healer of all those things that afflicted you in the past. Your attitude is one of a positive nature. and you will see the good things in your life and pay little attention to the negative things. Your new mantra is, Every day, in every way, my life gets better and better. Repeat that now. Every day, in every way, my life gets better and better. Relax. In a moment, I’m going to count from one to three. At the count of three, you will open your eyes. You’ll be wide awake, feeling better than before, with a positive outlook forevermore. And from now on, every day, and in every way, your life will be getting better and better. Relax. I’m going to now count when your eyes open, a new you will be there. One, two, three. Eyes open, wide awake, and every day, and in every way, your life gets better and better.

Every time you enter this relaxed meditation state, know that you’re getting better and better in every way. Whenever you enter this relaxed meditation state, you will mentally say, every day, in every way, I’m getting better and better. When you say these words, sense yourself improving in all areas of your life. Sense yourself getting better and better. Visualize improvements in your life now. as you mentally repeat the words. Every day, in every way, I’m getting better and better. Relax. Relax now and direct your attention to your eyes. Relax your eyes. Now direct your attention to your lips and your jaw. Relax your lips and jaw. Relax your entire head and relax your neck. That’s fine. Now relax your shoulders. Relax your arms and your hands. Relax the upper part of your body, your chest, your back. And now your stomach and the small of your back. Relax your thighs. Relax your legs and your feet. You’re now completely… Relaxed. Repeat mentally. My body rests and refreshes itself when I consciously relax. I am relaxed now. Repeat mentally after me. Every day, my image of myself gets better. I can do anything I have a desire to do. I am a wonderful, unique human being. There’s no one else on earth exactly like me. Every day I grow stronger knowing that I can. I can think. I can create. I can do. I can do anything I have a desire. to do. Relax. Imagine now that you’re sitting and that there is a white velvet curtain in front of you. Next to you is a box filled with black numbers. The numbers are from 1 to 10. In a moment, you’ll reach into the box and remove a number. The number that you reach will be in sequence. You don’t have to be concerned. At first, when you reach into the box, your hand will pull out the number 10. And then you will take the number 10 and lay it on the white velvet curtain. The number will stick. And then you’ll reach into the box and take out the number 9 and put it on the curtain. And that number will stick to the curtain. and then the number eight, and so on until you’ve taken each of the ten numbers out of the box and placed them on the velvet curtain in front of you. The numbers are made so that they will stick on the velvet curtain. Now then, take the black numbers out of the box one at a time and hang them all on the white velvet curtain. starting with the number 10, and continue until you reach the number 1. Begin. If you’ve not yet reached the number one, imagine that all the ten numbers are on the velvet curtain. Relax. And now, remove the numbers one at a time, starting with the number ten. Reach up to the number ten, take it off the curtain, and put it back in the box. Now the number nine. Now the number eight. Now the number seven. Put it back in the box. Now the number six. Now the number five. Now the number four. Now the number three. Now the number two. And there’s one number left on the curtain. Now reach up and take the number one and put that in the box. Now allow the velvet curtain and the box to disappear from the scene. Very good. You are now at a deeper. more concentrative level of mind. And now then, as I use the mantra OM, you mentally will follow along with me. Each OM will take you deeper into the meditation and you’ll be more concentrative so that the programming that you will be doing is more likely to be successful. Relax. Just follow along with me mentally. Imagine now the moon. Visualize the great moon that is between the earth and the sun. Imagine the pull of the moon. Imagine the tides of the ocean driving the water higher as the new moon’s gravitational pull attracts. This pull will enhance all of your programming. especially that program that we will now be doing. Think about the program. Think about what you want to come to be, what it is that you’d like to attract or perhaps repel. Think about that now. Relax. Stress causes all kinds of problems in the mind and in the body. When the mind gets in the way of the body, the immune system is depleted and you are more likely to attract bad things like bad luck and ill health. Without stress, your blood flows evenly and much better through your circulatory system. Your food is digested easier and your general health is better as your immune system… has the ability to fight off the negative forces, like foreign viruses, as an example. Now, this meditation has been designed to specifically ward off stress of all kinds. The opposite of stress is relaxation. You cannot be stressful and relaxed at the same time. The secret to ridding yourself of stress is to relax. or a group of thoughts that are causing you stress, change the thought. First of all, before you can change it, you have to allow them in. Don’t try to force them out. Allow the stressful thoughts to come. And then, like a daydream. A daydream is a controlled thing. So when you’re daydreaming the stressful thoughts, Then you can change them to a positive setting because you are, after all, in control of your thoughts. Now, create a mental movie of a relaxed scene. Do that now. Something relaxed where you’re comfortable. And mentally play it in your mind as you relax. Relax now and go deeper. If there were a place on earth where you would be completely relaxed, Where would that place be? If you had your choice of, oh, say, the beach or the mountains or the desert or your backyard, any place on earth where you’d be completely comfortable and relaxed, where would that place be? Think about that place now. Imagine that place now. Take your time. I’ll allow you some time now. Imagine a place where you’re completely comfortable, completely relaxed. Your intention here is to relax. Allow my words to help you. Do this every day until it becomes routine and you no longer need these words. And now just think about the positive aspects of what previously have been of a negative nature. Metaphorically speaking, the only way to get dark out of a room is to let light in. You can’t sweep dark out. You can’t chase it out. But as soon as you let the light in, the dark disappears. As soon as you let relaxation into your house, stress disappears. So then when something bad comes up, daydream the opposite and imagine what your life would be like if the bad were polarized and you could see the good, the positive side. Relax. In a moment, I’m going to count from one to three. At the count of three, you will open your eyes. You’ll be wide awake, feeling better than before with a positive outlook for that new, that stress -free you. One, two, coming out slowly now. Three, eyes open, wide awake, feeling stress -free, feeling better than before.

Turn your thoughts to the person in particular who you would like to attract. Keep the image of that person in your mind as my words flow over you. As you listen, think about things flowing towards you. Imagine someone tossing a ball to you, and you catch it. Think about an automobile, a car coming towards you. Imagine the wind in your face. Think about things coming to you. Now think again of the image of the person you want to attract. Now just listen and concentrate on the words.

Think about what you want to come to be, what it is that you’d like to attract or perhaps repel. Think about that now. Relax. An important resource that everyone has and that is, for the most part, overlooked, and in some instances even looked down on, is the resource of daydreaming. Actually, everything in your imagination is brought out through your daydreaming mechanism. But most people are told, as children, that daydreaming is not good. It’s bad. Keeps you from concentration. Wool gathering, many call it. And those ideas are really far from the actuality. Daydreams, when controlled, lead to success. Daydreams unlock hidden talents. Daydreams control confidence and the ability to concentrate. When daydreams are controlled, that’s the key. You must control your daydreams. This meditation is to stimulate your daydreams, but daydreams that you consciously control for a beneficial outcome. Think now about something that you want, something that you want to set a goal for. And now daydream the end result. Give the daydream motion. Make it like a movie. You’re the writer. You’re the producer. You’re the director of this movie. It’s yours. You’re in control. But more importantly, you’re also the actor. Now, play out the scene two ways. One way as an observer, seeing yourself act out the end result of your goal accomplished. Daydream that you’re watching yourself complete the goal that you want to happen. Then daydream that you’re participating in the scene. Imagine that you are doing whatever it is that you would be doing if your goal had come to pass, if your goal had come to be. Your goal now has been accomplished. Imagine that. Sense it. Daydream it. Whenever you are confronted by a situation where other people are involved and you feel outclassed, create an image in your mind of yourself as a gigantic figure. And the other people is very small, diminutive in size. This mentally will create a giant and will enhance your confidence and your self -esteem. You’re going to have confidence in yourself. And this confidence gives you the assurance that you’re capable of accomplishing perfectly well whatever it is that you want to do on a condition that you feel is reasonable. and perhaps that it’s your duty to do. When you want to do something or when you have a duty to perform, think that it’s easy and make the words difficult, impossible. I cannot. It’s stronger than I. I cannot prevent myself. Make those words disappear from your vocabulary. They’re not your words. What are your words are it’s easy and I can. With those words, you’ll do it quickly and well and without fatigue because you do it without effort. Relax. In a moment, I’m going to count from one to three. Count to three. You’ll open your eyes. You’ll be wide awake, feeling better than before with a positive outlook for that new. confident self of yours. One, two, three. Eyes open, wide awake.

Imagine the tides of the ocean driving the water higher as the new moon’s gravitational pull attracts. This pull will enhance all of your programming, especially that program that we will now be doing. Think about the program. Think about what you want to come to be. What it is that you’d like to attract or perhaps repel. Think about that now. Relax. At this time, your program is to conceive a strong, healthy baby. This particular meditation should be used exclusively sometimes during the 24-hour period just prior to the new moon. Relax and go deeper into the meditation so that your mind is free of all outside thoughts. Concentrate on relaxing your head and your neck, relaxing your body, relax your arms and hands. Relax your legs and feet. Be completely relaxed. Now create a mental image of you lying next to your partner. You’re both ready, relaxed, and willing to create a baby. Imagine the light of the full moon is bathing you, bathing you both. This full moon is a mental creation of yours. The new moon is coming into its greatest physical attraction. And just as the new moon has an influence on a seed, a seed that’s been planted during the period of the new moon, so will the new moon have an influence on the seed that is planted during this period of your desire to create a new life. Relax. Imagine the reflected light of the full moon bathing you both. Now visualize a child, a newborn baby, in your arms, cooing in delight. Relax. Now that you’re totally relaxed, complete the act of conception. In a moment, I will count from one to three. At the count to three, you will open your eyes, be wide awake. Feeling a sense of desire with a positive outlook for your new child. After you awaken, complete the act of conception. One, two, three. Eyes open, wide awake. Relax. Now continue to do this every evening. Do it every evening, every night for ten days. Your life will change for the better. Wisdom is the application of knowledge that is so necessary to live a good life. You’re well on the road to a wiser, more confident you. Relax. In a moment, I’m going to count from one to three. At the count of three, you’ll open your eyes. You’ll be wide awake. feeling better than before, with a positive attitude forever. and a more confident, wiser you. One, two, three. Eyes open, wide awake.

Lesson 43: Past Life Regression
--------------------

Description

--------------------
Audio Module 1: Introduction to Past Life Regression
--------------------

Module 1. People often ask what, if any, are the benefits of past life therapy. To me, it’s obvious. First of all, there are healings to consider. And I don’t just mean the healing of an illness. I mean healing a relationship, finding answers, healing a business, healing motivation. In short, past life therapy may just be the answer to many of your problems. Because past life therapy, is one of the best tools to solve problems. Next would be money. People with money problems often find answers stem from a past life situation. You may have heard of past life therapy being a form of therapy that some hypnotists use to bring back memories of their former lives. Generally speaking, the hypnotist will put the person in a trance and then direct the subject back through their memory, oh, a decade or so at a time, until they come to the earliest memory, and then they direct the subject to go to the life that’s having an effect on the problem in the present. I’ve used the technique many times myself. I’ve taught it. Well, that’s accurate as far as it goes, but, you know, I discovered something else, something more, and something that was extremely valuable as a resource. for a great many other things as well. That discovery was that the effect was therapeutic. And I made that discovery during a party. I was attending a party some time ago. People always want me to put on a hypnosis show. And I usually oblige because they’re a lot of fun. Nothing is more entertaining than stage hypnotism. One day, I think it was in the 60s. Wow, 50 years ago. Hardly seems real. But those 50 years, they went by in a blink. Anyway, as I was saying, during the stage show, I regressed a young lady and she started to act and speak as though she was three, maybe four years old. Well, everybody laughed and we all got a kick out of that. And I thought I would try something that everyone talks about, but few people have ever experienced past lives. I figured, well, she’s a good subject, so let me try something. And so I took her back from her three -year -old self. and used a directional tone to send her to a past life. I was curious, and I did suspect that the result would be beneficial. Well, the whole room stared at her, waiting for her to speak. I was alongside when suddenly she sat up straighter, and she spoke in a commanding voice. She wasn’t three anymore. It seems that she went into a life where she was the wife. of a cotton plantation owner in the deep south of the U .S., long before the Civil War. We had fun questioning her about all the incidents in her life, and a good time was had by all. But when she came out of the trance, something had happened. I didn’t know it at the time, but she had a case of Crohn’s disease and was bothered by a constant stomachache along with diarrhea. She called me the next day to ask me what I had done when she was in the trance. Well, I hadn’t done anything different than usual, and I asked her why she asked. She told me about the pain and the diarrhea, and she said that for the first time in months, it was gone. The regression had apparently healed her. Well, after that, I regressed people with problems in every hypnotism class I did, and the results were really amazing. I taught a lot of classes of past life regression. I taught them in London and Paris, Holland, Greece, Switzerland, and Portugal, and most of the large cities of the United States, always with good results. How and why does it work? I haven’t the slightest idea. I don’t question it. As long as it works, I use it. The first time I was involved with the discussion of past lives in any form other than anecdotal, was during a roundtable meeting with a few of my friends in the hypnosis and psychology fields. Two of my friends were pure hypnotherapists, and three others were psychologists. One of them was a psychiatrist. We met once a week at our homes, and that particular week, we used my house in Tarzana. That’s a suburb of Los Angeles. We used my house for our forum that week. We were discussing the various means we each used with clients and patients. And another good friend, Dr. Eugene Jussick, who had recently written a book on past lives, Reaching for the Oversoul. Dr. Jussick wasn’t present at this get -together, but we were discussing his book, in which he described a patient who, when in a trance, suddenly turned into a totally different personality. The American worker of Irish descent suddenly spoke as Jan Sulu. a gentleman from what was apparently ancient China. I had discussed this seeming phenomenon with Dr. Jacek many times, and it was still somewhat of a mystery. Dr. Jacek is a medical doctor, but his interests were in the field of past lives. My own background, which was heavily into the yoga philosophies, accepted the reincarnational experiences. The concept was that of karma. and the belief that karma couldn’t be dealt with aside from working out past problems with present afflictions that matched the evil that had been done in a previous lifetime. And that’s pretty much of a standard belief. At some point during the evening, we decided to see if one of us could somehow tap into that energy and bring out a discarnate entity. As all of us were professional hypnotists, we drew straws to see who’d be the subject. I drew the short straw. Harry Reisner was elected to put me in a trance, and pretty soon I was floating in that satisfying neverland between the physical and the spiritual. His words became dimmer as I went deeper into the trance, and suddenly, just like that, it happened. I found myself as in a lucid dream, a dream where I was in complete control of the action. There I was, walking along a street that was obviously not Kansas. It appeared to be Mayan or Inca culture, oh, circa 1500 or so. I was wearing kind of a kilt with an elaborate headdress. Along the street I strolled, immersed in the Mayan Indian culture, stopping here and there to bite into a vegetable or a piece of fruit. But my enjoyment didn’t last long, for with a whisper of a wind I was suddenly… transported to the top of a pyramid, a Mayan pyramid. On a slab in front of me was a young woman. It appeared to be she was a sacrifice. I was a priest who was about to do the deed with a stone knife. Well, my true self came to the fore and I wrenched myself out of that place and brought myself out of the trance. Well, we had a fine time discussing that one, but only I could get a sense of what happened. That was no dream. I was there. That priest was me. Was it another life? Or did I tap into one of those infinite universes that I was to eventually be so involved with? I was determined to discover more about this business. If there were such things as past lives… Why weren’t there any memories of them? Well, I thought long and hard about this, and I did come to some conclusions. We have a physical body, and we have a mind. About that, there can be no argument. The mind recalls much of our experiences, but not all of them. As an example, when you were six years of age, you were still you. You were the same you that you are now, but you acted differently and your senses were different. You had more energy. and your taste buds were at their sharpest. You could see better, hear better, and be more active. Think about a day in your life when you were six. Do you recall what you had for breakfast, lunch, dinner? Can you recall anything at all? Probably not. And yet it was you. Nature has given us the blessing of not remembering. Imagine having perfect recall. remembering every single thing you’ve ever read, eaten, thought, smelled, seen and heard, everything. You couldn’t function with that mass of material in your mind. Now multiply that by 10, by 100, by 1 ,000, and say that you can remember every single lifetime of yours. Don’t even try to think about it. You can’t comprehend it. No one can. But that past of yours is valuable. It is what makes you the person that you are. You act and react due to the experience of that past. You may not remember why you don’t want to drive 120 miles an hour, even though it’ll get you to your destination sooner. But something in your past, something that you did, something that you heard, something that you read, that causes you to consider the possible consequences of driving at that speed. And so you keep it to a sensible pace. And the result is that you arrive at your destination safely. All of your past experiences create your attitude toward everything, even though you don’t understand the original setting up of the causes. Those causes that create your present attitude. Now let me extend the thought into a previous life mode. Simplify the idea of karma. The saying, what you sow, so shall you reap, comes to mind. Karma simply says that you pay for every misdeed, no matter how small, no matter how large. Whatever the deed, your karmic responsibility will eventually kick in. Does that mean that we have no control over our lives? After all, if you were an evil being in a previous life, and you had that debt to pay in this one, then of what use is programming? or goal setting, or prayer. If it’s your karma to suffer, then what’s the use of trying to overcome that responsibility? Now then, karma is too vast a subject to deal with in its entirety with these short sessions we have together. I’m going to have to simplify the subject to better explain the real theme of this program, and that is past life programming, past life therapy. To assume that there is any value in past life therapy, one must think that there is such a thing as reincarnation. And that, too, is a subject too vast to completely explain. Well, then you may well ask, and what’s the point? If you don’t assume karma and you don’t assume reincarnation, then how can you speak about past life programming? Well, good question. I go only by my own experience. After all, how else can anyone explain anything except through the avenue of one’s own experience? Aside from personal conditions, there have been many anecdotal situations, too many to overlook. During my 10 years of daily practicing hypnotherapy in the U .S. and in Europe, especially when I was teaching others the subject, I always included a segment of past life therapy when all else seemingly had failed to get the result the client was looking for. In many of these cases, the client didn’t believe in reincarnation and just went along with the process, skeptical with the whole procedure, but treating it as though it was a simple guided fantasy. My own belief was always open, as in an infinite universe, one of the concepts I teach… Anything is possible. And so I used only one criteria, one standard, and that is, and that was, did it work? If it worked, I used it without questioning the veracity of the belief. Were the people actually going to a past life? Maybe. Was it just an elaborate daydream? Maybe. Did it work? Yes. And that was all that I have ever been interested in. If it works, use it. During this series on past life therapy, we’re going to assume that when you go to a past life that is having an effect on this one, that you are indeed getting valuable information from that past life. Assume. That means just pretend that it will work and go along with it. You can question the concept later on, but if the process… solves your problems, reverses your limitations in life, enhances your health, creates better relationships, and gets you what you want, then use it and keep it as one of your major resources. What we’re going to do with this series of modules is to open you to other possibilities. Things that, oh, maybe you don’t accept at first, and that’s okay. I prefer that you be skeptical. I am. to a degree myself, still, to this day, as a seeker after the truth, I’ll be talking to you, using logic in most cases, and in some supposition, supposing, what if. But if the aim and the final result is to benefit you, your health, your pocketbook, and your life in general, if that is the aim, and if it works, Use it. In addition to my talking to you, there’ll also be a series of meditations. These meditations are designed to take you to a place you may not have ever contemplated a different life. You, but different. A past life. All your past lives have an effect on your present life. All the good you accomplish in past lives show up in this one as well. All the bad shows up in this one as well. Everything is growth, and grow you will. This may very well be the most valuable course you’ve ever been involved with. This train is going to take you to a higher state of involvement. The next stop, a better you. And here’s the strange part. You don’t have to believe it. After all, there’s no real evidence. But after reaching a past life once or twice, you will at least have opened the door. And more knowledge can only lead to more wisdom.

Audio Module 2: Past Life Regression Experiences
--------------------

Module 2. I recall a time at the Hilton Hotel in Paris that’s not far from the Eiffel Tower. I was conducting a class in hypnovision or hypnosis. I’d just gone through a few healing with hypnosis techniques and I asked for a volunteer. I was going to demonstrate past life therapy to eliminate a problem. A woman stood up, Lily by name, and said she’d like to volunteer. Well, as it turned out, she had a problem with her left hand. She couldn’t clasp it into a fist, nor could she raise her left arm much higher than her shoulder, especially if she were holding something. She couldn’t reach into a high shelf or a coffee cup, as an example. After all that was explained to the class, I put Lily into a trance. Actually, in hypnosis, it’s called a trance. Actually, it was a deep meditation. and I took her back to her earliest memory. I call that a past life immersion. When that was established, I gave her this directive, speaking directly to her inner conscience. Lily, I said, allow your inner consciousness to take you back to a past life that’s having an effect on the problem that you have in this life. When you get to that life, you’ll be in a place, and you will describe that place. and you will get an impression of whatever event is going on. I then had her jump into the past life, and she instantly reported, I’m in a crowd of people. I’m a little girl. My mother is going to be hung. They say she did something bad. I’m holding on to my father’s hand. He’s squeezing my hand. The people are yelling and fighting. My father pulls away. I don’t have anyone. I’m all alone and scared. People are yelling and fighting. A soldier picks me up and takes me away. Now, let me stop this narrative for a moment. All past life immersions are not as detailed as this, but Lily went to a place and the details were really clear in her mind. She said, a soldier picked her up and takes her away. And then she said, The soldier, it’s Andreas. Andreas is her husband, in this life, that is. He was in the class. Well, I might as well tell you the rest of the story. Lily got up from the chair after she came out of the trance, and she glowed. She reached out her hands to her husband. As I said, he was in the room as well. Well, Andreas ran up to her, and they embraced. Everyone had a smile on their faces. While the upshot was that Lily’s hand grew stronger almost immediately, whatever forces were at work had released her. That was a dramatic one. Lily lifted her arm without pain and was, during that demonstration, apparently healed. Now, Lily’s case seems almost obvious, as they are not always like that, where the situation in the past life seems to have a bearing on the problem. Not like that at all. But Lilly’s case was an exception. They come up like that once in a while. I’ve had a few like that. But usually the past life incident seemingly has no bearing whatever on the problem in this life. But I found, and I’ll be saying this again because it is important. Matter of fact, it’s of prime importance. That is to simply observe and simply walk through the event without judging it. without trying to do it differently. You’re an observer only. The inner conscious seems to always know where to take you and takes you to the right place. And that’s the thing that we’re going to do with the following module, but not with hypnosis, with meditation. The difference between the two is that with hypnosis, the subject only reacts to the hypnotist’s suggestions. With meditation, you act on your own suggestions, not someone else. With meditation, you are always in control. Past life therapy was so successful that I decided to bring it into one of my personal development seminars where I was teaching, in part, the art of meditation. Now, meditation is used for many people simply to relax away the stressful conditions of life. only one of meditation’s many facets. There was a young lady in the class who asked if past life therapy could help with going into a new business. My reply was, I didn’t know. It can’t hurt, so let’s see. I then had her go into a deep meditation and then bumped her into a past life, a life that might have a negative effect on her opening a new business. Well, she projected herself into the past life with the meditation exercise. and she found herself standing in a grassy field there were people around her apparently picking something from low -growing vines she immersed herself in the scene and observed it but nothing of any consequence happened she walked through the scene a few times watching and then brought herself out of the meditation now that seemingly has nothing whatever to do with her business But somehow she felt a great sense of relief after that simple meditation, and she found a strong sense of motivation. She reported that her apprehension about the business had disappeared. Another kind, a different kind of past life meditation came about during a class we were having in Cleveland, Ohio. A woman jumped into a past life where she was a Native American from some tribe on the East Coast. The year seemed to be that of pre -Columbus. The problem she was trying to solve had to do with the sale of a piece of property. It had been up for sale for two years, and even though the price seemed to be right, it just wasn’t selling. As a Native American, she imagined that she lived in a community that had a permanent camp near the ocean. She imagined this idyllic life with children running around, campfires outside each tent. and a room where the elders met that had been formed with three trunks and branches. It was like an elaborate daydream, she reported. A month later, she called to tell me that she’d sold her property, but she couldn’t believe that the past life regression had anything to do with it. And my answer was, what’s the difference? Maybe it was just a crossover of timing. It would have eventually sold. Maybe it was just time for it to be sold. Then again, maybe, just maybe, the regression did lend some energy to the event to make it come about. In that same class in Cleveland, there was a woman who had a rash. It seems that she’d had the rash for two years. Her doctor prescribed a salve to ease it, but the rash persisted. I was tempted to use energized water, but this was a class in past life regression, and so back to a life that had something to do with the problem we went. She found herself in a city in Europe. She thought it was Paris, but she wasn’t sure. She walked along one of the… streets and kind of window shop. She came to the end of the street and was attacked by two men who stole her purse. She screamed for the police, and one uniformed officer appeared who chased the two men, and eventually she got her purse back. She came out of her meditation. About an hour later, her rash grew less. By the end of the day, the rash had disappeared. Now, there have been many tales with respect to past life therapy. As every time I did a demonstration, something of a positive nature happened. In my own case, it involved money. The year was 1975. I was with three of my friends, and we spoke of money consciousness. I was asked how a past life immersion could help to develop the right consciousness to attract money. I said, well, let’s see. At that point, I helped the four of us to reach a deep meditation. It was kind of a group meditation that I was leading. We all picked out a figure, and I said I would look for $10 ,000 in this life coming to me from a positive source or sources. Instructing them to go to the past life that was holding them back, I went into a past life myself. I found myself in a forest. It was like a daydream. I seemed to be a hunter. I just let the vision happen and I imagined that I was wandering through the forest. A deer suddenly appeared and it startled itself, but I guess I startled it. It ran off into the depths of the woods. I had a bow and I quickly pulled an arrow from my quiver and shot at the deer, missing it by a wide margin. I walked over to the arrow and put it back in my quiver. That was about it. Now, what that had to do with money is anyone’s guess. But I long ago learned not to question what happens when in a meditation trance. Just observe. Walk through the scene. And so I did. After that, we all discussed the places we’d been, and after a while, we left. Three days later, I received a call from a relative that he was giving me and two other family members $10 ,000 as he had just had a windfall. Now, I would be the first to admit that it probably would have happened anyhow. But there’s always that seed of doubt that says maybe. Maybe something was set in motion at a deep universal level. I don’t know. I do know that over the years I’ve had a lot, many, many stories pretty much like that about money, health, business. and a slew of other problems that were solved by a simple past life immersion and observing whatever scene comes up. Now, during the next module, we’re going to go through a past life immersion. But first, a bit of instruction. First of all, you want to activate your intent. You must activate your intent. To do that, you simply think about a specific outcome. that you want to happen after the meditation. What is it that you’re using past life therapy for? Money? Health? Business? Relationships? Attracting something? Repelling something? What? Once you’ve decided that you have your target, something is keeping you from it. Now that thing may be in a past life. Once you have the thing you want corrected in your mind, then you listen to the next module. Now, while in the meditation state, you’ll find yourself somewhere. It may be familiar. It may not be. It may not seem to have anything to do with the problem that you’re looking to correct. It may not. You may not get a particular scene at all. You may just get an imaginary, a fog -like thing. You may get a sense that something is going on. It may be just darkness. It doesn’t matter. Whatever scene you sense, just allow it to happen. Don’t be concerned about it. Just observe it, walk through it, or just view it as though you were there watching yourself. That’s all there is to it. It sounds too simple. That’s because it is simple. But just allow it to happen, walk through the scene, and once again, if it works, it works. So, next module, find a relaxed place and we will begin.

--------------------
Audio Module 3: Past Life Meditation
--------------------

Module three. Relax. Make yourself comfortable. Close your eyes. Take a deep breath. And when you exhale, mentally repeat and visualize the number three, three times. Three. Three. Like that. Take another deep breath. And while exhaling, mentally repeat and visualize the number two, three times. Take another deep breath. And while exhaling, mentally repeat and visualize the number one three times. You are now at a deeper, healthier level of mind. To reach a deeper, healthier level of mind at any time, just take an occasional deep breath. To help you reach the proper depth of meditation, imagine that you’re on the top of a stairway. There are 15 steps. You’re going to mentally walk down those steps one at a time. Each time you descend a step, allow yourself to go deeper into the meditation. You’re at the 15th step. Step down to the 14th, the 13th, the 12th, 11, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 5. Three, two, and one. Relax. You are now at a deeper, a healthier level of mind. You are now and always in complete control of your state of mind. You can open your eyes. You can be fully alert anytime you want to be. Every time you enter this relaxed state, know that you’re getting better and better in every way. Whenever you enter this relaxed state, you’ll mentally say, every day, in every way. I’m getting better and better. When you say these words, sense yourself improving in all areas of your life. Sense yourself getting better and better. Relax. Relax your eyes. Relax your lips and jaw. Relax your head, your neck. Relax your chest, your stomach, your back. Relax your body. Relax your hips, your legs, your feet. Relax your arms and hands, your shoulders. You’re now completely relaxed. At this time, you will go back to an incident in a past life that is having an effect on this life. You will automatically go back to an incident that has created a problem in your present life. Just allow the scene. to take place. It may seem to have something to do with a problem that you’re looking to overcome. It may not. Do not be concerned about that. Just observe. Observe what you sense and walk through the scene. It may seem like a simple daydream. It may seem very real. However you sense it will be all right. Before you go to that past life, think about something you had recently for dinner. Now think about an incident that took place when you were in school. Now think about your earliest memory. Now I’m going to count from one to three, and at the count to three, you’ll project yourself into a past life, a life that is having an effect on the problem you’re looking to resolve. You’ll imagine a scene of some sort. It may seem to have nothing to do with the problem, but don’t concern yourself with that. Just let the scene happen. and observe. It may seem like a daydream. Just allow it to happen. One, two, three. Project yourself to that past life. Where are you? What do you see? What do you sense? You’re imagining a scene. Just allow it to happen. Relax. Take your time and observe. Relax. I will now count from one to three, and you will project yourself back into this life. One, two, three. You’re now back. Relax. The resource you have just used is to help you to deal with the problem that you are setting a goal to resolve. In a moment, I will count once again from one to three. This time, you will come out of the meditation and be fully awake and energized, feeling better than before. In our next meditation, you will go even deeper, and you will use a bright light, a fog, to reach that past life. One, two, three. Eyes open, wide awake, feeling refreshed, feeling better than before.

Audio Module 4: The Ultimate Goal Setting Method
--------------------

Module 4. There’s a belief in the concept of infinity that’s accepted by many scientists, especially quantum physicists. This belief states that everything in the past, present, and future is actually happening now. That time as we see it is a subjective thing, and not necessarily how the universe perceives it. One example would be looking at the stars in the sky. What you are seeing is something that happened millions of years ago. That’s known to every scientist on the planet as it takes light that long to travel from the star to the earth. In a similar manner, what you perceive to be the present may or may not be what’s happening now. All that tells us is that there is much to know that we may never learn. To gather a better understanding, we look at what will work for us and what won’t. Infinity may well be beyond our understanding, just as is eternity and the cosmos itself. We can only guess at the great mysteries through intellectual investigation, experimentation, feedback, and success and failure. When we do something that works, we repeat it. If it works again, then we know we’re on the right track. And if there comes an occasion when it doesn’t work, then we either do it again, changing either the method or our attitude toward the thing. This is called empirical investigation, and so it is with what we’re about to do. Now, all that is very difficult to understand, for anyone to understand. That includes the scientists and quantum physicists and the teachers of the concept. The best way for the average student to comprehend the concept of time being relative and everything happening right now is to dip into the world of quantum mechanics. In this world, infinity consists of a multitude of universes. Think of this theory as a metaphor, if you will. As metaphor… metaphors are designed to clarify a concept because there’s no way to prove it at present it remains a theory however what we see is even more important than proof is works if it works we use it and gain the benefits that come out of it after all we don’t really know how many of our prescription drugs work we don’t know how aspirin works Scientists use a variety of plants, roots, molds, until they find one that has a good effect. But what actually happens inside the body and mind is very often a mystery. But when it works, they offer it to the world. And so here’s our metaphor for all time happening now, and every life of yours happening now as well. Picture, if you will. Not only an endless number of galaxies and solar systems and planets in our universe, but further picture an endless number of universes. Doing that, you’ll find an endless number of lives of yours as well as endless time periods. In other words, in one of those universes, it’s the past, in another the present, and in another the future. Your past lives are available to you. as are your future lives. If this is difficult to understand, once again, I say look at it as a metaphor, something that represents something else. So that when you’re imagining going into a past or a different present life, see it as a fantasy that will help you to overcome a problem, whatever problem you intend to resolve. In my own research, primarily when working with people and regressing them into a past life, I found that virtually anything can pop up, but whatever the individual is attracted to, there’s purpose behind the attraction. Your dreams, your daydreams often reflect this. Dreams aren’t to be feared, but rather embraced, as that is your inner conscious working with the material stored. and often buried deep within the subconscious to overcome the problem that you take to bed with you. Dreaming that you’re running away from something or someone but can’t seem to make any headway has a variety of meanings, as each individual has information stored and coded in a variety of ways. You can’t interpret it, but you can use it. Here’s how. Dreams are unconscious. in that they occur without any outer control. The big factor that’s often overlooked are your beliefs or your belief system. What you believe to be will be in your dreams, but generally, if not always, represent it as a symbol of what you want. The trick is to control them. One way to bring about that control is by managing your beliefs. When dreams are under your control, they can be manipulated to bring about an event or a situation that is to your advantage. But we can’t get into your dreams to manipulate them, and so we do the next best thing. We step into a situation that your inner conscious would set up as a dream. However, by controlling the access, we do what the dream is trying to do, and that is have a positive outcome. According to the best scientific minds on the planet, everything that has, is, and will happen is happening right now. There’s general agreement on that. However, what is missing from the equation is how to reach the happening. One way to do that is through the concept of past and future lives. Now, the question is going to come up, of course. What if you don’t believe in past lives? What if you don’t believe in reincarnation and coming back and so on? Well, that’s fine. After all, there’s no definite proof. Sure, myself and a few thousand other practitioners have taken people to what appears to be a past life, but there’s also the possibility that it’s just a fantasy, a dream, a daydream, or a genetic memory. What do I say to that? Well, I say to that that whoever says that, they may be right. I assume there are, but I could be mistaken. What is important, however, is the fact. The fact that it often works. I have, over the years, taken thousands of people back to what appears to be a trip to a past life. And too often to be coincidence, there have been positive things come out of that trip. Healings, problem solving, relationships restored. attracting people and things and a whole gamut of good events taking place after a past life session. And sure, there are anecdotal statements and a story by an individual that’s not necessarily a fact. But once again, I go by three little words. Three words that you should ask as well. Those words are, does it work? All that we ask of you is to go through the meditation. Allow yourself to drift in. to a situation that you intend to be a previous lifetime event and simply observe the event. Simply walk through the event, whatever it might be. Don’t judge. Don’t critique. Don’t even comment on or store it in your memory. You don’t have to do that. Just be there. Observe it. Walk through it, the event that is. And then allow yourself to come back to the present. When you meditate. You are highly concentrative. That’s where you want to be. Concentrative on a particular thought. I’ll make it easy for you, because I’m going to guide you through the process, stopping when you go to that prior life. After that, you must be on your own, and so you shall. However, you can come back immediately at any time. You’re not stuck there. All you have to do to come back is squeeze your eyelids together, and your eyes will pop open, and you’ll be wide awake. and out of the meditation. I’ve never been involved with anyone who didn’t benefit from the experience, though. Now, in the next module, there’ll be a few specific stories about people, and you’ll see how, step by step, they observe. Step by step, they walk through the event that they find themselves in, and then discover, when they come out of the meditation, their problem solved. People often tell me that it’s pointless to think about a past life, as if there is no memory of it and it doesn’t exist, because all things that are are in the memory. And yet when they’re asked to remember a thing that happened in their early childhood, they can’t. And yet they are the same person. And the things of childhood that can’t be remembered make you the person that you are today. So it isn’t much of a stretch to imagine that the things that happened in a past life that you have no memory of also have an effect on what’s happening to you. now. And also, now this one is a bit harder to take, your future life and lives are also happening now. One of the reasons I’ve found that goals seem to work better for some people than they do for others is because although the thing they’re programming for has already happened in one of their future lives, they’re focusing on the wrong one. Let me try to clarify this for a moment. Let’s say that you have 10 possible future lives. Now, that’s a totally arbitrary figure. You may have 10, but then again, you may have 2, 3, or 10 ,000. But we’ll use the number 10. In those 10 future lives, you have five successes and five failures. In other words, some of them are probable future lives and some of them are possible future lives. You also have five healthy and happy selves. And there are five sick and miserable selves. But all of those future selves started from where you are right now at the present time. Before you, there are many choices in front of you. There are many roads. And each road has lots of branches, lots of tributaries. The choices that you make now are what will take you to those future selves of yours. But all of them will happen. Which one, the you that you are at present, will be on depends on the choices that you make. To help you make the right choice, the one that will take you to the healthy and happy life, you must take a trip to the future self that you want to become and have that future self go back into a past life and walk through the event that’s holding you back. That past life is your present life. Now, if that seems too complicated, Relax, because you’re going to be guided through the meditation. You’ll be immersed into a future life during the meditation module coming up shortly. Just go along with the instructions, and things will happen automatically. Good things. You might say this is the ultimate method of goal setting. Now then, going into a future life is similar, but not quite the same as going into a past life. Before you take what we will be calling a meditation immersion trip, you must set your intent. What’s your intention? In other words, what do you hope to gain by this? In the next module, I’ll speak about a few of my students who went to a future life and how they went about it. This will set up the model for you to imitate to some degree. Now, once again, allow me to say don’t judge. Do not criticize. Allow whatever comes up to come up. Observe. However, with the future immersion, as opposed to the past immersion, you have a measure of control as you’re intending to go to the future you who has succeeded in what you want to achieve. The future you has gotten rid of the problem, whatever it might be. You are choosing this you. That’s your intention. Remember, the road you’re on leads to many places, many selves of yours. both successful and the opposite. Think back on your life with respect to all the choices you could have made. Each choice would have had a different effect, and you would be in a different place than you are at present. Now you have the ability to view the future from a different perspective and see the consequences of the choices that lay before you at the present time. For now, let’s look at George Eliot. and see how he used the future life concept to restate goals and achievement.

Audio Module 5: Neutralizing Dysfunctional Beliefs
--------------------

Module 5. George Elliott was a participant in a seminar that I presented at the Gramercy Park Hotel in New York. That was in the 90s. George’s problem was that he never seemed to get anywhere. He had a job that paid enough to get by on, but he just couldn’t seem to get out of the rut that he was in. He lived from paycheck to paycheck like a lot of his friends. But one of the fellows that he grew up with seemed to have it all. Money, an estate-sized house, a luxury car, beautiful wife, seemed to have everything. Now, George had a fair job, a loyal wife, two kids, a vacation every year, average house, and he was in good health. But George believed his bad luck was keeping him from the good life. And that’s what he really wanted, what he considered to be the good life. He wanted to know, would past life therapy help? He was envious of his friends who seemed to have more and weren’t any smarter or better educated than he was. Well, I thought he lived okay, but he wasn’t satisfied, and he was the only one who could really set the criteria, let’s say, for his life. So I thought, well, can’t hurt, like I tell most people. Before we went into a past life immersion, I used George as a demonstration of how to utilize something different, the power of a future life, to offset a harmful belief. Actually, I was looking to change George’s belief. Now, the class size was about 50 people. I called out for a volunteer, and George, of course, came to the front of the room. He went into a deep meditation and waited for guidance. Here’s what I said to him. Now, George is sitting in front of the room. I’m standing next to him. His eyes are closed. He’s in a meditation. And there’s a microphone in front of his mouth. And so everybody could hear every word he says, which is what I wanted because this was a training class after all. And here’s what I said. George, as you know, the past is a memory. It’s over, gone. It only remains active in your mind. And George? Deep in meditation, nodded. The future, I said, is a fantasy. It hasn’t happened yet. Not at this dimension. The power that you have to choose and to change is now. Your point of power is now. Not in the future, not in the past. However, to activate that power, you must visit the future and you must visit the past. You’re having problems at present because you believe that you’re a failure as a man. You believe you’re a failure as a husband and as a father. You told me this yourself. George nodded again and looked kind of sad. We’re going to change that belief that you’re a failure, George, because until you do, you’re going to remain exactly where you are right now. That’s one of your main problems. You are where you are because you believe you are. You believe you’re a failure. You told me that. Where does that belief come from? George, still deep in meditation, didn’t reply, just shrugged and looked even sadder. I continued. Well, I’m going to let you in on a secret, George. You know, it doesn’t matter where the belief comes from. It may have come from your childhood. It might be a small, insignificant cause. Or may have happened when you first went out into the world. May have happened in a past life. What we’re going to do now is to neutralize that belief. The belief that’s telling you that you’re not good enough. You’re going to pick a future self of yours who is good enough. A self of yours that’s in the future. A self that is not only good enough to do the things that you dream about, but who is successful. And more importantly, who is happy with his position in life. At that point, George relaxed, and I counted him down even further by counting from 10 to 1 again. Pretty soon, George was very, very relaxed and very deep into meditation. And here’s what I said next. And this is pretty much what’s on the next module, which is a meditation module that you’ll be doing. George, imagine that there’s a brightness about you. In front of you is a bright white light, pretty much like a fog that’s filled with brightness. This bright fog is a doorway, a doorway to a future time, a future you. There are many future selves of yours. Each one has chosen a different path. The path that each self has chosen is based on belief. If the self has a belief of being unworthy, he’s going to choose a path that is most likely to produce that effect. But that’s not the path that you’re going to choose. What path would you take if you were successful at everything that you did? What path would you take if you were successful and happy with your position in life? Now, that’s the path that you’re going to choose when you walk through the light. you will be involved with an event, a future event involving you. It’s going to be a positive event because your belief is such that you will be attracted to a self who is successful and happy with his family, happy with his friends, happy with his work, and happy with his place in life. Okay? Good. Now, imagine, George, that you’re walking into the light. You are now in the light. And now step through and greet your future self, the future self of yours that could be. Your future self has a strong belief in his self-esteem and the confidence that he can do anything and do it well and successfully. Your future self made different choices, choices a person with a strong belief in himself would make. When you walk through the light, you will be with your future self observing. Just observe what’s going on. Kind of walk through what you sense, what you see. Your future self will be doing something. It doesn’t matter what he’s doing. He’ll simply observe the scene and not comment, not judge what you sense and see. Now I’m going to count from one to three, and at the count of three, you’ll walk into the light, through the light, into a scene, a future scene that is taking place. One, two, three, begin. After explaining what was going to happen to George, I helped him to get to the meditation state, and I counted him just like I just said into the light. George was in front of the class, comfortably seated. His eyes were closed as he meditated. After a while, it was a little more than five minutes, he squeezed his eyelids together, opened his eyes, and smiled. Wow, he said. That was something. I kind of saw me driving a Bentley, he said. I was all dressed up. with a great suit and I think I had a silk shirt. I think I was driving to pick up my wife or a friend. It seems so real. What’s next? Well, the idea of going into the future life is to neutralize and wipe away the belief that George was a loser. Belief is generally the chief culprit in keeping a person from getting the things that they want. By going to a future self who is successful and has different beliefs, George’s subconscious sees that it is possible, and a chink appears in the armor that was keeping him from setting goals that he subconsciously believed were impossible for him to get, to attain. When you do the future self, your future self, you acknowledge the problem, and then when you do the past self, as we’ll do again in the later model, you wipe away the cause of the problem. Well, George went into another meditation. This time, this was a demonstration. After all, we did them both together. And this time, after walking through the light, he went to a past life. He reported that he was in a forest and a bunch of horsemen, apparently from some military or other gallop by. He heard voices and shouting and horses snorting, even thought he got a whiff of a sour aroma. As he was instructed, George just observed the scene, and that was it. The entire session with George took about, oh, maybe 30 minutes. And it changed him. When he left the class, he had a new belief. The belief was, I can. Simply that. But what a powerhouse there is in those two words. George changed. He showed up one day a few months later, the next time I was in New York, to bring his wife to the class. and to sit in on the seminar. I almost didn’t recognize him. He walked straighter, spoke with more authority and confidence. Self-esteem just oozed out of him. He brought his wife to the class so that she could learn and use the power of past and future life immersions. George asked me if I would be telling the story of the mud hen. I told him that I would. It’s something that I never neglected. It’s one of my favorite stories. It sums up very nicely why some people never seem to make it in life. And it goes like this. Once upon a time, there was a man who made his living selling newspapers on a downtown street corner. That was during a time when people did sell newspapers on street corners. Well, this man, his name was Bobby. He lived in a damp, single-room apartment that was too hot in the summer and too cold in the winter. He was aware of his newspapers, his simple room, his ill-fitting second-hand clothing, the simple food he ate, and little else. Other people he knew lived differently. But it was difficult for him to imagine that other world. How could a mud hen… hoped to aspire to the grandeur of the eagle, slowly circling higher and higher, working on a swirling updraft. Wings spread proudly in magnificent flight. Our mud hen’s name was, as I’ve said, Bobby. And every morning when he woke up, eyelids still clogged by the effects of sleep, his first thought was to see himself standing on his corner. hawking newspapers. The visualization was always the same. Half a dozen papers under his left arm and a single newspaper held in his right hand as he shouted out the headline, shouting it in a raspy voice, horsened by years of abuse. Some morning, still half asleep, he’d see a customer give him a dollar and say, keep the change. On these mornings, he’d open his eyes and smile. It’d be a good day. As he ate a simple breakfast of biscuits, bacon, and coffee, he would think about how many newspapers to buy. If he really felt good, he’d order half again his normal quota. If he didn’t feel that good, he’d order only half as much. Seeing a beautiful woman on her way to work, he’d visualize himself selling her a paper. Seeing a well-dressed man, he’d think, that one’s got to be good for a 50-cent tip. If he saw a policeman, he’d see himself handily… the officer a paper and the policeman smiling at him. Passing a stockbroker’s office, he’d imagine the brokers busily engaged in reading one of his newspapers. He related everything to newspapers. Newspapers were his life, his world, his reality. Everything he was conscious of, he would in some manner relate to newspapers. He believed himself to be a small, raspy voice failure of a man, capable of selling only newspapers. And so he was, because he only accepted information that reinforced the belief. He enclosed himself in a structure that he himself had built, brick by brick by brick. Every time he bought himself a worn-out pair of second-hand pants, he added a brick. Every time he brought home a stale, crusty day-old bread to save money, he added a brick. Every time he sold a newspaper, he added a brick. And in the mornings, as he slowly pushed himself out of bed and saw himself selling papers and being tipped for his efforts, and in the evenings, when he thought over the day’s events and smiled because of the tips or sulked because of the torn papers, it was then. that he added the mortar. And so he lived, and so he died, never knowing that he was an eagle all the while, an eagle bound with the most senseless chains of all, those of limited awareness. What good is being an eagle if you believe yourself to be an earthbound mud hen? Believe yourself to be a mud hen, and you’ll not only see one in your mirror, you will view the world from that perspective. Belief is a powerful force. But what exactly is a belief? Here’s a simple definition. A belief is mental acceptance of something, some idea as being true. Now that acceptance can be based on trust for an authority, on reason or prejudice. A belief can also be a thought or series of thoughts that have been programmed or conditioned. by outside agencies. Even when the acceptance isn’t supported by reason, a belief causes the individual to act as though the thing were totally reliable. Many beliefs that seem to make no sense at all appear to have been instigated early in childhood or during an event in a past life. That’s what past life therapy is for, to change harmful beliefs. Bobby, the mud hen, Couldn’t imagine a future self. He was stuck in the present. His future was as immutable as his present. But if he had the opportunity to view a possible future self, he might just have pulled himself out of the quagmire he was in. You, however, have the opportunity to see a future self. that might be. A self that could be. The next module will be for you to concentrate on, on what could be a future you. A possible you. Hopefully, after you go through this program, a probable you. So relax. Be comfortable. Listen to the meditation. Go into the meditation. on the next module.

Audio Module 6: Future Life Meditation
--------------------

Module six. Find yourself a comfortable position and relax. Close your eyes. Take a deep breath. And when you exhale, mentally repeat and visualize the number three three times. Three. Three. Take another deep breath. And while exhaling, mentally repeat and visualize the number two three times. Take another deep breath, and while exhaling, mentally repeat and visualize the number one three times. Relax. You are now at a deeper, healthier level of mind. To reach a deeper, healthier level of mind at any time, just take an occasional deep breath. To help you to reach the proper depth of meditation, imagine that you’re on the top of a stairway. There are 15 steps. You’re going to mentally walk down those steps one at a time. Each time you descend another step, allow yourself to go deeper into the meditation. You’re at the 15th step. Step down to the 14th, the 13th, the 12th, 11, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5. Four, three, two, and one. Relax. You are now at a deeper, healthier level of mind. You are now and always in complete control of your state of mind. You can open your eyes. You can be fully alert anytime you wish to be. Every time you enter this relaxed state, know that you’re getting better and better in every way. Whenever you enter this relaxed state, You’ll mentally say every day in every way, I’m getting better and better. When you say these words, sense yourself improving in all areas of your life. Sense yourself getting better and better. Relax. Relax your eyes. Relax your lips. Relax your jaw. Relax your head and neck. Relax your chest. your stomach, relax your back, relax your body, relax your shoulders, your arms and hands, relax your hips, your legs, your feet. You’re now completely relaxed. Imagine that in front of you is a bright fog. When you step through that fog, you will find yourself in a future time with a future you, a you that might be. a happy, a successful you. This self of yours had many choices in life to make, just as you presently do. This self made choices that created a strong belief in success and happiness. The belief was an inner conscious belief that you have the confidence to do and to be anything you wish to be. Think now for a moment. Before you step into the bright fog, what it is and where it is that you want to be in a year or two years or five years or any number of years that you choose, where do you want to be? What do you want to be? What kind of a self would that confident self who made the right choices be? When you step through the bright, fog, you will be with that self. But only to observe. View the scene. Do not critique. Do not judge. Only observe. Only view the scene that you imagine that happy future self of yours that made all the right choices. Imagine where that future self of yours would be. When you step through the bright fog, you will be with that self, but only to observe. View the scene. Once again, do not critique or judge. Only observe. View the scene that you imagine that happy future self of yours will be in. Relax. I’m going to count from one to three, and at the count of three, you’ll step into and through the bright fog to be with a future you. a future self. Just allow the scene to happen and walk through it or observe. It may seem like a daydream. Just allow it to happen and observe what’s going on. One, two, walk into the fog. Three, step through the fog and you’re now with a future self. Where are you? What do you see? What do you sense? Imagine a scene. Even if you have to create it, just allow it to happen. Relax. Take your time. Begin. Relax. I will now count from one to three and you will project yourself back into this life, into the present. One, two, three. You are now back into the present. Relax. The resource you have just developed. is to help you to deal with the problem that you’re setting a goal to resolve. In a moment, I’ll count once again from one to three. This time, you’ll come out of the meditation and be fully awake and energized, feeling better than before. One, two, three. Eyes open, wide awake, feeling better than before.

Audio Module 7: Repaying Past Life Debts
--------------------

Module 7. Many, if not all, problems were instigated during a past lifetime. If it is your destiny or karma to suffer, it would seem that there was no way out. But it is also your karma, that being the case, to discover the means to overcome your problems. That’s why you’re reading or listening to this right now. It’s been said that when the student is ready, the teacher will appear. Are you the student? And am I the teacher? Time will tell. If the things I say have a beneficial effect on your life and lifestyle, you’ll have to assume that you are and that I am. You can also see this as when you are ready to overcome the karmic payment for past debts, the means will appear. The very intention that you have to change your life is a beginning, your intent to change. I found that often the simplest method of intention is always the best. And so I’ll give you four words that will start you on the way to overcoming karmic debts. Those four words are, be a better person. That’s the beginning. By now you’ve gone through two meditations, one on past life and one on future life, each designed to neutralize your karmic debt. Now that’s a good start, but going back to the same attitudes of the past, the same guilts, the same regrets, the same approach to things will bring you the same results. Take care of that. I’m going to help you to overcome automatically. The corrupt reasoning that forms the basis of all problems. This program is intended to be unique. The only criteria we have is whether or not it works. And it does. It works. I’ve had feedback for many, many years. It works. Now go through the meditations. Decide to be a better person. And you will indeed find your life getting better and better. What does that mean, be a better person? Perhaps the best way to explain that would be to define evil and to define good. Evil is a lack of empathy. Goodness is an abundance of empathy. Once understood, you can indeed know how to be a better person. I’m reminded of the time when I was listening to one of my yoga mentors many years ago. I asked him how empathy could balance a karmic debt. He told me this story. A young monk who had recently joined the monastery seemed to be destined for a short life. His guru sensed this and sent the novice off on an errand. When he returned the next day, his lifespan, as sensed again by the guru, had lengthened. After a long and detailed conversation with the novice as to exactly what had transpired during his errand, it came out that while taking a shortcut through the woods, the novice came upon a grasshopper who had a leg stuck in the sap of a fallen branch. The novice carefully pulled the leg of the grasshopper free, wiped away the offending sap, And the novice continued on his journey. A simple story. But what has this to do with empathy, you might ask? Empathy is identifying with and understanding another person’s feelings and difficulties. This means not only with people, but with the animal kingdom as well. One of the reasons people do have problems with past life incidents is due to that lack of empathy. Now, when I refer to evil as being a lack of empathy, we must bring in the degrees of that lack. All things are governed not only by the emotion, but by the degree of that emotion. When you hear of the evil done by dictators in other countries, the mutilations, the killings, the ethnic cleansings, it’s difficult to comprehend anyone being involved in such misdeeds. Only a person who is totally lacking in empathy can do those things. Only when one has little empathy can it be understood. The karmic debt these people build is so enormous as to ensure a horrendous future lifetime. It would be so horrific as to ensure that there would be no teachers to help them to overcome the mountain of karmic debt they build. and it would take many, many lifetimes before help would be available to them. On the other side of the coin are those who display a measure of empathy. These are those people who know they have a chance to pay the debt, first by going back to the past life where it was instigated, and then to briefly visit the future life that could be. After that, the determination to be a better person by considering other people from their perspective. This is probably exemplified by the old Native American statement, do not judge another person until you have walked in their shoes for three moons. When you view the other person’s point of view, you have a better understanding of that person, and that includes friends and family members as well as strangers. Going into a past life is also a method of experiencing other aspects of yourself and your lifestyle, your attitudes, and why you choose the things that you do, why you chose your friends, your work, your hobbies, indeed, about every aspect of your life. After meditating and immersing yourself in a few of your previous lives, you will find more than a few answers as to why you do the things that you do. Once you uncover the secret of past life orientation, you’ll find that you’re making different choices in life and you’ll be getting different results. But mainly, you keep your intention directed at the fact that your intention is to be a better person. Look at everything you experienced up until now as a learning experience. You are who you are because of the incidents you encountered, the choices you made, the paths you trod. You’re now at a crossroads with a new mantra. You want to become a better person. The easiest way to become this better person that you’re striving for is to remember that goodness is an abundance of empathy. Think about your parents. But when you do, put yourself in their place. How would you have acted towards you if you took your parents’ point of view or your children’s? Or your friends. Get the idea? In the next module, I’ll be telling you about other people who attended my seminars on past life therapy and how they adjusted to their new lives. However, before you complete the program, you must be able to accept this new you. You must be ready to accept this new you that will be coming out of it. A new, better you. Better able to cope. Better equipped to understand. And better able to act in a manner that will be beneficial to you. Accepting the premise that there have been many lives in many situations opens one to the question, why can’t I remember any of them? As I said in the first module, there are many answers to that question, but perhaps the best one is the one that reminds you of the facet of memory itself. Imagine, if you will, that you had eidetic memory. That would be the ability to recall everything you’ve ever experienced in total accuracy. and as vivid as though you were looking at it. Everything that had ever happened. Looking at a chair, you’d instantly remember every chair you’d ever sat on, every chair you’d ever seen. You would be besieged by so many memories, you wouldn’t be able to function. And so nature has blessed us with forgetfulness. Now then, like all things, there are degrees of forgetfulness. We forget that which is unimportant to us. Things that are not attached to great emotional states. We do remember things that will help us through life. Burn yourself as a two -year -old and you’ll always remember that fire hurts. You’ll probably always remember when you burned yourself. There’s an emotion attached to it. Something traumatic that took place at an early age is remembered with clarity and it’s easily recalled. So it is with past lives. If nature protects us against filling our minds with millions of images, so we are protected from thousands of millions of images of events of past lives. But there are always the consequences of those past lives. There are consequences to every action. Here, too, are degrees. Highly traumatic experiences in a past life is often viewed metaphorically in dreams. and as deja vu, that feeling of having experienced something before. But the reality isn’t experienced, only the emotion or the sensation of that scene. When your intention is to be a better person, and you allow yourself to go back to a past life that’s preventing that, you are drawn to an event. That event and time is sometimes dramatically vivid. Sometimes it’s tenuous as a cloud. But whatever you sense, it’s where you are supposed to be. It’s what you are supposed to sense. Once again, I repeat, don’t critique. Don’t judge the scene. Just observe it, whatever it is. I realize that others may have different suggestions, but I speak from many years, decades of experience and feedback. It is simple. So very simple that one wonders how it can possibly have an effect. But discover this for yourself. Just do it. Determine to be a better person and reap the rewards of the process.

Audio Module 8: Engaging Past Life Influences
--------------------

Module 8. Many, if not all, characteristics of a person’s behavior may be traced to past programming by authority figures like parents, family members, friends, religious leaders, teachers, and of course the media of the world. What’s generally overlooked is the influence of karma, past lives. Cause and effect is recognized by virtually all the scientific community. Every illness can be traced to a particular incident, every accident or coincidence to a particular event. This is on the level of the present, of now. If one was able to go even further back, you’d find a lot of interest, things of interest that affects a person’s life, this life, in a previous life. Consider one of my recent students. The incident took place in Portugal. I was demonstrating past life therapy and I asked for a volunteer. Let’s call her Bridella. Bridella was greatly overweight. She told me through an interpreter, I don’t speak Portuguese, that she’d been fighting her weight problem all of her adult life, but nothing seemed to help. Was there anything in past life therapy that might have a positive effect on the problem? Well, my first inclination was to say no, as I had never used past life therapy for weight loss. But as all my classes was research as well as teaching, I said, well, let’s see. And so Berdella went into a deep state of meditation and then went into a future life where she saw herself as thin, energetic, and popular. Then she was directed to go through the bright fog into a past life that was having an effect on her weight in her present life. She saw the scene as though it were a three-dimensional movie. She was a peasant in an unidentified town and her entire family was starving. She imagined that she saw her mother, her sister, and two young brothers laying around in a hut. They hadn’t eaten for days and they were waiting for their father who had been gone for two days. Berdella wanted to wait around until her father got back, but as her instructions were just to observe the scene, view whatever comes up, that’s what she did. She was in deep meditation for about five minutes. That’s about as long as it normally takes. She came out of the meditation and told the group what she’d experienced. Well, I finished the class and I didn’t hear anything else about Berdella until the following year when I returned to Lisbon to do another seminar. At the seminar a pretty slim young lady walked over to me, grinned, and asked through the interpreter if I remembered her. I said, no, I didn’t. Well, she grinned like a Chesser cat after that. She said, I’m Bradella. And she reminded me of the past life session of the previous year. After that, I added weight control to past life therapy. Appears to work with just about any problem. Another young lady from Cleveland, Cleveland, Ohio, Janie, by name, had a strange affliction. She habitually and constantly pulled her hair. One by one, she yanked them out of her head and wherever hair grew. I later found this was uncommon, but it existed as a problem all over the world, even as a name. The name of it is trichotillomania or TTM, often referred to as trick or trich. The affliction was new to me. I’d never heard of it before. But here was another chance to see if PLT would work for this problem. Janie went into a deep meditation, and as this was the teaching class, she reported what she was seeing while she was in the meditation state. I’m in a cellar, she said. Bombs are going off outside. Apparently there was a war going on. She continued, a soldier is in the cellar with me. I want his hat. And he takes it off and he gives it to me. I’m scared. I put the hat on and I pull it tight over my ears. Well, that was it. That was the entire scene. I had no idea what that had to do with the TTM problem. But I have found long ago and many, many times, don’t try to figure out the reasons. Just walk through the scene, observe it, let it go. For Janie, as with Berdella, one session did it. Janie, after that, no longer had the compulsion to pull out her hair. Past life therapy seems to work with so many things. I haven’t had occasion to use it for alcoholism, but I don’t see any reason why I shouldn’t work with that problem. Perhaps one of my internet students will use the technique successfully and report it. Another incident comes to mind where the person went to a past life and found himself looking over a field of grass. Only that, nothing more. His problem was that he was lazy. He wanted to do things but couldn’t get himself out of the house. He lived with his parents, which was fine, but he was 38 years old and he felt his life slipping by. His days were spent either reading or watching TV. He went for an occasional walk around the block, but that was the extent of his expenditure of energy. His mother was too used to seeing her son in the house, and she enjoyed his company, not requiring any income, he got lazier and lazier. He told me later it was an effort for him to come to my class, but the class was in Van Nuys, and he lived in Sherman Oaks, which was close by, in the next town, actually. So he dragged himself out of the house and came to the class. Well, we used him as a subject, and he reported seeing the field of grass, but that was it, nothing more. Whatever that field represented, though, it did the trick. He went to work for his father, who had been trying to get his son into his business for years without any success. Another instance in Van Nuys was the case of Helena. Helena had severe migraine headaches. Deep in meditation, she stepped through the bright fog and suddenly saw herself on a scaffold getting hung. She couldn’t gather the time period, but guessed it was the Middle Ages. She observed the scene for a few moments and came out of the meditation. Result? No more headaches. One interesting case was a gentleman named Stanley. He came into my office when I had a center in Tarzana, California. It was, I believe the year was 1977. He whispered in my ear that he was impotent and could past life therapy help him. As usual, I said, I don’t know. I can’t promise anything. But I know it can’t hurt, and if you don’t like the result, I mean, you get your money back, so you can’t lose. Well, that Saturday, he came to the seminar with his wife, who had a look on her face like she’d swallowed a glass of lemon juice. I guided him through the meditations, and he reported going to a place where there was a meeting of many men. He felt as though he was learning about something, but he couldn’t gather just what. The scene made no sense. But as instructed, he just observed. He didn’t critique it. He just viewed what his imagery brought to him. The next day, Sunday, he came in with his wife, had a radiant look on her face. He took a seat in the back of the room and winking gave me a thumbs up. Apparently whatever had taken place during the past life meditation worked. And another class that comes to mind was one where I’d been doing a few healings, as that too was among the things that I was teaching. When a young man, Lester was his name, asked if everybody had the ability to heal. As I’ve always felt that was the case, I said yes. But some people block the ability, and suddenly a thought came to me. Could past life therapy open this ability if, in fact, it had been blocked by some remote incident during a past lifetime? Asking Lester, he was in his late teens, if he’d like to volunteer to be a subject, we’d find out if we could turn him into a healer. Well, Lester came to the front of the class and took a seat. I helped him to get to a deep level of meditation, first telling him that he was going to go to a prior lifetime that had something to do with him becoming a healer, or whatever it was that was blocking him becoming a healer. Guiding him through the bright, fog-like light, I asked him where he was. I’m walking down a dirt road, he said. There’s a woman there by a well. She’s drinking from a cup of some kind. How do you feel about that, I asked. I’m thirsty too, he said. I want some of the water, but she won’t give me any. Why won’t she give you any of the water, I asked. Because she doesn’t like me, he said. Why doesn’t she like you, I asked. Because I have on a red cape and she’s one of the blue people, he said. How do you feel about that, I asked. I want to be one of the blue people, but I don’t know how, was his response. He was quiet for a while. I didn’t say anything. After a minute, I asked, what’s happening? He shook his head and muttered, nothing, it all went away. After that, I counted him back and back to the present. He looked mystified and pretty much reported the same thing that we had heard. It seemingly had absolutely nothing whatever to do with him opening up his healing abilities. But we would soon find out. There were about a hundred people in that class and I asked if any of them were in any pain. A few people raised their hands, and we picked three of them. One had a painful shoulder, another a back pain, and the third had hurt her foot a week prior to the seminar and was still limping. I called the three to the front, and I told Lester, heal him. How? he asked. Well, you’re a healer now, I replied. You figure it out. Lester scratched his head. He went to the man with the painful shoulder. He put his two hands on the man’s shoulder and looked him in the eye, saying, The pain is gone. The man smiled, moved his arm around and nodded. Yes, it is, he said. Lester kind of screwed up his face in disbelief. He put his hands on the woman with the back pain. He said, the pain is gone. And she too said, yes, it is. Now Lester was really mixed up. He squatted down in front of the woman with the limp and gently grabbed her foot, saying again, The pain is gone, and the woman turned her foot a few times and walked down the aisle smiling without a hint of a limp. Lester walked back to his seat in a daze. He was a healer. Everyone’s a healer. All you have to do is remove whatever is blocking it if you think you can’t heal. I found by going into a past life with the intention of going to an incident that is having some effect on a problem or situation that you want to correct in this life, there is very often a positive resolution. In the next module, there’ll be a meditation to take you to a past life that is having an effect that you want to correct. Before going into your meditation, think about the problem that you want resolved. That’s your intention, to resolve that problem by going into a past life. Keep that in your mind, but let it go. As soon as you hear the three to one count. After that, just concentrate on my words. So then, for now, find a comfortable place where you’ll be undisturbed for 15 minutes or so. Relax, listen, and follow along with the next module.

I can think. I can create. I can do. Relax. What I say now, every word. is going to be fixed and impressed in your mind. It will be engraved in your mind. Without your will or knowledge and unconsciously, your inner conscious will obey. The words you’re about to hear will be fixed in your mind. Three times a day, in the morning, at midday, and in the evening at your usual mealtimes, you will feel hungry. You will experience the agreeable sensation which makes you think of something nutritious to eat. You will learn about the nutritious foods and enjoy eating what you know is good for you. You will eat and enjoy your food without overeating. You will be careful to chew your food well so as to pre -digest it before swallowing it. You will eat in moderation. You will digest your food properly and feel no discomfort, no inconvenience, no pain of any kind either in the stomach or intestines. You will assimilate what you eat, and your body and cells will make use of it to make blood, muscle, strength, and energy. The food you eat will digest properly.

Things that used to worry, annoy, or irritate you will from this time forward leave you indifferent and calm. Your organs are performing their functions properly. Your heart beats in a normal way, and the circulation of the blood takes place as it should. Your lungs are carrying out their functions, as is your stomach, intestines, the liver, kidneys, gallbladder, and bladder. If at present any of your organs are acting abnormally, that abnormality is becoming less every day. so that quite soon it will have vanished completely and the organ will have recovered its normal function. If there should be any lesions in any of these organs, they will get better from day to day and will soon be entirely healed. It is not necessary to know which organ is affected for it to be cured. Under the influence of the auto -suggestion, every day, in every respect, I am getting better and better. The subconscious acts upon the organ which it can pick out for itself. You are going to have confidence in yourself, and this confidence gives you the assurance that you are capable of accomplishing perfectly well whatever you wish to do, unconditioned that it is reasonable and whatever it is your duty to do. When you wish to do something, or when you have a duty to perform, you will think that it is easy. and make the words difficult, impossible, I cannot, it is stronger than I, I cannot prevent myself from. Make those words disappear from your vocabulary. They are not your words. What are your words is, it is easy, and I can. You will do it quickly and well and without fatigue, because you do it without effort. You’re going to enjoy excellent health. Relax. Allow those words to lock into your mind. You have a new sense of confidence. You have a new sense of good health. Your body is now balanced and your energy levels will grow. Every cell of your body is recharging and restoring itself. Relax.

I can think. I can create. I can do. Relax. A strong sense of self -esteem is generally due to feeling equal to all people, neither feeling better nor worse, higher or lower than any other person. When you feel neither better nor worse, higher or lower than any other person, you feel equal to everyone. Every person in the world is a human being. And in that respect, we are all equal. A human being is just that. Human as opposed to non -human. Every president, king, queen, prince, emperor and empress is a human being. Every judge and every trash collector is a human being. Every sanitation worker, every gardener, every millionaire, every pauper, every tailor and architect is a human being. Every attorney. artist, doctor, musician, clerk, is a human being. Every foundry worker, every farmer, every miner, every tramp, every homeless person and every captain of industry, every businessman and every housekeeper is a human being. You are a human being and therefore equal to every other human being on this planet. Every human has their own unique qualities that make them different. Not better. Different. You have your qualities. They have their qualities. There are things that you can do that no other human being on earth can do. There are things that every other human being on earth can do that you can’t do. Things that you can do are unique unto you. You are unique. You are equal to everyone else on this earth. Repeat mentally after me. I am a human being. I am equal to every other human being on earth. I have my own unique qualities that make me different. They have their own unique qualities that make them different. No human being is better than I am. They are only different from me. Relax. Imagine yourself at a gathering of people, a social gathering. There are all kinds of people at this gathering. There’s a prince, a president, a famous actor, a singer, a musician. There’s a doctor, an architect. There’s a judge and a clerk, a secretary, a ditch digger, a plumber, a sanitation worker, and there’s a farmer. an unemployed carpenter, and many others. You and they are all human beings. You and they are all equal as human beings. You’re not better than or worse than the prince or the judge. You’re not better than or worse than the farmer or the ditch digger. They are human. You are human. You are all equal. Every one of these people can do things that you cannot do. You can do things that they cannot do. You’re all different. Think of the things that you can do that the prince can’t do. Think of the things that you can do that the judge can’t do. Think of the things that you can do that the coal miner cannot do. Think of the things that the coal miner can do that you cannot do. These things do not make the coal miner lesser than or better than any other person at this social gathering. You are all unique and have your own qualities. You are unique and you have your own quality. Your mind is unique and has its quality. You are equal to every other person on this earth. Relax. Imagine this gathering of people with different professions and occupations. Mix and speak with it. mentally. You are all equal. Tell them about the things that you do, what you do, the things that you do that they cannot do. Speak about the positive nature of what you do. Mix with the group. Imagine that you’re there. Relax. Begin. Whenever you think of your occupation, what you do, think of the positive aspects of what you do. Everything that everyone does in some way adds to the whole and is a contribution. Think of the ways that you contribute. Think of the things that you do that help humanity. Every leaf that falls makes a contribution. You make a contribution.

Audio Module 14: Improve Positive Thinking
--------------------

Improving positive thinking. This meditation to be played while you’re sitting down or lying down in the comfort of your home. Not to be played in a moving vehicle. Just relax. We’ll start this meditation with the three -to -one method. So find a comfortable position. Close your eyes. Take a deep breath. And while exhaling, mentally repeat and visualize the number three three times. Three. Three. Three. Like that. But do it mentally, of course. Take another deep breath and while exhaling, mentally repeat and visualize the number two three times. Take another deep breath and while exhaling, mentally repeat and visualize the number one three times. You are now at a deeper, healthier level of mind. To reach a deeper, healthier level of mind at any time, just take an occasional deep breath. Relax. You are now at a deeper, a healthier level of mind. You are now and always in complete control of your state of mind. You can open your eyes. You can be fully alert anytime you wish to be. Every time you enter this relaxed state, know that you’re getting better and better in every way. Whenever you enter this relaxed state, mentally say, every day in every way, I’m getting better and better. And when you say these words, sense yourself improving in all areas of your life. Sense yourself getting better and better. Visualize improvements in your life now as you mentally repeat the words. Every day, in every way, I’m getting better and better. And visualize improvements in some aspect of your life. Relax. Relax your eyes. Relax your… Lips your jaw. Relax your entire head. Relax your neck. Relax your body. Your arms and hands. Relax your legs and your feet. You’re now completely relaxed. Repeat mentally. My body rests and refreshes itself when I consciously relax. I am relaxed now. Repeat mentally. Every day I improve my image of myself, my self -esteem. I am a unique human being. There is no one else on earth exactly like me. Every day I grow stronger in the realization that I can. I can think. I can create. I can do. Relax. Now think about the person. that you love the most. Create a scene with that person. Imagine you and that person together doing things that you both enjoy doing, feeling the positive aspects of the scene. Relax. Now, that’s a positive viewpoint. At this time, think of something that you don’t like doing, such as washing dirty dishes, pots, perhaps shopping, or perhaps washing or gassing up the car, or seeing someone you dislike. Perhaps you’re doing something you don’t like. Pick a thing that you dislike doing and mentally visualize yourself doing that thing. That was a negative viewpoint. To change a negative viewpoint to a positive viewpoint, switch the experience. Polarize the experience. Put a different spin on it, as the common phrase goes. Change the viewpoint itself. See yourself in a sparkling clean kitchen instead of that of doing dishes. See yourself with new clothes or a cabinet full of food or that thing that you dislike doing. See the end result of that doing. A sparkling clean kitchen is not a bunch of dirty dishes. One is a negative viewpoint. One is a positive viewpoint. See yourself with a clean car, a sparkling clean car driving somewhere instead of the gassing up or the washing of the car. Instead of seeing yourself visiting someone you dislike, See yourself with the benefits of a successful visit to that person. Consider the positive and then visualize the positive aspects of the experience. Switch your viewpoint. Instead of washing dirty dishes, change your viewpoint to that of sparkling up your kitchen. Instead of opening books and studying, switch your viewpoint to opening books and learning. It’s never the experience or the thing that makes you happy or unhappy. It’s your viewpoint of the experience of the thing. You may not be able to change the thing, but you have total control over your own viewpoint. Think now of something that you’d like to develop a positive attitude towards, something that you’d like to have a positive viewpoint for. Sense the positive nature of that thing. Use the thing to develop a creative, positive push. Don’t study if you don’t like to study. Learn. Everyone loves to learn, but it’s the same thing you might say. It isn’t. How can it be the same if you dislike one and like the other? Don’t study. Learn. Don’t wash dishes. Sparkle up the kitchen. Let’s say someone has dented your fender and it’s going to cost you $500 to repair it. See the positive side. Use the cost of the repair to stimulate you into making twice that amount of money. Use the cost of the repair to stimulate you into doing something creative, something you would not have done had you not had the problem to trigger your desire to be creative. Instead of thinking of the dented fender, think of how you can earn an extra thousand dollars. There’s a positive side to all things. Sense the positive nature of the thing that you wish to develop. What is it that you wish to develop a positive viewpoint towards? Sense the positive nature of that thing. Do it now. Take your time. Get a strong visualization. What is it you wish to develop a positive viewpoint towards? Do that now. Relax. When something is making you unhappy, it’s generally your viewpoint of the event that is causing the unhappiness. If a thing is making you unhappy, change it. If you cannot change it, avoid it. If you cannot change or avoid, then change your viewpoint of the thing to a positive one and accept the thing. Relax. Love is a positive viewpoint. To use love as a force in your life, recognize that your viewpoint can be controlled by you. And by seeing other sides of the thing that is causing you unhappiness, you can… your viewpoint and then do the thing with joy and creativity. Repeat mentally. I feel better and better. I see the good in myself. I have a positive viewpoint toward myself. Every day, I get more and more confident in my own abilities. Relax. In a moment, I’m going to count from one to three. At that moment, you will open your eyes. You’ll be wide awake, feeling fine, and in perfect health, feeling better than before. One, two, coming out slowly now. At the count of three, you’ll open your eyes. You’ll be wide awake, feeling fine, and in perfect health, feeling better than before. Three, eyes open, wide awake, feeling fine, in perfect health, feeling better than before. It’s a wonderful feeling to be deeply relaxed, a very healthy state of being.
