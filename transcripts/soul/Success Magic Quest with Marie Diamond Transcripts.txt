LESSON 0: Intro 1: Welcome to Success Magic
--------------------
Welcome. My name is Marie Diamond, and I'm bringing you on a journey to success magic. In this journey, I'm going to help you how to start from your vision, your goals, how to create a vision board, and how to help your goals manifest in an easy and a wonderful way. This journey will help you to really get clarity on what is right now living in your life, what you want to manifest, and how to do the practical steps in this journey of manifestation. I call it success magic because it's a magical journey. Your life will transform, because you will have a very practical and magical journey that we are going to do together step by step. I'm going to guide you, so that you don't get lost in all the ideas that you have in your mind about what you want to do. You will have clarity, and through the clarity that will unfold, you will be able to do practical steps along the way with me. I will be your mentor to success magic, but you will be the one going through the different steps. You are going to use the law of attraction in a whole new level, because the law of attraction says that you need to focus on what your vision is. You need to take action steps, and you need to visualize the success that you desire. All these components are in this journey. The journey includes eight modules. The first module is about how to set your vision. In this module, you will connect in with the vision that you have, so that you will be able to achieve that vision, a vision of what you want to accomplish in your life. But I'm sure that you're not always clear about that vision, how to connect with it, how to manifest it, how to write it out. In this first module, I will help you to connect in with the vision of your soul. What have you agreed upon to come into this world? What have you agreed upon from your soul to manifest in this world? The second module is about goal setting. There are many ways to set your goals, but I'm going to give you the best way to set your goals because setting goals is about communicating to the universe. It is a special language. Goal setting is a magical language. It has to have the right words, the right concept, and also the right energy, so that the universe will hear you, will feel you, and will respond to you easily and fast. The third module goes about a power position, so that you can manifest your goals. You have to be in a power position in your life. You are like the queen or the king in your own life. You need to be on top. You need to be in the best power position to manifest your goals. In the fourth module, we're going to focus on your personal energy number and your success direction because when you are putting your goals and activate them in your success direction, you will go to the next level of manifesting your goals. In the fifth module, we're going to bring in your home, your environment, because your home is responsible for one-third of the law of attraction, so how your home is a three-dimensional vision board and how you need to align your home with your goals. That is what we are exploring in the fifth module. In the sixth module, we're going to create a real vision board, but the vision board you have never done before. It's a vision board combining feng shui and the law of attraction. In module seven, we're going to activate your vision board with the power of gratitude. And in the last module, we're going to release the old energy to open yourself up for the new information, the new goals, the new success in your life. Are you ready for success magic? Let's begin.

Success Magic

====================

LESSON 1: Set Your Vision
--------------------
Welcome to module one. This module is about setting your vision. All successful people have a vision about the success they want to achieve. Are you having one? Or are you just moving forward into your life without any direction? A vision is like a soul guidance so that you know everything you do, every action you take, every step on the way is helping you to go towards that vision. Success Magic is a journey but a journey without vision, you cannot even start. You cannot even start a soul journey towards your success magic without a vision. You need to know where you're going. It's like traveling. You just can't go on the road with your car left and right and hoping you end up in a beautiful place, but it's not guaranteed. But if you make a decision before you travel... Hey, I'm going to this place. I've always dreamed to go into that area. I always dream to go to that space, to this country, to this city. There's an excitement because you have a vision. You know where you are going. That is what a vision is about. A vision is like knowing what you want to accomplish at the end of the journey. My vision started when I was 15 years old. After a near death experience I came very clear on my vision. My vision was to enlighten more than 500 million people. A very simple sentence. I am here to enlighten more than 500 million people. A vision doesn't have to be very concrete. It can be very general, but still it makes sense to you. At that moment, I knew this was what I was going to do but I did not know how. A vision is not telling you the strategy. A vision is an image. A vision is not just a sentence. A vision is what you long for to manifest. It's like you know deep in your cell, you know deep in your heart this is what I'm here for. It's something that makes you excited and passionate. So what is it that you feel: I am here for this, I am born to do this? Could be that you have a great vision, an entrepreneurial vision for becoming very successful in your business. To sell a certain product or to share a certain service. It can be that your vision is to be the best mom and dad in the world. It can be that your vision is to help people in need. A vision is something so subjective, so close to your heart, it actually is in your heart. It's what your heart longs to do. But perhaps you have forgotten what that is. Perhaps you need to go back a little bit to yourself. And perhaps you have just started a career and you don't feel so happy about that career. Perhaps you are on a journey right now in a relationship, in a country, in a place where you are where you feel it's not where I am totally living my fullest life. A vision is really knowing what you are here for. So my question to you is, what are you here for? What is your soul coming to do in this world? Is your soul here to lose time? No, your soul is here to get into action. Your soul is here to manifest something greater than yourself. And a vision is something greater than you can imagine but it also is something to help, to impact the world. A vision is never about just you. A vision is about how you want to contribute to humanity, how you want to contribute to the world. So what is your vision? Perhaps you need to go back a little bit in yourself. Perhaps you need to take time for yourself. To really reconnect. Because life has been busy, life has perhaps been confusing. Perhaps life did not inspire you lately. And so now it's time to take time and listen to yourself. So I will ask you to take some time after this module and to take a piece of paper and to start writing, or to take your journal and to ask yourself, what is my vision? What I am here to do in this world? What is my contribution to the world? What is my contribution to humanity? I knew at 15 I was here to enlighten more than 500 million people. That sentence came to me in my near death experience. Now, thank God you don't have to go to a near death experience to know your vision but you do need to take time. You need to sit still. You need to stand still in your life. So I'm asking you to write that down. What are you here to contribute into the world? And perhaps you're already doing that in some way or some form. But my question is, are you doing that as a vision? Perhaps you're doing this next to your career, perhaps as a passion, perhaps as a free time, perhaps as a service to your community. And you feel each time you do this, you are so happy. There is this fire in you that you feel that when you do this, when you do this service, when you practice something, that this is really getting you to the next level. Every successful people I have met in my life they have a vision greater than themself. A vision that contributes to the world but also that sets them on fire. It sets them so much on fire they want to do it every day. And that is how when I wake up every morning I repeat my vision. So once you know your vision you want to connect with your vision. You want to say to yourself, I am here for, and repeat your vision. And then to ask, show me. Show me the steps. A vision is like a sun that hangs above you that shines on you every moment, and that you are connecting with with that light of that vision and say, show me the way, show me the path, show the light in front of me and lead me in my daily life to manifest that vision. So my question again, do you have a vision? Now, it's not something to break your mind over, right? It's not like, oh, I need to have my vision. What is it? Don't get depressed about it if you don't have one, right? You can already start with saying, my vision is to make a difference. That is already a very strong vision. To make a difference. To make a difference in your life, in the life of your family, of your community, of the world. By saying, I'm here to make a difference, you'll start filling in making difference by what, how? With who? And it will start unfolding. So already start writing down, I am here to make a difference. That is already quite a spectacular vision. And as you are getting used to say that you'll be able to start filling that in. Making a vision with, I dunno, connecting with children, supporting children, supporting mothers, supporting entrepreneurs. Whatever it is, it'll become clearer. Just accept, it's already about making a difference. Because every successful person always makes a difference, a positive difference. So you can even say, I'm here to make a positive difference in the world. Sometimes we have to go back to when we were younger. I remember when I started connecting with how do I want to manifest my vision? I went back to when I was young. And I did a lot of things when I was young but there was one thing that always stood out. I loved teaching. I loved teaching people. And so you need to perhaps go back to your childhood and what did you love doing? Something you wanted to do hours, days. It didn't matter how long, but each time you did it your heart was on fire, you were excited about life. So for me, it was teaching. And I literally had 40 dolls placed in front of me when I was teaching. And I had this chalkboard and I was teaching math and English and religion. And everything I learned that day I needed to teach my dolls every day. Now I'm still teaching because that is my way to enlighten the world. I was doing meditation with my dolls and I'm still meditating with people. But now you are the one I'm sharing my information to. So the Success Magic journey I'm leading you on will be how to first connect in with your vision is by asking the right questions and start writing about it. And then to concise it, to put it together in one sentence. A sentence that when you read it, a sentence when you speak it out loud, it feels right to you. Sometimes people don't even know what their vision is but if they ask people around them, what do you think that my vision is? They will know it for you. What you are telling the world, how you have been helping the people around you is already part of your vision. And perhaps you just don't see it but others around you can see it sometimes better than you. So connect with it, take time for it, write it down. And then once you have written it down, share it with the people around you and see how they respond. And they're like, yeah, that's so you. When people start saying that you are on the right track. And sometimes it'll be surprising for the people around you because they're like, oh, I did not know that part of you. I only knew you as a career person but I didn't know you had this passion. Because what if from the vision you have you can manifest it in such a way that it becomes successful. And what if you could even be that vision nonstop in everything you do and even make your career out of it? And make even abundance flow coming towards you from fulfilling your vision? Wouldn't that be the best thing ever? So this is exactly what I want you to think about and to be enthusiastic about. A vision is not something to be too serious about but to feel enthusiastic about, like my God, this is my vision. When I talk to people I always ask them, what is your vision? And 99% of the people don't know what to say. All successful people I have met they always can tell you exactly what their vision is. I want to have a computer for everyone. I want every family to have a car. I want all the women of Africa to have financial means to create a business. I want everyone to have access to water. These are some great visions that successful people have gotten over the years. And because they had a vision they had a pathway, they had a guidance. So that once you have a vision, every decision you're going to make needs to connect in with that vision. When I'm doing a course, when I am teaching, when I'm doing a seminar, when I'm creating a product I am always connecting decisions with my vision. Is it aligning with my vision? Then the answer is, yes, I'm going to do this. I said yes to this journey of Success Magic because I know I'm going to help you to enlighten yourself. You are one of my more than 500 million people. So the answer is easy, it's yes. But so many proposals are coming my way. When that proposal and my vision do not align, then it's easy, the answer is no, cause your vision is your guiding line so that you will be always knowing exactly what are your next steps. Now the next step is to go in a practice moment so that you'll be able to gather, to find your vision. So I see you at the practice session.

Lesson 1 Meditation: Set Your Vision
--------------------

Visualize that crystal white light comes from the center of the universe.
Filling your whole body from your head to your feet.
Allowing the light to be present. Relax
your body and
all that is light in you remains and all that is less than light
fear emotions worries stress release now that less than light
Visualize now the color rose to be all around you.
The color rose stands for the unconditional love and support that is in the universe
for you.
And accept now that you're loved and there is this unconditional support for your
vision.
Visualize the violet light coming from under your feet, clockwise spinning through
your body and aura field. Inviolet stands for letting go of all past judges.
Take on all these judgments and
clear them by visualizing this violent light going above your head into the universe.
Take a deep breath in and
take a deep breath out.
Imagine now that you have a magical hat on and the top of your magical hat is an
arm linked above your head and
there is a bright white light that
you can focus on on top of your magical head.
This is your quantum point.
The place where you have access to your highest self.
And visualize now connecting with that point of light that you're in an open space
in nature with this harmony and peace,
a place where when you are there, you feel you are in that highest light.
top of a hill, top of a mountain.
And when you're standing on top of that mountain,
you see 360 degrees around you
and see as far as possible
over other mountains, over valleys,
Speak your vision into existence,
into the world around you,
and see the energy of your vision travel to
the people that need to connect in with your vision.
so your vision can manifest and
see from all over the response, the signals coming back to you.
And as you're standing on top of the mountain,
be open in your heart and your mind to receive the support the next steps a
message to
support and manifest your vision
take a deep breath in and out. And allow now the response of the universe coming
to you and
then gently walk back over the pathway to the place in nature where you started
integrating
the information, the knowledge that you received on top of the mountain.
Take a deep breath in and out, bring your hands together, move your hands,
bring your warm hands in front of your eyes, open your eyes and gently let go of
your hands.
End of the first meditation.

--------------------
Lesson 1 Practice:
--------------------

Welcome to the practice for module one, how to set your vision.
So take a piece of paper or take your journal and I'm going to ask you to answer
some questions. Are you ready?
First question is, What is the vision for your life?
And as you answer this, you can start with writing, I am here for,
and then fill something in. You can stop the video any time you want to just write
things down. Take three to five lines as you're writing because there can be many
things. You can do bullet points, but what are you here for?
to humanity.
Write that down.
Perhaps your contribution is in your family. It's in your community.
As you're writing that all down and you can stop the video anytime you want so you
can continue writing, but write at least three to four lines. You can do bullet
points and just feel what comes up in you. And each time you have written
something, take a deep breath in and take a deep breath out and feel it.
Is this okay? Does it sit right with you? Do you feel it's aligned?
And then keep writing.
Now you have written quite a few sentences down. And I want you to take now the
time to take the paper, to take your journal and read it out loud
with a clear voice,
like you're telling it to the universe, you're telling it to somebody else and see
which one resonates the most because just reading your vision is different than
speaking your vision.
As you're speaking it out loud, do you feel like there's a happy feeling in you?
Or you feel like, yeah, it's kind of okay.
When you feel it resonates in your heart, make a little mark there and say,
yes, that is a good one.
And try to come to two, three sentences that really resonate and keep reading it
out loud till you feel you have two, three sentences that really resonate with your
heart.
And then try to bring them all together, perhaps do one clear sentence,
one clear message. I am here for.
Wonderful.
So I invite you to listen to the meditation about the vision.

====================

LESSON 2: Set Your Goals
--------------------
Welcome to module two. This is a module how to set your goals. I love the word goal because it has two components to it. Go, all. It actually says go all. Go all in. A lot of people start setting goals and they're holding back. You know that the energy that the universe uses to create small goals or large goals, it's the same energy. So, why don't you set some bigger goals? Because bigger goals are as easy to manifest for the universe as small goals. In the first module, we went into setting your vision. Your vision is your guideline, and the goals are now creating the right steps to get to your vision. I compared getting a vision to know which is the destination of your traveling. But before you get to your travel destination, you have to do some practical goals. You make decisions about how to get there, with who you're going to travel there, what time you're traveling there, what you bring in your luggage. All these little details of your travel, these are actually your goals. So I'm going to ask you to write down some goals, and I'm going to give you a strategy, how to set goals that do manifest easier and faster. Goals are all about your soul directing you in which direction to go. So that's why we're going to use the word I am to start your goal. When you write goals, you always have to be in the present tense. The vision is something that you're going to manifest, I hope, by the end of your life and, if possible, sooner. Goals are things that are manifesting from right now. They're manifesting here and now. That is why goals are always written in the present tense. You don't write goals as like, one day, in the future, I will manifest this, or once upon a day. Goals are no fairy tales. Goal are practical steps you know you need to accomplish in order to achieve your vision. That is why we write the goals always in a present tense, and we start with the word I. The word I, but capital I, connects in with your soul. It's not a small i. It's not the little ego that writes your goals. These are goals written from your soul. That is why, in the meditation, I'm going to connect you with your soul vibration so that you'll start writing your goals from that perspective, so that you're going to start writing your goals from a soul energy and not from the ego. What's the difference? When we write goals from the ego, we are connecting with fear. We're writing goals out of limitations, out of blockages, out of what life is at this moment. When we write from our soul, we connect in with our purpose, with our vision. We're thinking unlimited. So when you start writing your goals, you will write the word I and AM and all in capital. 'Cause when you write I and AM, subconsciously, you're actually saying to your soul, it's up to you now. The divine in me can speak. The divine in me can express itself through the goals I am setting up. Like, I am a successful entrepreneur. I am a coach that helps hundreds of people. I am a wonderful mom to my children. This is how you write in a good way the goals. Because each time you say I am, you're always connecting in with your vision. Remember your vision that you have created in your first module? Make sure that vision is in front of you. Read your vision again. Speak it out loud before you write your goals. Many people ask me, "How many goals do I have to write?" Well, as many as you can. You can write them down on a piece of paper. You can write them down in your journal. But make sure you keep track of your goals. So start, at least, with writing five goals down about success. In the Success Magic, we're going to really focus on success, first of all, in your career, in how you express your gifts and your talents. So write down five goals on this. I am, and you fill in the rest of the sentence. Write down five goals about money, your abundance, your income flows. Write down five goals about your health and wellbeing. Five goals about your relationships. And you can say I do five goals on your personal relationships. That is about your romance. It's about your family, your friends. And you can also write down five goals on your professional relationships with your clients, your colleagues, your team. I also invite you to write five goals on your wisdom. And wisdom is all about goals about what you want to educate, how do you want to motivate, inspire you, and even how you want to express your spirituality. So in total, you have about 25 goals you have written down. You can say, "Well, that is a lot." Well, you start with writing five for each one. Success and money, health, relationships, and wisdom. 'Cause we're going to use that later on in one of the next modules, how to activate your environment to align with your goals and also how to set up your vision board. Because when you don't have goals, how can you make a vision board? So when you write about success and money, perhaps you want to put in some numbers. Like, I want an income flow of this amount of money. I want savings of this amount of money. I am receiving income streams that total this kind of money. So as you're writing numbers down, always think that numbers are very crucial. Numbers are very important for the universe. As I always say, the universe is a mathematician. It loves numbers. But always make sure you add more to it. So when you write down a number, and you say, for example, I am receiving as monthly income so much in your currency that you want to put on, make sure you always write down and more. Because, as you put in numbers, you're really limiting yourself. So it's possible you're saying, "Well, that is what I feel that I can make right now." But when you say that, you actually are connecting with your ego. Because the ego is saying you can only do that limited amount, while the soul is saying, "Really? "What if there is more?" So always write down, when you put numbers down, and more. Let's say on relationships, you want to reach people. You want to have friends, or you want people on your social media, or you want people following you on social media. Let's say you're saying, "I am reaching through my Instagram 10,000 people." Write on it and more. Because when you say a certain number, you always make that decision out of your analytical mind. You're thinking, "Well, that is a good number." But the universe is saying, "What if you can have more?" So always, when you do numbers, make sure you add and more because then you're expanding yourself. You're giving yourself permission to do more. So you have written now your goals, and I want you to read them out loud. Because, as you're writing them, you're kind of connecting from your mind energy, but I want you to feel it. So stand up. Don't sit down. Just stand up and read them out loud, like you are saying it to the universe. You're saying it to God. And you can even ask somebody to play God and play the universe in front of you so to see how you respond to that energy. And make sure that that other person that is sitting there is sitting there with a big smile because the universe is always smiling on your goals. So as you are speaking out your goals, speak them out not from your mind, but speak them out from your heart and say them with enthusiasm, say them with passion. Speak them with fire. I am an international best-selling author. I am well and healthy. So as you're speaking these sentences, you will feel the magic starts happening. Because the universe does not just want to see them. The universe wants to hear them. But when you say your goals, speak them out loud with passion, with love, with happiness, and with a conviction. Speak them out loud with confidence and say them as you mean it, that you know it will manifest. If you start saying like, "I am an international best-selling author," with fear in your voice, the universe will hear that and say, "No, she's not ready. "He's not ready. He's in fear for it." So speak them out loud, and in the beginning, it will be a little bit difficult because you're like, it feels like not real. It feels like you're faking it because they haven't manifested it, because you're saying them in the present tense, I am. I remember one day, I was flying to America, and somebody asked me, "Who are you?" And I said, "I'm an international best-selling author." But there was a little bit of trembling in my voice. And the person said, "You sure?" And I started all over, and I said, "Yes, I am an international best-selling author." And this person said, "Oh, wonderful. Tell me more." And this is what the universe will tell you. It will say, "Tell me more." And I was speaking about that I was going to do books and courses about feng shui and meditation and about success and the Law of Attraction. And this man said, "Oh, amazing. "I can't wait to read your books." That's the energy the universe needs to get from you. The universe says, "I can't wait to manifest this for you." "I can't wait to manifest this for you." If you have that enthusiasm as you read out your goals, the universe goes into the modes of manifestation. Because, as you're speaking it out loud, you are exactly starting the magic. As you're speaking out loud, the magic starts unfolding and manifesting easy and fast. So once you have your goals written down in a journal, on a piece of paper, it's not just that you read them out once. Try to read them out several times. Try to read them out regularly. Some people will say, read them out at least 21 days consecutive or 30 days consecutive. But I would say, each time you can, read them out loud, but each time with a lot of enthusiasm. Because when you do that, it's like an energy starts unfolding in you. You're opening up your mind, you're opening up your heart, and you're opening up a portal to the universe. Because the more you are believing it, and the word believing holds the word be living it. The more you're living it, the better it's going to be. And even take time as you're reading out your goal with this confidence and with this conviction. You can even close your eyes for a second and see the image in your inner mind, in your inner eye. See the image as it already has happened. See yourself as this best-selling author. See yourself as having so much followers. See yourself being a wonderful mom. See yourself in a romantic relationship. When you can put together the goal and the image and you align them together, that is how magic starts flowing faster. That is how the Success Magic unfolds. So write down the goal, speak it out loud, take a deep breath in, and see in your inner eye it already is manifested. Some of you will ask, "Can I write more than 20, more than 25 goals?" Of course, you can. I even will suggest you write at least 100 goals down. Successful people have more than 100 goals. Why would you limit yourself? But you can say, "Well, I don't know how it will unfold." That is what Success Magic is about. You do not need to know the how. Do you think I knew how I was going to reach millions of people? How could I know at 15 what my vision was? Each time I write my goals, I don't know how it will unfold, but I am telling the universe clearly, this is my goal, and I allow the universe to unfold the plan, the goal for me. I wrote down, "I am a successful teacher on Mindvalley "in meditation and spiritual practices." This was one of my goals. I didn't know how this was going to unfold, but the image, the energy is picked up by the universe and then people respond. That is where the magic is. So write down your goals, be open to manifest, and let the universe unfold. Just do your practice, and the universe must respond. That is the law. That is the Law of Attraction. You take action, and the attraction starts unfolding because you're clear, because you're convinced, and it matches what you believe in, and then the magic of the universe unfolds for you. I'm looking forward to have you with me in the module two, Goal Setting Practice, so that together we are practicing what you just have learned today. See you there.

--------------------
Lesson 2 Practice: Set Your Goals (Practice)
--------------------

Welcome to the practice on goal setting. You just have been watching the video on goal setting. Now let’s get practicing. So I want you first to get an Oreo journal or a blank piece of paper. And get a pen. The best is to take a beautiful pen, a gold-looking pen or a blue pen, because these are colors of success. And as you’re going to write your goals, make sure there is space around you so you don’t want any chaos. You cannot sit on a desk with a lot of files, a lot of books around you. Make sure there’s space all around you. Don’t sit in the kitchen. Success is not made in the kitchen. So sit on your desk or in your living space. And as you’re sitting like this… Make sure there is calm energy around you. Perhaps you want to put on some background music, but make sure there’s no kids running around, the television is out, your phone is off, so that you have a space and silence around you. Goal setting is serious business. No, it’s not. It just means that you need to honor the space. Honor the space around you because goal setting is really telling the universe, communicating with the universe what you want to manifest. Before you start writing, do the meditation or do any kind of meditation that aligns you with your soul. So take a few deep breaths in and out to calm your energy, to get focused. Whatever you want to do to align yourself with the highest vibration in you, after you have done that, start writing down your goals for success. Make sure you have five goals you can write down. It’s the goals to express your success in your career, in your professional life, in what is success for you, in what you want to be successful at. Always write in the present tense. I am and you fill in the line. And as you’re writing it down, just allow it to flow. You don’t have to be too analytical. Just whatever comes up, you write it. If you have more than five goals, write more than five down. If you want, you can stop the video now and first write your five goals on success. Now you can write down five goals on your finances, on money, abundance, income streams, savings, anything you want to accomplish in a financial way. And again, you write down five steps minimum, I am, and you fill in the rest. When you write down numbers and currencies, I am receiving so much for my career. I am receiving so much for my monthly income. Always write down after it and more so that you open the energy up so that the universe can give you more than you ask for. You can stop the video if you wish right now till you have finished your five goals on money. Now it’s time to write five goals on your health and your well-being. I am. And you write down things about your physical health and well-being, your emotional, your mental, and even your spiritual health and well-being. Now it’s time for you to write goals about relationships. You can divide the goals about relationships into personal relationships like relationship with your partner, your romantic partner, with your children, with your family, with your friends, and also professional relationships, like with your clients, with your team, with your colleagues. You can write down goals on personal relationships or goals on your professional relationships, or you can bring them all together in the first five. It’s up to you. You can stop the video now to write your goals. And last is to write five goals on your wisdom. Wisdom is all about, perhaps, goals you have in what you want to educate yourself about, what you still want to learn in life. It can be goals about your spiritual growth and your self-help journey. It can be goals about your connection with your spiritual teacher or your church. It’s all about education, knowledge. and religion and spirituality. So write down at least five goals, I am, and fill in the blanks. And you can stop the video if you want to. Now you have created a lot of goals. I invite you now to stand up, to take your paper, your journal, and to read out every goal with passion and confidence. as you’re saying it and speaking it into manifestation. You’re speaking it into existence. And after you have set that goal, close your eyes for a second and see that goal manifesting. See it as it already is existing. See it as it already is manifested in your inner eye. And in the beginning, it’s not always so easy to see that image, but try to see an image. Once you have that image, say the next sentence. Open your eyes and say it out loud. And again, close your eyes and see the manifestation in action. Once you have all done this, say an ending sentence. And say to the universe, I thank you. I thank you for manifesting. my goals here and now. So end with I am manifesting my goals here and now. Thank you. Whatever you write and say at the end, it must be a gratitude to the manifestation power of the universe. You did an amazing job. This was amazing. I’m looking forward to be with you. in the meditation about your goal setting.

LESSON 3: Find Your Power Position
--------------------
Welcome. This is module three. Today I'm going to share with you about a power position. All successful people position themself in a power position. This is the major feng shui principle to align yourself, in any environment, with success. It's not just having a vision, setting your goals, but making sure that your body is always aligned with success. That in every place you are sitting, you are sleeping, you are living, you always are aligning your body vibration with the energy of success. This is what we call the power position. When you look at a king, a queen, an emperor, a president, they always will position themself in such a way, in every space, that they are the strongest energy. That everyone is always connecting with them. So how can you do that where you are living? Because I want you to be the queen or the king in your life, in your professional and personal life, so that every second of the day, you are aligning your energy with the flow of success that a universe is bringing to you. You have been asking for success with your vision and your goals. Now you have to open yourself to that success and sitting yourself in a power position does that. A power position is about sitting yourself up, in any room you are, in such a way that you can see the door. So let's say I am here in a space. I need to be able to see the door. The door is in front of you, a little bit to the side but cannot be behind you, because when you have a door behind you, you are not sitting as a queen or a king. So in every room you are awake, working, living, dining. You always position yourself that you can see the door. The door is where people come in. Even if you're saying, "Well, nobody comes in there, Marie." Still the energy comes there. It follows the human energy. Perhaps you're saying, "But I love seeing my view, Marie. I love seeing the window." You can see the window, if at the same time you can also see the door. But if you position yourself in such a way that you can see the window and the door is towards the back of you, you are not in a queen or king's position. Abundance can only come when you see the door. When the door is behind you, you are in what we call a poverty energy. You cannot see the flow of money coming in. When you set yourself up this way, something changes in your mind. When you are seeing the door, your whole vibration becomes strong. Your chakras get aligned easier. Your brain waves go from beta vibration into alpha. When you have beta brainwaves, you are not so concentrated. You are more closed off to the energy of abundance and creativity. You are easier overwhelmed. It's harder to concentrate and to focus. When you are in an alpha brainwave, you are open with your mind. You see easier solutions. You can think outside of the box. You're more optimistic, concentrated, and focused. So when you can put yourself in a position that your mind is always open, then it'll be easier for you to see the opportunities, see the possibilities and hear the proposals and connect with people as a successful person. So practical. How does that work? Let's start with your living room or your family area. Make sure your couch is set up in such a position that when you're sitting on the couch that you see the people coming into your living space. You do not have to see the front door, but you have to see people coming from the front door going into your living space, so you can welcome them. 'Cause when you welcome the energy, you welcome the results of your goals. You are welcoming what a universe is bringing to you. So make sure when you walk into your living room, it's not your TV that is in the power position and you're sitting on the couch with your back to the door because then the television has all the power and you should have the power position. So turn your couches around in such a way that you can always see who comes in, even if nobody would come in. It's about the principle of being open. At your dining room area, make sure you are always sitting in such a way that you can see where the food comes from, because then you see where the energy comes from. Where people come in with the food towards the dining room area. Do not allow your children to be in a power position because they will be more powerful than you and you are the one that needs to attract the success for the whole family. The next step is where you work. And it's possible you have your own office, your own workspace. Perhaps you are sitting at the dining room table. Wherever you are working in your house or in an office or a workspace, make sure your desk is positioned that you can see the door. It can be straight towards the door, it can be at a little angle, but you always have to make sure you have a peripheral view of who comes in. So if the door is literally left or right from you, you cannot see them. If the door is behind you, you cannot see people coming in. So put yourself in that power position in your office, in your workspace, and I'm telling you, your life will shift, your success will change. The first time I did that was in my first job as a lawyer and I was sitting with my back to the manager and she didn't see me. Literally any proposal I had, she was always denying it. And one day I just changed my desk around so I could see her walking by. And each time after that, whatever I proposed, each time she said yes to it. Even till the point that six months later, as she went to a new level in her career, I became the manager. You can also get your power position in your bedroom. When you wake up, you want to see the door. When the door is to the side of you or behind you, you are weakening your positioning and that means you will have less possibility to attract a successful, loving partner. So when you wake up, when you see the door, romance can come in, the gifts of the universe can come to you. Even when you meditate, even when you do any practice, make sure you always see the door so that the universe can bring all the gifts and results of your goal setting. The second part of the power position is you want to have space in front of you. You do not only want to see the door, you want to make sure there is enough space in front of you so that all the gifts of of the universe can be delivered to you. So if you're sitting on the desk, make sure that you are not sitting with your desk against a wall, because then literally you are hitting the wall. You actually can never be successful this way because there's no space for money, for people to come to you. You are literally hitting a financial wall. Even if you would face the wall and you can see the door, that is not enough. You need to take your desk a step back, as far as possible in the room, so that people can sit on the other side of you. When you do that, you'll be more rewarded, you'll be more promoted, you'll be more recognized for your work and your success. Magic will start happening. Part of the power position is also that you make sure you have a strong support behind you. Think about the queen and a king. They are seeing the people coming into the space. There's space in front of them for people to sit down and they always have a strong support. They have a throne where they're sitting on. They have a baldachin, they have a wall behind them. So when you're sitting on the desk, have a high back chair, even with armrests, because then you're actually becoming the king, the queen, of your professional life. In your bedroom, make sure you have a strong headboard so you can sit up against it and you feel like a queen or a king in your romantic life. On your dining room table, make sure you have high back chairs so that you are dining as a queen or a king. What it creates, it creates a psychological energy for you to feel successful, constantly. Not just to have goals, but that you live successfully by being in a power position. I'm looking forward to be with you on the practice video so that together we are going to set up your home, your office, to create success magic. See you there.

Lesson 3 Meditation: Find Your Power Position
--------------------

Welcome to the power position meditation. I invite you to sit now in a relaxed position, but in your power position. So make sure your chair or the place where you sit is set up in such a way that you can see the incoming flow through the door, even if you’re closing your eyes for the meditation. And feel how your body is relaxing. And feel the strength of that space. And take a deep breath in and out. And connect now with the crystal white light from the center of the universe. And feel your whole body from your head to your feet. Relaxing every muscle, your nervous system, every organ feels balanced. And your whole aura field feels the power of the universe. And feel that light coming all around you in your whole aura field. And we’re tapping into the power that is in the universe. And allow that power now to come with that light in you. Breathe into that power. breathe into that manifestation power that you have that is present here and now and feel your alignment between the universe your body and the earth and feel that divine power connecting through your feet connect now consciously with your vision and feel your vision in your heart space and send out now that vision through this portal of success into the universe. Speak it, feel it, be it into existence and be open now to receive back through this portal of success answers, messages, energy, guidance. Focus now consciously on your success and money goals and connect them with your heart space and send them from your heart through the success portal into the universe, asking to receive energy, messages, guidance back through that portal in your awareness now or in the future. This portal is always open. Whenever you are connecting with your vision and goals, face your direction of success and connect in with the universe. It’s the open channel of sending and receiving, of asking and allowing. There is no resistance in this channel. The road is open. to send and it’s open to receive. And the receiving can be in energy you feel, in a symbol you see, in a message, in an awareness. That depends from you or even every day will be different. What have you received now? Make a note of that in your journal after. the meditation. Bring your hands together. Move your hands. Bring your warm hands in front of your eyes. Open your eyes and gently let go of your hands. In that bright white light that is present there, you connect with your soul power. You are in direct alignment with the power of the universe. When you open your eyes, Stay focused on that point so that you’re not only in the physical three-dimensional world positioned in your power position, that you’re not only in the three-dimensional environment sitting in a power position, but that your whole energy field is connected with the power position of your soul. Bring your hands together. Move your hands. Bring your hands in front of your eyes. Open your eyes and gently let go of your head.

--------------------
Lesson 3 Practice: Find Your Power Position
--------------------

Welcome to the practice video on power position. Together we’re going to go through your home to see if you’re each time in a power position. So I invite you to take me with you into, first of all, your living space. And I want you to sit down in the normal place that you’re sitting to be with your family, to watch television, to be with your children. I’m sure there is a sofa or place on your couch where you always love to sit. So why don’t you sit there right now, and as you’re sitting there, look around, and do you see the door coming from the hallway? Perhaps there’s another door to your kitchen, but that’s not the one I want you to focus on. It’s the door if people would enter your house, enter your apartment, and then from the hallway they come into your living space. Do you see that door? If you see that door, check, you’re good, you have your power position. It is possible that you see on a different couch or a different place on the couch even more the incoming energy. So try another position if you see more clearly the people walking in. Then from now on choose that position to sit down. If you have been sitting down and you don’t see the door because the door is left or right from you, it’s not in your peripheral view. The peripheral view is literally in front of you 45 degrees left and 45 degrees right. It’s not 90 degrees left because that’s here or 90 degrees right because that is off. That is not correct. Or even if your door is… on the left and right of you or behind you, then you are not in a power position. You’re in a weak position. And in that weak position you attract poverty and not abundance. So when you’re having that situation in your living room, try to figure out if you would change. your couch, change your sofa, or position yourself in a different way so you can create the best possible way to see the incoming energy. Yes, it can be that you need to change your television around, but you know, that’s an easy thing to do. But creating power position is always priority. Are you sitting in a good direction right now? So change it around. If not, Try to feel it and you will see you will never go back to the original situation if the original is a poverty position, if the original is not good. Because you will feel you’re in control. You feel that things are coming to you. There’s space in front of you. You see the gifts, the results of your goals coming to you. Now, let’s go to the space where you are working. It could be that you are working at home, on the couch, on the dining room table, or you have your own working space, an office in your home. Or perhaps it’s outside of your home, and you can take the video with you in your office or your workspace outside of your home. So now you are in your workspace. Sit where you’re normally sitting to work, to make phone calls, to write. You’re sitting down. you’re looking up, do you see the door in front of you, to the side of you? Or do you see the door completely on the side of you or behind you? Then you are not in a power position. So when you’re seeing the door, check, that is amazing. It is possible you even want to change your position a little bit in a different way so you can even see the door better. If you just see it on the side like this and you perhaps can turn it around so you can look straight on it, it’s even better. The straighter you can see the door, the stronger your power position. If it’s behind you or to the side of you, take your desk and turn it around in such a way that you can see the door in your peripheral view. Now, I can imagine some of you are saying, Marie, I cannot change it. It’s built in the desk. In that case, I would suggest to get a little mirror and to put that mirror left or right of you on the wall so that you can see what’s happening behind you. Now, this is not a perfect way. The perfect way is always to change your desk, your working area. But if that is not possible because it’s a built-in area or you are in a workspace that has built-in desks, this is the alternative. You put left or right of you a mirror to see what’s going on behind you. Let’s go to your bedroom right now. So you’re in your bedroom. I want you to lay down. And now I want you to sit up. And as you’re sitting up, do you see the door? Is the door in front of you or to the side of you? When that’s the case, check. You are good. You are sleeping in a power position. When the door is to the left and right of you or behind you, you are in a poverty position and you need to change your bed against another wall so you can see the door when you wake up. Now you have realigned. all the positions. Make sure there’s also space in front of you, especially where you’re working, that you are not putting your desk against the wall, but there is space between you and the door so people can come in and sit on the other side of your desk. Also, make sure that you have some strong support behind you, a high back chair or a headboard. where you can lean on. You are now in a power position during the day, in your social life, in your working environment and during the night while you’re sleeping. I’m looking forward to have you with me in the meditation on the power position.

====================

LESSON 4: Find Your Energy Number & Success Direction
--------------------
Welcome back, we are now in module number four and I'm going to share with you how to use the power of the energy number and your personal best direction. The information I'm going to share with you is based on the ancient knowledge of feng shui. Your personal energy number will help you to understand based on your energy archetype, what is your mission, what is you are here to come to do into the world? It'll help you with your vision, with your goal setting but also with that person energy number and your personal success direction, we're going to align your goals in the best area of your environment and even how to set up your vision board. So the first thing that you need to know is that based on your birthday and your birth gender, there is a calculation that needs to be done to find out your energy number. And the energy numbers goes from one till nine and each number has an energy archetype and explains what your soul is here to do and to manifest. So how can you find out, based on your energy number, there's also a success direction that connects with it. A success direction is a compass direction and there are eight compass directions from north, northeast, southeast, south, west, southwest, northwest that actually connects with you, that aligns with you. And we're going to use that success direction to place there your goals of success, so that even when you are not focused on them, when you are not speaking them out in existence, that your home, your environment will help them to manifest. So this is a part of success magic that is so powerful. This is what I have used my whole life to manifest my vision, my goals into existence so that my environment is helping me to manifest things faster and easier than ever before. Are you ready for that? So let's go with the first step. I will ask you to download a Marie Diamond app because we're going to use this in the next modules too. So you download a Marie Diamond app for your iPhone or your Android and then you'll be able to fill in your birthday and your gender. So you have to choose male or female. So you will have to put in your gender at birth, male or female. So you have to click male or female and then you have to click on your birthday and you have to put in your day, your month and your year of birth. Click on done. And then it says reveal my energy number. Click on that and you will get a compass On top of that space, you will see about your number. So my number is five because I put in my information and I can click on the arrow and the arrow says, your archetype is called The Connector and it gives the essence of The Connector and also some famous people that your energy number is with. But it also says your best directions. And I click on the arrow again and you see you have a little compass here and that compass is connect with compass in your phone and is actually able to move. Yeah, so when you hold the compass you will see that there is a blue angle and it says the word success on it. For me, that is southwest. For you, it can be east, it can be northeast, north, south, west, depending on your energy number and the calculation. So as for me it says Southwest, it means that I'm a connector and that is so true. I love connecting the dots. I love connecting with people. Many people always say, you are an amazing networker. I love making sure that I introduce people to each other because I have that generous heart of just making sure that people connect in the right way with each other. So I'm a connector. But it's possible that you are an energy number one. When you're energy number one, you are the wealth creator. You love creating wealth, not just for yourself but also for others. Now wealth can be many things, but it's always that you love to give people more and to help them achieve a higher level of their existence. So when you're energy number two, you are the teacher, the writer. You love to share information with the world. When you're energy number three, you are the bringer of light. You love to be in the spotlight or you love helping others to be in the spotlight and to feel more confident and to have higher self-esteem. It's possible you love being entertaining or to help entertainers on your journey. Energy number fours are called the managers. They're really good at managing projects, people and also to create strategy. I sometimes call them the strategists because they know how to start a project and how to end the project and they're very detail oriented. The energy number fives, if they are men, they are the same as energy number two, the teachers, and if they are women, they are the same as as energy number eight, the connectors. When you energy number six, you're called the creator, the inventor. You're so creative, you have new ideas all the time and you love to think outside of the box. When you're energy number seven, you're called the advisor. The advisor is all about advising people. They are always looked out for their coaching and their mentoring and they love to travel. They can see beyond what other people can see. They can see the bigger picture. The number eights are the female number fives, there are the connectors. They love to see how things work together. They love connecting people, I call them mothers because they love the networking, they love to bring people together. And the energy number nines are the healers. They are able to heal the past. They love to make sure people feel better. And that can be both on physical level, emotional, mental and spiritual level. So depending on your energy number, you will have a personal success direction that is different. If you're energy number one, your success direction is southeast, when you're energy number two, your success direction is northeast. Energy number threes their success direction is south. Energy number four, your success direction is north. Energy number five, if you're a man, it's the same as energy number two, you are northeast a success direction. And in number five female have the southwest as success direction. When you are number six and you are the creator, your success direction is connecting with the west. The number seven is connected with Northwest. Energy number eight, the connectors, it's all focused success towards the southwest and the energy number nines, they have east as success direction. So now you know your different directions but the most important thing is that you go back to your app and you see where your blue angle is. That is where your success direction is. So what you will do is you will hold the compass, this app, on the level of your heart, not too close to your body, just kind of like this and you will stand in the center of a space. I'll ask you to first start with the center of your living space. So you imagine there's a center point and as you're standing there, you will see where your success direction is focused towards. So let's say it's that direction, kind of not in front of you, but to the side of you. For some of you it'll be be towards the back of you. So then look and turn yourself so you are in alignment with that success direction. If it's to the left of you, you turn around till you are aligned with your success direction. You'll see your compass will move with you. As you're then looking at your success direction, so let's say it's in front of you right now. I want you to look at what is there at this moment. If there's a lot of clutter, a lot of boxes and a lot of things, just release that, make it first clean and clear. 'Cause success cannot happen when things are in this order in this way, because your success direction is a portal to success. So even if you are not aligned with your success, with your goals, you can actually use your environment through this principle of feng shui, to make sure that your portal to success and that's one of these directions. Success can be east, north, south, east and west depending on your energy number. So based on your energy number you know your success direction and your focus on it, what hangs there, what stands there, what is representing there? Is that expressing your success? Let's say it's an image of boats stranded in the harbor and there's no water around them anymore. Is that an image of success? No, it's an image of being stuck. If it's an image of a desert with sand and cacti, do you think that is a symbol of success? No, it shows that success has dried up. There's nothing there. So any image that is in your success direction is like a 24 hour portal of signals to the universe. So if anything is there that doesn't represent your success take it away and put items and energy that can be connecting with your success. Like it can be books on success, it can be pictures of success, it can be certificates it can be something you look at and you feel just happy. Could be an image of traveling where you felt so abundant and so rich and so amazing, place that there. Wealth and richness and success is not only an image of it, it must feel like this. Then go to your workspace and especially in your workspace you need to focus on your success direction. So make sure you stand in the center of your office or the space where you work. Look where your success direction is, look at the compass and then align yourself. Turn yourself towards that success energy. And as you're doing that, look at what is there, especially in your workspace. It must be aligned with your success. In my success direction, in my office, I have all my books, all my courses, I have a picture of Vishen Lakhiani, I have images of successful people I work with. I have books on success. I have my certificates hanging there, but I also have there my goals laying down or I place there my journal. 'Cause as I place it there, even if I am consciously not connecting with my success, my home is holding the space for me to manifest that success 24 hours a day, nonstop. It's like my marketing place for success into the universe. So what is in your success direction right now? Clean out whatever is not supporting your success and start looking around you. You have, I'm sure books on success, courses you are connecting with on success and abundance. Put pictures of successful people. Perhaps you have a logo, you have certificates, you have products. Make a success altar, put a table or put a cabinet with your files in there and put on top of it things you can physically see with your eyes. So even if you're not looking at it, the universe is looking at it all the time. If you're sleeping, if you're going somewhere else, there is an anchor point of success. This is an amazing tool of success magic. You can also look at your success in your bedroom but in a bedroom you're not so focused on success, you're more focused on health, on romance. But you can indeed put a little altar out with items and books to create success. But let's not make it an office place. Another thing that is very important for a success direction is that when you are making phone calls, when you're doing major meetings, try to not just see your door, the incoming door, but try also to face, to look at that success direction. So in this room, right, I am facing my success direction so I'm speaking to you, but I'm also invoking and connecting in with my success energy. When you are focusing and speaking towards your success direction, face the direction of your success and speak them into existence. This way you are not just aligning your goals in yourself with your mind, but you are aligning your goals with your success portal into the universe. We're going to use more of that in the next modules. This is how you can already connect in with your success magical place in your environments. I'm looking forward to be with you in the practice video on the energy number and the success direction. See you there.

Lesson 4 Meditation: Energy Number & Success Direction 
--------------------

Welcome to the meditation. Before you start please sit in a position that you are facing your personal success direction. You do not have to take care of seeing the door right now. I just want you to face towards your personal success direction. Take your Mary Diamond app. Check out where that success direction is and turn your chair towards that direction. Then sit relaxed and close your eyes. You are now facing the portal of success, the bridge between the three -dimensional field of your existence through the portal of success into the universe. This portal is always open and manifests your success and your money flow. So as you take a deep breath in and out, connect now with that compass direction that you are facing and feel your chakras aligning with your success flow, with your abundance flow into the universe. and breathe into that direction connect now consciously with your vision and bring the energy of your vision into your being and radiated out from your heart into the direction of your success into the universe connect now consciously with your vision and feel your vision in your heart space and send out now that vision through this portal of success into the universe speak it feel it be it into existence and be open now to receive back through this portal of success answers messages energy guidance focus now consciously on your success and money goals and connect them with your heart space and send them from your heart through the success portal into the universe asking to receive energy messages guidance back through that portal in your awareness now or in the future. This portal is always open. Whenever you are connecting with your vision and goals, face your direction of success and connect in with the universe. It's the open channel of sending and receiving, of asking and allowing. There is no resistance in this channel. The road is open to send and it's open to receive. And the receiving can be in energy you feel, in a symbol you see, in a message, in an awareness. That depends on you or even every day will be different. What have you received now? Make a note of that in your journal after the meditation. Bring your hands together. Move your hands. Bring your warm hands in front of your eyes. Open your eyes and gently let go of your hands.

Lesson 4 Practice: Find Your Energy Number & Success Direction
--------------------

Welcome to the practice video on your Personal energy number and your success direction. I hope you already have downloaded the app because that's the first step you need to do. So check out the links to find out the Marie Diamond app for your iPhone or Android phone. Once you have download this for free, you will receive information to put in your gender so your gender is connected with male or female and it's connect with your birthday and then put in also your birthday. You click on it and you scroll down till you have your birthday. Click on done and then reveal your energy number. Once you have done that, you will get a compass with different colors and one of them will say success direction. You have found that so far? Great. You will also get a number and you can click on the arrow next to it to see what is the archetype. Are you a wealth creator, a teacher, a bringer of light, a manager, a creator, a connector, or a healer, or an advisor. And you can read that information. But the main thing is to connect in with your compass. Take your compass with you and go to your living space first. So get into your living area, take your compass out on the app, hold it on the level of your heart just a little bit in front of you. Make sure you do not have too much rings and chains on because it can deviate the magnetic north of the compass. Hold it in front of you and see where the blue angle is. That's your success energy, hold in front of you and it's possible is in front of you. It's possible is it behind you? So turn yourself towards the area so you are aligned with that success direction. And then see what is there. So as you are aligned now with your success direction, make sure you have a paper with you and you can make like a floor plan and drawing where you put your success direction and make some notes, or you do it mentally and you look at like what is there? Is that energy still expressing what I want? Is what is there expressing my success or this clutter or dried flowers or images that are just not creating a good vibration for success. Or there's a lamp and the light is not working anymore. So any broken things, release it. It's always better to have less than more. Don't put too much things there but just things that really gives you enthusiasm, feels aligned with your success. Once you have found that out in your success direction in your living room, go to the space where you work. Go to your, if it's your dining room, or it's your own workspace or office area, stand in your working area and hold the compass and again, see where that success direction is. So if your success direction is, for example, this way, you turn around it till you're looking at it and then you see what is there. If what is there is not supporting your success, you want to place something that activates your success. It can be that you say, well, it's the door. Well still, you can put something left from the door, right from the door. If it's a window, you can put a table in front of it and put some items on top of it. So always try to activate and place there items or images or books or certificates that are representatives of your vision, that are representative of your goals. And you can even write your vision out in a beautiful paper and put it in a gold looking frame and put it in your success direction. You can put your goals in a beautiful file holder and put them in your success direction so you can, each time when you read them, already face easily your success direction or there are your journal and you put your journal in your success energy. So you can do the same for your bedroom. You can stand in the center of your bedroom and see where is your success direction. Definitely clean out and declutter always your success direction because you do not want the wrong image. Remember, it gives you an image, a signal constantly to the universe. So clutter stops and blocks your success magic. Declutter it in your bedroom. And if you want, place a few items that relate with your success. Books on success is always a wonderful thing to place in your success energy. I am looking forward to be with you in a meditation to activate your success direction.

LESSON 5: Make Your Home a Three-Dimensional Vision Board for Success
--------------------
Welcome back. Today, I'm going to share with you in module number five how your home is shaping your success as your home is a 3-dimensional vision board. That means that everything that is around you is actually giving you subconscious messages. We know that the results of the law of attraction are coming from our conscious mind and also our subconscious mind. In your subconscious mind, you have programming of your ancestors, of yourself, your doubts, your fears, your limitations, your judgments, but you also have part of the subconscious mind is the effect that your environment has on you. The colors, the images, the way you position yourself, the way you have laid out your home. It all affects you subconsciously. You already changed in a earlier module how to position yourself so that you are connecting with your 3-dimensional vision board from a power energy. You also already connected with your energy number and your success direction. And your success direction is actually telling you there's a part of your home in every room, living room, dining room, office, your bedroom, that is subconsciously giving you messages about your success. Now we can expand that, and as you have seen in your energy number, you don't only have a success direction you also have a health, relationship and wisdom direction, because success is not just about your money. It's not just about your career. It's all about how successful you are in your health, how successful are you in your relationships and how successful are you on your inner spiritual journey? So I want you to put in your birthday and birth gender and then check out your energy number and your compass. You'll see on the compass you have a success energy that stands for Royal blue. You have green that stands for health. You have a direction that stands for relationship that is rose indicated and you have a yellow direction for your wisdom. So what you're going to do is you're going to take, again, your compass and you go into your major areas of your space, your living room, your office or workspace, your bedroom. These are the areas that complete a full day, eight hours of working, eight hours of sleeping and eight hours of a social life. So you stand each time in the center of every space and as you already have looked at your success direction you also now going to look at that 3-dimensional vision board and see what is your home indicating and giving you as ideas how you manifest your relationships, how you have been attracting health and wellbeing and how have you been on your journey. Your home is a reflection of who you are. It already is an expression of what you are manifesting at this moment. So in order to create success magic, you want to change what is living within you. You want to create a different magic, but you first have to rearrange and redirect the energy outside of you, because that has been giving you nonstop 24 hours a day a message to your subconscious mind. So if in your health direction you have a garbage can, a garbage bin, what is the message you have been receiving from your home that was put my health in the garbage. I am not interested in my health and wellbeing. If you have in your bedroom, in your relationship direction, an image of you by yourself or from a lonely woman or a lonely man, you have been telling to the universe nonstop as you're sleeping, hey, I want to be alone. If you have placed in your wisdom direction, dead flowers, dried up flowers, then you've been telling to the universe, I'm not interested to educate myself. I'm kind of dried up. So everything around you is giving you nonstop an image, a message, and that is going on all the time. So you are not going to only check your success direction, but you're also going to check out your relationship energy, your health and your wisdom direction, and start rearranging things. Start placing things there that support the energy and that support your manifestation. And your health and wellbeing, it can be books on health, it can be your work out exercise, it can be anything that is alive and is beautiful. Energy can be crystals, can be plants that are blossoming except in the bedroom you do not place living plants, because at night nature is asleep. So do not place that there. In your relationship direction, in your living room, you will place images of your family, your children, your friends, because that is the area where your social life is blossoming. You can also in the office place an image of your team in your relationship direction or image of clients or perhaps of you and your teacher. A globe if you want to connect globally with your clients and customers or even in a beautiful team picture will give you that incentive to be in a very successful relationship professionally wise. Wisdom, you can connect with putting there a picture of your teacher or any books on your wisdom modalities or any practices that you have. Are there any symbols of your religion of your spiritual practice? Place them in your wisdom direction, because then you are activating that 3-dimensional vision board, but you also can work with colors. 3-dimensional vision board is not only created, because of the items and the images you place around you, but with the colors. There are several colors of success that can uplift your success energy. The first one is the color of success in a professional way, To have confidence, to feel successful, to feel powerful is the color Royal blue. Royal blue is a color that is used by the kings and the queens as a code or as a dress or as a outfit, because it shows power and it protects you also with the power of the universe. So when you are meeting someone, just add something Royal blue to your outfit. It could be a shawl, it can be a tie, it can be jewelry, because when you wear that color you are always manifesting and invoking and receiving and integrating powerful success to you. When you feel you need some more empowerment, more encouragement, more self-esteem. You lack perhaps of confidence, you'll work with the color cobalt blue who's kind of a dark, marine blue, because that's the color that gives you always that extra strength. And again, this is not about having this whole outfit in that color, but it also is about just some touches that you are implementing in your outfit for success. But you also can use these colors to place somewhere in your environment. The Royal blue and the cobalt blue both can be placed in the north area of an office, the north area of a living room. So it can be an item, a vase, a candle. You don't need a huge item, but just something that is like a handful in that color. And when you place that in the north area, so take your compass, so take your app and you'll see the north is indicated there and so you can hold the compass in the center of the space and see where the north is. The north is always indicated with a little red arrow that stands for magnetic north. So in this case here, the north is kind of here behind me. So placing something in cobalt blue for more empowerment and encouragement and self-esteem or you want something more powerful and successful energy you can put a cobalt blue item in that area. It will help not just for your success, it'll help anyone that comes in that room to be more successful. These colors I call them quantum colors, because they work for everyone. Even if you place it for yourself it will affect everyone that lives in that house, works in the same space. Gold is a color for abundance, for money flow in abundant levels. So you can also place something gold in the southeast section of your office. It can be a gold-looking bowl with coins in it, it can be a gold vase, it can be a gold item representing money, like a gold bar. Anything with gold in that area and it doesn't have to be real gold, you can fake the gold, because you fake it as you make it. So as you're placing in the southeast section of your office space you are actually telling the universe subconsciously I'm open to money flow, I'm open to abundance. I also suggest people to put items in a gold-looking frame. If you have certificates, if you have images of successful people, even if you put them in your personal success direction or personal relationship direction, putting things in a gold-looking frame always manifests an abundance energy. And if you can, when you have meetings for your work, for your professional career, for manifesting your vision, always wears something in gold. It could be gold-looking jewelry, like I said, it doesn't have to be real gold, but place have something gold looking on, because that will help you manifest your abundance. Another color to help success is silver. Silver stands for magnificence, magnifying what you already have. So when you dine, have silverware, place silver or silver-looking items on your table like a carafe with water or a vase with flowers in it. As you're adding silver to your dining room table, you will always magnify the food that comes on your dining room table. So gold and silver are two colors of manifesting success in money. When you want to manifest more of what you already have, place a silver or silver-looking item in the northwest section of your living space or your office. When you feel you need to become more visible, more seen by many people, you want to become more a celebrity, being more celebrated and more recognized for your success, and you lacking that at this moment, add the color orange to your environment. Orange is the color of celebration of pure joy expression. Place orange as pillows in your sofa. Place some orange flowers on your dining room table when you have friends or clients coming over. Place a bowl of oranges on your coffee table so that everywhere that orange energy is represented. Place orange colors or items like an orange candle or a vase in the south area of your living space or your office so that you'll be more recognized and celebrated for your success. When you need more joy in your journey towards manifesting your success magic, add the color peach. Peach stands for the inner joy. When you feel you have a setback, when you feel life is not so easy, bring in that peach vibration, because when you do that life gets more enjoyable and you will start feeling again this wonderful fire to move forward. You can place a peach-colored item in the west area of your living room, of your bedroom. It's not only helping you, but everyone that's in that same space. I'm looking forward to be with you in the next video and practicing how your home is a 3-dimensional vision board. See you there.

Lesson 5 Meditation: 3-Dimensional Vision Board
--------------------

Welcome to the meditation. Take a deep breath in and out and relax your whole body and aura field. And visualize your whole energy is filled with this beautiful crystal white light. And visualize around this crystal white light a tube of royal blue energy connecting with the power of the universe. A tube of rose light come all around you, supporting you with unconditional love. Visualize then, from under your feet, violet light going clockwise through your body and aura field, letting go of all negative frequencies from the past that you've been holding on to. Let them go through the power of forgiveness. And feel that energy going above your head into the universe. Connecting with your quantum point by visualizing your magical hat. And the top of your magical hat is this bright white light. With your tubes of light in your quantum point established, visualize now that you are in the center of your home. And feel into the vibration. of the home around you bring in now the light of the universe through the roof through the ceiling to the center of your space and see that light that universal light go to every space that is in your home or apartment let's bring it first to the front door and even As you open in your visualization the front door, see the light going on the path or the hallway leading to your front door. And where there is light, light remains. And when there's less light, like negative vibrations, conflicts that have happened there, traumatic experiences, worries, fear, emotions as you're bringing in the light in your front entrance and your entrance hallway with clearing that completely from any negative vibrations that have ever happened there while you lived there and even before then walk into your living space and as that the light of the universe goes everywhere in your living space from the ceiling to the floor into every corner it cleanses your sofas your dining area and all that this light remains and all that is less than light is now clearing and seeing it out through the windows to the floor into the soil Visualize then going to your bedroom where you are sleeping.

Lesson 5 Practice: Make Your Home a 3-Dimensional Vision Board for Success
--------------------

Welcome back to module number five, how to set up your home as a three-dimensional vision board. The first thing I want you to do is to take your journal and your goals and your vision, and read them again. And as you have read them again, you know what you really want to accomplish in life for your success. So then, second step is I want you to go outside of your home, outside of your apartment, with all this goal setting and your vision in your mind. And now imagine you are God, you're the universe, and you open the door. And as you walk in, look around you. If, at the entrance, that area is representing your success. Or if there are boxes on the ground, if there are coats hanging and are the images that are there welcoming you, welcoming the success to come inside your space? If that's not the case, then I want you to change things around, and perhaps place a picture of your family. Put a beautiful plant, a bouquet of flowers, a candle, an image that expands the energy. And also, you can place something in orange because orange, as you know, is the color of celebration. Or you can place a color of gold, inviting abundance. Or you can put something in royal blue in your entrance to say I'm open to be very successful and powerful. And it can be an item, it can be a carpet, something that catches your eye or the eye of every visitor. Then I want you to go and walk in as God, the universe, into your three-dimensional vision board called your living space. You're already sitting, welcoming everyone because you are in a power position. Then check out if your successive action is already done, but then also check with your app if there is the right information in your relationship direction. Are there images of your family and your friends and your children? In your health direction, is there perhaps a lush plant or a beautiful crystal that creates good vibration? In your wisdom direction, is there something connected with your religion or your spiritual journey? And then look at the colors. Is there gold in the southeast section? Is there blue? Is there a beautiful royal blue or cobalt blue in the north area? Is there a golden item for abundance in the southeast of your living room? Check with your compass. Is there something blue in the north to empower you and to make you more successful? Is there an orange item or a color in the south to have more recognition? And is there a peach item in the west to enjoy life more? Then go into your bedroom and look again to your four different directions. Check out your energy number and your four areas. Hold it in the center of your bedroom and check your success that you already have done, your health, your relationship and your wisdom. Are the right images in place? Is there something orange in the south, something gold in the southeast, something blue in the north? So you're aligning the energy in your bedroom. And then go to your office space, your workspace, and check also there if, based on your energy number, your different directions are activated. Health, relationship, for sure, in your workspace. Make sure your relationship direction is activated for your clients, for bringing in a great team, for connecting in with your colleagues, with the world. Make sure your place there a beautiful globe to connect in with all of humanity. And then place gold item in the southeast to create abundance. Place something blue in the north to create a beautiful, powerful career. Place something orange in the south to uplift and make sure you are celebrated in your success. And something in silver in the northwest for magnifying your abundance, and something peach in the west to enjoy your career. So all that is activated, you have then set up your three-dimensional vision board. And now we're going to go into a meditation to activate your home as a three-dimensional vision board.

====================

LESSON 6: Make Your Physical Vision Board
--------------------
Welcome to Module 6. Today you're going to make a vision board. But a vision board like you have never made before. It's a vision board that combines the law of attraction and Feng Shui. You have already worked on creating a 3-dimensional vision board, but now we're going to focus your goals connected with your energy number on one piece of paper. So take again your goals that you have written down and now I would love for you to look at your goals and write next to it like a image or an idea how you want to express it. Let's say you have as an idea that you want to travel more. Well, write down which countries do you want to travel to. Perhaps one of your goals is to become successful in your career and you have a specific career and you know somebody that is on the top of his game in your professional field. Then write down that name next to it. Why is that? Because you're going to have to start collecting images. Because a vision board has two parts in it. It's not only that we're going to write down your goals, your major goals, on the vision board, you're also going to add pictures. Because we need both brain parts to be activated as you are looking into your vision board. When you see the written texts of your goals, your analytical brain, your left side of your brain will say, I got it. But your creative part of your brain, the right side is not getting anything, is not getting the signals, doesn't understand it when it just sees written text. It needs artwork, it needs pictures. Make sure you have a printer ready at home and you will start next to your goals as you have written down images that could be right for expressing that goal. You will put it into Google Images or Yahoo Images or any search engine and you will write down what you're looking for and click on images and some images will start showing up. And then you can print these images out. Or you go into magazines and you look for images that are connecting with that. But I'm telling you, going online is the easiest fastest way because you can even write down a goal in your search engine and click on images and some images will start showing up and then you make a decision, you copy and paste that and you print them out. This is how you're going to create a collection of images. Of course, if you're great at drawing, of course, you can draw yourself the images or whatever you want to place on your vision board. This vision board will be connected with your personal energy number. So I'm inviting you again to check out your Marie Diamond app to see your number and your four best directions. So let's say you have energy number two and you see you have four best directions. You have directions on success. That is success and money. That is the blue angle. The green angle is about health and wellbeing. And you see what compassion that is. And you also look at your relationship direction. That's the rose angle. And write down also the compass direction and your yellow direction is the wisdom energy. What is that compass direction? You already have written down five goals on your success, five goals on money. I hope you also can complete now to write at least five goals on your health and wellbeing, on your relationships, both personal and professional, and five goals on your wisdom. So take them and if you haven't complete them, this is now the time to do this first. So do this now and stop the video before continuing watching how to create your vision board. So the first thing you're going to do is to take a piece of blank paper. You can go for just a paper that is the size of a normal paper, but I suggest a larger paper because you want to make sure you write down your goals and that you have space to write your goals and put images up. So you have your goals ready next to you and the images that you have found connected with that, then take this paper and we're going to start dividing it based on your compass energy. We're going to start dividing it as a compass. So we're going to use this as a vision board based on energy, how it flows in the compass direction. Now the center, the center of your vision board is you. I have seen so many vision boards where people put wonderful images up, but then they only work with the right side of their brain while they forget to write down the goals that they have on their vision board. But when I look at their vision boards, there's no picture of them. So the center of your vision board is you. You can say, well, that's quite egocentric, well these are goals about you. So you can write down first of all, in the center it's about you. Because you are the center of your universe. You are sending of the goals and the vision for your life into the universe. And you have to tell the universe who they're coming from. So it's you that is the center. So you have your piece of paper and take a good marker and then take the center of your paper and in the middle make a circle and put in your picture or your name. So you are in the center of your vision board. Make sure the picture you place in the center is a recent picture, not one from when you are like 10 years ago because you want to manifest from here and now. So it needs to be a recent picture or you just can write down in it I am, inputting your name so, but it is you. Then what you're going to do is you will take the sides of the paper and you are going to divide them in three. So I kind of do it without a measurement. And you divide them in three. So you divide the sides of the paper in three. Then you take the sides and you are connecting these points that you indicated you're connecting them with your circle. And now you have like a sun. So you are the center and you are radiating out all your goals to the universe. Then each area of your vision board will connect in with a direction. And on top of your vision board is the south and the bottom is the north. The top is the south and the bottom is the north. Now it's possible you say but Marie, the north pole is on top and the south pole is on the bottom. But in Feng Shui the south stands for the sun and the fire and you want the sun to shine on you while the north stands for the water and you want to have the water below you. Because if you reverse it, the south is fire and you are in the fire and you are drowning with the water, your goals will not manifest. So now you have the south and the north and then you fill clockwise the rest of the directions. So on top is the south, in the upper right corner is the southwest, the right middle area is the west, the under the right under area is northwest. We have the north in the center in the below, and then we have northeast in the left under, east in the left to the center and southeast in the upper left corner. Now you have the layout of a diamond vision board. You are the center and you have the compass directions around you. Then I want you to look again at your energy number and your four best directions. Based on your energy number, you have a success direction, a compass direction that for you is aligning with success and abundance. So for example, if you are energy number one, it is the southeast. So the people that have energy number one, the southeast is their success direction. So write already there the word success in it. And you can do that just with a pencil so you know which area you will fill in with success goals. When you're energy number two or male five, your northeast area of your vision board is connected with success and abundance. So write already in pencil there success. So you know that is the first area you're going to fill up in your vision board. Energy number three, this is the first area here in the south. So this south area for the energy number three that's where you will put your goals and your pictures on success and abundance. Energy number four, they will actually first write in the north area. Energy number five, and you are a man, you work with the northeast. And energy number eight are the connectors. They will write it in the southwest. Energy number six, they will write it in the west area. Energy number seven, the advisors, they'll write it in the northwest. And energy number nines, they will put it in the east section first of all. So what will you do? So you will take your goals and you'll write your goals down, five goals at least. I always suggest that you first do five goals. You don't have to write more than that in your vision board. Now it's possible you're saying, well, you know, what if my goals would change? That is why you can take literally a post-it note and write your goals on a post-it note and stick the post-it note on your vision board. So you can work with post-it notes to write down your goals. And remember, we have for each angle a specific color. We know that success is connected for everyone. It's a quantum color with blue. So literally you can take a blue post-it note put it on there, write down your goals. I am successful. And it's on there. So if you want to change your goals, the only thing you need to do is take the post-it note off. So depending where your success direction is, you will have a blue post-it note in the area, what is write. So here it's like in my success direction, I wrote down I am successful. But of course you write it in a smaller print and this way you can take off the post-it notes if you feel that goal has been met and you want to change it. When you write the goals, make sure you write them as much as possible to the outside of your vision board, so there is still space for you to put in the pictures. And so once you have written down your goals then you can fill the rest of the angle with images that you have printed out. So when you will look at your vision board, there will be the goals and there will be the pictures next to it. So let's go now for your health directions. For your health directions, you can take a green post-it note and then put it in your health direction. So for me, my health direction is northwest. And I can then write there on it I am healthy and all other goals that you have. So then you already have a second area filled in. And next to your goals you can then put images that will present the more creative aspects of your goals. So then check again on your energy number layout, where is the rose area? And see on the outside circle, you'll see a compass. So let's say you're energy number seven, you're an advisor, and your relationship direction is northeast. So you look at where the rose angle is, and you look in the circle around it and it says northeast. So in that case you take for you the rose post-it note, and you put it in the northeast part of the vision board and you can write down I am and put all your goals there. And then next to it you can put all the images representing the goals and the goal for relationships as personal as possible. So if you are in a relationship, then put an image of you and your partner. If you have not an image of you and your partner, if you are single, then look for an image of a couple that is perhaps more neutral. If you don't take a picture of your family members that are in love or a friend that perhaps has just a wedding picture because you don't really know if you want that kind of relationship. If you otherwise just go very neutral and look for images on any search engine about romance. So in that case you will then have here your rose post-it note and you will have all the images connected with your relationship area. And then last but not least is your wisdom direction. So again, you look at your chart. And for energy number seven, for example, wisdom direction is in the west. So I put in the post-it note in the west. In that case I write down I am and you put all the goals in it. You put all the goals in it and you put the pictures next to it. So let's say for energy number five, and if you're a woman, this would be the layout. So success would be the blue one, relationship the rose one in the west, then health in the northwest and the wisdom would be in the northeast. For energy number one, the wealth creators, they would have the blue post-it note in the southeast. In the south, the relationship corner. Health in the east and wisdom in the north. So this way you already have four angles of your vision board filled in. Now you'll say Marie, but there's four areas that are not filled in. Do I just put the vision board up like this? Yes you can and it'll work. Now you can also fill in the others if you want, but not so personal. You will not write down any goals there and you will not put any personal images in this areas, because only these four areas are connecting with you personally. And this is where the magic, the success magic of the vision board is happening. So what can you put in the other areas? The other areas have generally aspects that we can activate but we will always place there more general images. So let me go over what every direction also can mean. So if you are energy number 1, 3, 4, and 9, you will have open southwest, west, northwest and northeast. These areas will be blank for this moment. So you will see that southwest, west, northwest and northeast are blank for you when you're energy number 1, 3, 4, and 9. When you're energy number 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8 you will have now open on your vision board the south, the southeast east and the north. So you can place their general images. So let me go over every compass direction what you can place there. So if the south is open, you can place there anything to do with film, with movies, with celebrities, with self-esteem, with dance, with music. So perhaps you have a passion for music and you have placed already something about that in your success direction, or something you want to add in your wisdom direction but you still have more pictures about it, you can always put it in the south area. So when you have the south open, you can put everything about celebration, joy, happiness, movies, dance, music, self-esteem, confidence, and you can even literally put words there. Yeah, it doesn't have to be even images but not goals. You will never put anything with I am goals. If the southwest area is blank in your vision board, then you can put general images and quotes about romance, teamwork, motherhood, powerful women, collaboration and strong feminine energy. When the west area is blank on your vision board, you can place their images of plain children, joyful energy, technology, psychology, anything that just gives you a joyful experience. But do not put personal images of your children there when it is not one of your good directions. The northwest area, when that is blank on your vision board you can place their extra images of travel destinations, images of friends, but just not personal friends or anything to do with space, the moon, the stars. And you also can place anything with advisors and coaches and mentoring because that is the helping advisor area. The north area is all about career. So when that is blank and you want to put extra images of people working being professional, being the number one in their field, you can all place that in the north. Also, anything about going on a journey, going to the mountaintop, all that gives you support. So even if they're blank, they will still give you subconsciously energy but they are not so focused on your personal vibration. The Northeast stands for everything with wisdom. So it can be books and libraries and teachers, everything to do with spirituality, religion, anything that gives you a higher vibration in yourself. The east stands generally for everything with government. So it can be flags, it can be anything to do with the past, with antiques, and with your extended family and also with health. So if you have extra health items or health images and quotes you want to put on there, you can place it there. But you do not put personal images or personal goals in the east when that's not one of your good directions. And the southeast stands for everything about money and abundance and luxury items and luxury places. So you can put there images and quotes about that, but nothing again personal. Now the next part is where do you place your vision board. So you can place your vision board the best in your personal success direction. So take again your compass and check out where is your personal success direction. I suggest to put it in your office or workspace or to place it in your bedroom. If you have an open space, for sure, you can place it. If you have an open space and studio, you can place it in your living area. But you don't always want everybody to see your vision board. As you hang it out, I always suggest to frame it and to put like a golden band around it or you can even put a golden marker around it. And you can also place it in a gold looking frame because the gold manifests on the top, on the best level possible. And as you have then placed it in your success direction, you are ready with your vision board. Your vision board can be changed. So that is why if you have already goals, and you had, let's say, let's say you have a held goal and you feel like, hey, that's already done. I always suggest to first write down next to that goal thank you, and then leave it there for a week, and then take the post-it note off and rewrite your goals and put it back on. If you cannot put your vision board in your success direction, place it in your wisdom direction 'cause that will grade better energy than the other directions to manifest your vision board. You can take a picture of your vision board and put it as a screensaver on your computer or a screenshot on your phone so that you can always look at it whenever you want to connect with it. Do not place your vision board in your drawers, on your fridges, in the bathrooms, in the toilets. Do not put it in the kitchen. Do not put it in your bathroom. Do not put it in the drawer. Do not hang it on the fridge. Because these are all areas that are not positive. You need to place it somewhere where you see it at least three to five hours a day. Even if you're not connecting with it right away, at least it is there. I always suggest that you connect more positively with your vision board. And so when it's there, connect with it, and the first time you hang it up, do some intention setting. You know, stand in front of it, you can hold your hands in front of it, or do a special prayer or a special intention setting or you can literally do a little meditation. I'm going to guide you and separate meditation how to activate your vision board, because having the right intention setting is so important. And so written your goals, look at the images and smile and connect positively with it. Don't look at your vision board like, oh, this will never happen, right? So see it as it already is happened. See it as it's already there. This vision board will help you to manifest and create success magic in your life. But you need to connect with it regularly. So it's not just you hang it there and that's done. No, you connect with it regularly, connect with it, talk to it, read the goals, look at the images. Sometimes I go to my vision board and I see this one person like, hey, how are you? I'm connecting with you right now. I know it seems silly, but it works. Yeah. I remember in 2018 I put on my vision board in my success direction, I put I am going to be one of the leading teachers in Mindvalley. I will have my own course. I will be on Mindvalley A-Fest and Reunion, University and any other program and amazing application that they have. And so I put a picture next to it with Vishen Lakhiani and me, a picture I had. And within six weeks, Vishen called me and said, Marie we are ready for you. So can you imagine what is to, can you imagine what you can manifest? Me becoming a number one bustling author, me becoming in the Secret. It's all because I put it on my diamond vision board. I wrote a little post-it note, I put an image next to it. And this is how I've been manifesting all my success. Why is that? Because it's a focal point of energy, but you have to keep activating it, you have to keep connecting with it. And that's why if you have a picture of it, you have it on your screensaver, so in a lost moment when you're traveling or when you are just relaxing, you can look at it and see it all the time. I'm looking forward to be with you in the next practice video.

--------------------
Lesson 6 Practice: Make Your Physical Vision Board
--------------------

- Hello, welcome back to the practice video. I'm going to go quickly again, over the steps of your vision board. The first thing is make sure you have a big piece of white paper, a little bit thicker, so it's really strong to hold all the images. The next thing is, you place in the center your name, I am, and your full name, first name, last name or you put a recent picture in the center of your vision board so that all the goals that you're writing down and all the images are connecting with you. The vision board holds a focal point of your goals, but it is actually as it is sending out the energy 24 hours a day. Even if you are not thinking about your goals anymore, your vision board is still radiating and sending out the signals to the universe. After you have done that, you will divide the sides of the paper in three equal areas, like this. So then you connect to points with a line to the center. This little circle where you name or your picture is in. This way, you kind of create a radiating sun and you are the center of the sun. The next thing is you'll put the compass directions on. So on top is the south and the bottom is the north. And so south, and then you go clockwise, southwest, west, northwest, north, northeast, east, and southeast. Once you have written that down, take your compass and your information, and look at your energy number again, and the four areas that are indicated. Your success direction, health, relationship, and wisdom direction. You see on the outside circle, you see the compass directions. So fill in then where is your success, health, relationship and wisdom direction just with a pencil. Take down the goals that you have written down on a paper in the previous modules and take all the images that you also already have collected. Put them ready, take your post-it notes, take a blue Post-it note, for success and put that in your success area. Write down some of the goals, at least five goals and you can do more if you have more space. You take a green Post-it note and you put it in your health direction. The relationship direction is a pink note. And your wisdom direction is a yellow one. By using the colors, you're already are activating the energy with the right quantum color 'cause the quantum color for success for everyone is blue. For health for everyone is green. Pink works for everyone for better relationships and yellow for more enlightened wisdom. Once you have put your goals down then you will make sure you have some tape or glue to take your pictures and fill in the rest of the area of your success, health and wisdom direction. So this would be like mine. This would like my vision board. So success, I put here my images. Relationship, I put my images next to it and my health, and my wisdom. Then you have four areas, blank. And check out again in the lesson what you can place in the other areas, just from images and form quotes that you can place, but nothing personal. Then frame your vision board and put it in your success direction, in your bedroom or your office, your workspace. If there's no other possibility, put it in your living area. Check out the meditation, how to activate your vision board? Looking forward to see amazing results with your success magical vision board.

LESSON 7: Express Your Gratitude
--------------------
Welcome to module number seven. Today I'm going to share with you about how to use the power of gratitude to manifest your success. You have already focused on your vision, on your goal-setting, your work with your three-dimensional vision board. You made your own vision board. And now I want you to understand that all these are wonderful tools to manifest success. But the universe needs to feel that you are open to success. It needs to feel the gratitude that you have. Most people are grateful when things have happened, but in the law of attraction and to create magic, you need to be grateful before it happens. You need to be happy for the process that is unfolding. You need to be happy and grateful for the goal that is manifesting into existence. That is why gratitude is called the juice of the universe. Without that juice, you are not able to manifest and magic is kind of falling flat. So, this is one of the tools that I'm going to ask you to really practice with because being grateful is a change of mindset. It's a change of behavior. It's actually changing your actions. How much have you lately thanked yourself? How much have you thanked others? How much have you expressed your gratitude to God, to the universe to everyone that is on your way, supporting you your teachers, your advisors, your coaches, everyone that is helping you on the journey to be the best that you can, that is supporting your success. Saying thank you is a start, but not just saying one time, thank you, but saying thank you as almost in everything you do, everyone you meet. And just saying thank you is not enough. It needs to be thank you from the heart. It needs to be a gratefulness from your soul. There needs to be a twinkle in your eye and a smile on your face when you say thank you. You do not just say thank you from your mind. You say it from the bottom of your heart. You need to express gratitude. Once you express it, you immediately will start feeling so much better. You have positive vibrations in your whole body. Your day will look different. You will be different, and the universe will react faster, and with more enthusiasm for you because when you express your gratitude, the universe is like, oh she or he is so passionate, they are so happy with the unfolding existence, the unfolding of the goals. So, I would suggest that you start every day in your journal or just expressing in the morning what you are grateful for. That is going to happen in a positive way that day. So being grateful before it happens. Like this morning I woke up, I'm like I am so grateful I can do this success magic. I am so grateful that I have an amazing team supporting me. We haven't filmed yet when I was already saying thank you. You have not even seen the success magic journey. But I was already grateful. I was already grateful for you to join me on that journey. And because I am always in that state of gratitude as much as I can, I mean, we are all human beings and we all have moments that we're like, hmm, life is not so great. But then go right way back into that gratitude moment, and then be grateful for that challenge and for the lesson you learn from it. So I hope you already are full of gratitude for the journey of success magic. And so when you're going to read your goals as much as you can, or you rewrite them, always end with a feeling of gratitude and you can even express it, and say thank you universe for manifesting these goals here and now. You can end when you write them. You can end when you speak them into existence. When you look into your vision board, and you look at certain goals, and you focus on a certain image, say thank you for manifesting this right here and now because you don't thank for the future, you thank for the present because it's in the present moment that gratitude is working towards the future. You can say, well, I will be grateful within five years if I become a millionaire, right? But every money that comes into your account, every check that is given, every lesson you learn around money, if you are already grateful for that, this is part of your journey to become a millionaire. If you want to have a successful professional career, be grateful for every step you learn on that journey. For every successful person that gives you advice, for every aha moment you had or every amazing idea, say thank you universe for this idea. Thank you for every email that comes in, that gives you perhaps a next client. So each time, have that constant vibration of gratitude in you. It's a process that is vital to create success magic. So start with in the morning to set your day, to connect with your goals and say thank you for manifesting them here and now. And at the end of the day, express again your gratitude to yourself, to everyone that was a day in your life, to God, to the universe, whatever you call the creative force that helps to manifest your goals and say thank you for every step, for every person, for every lesson that I learned towards manifesting the goals here and now. So you have just made your vision board. So I want you to take your vision board now and look at it, and read your goals again and say thank you to each area. Thank you for my success goals. Thank you for all the people that are on my vision board. Thank you for all the quotes I've written down. It's just like, put your hands on that vision board and wherever you feel you want to put your hands on it and become a grateful vibration, and your hands or hands of gratitude. And as you're putting it on your vision board, you are just expressing to the universe like, I'm so grateful. I'm so grateful for this. Oh, I'm so grateful for this. Wow, I'm so grateful for this. And the universe is like, oh, the universe feels it. Just writing your goals, having a vision without joy, without happiness, without gratitude, you are only going so far. If you want to go all the way with manifesting your goals add a positive feeling of gratitude to it. You can even go a next step and write a gratitude letter or have a gratitude journal where every day, you just do not think about your goals but you write them down. "I am grateful for..." And when you write a gratitude letter, perhaps when you are ending a job or when you are ending a relationship, or just because you feel like it's time to write a gratitude letter for my life as it is right now, then write that gratitude letter and then burn that letter up in a beautiful sunny day around noon and send it out to the universe, and say, "Universe, I am so grateful for what I have learned today. And I know sometimes life is challenging, and it's just at that moment of challenge that you need to reconnect in with that vibration of gratitude. And so when life is difficult, write a gratitude letter because you have things to be grateful for. There were moments in my life that the only thing I was really grateful for was that I was alive. That I was in such a huge pain physically, emotionally, mentally that I was in such a deep state of depression. Yes, I had these moments too, that the only thing that kept me going was being grateful. There were moments in my life I had no money that I was in failure. Only thing that kept me going was the gratitude that I was alive, that I was breathing. I had my family, I had my mind, I had my possibilities. I had still my future in front of me. You all have something to be grateful for. So write it down. It's wonderful you write down your gratitude, you send it off with a gratitude letter, or you write it down in your gratitude journal, but express gratitude. So at least, even in the evening, when you are done with your graduate journal, and you have perhaps said thank you for my partner, thank you for my children. Don't just write it down, express it to them. When they're at home, just tell them "I'm so grateful for you." Send them a text message with the word, "I thank you for being in my life." Give them a phone call at least by the end of the day. See if you have said thank you to at least five people. And it can be even going on your Facebook or your Instagram and saying gratitude for all your followers. I mean, there's so many places that you are connecting now with people. At least express it regularly. I make a point of at least trying to once a week, to thank all my team members for the amazing work they do, that they are in my life, that they give the best they can for helping me manifesting my vision. So, each time I'm in a call with somebody, I will say thank you. I send an email to them to say, thank you. So it's a simple thing, but it creates this non-stop, vibrant, vital energy that the universe needs from you to manifest your goals. So just writing your goals down. Many people have said it doesn't work because they are too serious in their life. They are thinking the universe must manifest these goals, and they're thinking, oh, I've done my work. But you need to be an active energy, an active force into manifesting your goals, and taking action first of all is by being grateful. I am grateful for you to be with me on this success magical journey. I'm grateful that you are implementing all that you have learned as much as you can. I'm grateful that you will share even this information with your friends, with your family, with your children 'cause you want for sure that they have a success magical day themself. I'm looking forward to see you in the practice video.

Lesson 7 Meditation: Express Your Gratitude

Take a deep breath in and let it go. Now imagine that you're connecting in with the top of your magical hat that is an arm length above your physical head. This bright white light is your connection with the universe, the access to the quantum field. Now visualize that you're in an open space in nature. with this harmony and peace. The sun is shining perfectly for you. There is this nice breeze. Everything around you, the flowers, the trees, the soil, it just gives you a feeling of harmony. You'll hear a water sound close by, relaxing you perfectly. And when you look to the right, there's this beautiful pathway going up a hill or a mountain. And it's easy to walk up. And you come to the top and you see other mountains and valleys around you. There's this wide open horizon. You feel expanded. And you can see 360 degrees all around you. and in front of you now is this basket an overflowing basket of pink roses they are energetic roses of gratitude and as you have written down all the things you are grateful for connect with them or think about what you are grateful for today and take now this energetic pink rose And send it through the air to the people you are grateful for.

--------------------
Lesson 7 Practice: Express Your Gratitude
--------------------

Welcome back to the practice video on gratitude, so please take a piece of paper or take your journal and I want you to now connect in with the experience of gratitude. So take a pen, take a deep breath in and out. And just let go of everything that you have been stressed about. And write on top, I am grateful for or thank you for, whatever that is. The strongest is to do it in your own language, even if English is one of your strong languages, write it down in your own personal language, because it speaks the most to you. So I'm grateful for in your own language and write down at least five aspects. You're grateful for about success, your career, money, today in your life. And as you're writing this down, try to have a smile on your face. Try to write it down really with this generous feeling in your heart and with a twinkle in your eyes. Don't be too serious. Then write down five thank yous for your health and your wellbeing. Five things you're so grateful for and perhaps you have some health challenges, but there are so many other things that from your health and wellbeing, perhaps that you're grateful you have a great doctor, great healer, friends that support you, that you're able to work out, that you are breathing. I mean, there's so many things on health and wellbeing that you can still be very grateful for. And again, do this with a lightness in your heart and write it with a smile on your face. And then write down five thank yous for people in your life and it can be personal, your partner, can be your children, your family, your friends, your clients, your team. And if you have more than five, please write more than five. Don't say, "Oh, Marie only limits us to five." No, five or more. And again, remind yourself to do this from a happy, joyful feeling. And then write down five thank yous for your wisdom. How you're connecting with God, how you're expressed through religion, through spirituality. Your advisors on that journey, your coach, your teachers. Thank the angels, the masters, the guides, the books you are reading, the authors that have been inspiring you. Five or more. And once you have written that down, just sign it. Just say, "Yes, I agree with this." Put on the date. Because when you write and put a signature and a date on it, you are putting it into law. You're manifesting it even stronger and try to do this as much as you can. Grateful to be with you.

====================

LESSON 8: Let Go of Past Failures
--------------------
Welcome back. We are now in module number eight and in order to manifest your Success Magic it's also necessary to let go of past failures, of things that did not work out in the past. 'Cause from now on, you're focusing with your goals here and now to change your life. But sometimes consciously or subconsciously you're still holding onto what did not work out in the past. And the past can be yesterday but can be literally even your ancestors because it's not just you that are holding onto failures. Sometimes your ancestors have been holding onto their failures and passed on fear or pain towards you. And even it's possible you're holding on to failures from past life incarnations. So it's time to say, "I let it go." I love the word letting go. It means, I let God take over. I am not trying to change it anymore. I'm not longer trying to fix things anymore that didn't go right. I'm not longer trying to fix things, solve things that went wrong in the past. So I'm letting God take care of this so that you can move on and say, "Look, I have a new chance, I have a new opportunity. I have a new possibility to create success in my life." Because if you do not allow the past to be where it is, you cannot start from here on now to move forward and create your vision and to manifest your success. Because when you hold onto the past, it's like holding onto a backpack with stones in it and they're stones of failure, stones of blockages, stones of perhaps losing a job, losing your money, losing your career, bankruptcy, all kinds of bad luck that perhaps you created or that just happened to you. You've been putting it on your shoulders and every step on your journey towards manifesting your vision you're taking it with you. You found your vision, you set your goals, you created a three-dimensional vision board. You activated everything around you. Do you think that this backpack with stones in it will help you now to move forward? No. It's time to take that backpack and let it go. How do you do this? In this module, you will have a very powerful meditation so that you can really let go of things on an energetic level. I'm asking you first to write down on a piece of paper or in your journal all the things that you've been holding onto. It can be doubts, fears, failures, things that you like, "This stops me from being successful." It can be even relationships or perhaps even the job that you're in now. It can be many aspects. It can be your health. It can be any blockages that you feel that are holding you back from manifesting your vision and your goals. Success Magic only happens when you let go. So take that paper and write down on top. "I let go of," double point. And there you can write down bullet points or just sentences of all the things you feel consciously and subconsciously. And as you start writing, things will come up in your mind like, "Oh, I need to let go of this. I need to let go of this." And this is not about five things. You just keep writing at least a full paper. Perhaps there's even more. Perhaps you even want to do that over a couple of days and weeks because a lot will start showing up. And if you do not know what is holding your back, ask the people around you. Ask your family, ask your friends, ask your children. Sometimes they know more than you what you've been holding onto and haven't let go of. One of the great things to do when you write letting go is take a purple pen as you write. Write with purple ink or purple color. Purple is the color of letting go. The purple connects in with your ground chakra, with your wisdom, but also is the color of the rainbow that is the highest vibration. And so when you write the letting go with purple ink or purple marker, you actually will have an easier time to energetically let go of what you desire. As you write down this letting go letter it's possible some emotions come up. Each time it comes up. Just say thank you, "Thank you for being there but I let you go." Perhaps some stories will start showing up, some ideas, some memories. Let 'em come and just say each time, "Thank you, I let you go." Because as you write, it's like you are tapping into that subconscious energy of you where you've been holding onto all the failures and blockages. And as you write it down more will come, emotionally, mentally and the only thing you need to do is say, "Thank you, I let you go." Don't think it, say it. Speak it into existence. Once you have finished your letting go letter, I'm asking you at the bottom to say to yourself because you letting go to you. "I forgive myself for holding on to these failures, I forgive everyone that has co-created these failures with me." Because some failures, some problems are not just created by you. Perhaps they were connected with your family, with your friends, with your partner, with your children, with your ancestors. If you have a hard time forgiving then start already with writing down. "I am willing to start to forgive." If you feel forgiving is such a big step, start already saying, "I am willing. I am willing to forgive. I'm willing to let go." And as you have done that, sign off with your name and then take that letting go letter and let it really go. After you write this letter, find a beautiful sunny day and around noon in your local time, take that letter, put it in a ceramic bowl or a metal bowl and lit the letting go letter. And as you lit it and it goes into fire, give the intention that you're not only letting it go from you, but you're letting it go into the universe. You let God take over your burden. You let go, take over your failures so that God of universe can reverse it. Can guide you, in opening up to new possibilities, to new opportunities, to new directions in your life. When you write this letter and when you let it go it can be quite an emotional experience because you do not let go just words. You let go experiences, you let go emotions, you let go of mindsets, but you will feel renewed. And when you're finished with that, I ask you to go back into your vision, into your goals and speak them out loud again, facing your success direction in your successful three-dimensional vision board called your home. And now released with that burden, you will feel, you'll manifest even more magical than before. I'm looking forward to have you with me in the practice video on letting go of your failures. See you there.

Imagine now you're holding in your hand a sword of a knight or a laser beam sword. And around this sword are all royal blue flames of power. And you're going to cut through all the cords of negative experiences. negative situations and negative people that are not longer needed in your life. All that is positive will remain. Visualize holding that sword in your hands now and move your hands in your visualization or even physically and cut now the energetic cords with all negative vibrations and as you cut through them The royal blue energy goes over the cords to the source of negative creation. Move the sword around you, behind you, above you and under you. Take a deep breath in and let them go. Visibilize now the rose color for love and unconditional support all around you and under your feet. accepting that you're loved and supported by the universe.

Use the power of forgiveness now. to release that as you visualize the violet light as a violet fire going through your body from your feet till your head into the universe. Connect now with your quantum point at the top of your magical hat.

And the flames are violet, with the power of forgiveness infused. We're first going to focus on all the failures and negative experiences around your professional and business career. Imagine now that all these failures, you can take them with your hands out of your energy system. And you're throwing them into that violet fire. And the violet flames of forgiveness release them. Think about the failures, the blockages you have experienced in your career, in your professional life. Each time you throw them in the violet fire. And each time you say to yourself, I forgive myself. Perhaps there are situations that were co -created with others. Say, I forgive them. as you're throwing this negativity into this violet fire and you release it. Focus now on any failures and negative experiences around money and throw them in that violet fire each time telling yourself, I forgive myself. If situations come up that were created with others, express that you forgive them too and release it to the power of forgiveness. Visualize now on your health and well -being, any disease, any illness. Forgive yourself now. Forgive your body. Forgive anyone that co -created. Forgive the healers, the doctors, if they were not able to help you in the way that you needed to. And throw this in this violent fire. And through the power of forgiveness, release it now. And when your body failed through accidents or through any negative experiences created by others, Forgive them now and release it in the violet fire. Take a deep breath in and let it go. Visualize now connecting in with all your personal relationships. Any negative experience with your parents, with your current or previous partner, with your children, with your friends, your family. Let that go now. and throw it in this violet fire and see the flames of forgiveness release it now until i forgive myself for having allowed this i forgive others for co -creating this with me and focus on your professional relationships with your clients your team your colleagues your manager any negative experiences you have there throw this in the violet fire And forgive yourself for having allowed this in your life and for anyone that co -created the situation with you. And let the flames of forgiveness release that now. Take a deep breath in and let it go. Focus now on all the failures and blockages connected with wisdom. When you studied in school, your connection. with religion, with spiritual journeys, all the failures and blockages you experience there. Forgive yourself now for attracted and allowed it and forgive anyone involved with it. The teachers, your coaches, your co-students, anyone involved. Throw it in a violet fire and release that now to the power of forgiveness. And as you have released so much now, feel your body, feel your energy, feel your heart. How much lighter it is now. As you have opened it to let it go. As you have opened yourself to let it go and to forgive yourself and others. Take a deep breath in now. Move your hands. Bring your warm hands to your eyes.

Lesson 8 Practice: Let Go of Past Failures
--------------------

Welcome back to the practice video. I really want to make sure you write your letting go letter. So let's do it together. Take your journal or a piece of paper and take a purple marker or purple ink and write down, "I am letting go" and write that in full capital letters. "I AM LETTING GO:", double point. And now I want you to take a deep breath in and out. Close your eye for a moment. And say to yourself, "I am ready to let go. I'm ready to let go of my past. I'm ready to live now, here and now." Take a deep breath in and exhale. Take your pen and start writing down, "What are you ready to let go of?" And as you write down, don't judge yourself. Don't say, "Oh, all these things that happened." Whatever emotion comes up, just say thank you and let go of it. And as you write down, it can be that you want to let go of things in your professional career, about your business, failures that you had. It can be problems around money. It can be about relationships, romantic relationships that you need to let go of. Problems with your children, problems with your parents, your siblings, your family. Problems with your health and your wellbeing. Problems with the house. Problems on your spiritual journey, with your church, with your teachers, your advisors. And each time you stop, and you cannot go further, close your eyes. Take a deep breath in and give yourself permission to let go. Say, "Yes, I'm ready to let go of the past. I'm ready to live here and now." And start writing again. And you can stop the video now if you want as you're writing, or you can continue. And at the end of your letter, write down, "I forgive myself, and I forgive everyone that co-created this past with me." And then sign it. And then take this letter. And on a sunny day, take this letter, burn this letter, and let it go into the universe so God can take care of it, and that you're not longer holding the burden of your failures. Check out a meditation to help you to even clear on a deeper level, energetically your failures.
