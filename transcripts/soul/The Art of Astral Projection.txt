Preparation 1: What Is Astral Projection?
--------------------
<v ->Hello Mindvalley students.</v> Welcome to your quest on spiritual integration through the Art of Astral Projection. So before we start our journey, let's look at what Astral Projection is and what some of the benefits of this practice can be so that you can not only understand it but be fully immersed in this practice and get the maximum results. Astral Projection is a self-initiated out-of-body experience, usually associated with the astral planes. During an out-of-body experience, our self-awareness, so where we perceive ourselves to be in time and space, isn't operating in the same place as the physical body. In other words, we appear to experience the world from outside of it. So if I were to have an out-of-body experience right this second, it would be a little bit like I shift out of my physical body, and I'm able to turn around and look at myself, sitting there. It's that real. So during a full-blown OBE, out-of-body experience, there's a visceral feeling of exiting, such as floating or phasing out of the body. Sometimes we appear in a second body, often experienced as energy or light. Imagine slipping out of your skin like a jacket or stretching away from the body like caramel or dissolving out like a puff of smoke. One time I swung both my legs out of my body, sat up, and walked away from it. After leaving the body, we appear to travel in other realms of reality, encountering beings and places that seem real. Sounds pretty far out, right? So let's look at what might be happening when this occurs. Shamans enter trance, Buddhists meditate, and Dervishes whirl, all to connect to deeper parts of themselves and the wider world. Science calls it Polyphasic Perception. They call it being human. These alternative ways of knowing are found in over 90% of the world's cultures and are not considered strange at all. So why in the modern world, are these experiences written off as woo-woo? Because we've lost this perceptual diversity, different ways of gaining knowledge. We get flashes of insight through epiphanies and creativity and meditation. But for the most part, we see through one lens, and it's blinding. Neuroscience and psychology is now beginning to catch up to the health benefits of non-ordinary states of consciousness. And the good news is that these states are not limited to the wise man or medicine woman. In fact, you have probably experienced one without even knowing. Chanting football fans, nature dwellers, and clubbing ravers can all enter various altered states. This is due to the way these events naturally alter our brainwaves via song and dance, deep presence, and feelings of awe. Yet, whilst you can simply rest in an altered state, like the time you daydreamed at school or did your meditation, we can also use it to channel focus, explore the mind, or even develop extra sensory perception. This is because an altered state is a bit like getting into a car. There are different types, and we can use the gears to direct the destination. However, most people don't know how to drive so they just sit there. Until now. Techies are leveling up their focus by micro-dosing in Silicon Valley. The Navy SEALS are hacking flow states for athletic performance, and stressed-out office workers are using mindfulness for better health. Ordinary people are discovering fields of super-human awareness. Astral Projection is one of them. In this quest, we are going to harness totally natural altered states of consciousness to self-initiate an out of body experience for the purpose of self-transformation. This esoteric term, Astral Projection, alludes to the spirit or soul leaving the body, as believed in some spiritual traditions. When you hear stories of people floating out of their bodies, you can certainly see why. Astral Projection is not some new age invention; it has a long history within cultures all around the world. One cross-cultural study of 488 societies found that 89% of them made reference to out-of-body states of consciousness, and descriptions of what appear to be like astral travel experiences featured in spiritual texts of all the world's major religions. Within ancient Hinduism, Astral Projection is one of the super power Siddhis, considered achievable by advanced yoga practitioners. And modern masters, such as Paramahansa Yogananda vouched for Astral Projection in his classic text, Autobiography of a Yogi. Astral Projection also crops up in Sufism. Sufis speak of alan almithai, or dimensions created by thought. There are numerous accounts in both the Bible and the Qur'an of Astral Projection experiences. And within the shamanic tradition of the Toltec seeker, this skill was rare and only given to people of power. Rulers, priests and warriors were trained in Astral Projection in order to conquer lands, bend reality, and attain self-mastery. In ancient Egypt, they called the energy body Ka, and priests left special inscriptions on how to astral travel on the rock faces of temple walls. In the Bible, St. Paul describes experiences in non-physical realms which he terms as the third heaven. And he describes the thought-responsive nature of these dimensions, something that's also reported by modern astral projectors. In Tibetan Buddhism, Astral Projection is a central practice for advanced meditators, and it has been utilized as a part of dream yoga and practiced for millennia for the purpose of exploring the nature of reality and as preparation for death and dying. Even the modern traditions, like Theosophy, suggest that humans are multidimensional beings possessing up to seven bodies. I'm referring to an astral body among these as the linga sarira. So Astral Projection has a long and strong specific practice, but sometimes there's still some confusion around it, due to commonalities with other abilities. So let us clear some things up. Astral Projection is not simply a dream or a shamanic journey, remote viewing, mediumship, dissociation, or just vivid imagination. Phenomenologically these things are experienced quite differently. To help explain, it might be useful to think about these experiences as though you were sitting on the sofa, watching a movie. The act of seeing what's on the TV might be thought as remote viewing; the shamanic journey would be watching through 3D glasses. A lucid dream would be to enter the scene itself, whilst mediumship would be to interact with the characters from the sofa. And then there's dissociation which would kind of be to feel floaty and discombobulated whilst trying to watch the TV. Now with astral travel, you can step out of your body, look back, and have a good look at yourself watching the screen or the TV. You can then either float into the TV and experience that reality, or you could go out of your lounge to see what your neighbors are up to. But here's the thing: because many of these experiences happen in an altered state, it's possible to springboard from them into an out-of-body experience, such as going from the lucid dream into Astral Projection. In fact, we learn how to do this in the quest. So how can we benefit from astral travel? I think we can all agree that astral projection sounds out of this world, right? And it is, but it's more than just a cool experience; it has a whole range of benefits that support well-being. It has huge transformative potential, and there are hard stats to back this up. One study reported that 88% of research participants experienced beneficial change after their out-of-body experience happened. In another, more than 300 participants found that 86% experience heightened awareness, in their perception of reality, with 78% noticing long-term sustainable benefits. The biggest potential of OBEs is that it is a spiritual tool to elevate your state of consciousness. In 1943, the psychologist Abraham Maslow published a paper that was set out to be later called "Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs." Maslow saw that the hierarchy of needs as reflecting the journey of human evolution and that self-actualization was an evolutionary step. For some people that missing link in their evolution is provided by an out-of-body experience, a radical path to becoming all that we can be. When we are at a crossroads in life, in need of guidance, and the universe wants to offer us a little nudge, we might find ourselves in a spontaneous out-of-body experience. Barbara needed a nudge towards self-actualization, and found herself in a spontaneous out-of-body experience that changed her life forever. Barbara was a corporate TV executive from the U.S. who was exhausted by the high pressure lifestyle of the media world. And she was drained by the need to always look good and to be the best. One morning at around 5:00 a.m., she awoke from sleep and rose out of her physical body. She found herself flying over what she somehow knew was the city of Giza in Egypt, next to the river Nile. Her energy body landed near the ancient pyramids. Something was roused within her, and she said she felt "This is where I need to be." As if the land itself was calling her. From her point of awareness, she scanned the horizon and saw dusty apartments dotted throughout the old town, but next to them was a KFC chicken shop. "How could they build a KFC so close to a sacred site?" she thought. Maybe it was just her mind glitching, or perhaps her astral vision was somehow distorting. Whatever it was, it surely couldn't be real. So she shifted her awareness and continued to have an extraordinary out-of-body experience. Then when she found herself back in her physical body, something had changed within her. She couldn't forget how the feeling of the land of Egypt had been beckoning her. And soon her day job in corporate TV began to seem increasingly vacuous in the light of her out-of-body experience. Something had changed within her inner world, and she couldn't shake it off. Eventually she heeded the call. She left the corporate world and made a life-changing decision. Barbara quit her job and retrained as a holistic therapist and a tour guide, taking people on trips to sacred places in Egypt. But when she visited Egypt for the first time in her physical body, she managed to locate the exact same place in Giza, the dusty streets near the pyramids that she visited in her OBE. And just as she had seen, there it was: the KFC chicken shop-proof for her at least that in her OBE she really had made a trip to Egypt. Barbara credits, her out-of-body experience with shaking her out of herd mentality, bringing her in alignment with a greater cause and helping her become more of who she really was. It's not just elevating consciousness that OBEs can be good for; the simple act of Astral Projection itself can be such a mind-blowing experience that they're often classed as what is clinically known as an exceptional human experience. An experience of cataclytic gnosis-knowing- that extends the limits of who we are and what we perceive reality to be. A peak experience in which we can touch the numinous. Basically a massive, "What the heck!" moment, and no wonder. In the same way people who have near-death experiences return believing that they're a soul or a spirit, the same can be said for most astral projectors. Everyone of the case studies from my master's research claims that consciousness goes on after death, even those who are atheist or agnostic beforehand. Knowing for yourself that beyond a doubt you are not exclusively limited to your physical body but simply habitually limited to it and that that habit can be broken can be profound. This is one reason why it's considered an exceptional human experience in the sciences of psychology. Research has shown that these types of experiences make us more open-minded, more emotionally mature, and lead to higher levels of happiness and well-being. Tied in with this is usually the visceral experience of awe. In fact, it's one of the highest reported emotions felt during Astral Projection. Once we get over that initial "What the heck!" moment of leaving our physical body, and we relax into the experience, we realize just how awe-inspiring Astral Projection really is. Flying through the sky at the speed of light, meeting dead loved ones on the astral plane, entering into realms and other dimensions. The possibilities are endless. Yes, get ready for one of the most visceral experiences of awe a human being can have. And awe, it turns out, is really good for you. A University of California, Berkeley study found that awe-some experiences increased people's feelings of connectedness and willingness to help others and that experiences of awe can change the course of a life in profound and permanent ways. The University of Toronto researchers found that awe is actually good for our health too as it directly lowers levels of inflammation, the main cause and the exacerbator of many chronic health conditions. There is a phenomenon reported by astronauts known as the overview effect. It occurs when they look back at the earth and they appreciate the vulnerability and the smallness of that pale blue dot spinning in infinite space. The overview effect creates a cognitive shift of perceptual vastness, reframing one's reality and place within it. How we see ourselves and our world changes. The astronauts who report it are forever transformed for the better. Astral projectors report the same thing. I call this the Outerview Effect. When during Astral Projection they glance back at their physical body, just as the astronauts glance back, they realize they are not their physical body, and so they begin to identify less with it and search less with their limitations. Their sense of self expands, leading to a decrease in existential anxiety and a lowering of thanatophobia, fear of death. Dr. Mel Slater's team at Barcelona University showed that even a virtual reality experience mimicking an illusionary OBE can reduce death anxiety. This has a domino effect into other areas of life, such as relationships, our purpose, and our fears. So in a nutshell, what are the benefits of Astral Projection? Astral travel can be harnessed to source answers to problems, insights into illness, guidance with decision-making, healing with grief, and the releasing of fears and limitations. Suffering from burnout? Take that trip to Hawaii. Feeling lonely? Visit that lover across the pond. Heal that trauma? Go to the source. Want adventure? Fly into space. Imagine having your own private jet to people and places that you can visit from the edge of your bed at any time. You are that plane and this quest is your return ticket.

Preparation 2: The 3 Steps to Astral Projection
--------------------
<v ->Hello, and welcome to your quest on astral projection.</v> My name is Jade Shaw, and I'm going to teach you how to fly. You will learn how to self-initiate an out-of-body experience for self-transformation. Astral projection is a secret skill you never knew you had. What if you could access expanded states of consciousness and connect with people and places beyond time and space? Where would you go? Who would you meet? And what would you bring back? In this quest, we learn how the sages of old traditions activate the ability to astral project for insight, guidance, and healing. Bridging science and spirituality, we draw from Western psychology and Eastern traditions to teach you the core principles of modern day astral projection. So here are a few things about what to expect and how this quest works. This is a beginner's experiential program. So whether you haven't had any experiences at all, or if you have had quite a few, it's perfect if you want to start a practice or boost your current one. It teaches the core principles and methods necessary to self-induce an out-of-body experience and then navigate non-physical realms of reality, so that you feel confident, equipped, and ready to fly. By the end of this program, you will have everything you need to have a successful out-of-body experience. This quest will give you a chance to access altered states of awareness and elevate your consciousness, because astral projection is one of the most powerful spiritual tools for transformation. It will help you to overcome fears and anxiety, transcend identification with the physical body, integrate and heal your shadow, heal grief and meet loved ones, achieve soul alignment. This is a 28-day journey toward self-transformation. And this quest is built like a step-by-step manual for astral projection. There will be some theory to lay a firm foundation, but it will mainly be practical exercises. It's a bit like going to a yoga class, except instead of flying with the body, we're flying with the psyche. Some say, the soul. To do this, we focus on three steps. Step one, the first is the mind awake body asleep state. This is a type of altered state, similar to deep trance. When the mind is awake and aware, but the body is completely relaxed, until we cannot feel it anymore. This is like our flight pad from which we'll springboard into astral projection. Step two, this is the vibrational state. This is a transitory precursor experience which occurs just before we leave the body. It can be filled with unusual sights and sensations such as energy and light. Can be very subtle to pretty intense. But either way, it's completely safe. It's sort of like the wind picking us up before we take flight. Step three, the third step is exiting the body. Now, I don't like using the word exit, because it suggests that we're completely leaving which isn't necessarily true, because an aspect of our consciousness, our awareness, stays behind. It's this that keeps the lungs breathing and the heart beating. And it brings you back immediately if your body gets disturbed or distracted, such as when you need to go to the toilet. However, it does very much feel like a separation or an expansion beyond the body when we astral project. So for the sake of ease, I'll refer to exit techniques in step three. We can practice astral projection through deep meditation and powerful trance states. But one of the best ways, especially for beginners, is on the cusp of sleep, because most spontaneous experiences occur at this time. And it's easier to harness because we all sleep, right? Of course, you can apply almost everything that we learn to other deep altered states. So don't think that astral travel can only happen via sleep states, but it is one of the quickest ways to learn the skill. That's why this quest does just that. So we're going to do this by using our nighttime and daytime techniques to prepare the body and mind. Some of which work with cultivating qualities that improve the ability to astral project, such as sustaining attention. Others are directly involved with leaving the body or traveling the astral planes. How well these techniques work depend on our personal psycho-spiritual makeup, what type of person we are, and where we're at in our spiritual journey. For example, if we're a very perceptive person, the visual methods might work better for you, or if we're very felt sense, the kinesthetic ones might give you more success. This is why you will be given a toolbox of techniques related to the three steps, so you can create a bespoke practice personal to you. It will be a case of trial and error as you begin to discover what type of astral projector you are. That's the fun part though, trying all the sweets in the shop and then pick and mix your favorites. Just like in yoga, the teacher can't give you a handstand balance, but they can give you the skill and the wisdom to do it yourself. In the same way, I can't give you an out-of-body experience, but can I give you the tools and techniques to build this skill to self-induce your own experiences? Absolutely. I'll teach you how to transform your world from the edge of your bed. Now let's take a bird's eye view of how that journey will unfold. Week one is preparing our flight pad, learning the foundations, the core principles of astral projection. Emphasis is placed on preparing the body and mind for effective experiences. The two biggest blocks to astral projection are fears and limiting beliefs. So we will address these head on. We will also learn how to create our own projection plans and harness sleep states with mindfulness to increase our chances of going out of the body. This includes mastering step one, the mind awake, body asleep state. In week two, we spread our wings. We learn how to bring on and ride the vibrational state, the transitional doorway between the physical and the non-physical worlds. This involves connecting to our energy body and heightened levels of awareness. This is where you learn how to navigate non-physical realms and see with your astral eyes. We will discover where you can go and what you can experience. In week three, we begin to soar, so get ready to fly. This week covers step three, exit techniques. Different ways in which you can shift beyond the body and enter other planes of reality. You will learn a range of tools to transition to the astral plane. But not only that, we will learn how to transform sleep paralysis and lucid dreaming into a gateway to the multi-verse. And finally, in week four, we begin to fly high. This is where we explore advanced practices, such as shadow integration, soul retrieval, and meeting dead loved ones through astral projection. We will also test our skills by doing an experiment, as well as learning how to safely embody and integrate our experiences back into our everyday life. The Monroe Institute is the world's most renowned research venue for out-of-body experiences. This is where the CIA trained astral projection and remote viewing, and where some of the world's top trainers reside. They have been developing brainwave technology for expanded states of consciousness, such as binaural beats and isochronic tones, for over 40 years. This cutting-edge technology helps to place the brain in the best conducive states for astral travel. Coupled with my guided meditations and exercises, you will be in the best possible place to start your practice. Here are the main things you need to prepare: projection diary and pen. This is a journal or notebook that you dedicate to record your out-of-body experiences. We will also use it for some of the lessons and exercises. Headphones. This quest is full of guided audio recordings that bring you into an altered state of consciousness. An eye mask, earplugs, and cushions and blankets are optional. Also, here are a few of the tips on how to maximize success with your learning journey. I suggest dedicating a specific time on your calendar, 20 to 30 minutes, for watching the videos and doing the daytime exercises, even though most practices will be done at night. Block off that time in your calendar and commit to it for 28 days; make it a non-negotiable. This is your time to invest in yourself. And connect with your tribe; use this conscious community of like-minded individuals to support one another on learning and embodying your new skills towards self-transformation. Set an intention in your projection diary. Why are you here? What do you think might have brought you to this specific course at this specific time? Why do you want to learn astral projection? Is it to align more with your inner self, connect to dead relatives and overcome grief, or transform the fear of death? Maybe take your spiritual practice to the next level. What is it for you? Your actions for today. Before we start our journey, I'd like you to prepare your projection diary, because it will be crucial for our journey together. And another action before we start is to set your intention and write down your motivation for starting this Quest. You can write it, you can paint it, whatever you like; get creative. And then, I suggest to go an extra mile and put it in a visible place so that every time you see it, it can remind you and help you to continue on this journey. We're going to go way beyond to be well within. See you on the other side.

Week 1: Prepare Your Body & Mind

====================

LESSON 1: Start an Astral Projection Diary
--------------------
<v ->Hello, and welcome to your quest on astral projection,</v> aimed at teaching you how to astral travel for the purposes of self-transformation. I've looked back at my physical body, time traveled, shed the fear of death, met ancestors, witnessed the vastness of space, entered other dimensions, healed parts of my soul, and experienced unconditional love. This isn't your average well-being practice. This is a powerful way to evolve your consciousness because it can positively transform the very essence of who you are. I wouldn't be sitting here speaking to you if it didn't. So let me ask you this question: are you willing to let go of who you think you are, so you might become all you can be? The ancient philosopher Lao Tzu said, "The key to growth is the introduction of higher dimensions of consciousness into our awareness." This is what astral projection does. So I hope you're ready because I know what's in store for you, and I'm pretty excited. I've been doing this since I was a child, and still every time I astral travel, it absolutely blows my mind, and I can't wait for you to experience it. Over the next four weeks, I'm going to teach you how to master three steps that will give you the ability to self-induce your own out-of-body experiences and build an astral projection practice. But like any new skill, we have to start from scratch. Walk before we can run which is why it's important to tune in to our intention, check our motivation, and create a projection plan. So grab your projection diary and let's get going. A projection diary is like a dream diary, except we also write about the things that happen throughout the night too, such as what we notice when we drift in and out of sleep, and during any meditations. If you have a dream, sleep paralysis, insomnia, or astral journey, anything that comes up during your practice, it all goes in the diary. This way we can keep track of our progress and notice any significant steps and breakthroughs. You can write in your diary at any time, but I will be specifically asking you to use it for certain activities during the Quest. We're going to do the first one together now. I'd like you to create a projection plan, something you would like to do in your astral projection experiences. So to avoid aimlessly floating around your room when you come out of body, you might want to think about where you want to go and what you want to do. What most people don't realize is that once you self-initiate the out-of-body experience, you have the keys to the universe. You can go anywhere. The possibilities are limitless, and yet beginners often wander around their house because they're not quite sure where to go. So now there's nothing wrong with this. In fact, your first experience is often one that is most memorable anyway. When I was the consultant for the cast of Behind Her Eyes on Netflix, I did a workshop with the actors. The main character Adele, played by Eve Hewson, managed to get her energy head out of her body. She lifted it out and she was so stunned, she dropped back into her body. This is because it felt so real. It is not a dreamy experience at all. So even if you come out and you roam around your room, it probably will be pretty exciting, but let's aim to do something even more adventurous. Creating a projection plan involves deciding on our intention, what we're going to do, and our motivation, why we're going to do it. If I were going to buy a loaf of bread, my intention would be to go buy the bread, but my motivation would be to feed my family. Here's a secret tip, choose a meaningful motivation. Our unconscious mind, our highest self, the universe. God is more likely to get on board and support the experience if you have a good reason to do it. I'm not sure they would probably get on board if you wanted to go spy on your ex or access the lottery numbers. Now I'm not saying don't have fun. On the contrary, a sense of play is very important. So by all means, fly to the moon, time travel, or go visit your friend. But for your main goal, perhaps choose something that you know will make a positive impact in your life or develop your spiritual practice, such as healing grief, overcoming fears, connecting to your purpose, releasing limitations, or developing your psychic awareness, experiencing life after death to lose the fear of death, or accessing infinite possibilities. I'd like you to write the following statement of intent in your diary. Choose the words that resonate most with you, and then fill in the blanks. "I call on my subconscious, highest self, spirit guide, or ancestor to help me go beyond the body to go, see, or experience __________ for the purpose of ____________." Choose what resonates with you the most. Here are a few examples: I call on my subconscious to help me go beyond the body to experience whether this is even really possible for the purpose of exploring states of consciousness. I call on my ancestors to help me go beyond the body to meet my dead father for the purpose of healing grief and gaining closure. I call on my highest self to help me go beyond the body to access other dimensions that show me my ultimate potential. I call on my spirit guide to transcend the body and experience an ultimate feeling of oneness with life and all there is. If you're not quite sure, that's okay. There's no need to force it. It might be that something comes to mind later on today or even in the week, but allow this question to drop into your mind: what do I want to do, and why do I want to do it? Your actions for today. Dedicate five minutes now and fill in the statement of intent in your projection diary. So by the end of today, you will have your projection plan, what you want to do, and why you want to do it. And then, we'll be able to learn some skills to make your plan happen. But that's for tomorrow, I'll see you then.

LESSON 2: The 12 Stages of the Hero's Journey for Astral Projection
--------------------
<v ->Hello, dear travelers.</v> Now that you're charged up with motivation, let's talk about the right attitude and approach to astral projection. In the Harry Potter books, the arch-villain Lord Voldemort strikes down the hero dead with a swipe of his wand. When Harry awakens, he's in a place of bright white light, that looks like King's Cross Station in London. He's having a near-death experience and Dumbledore, his wizard mentor, is there to greet him. After giving him advice, Dumbledore invites Harry to make a decision to stay or to move on or to return to his life. Harry knows he has to go back to finish his mission to defeat Voldemort. But before he leaves, Harry asks Dumbledore, "Is this real, or has this all been happening inside my head?" Dumbledore replies, "Of course it's happening inside your head, Harry, but why on earth should that mean it is not real?" "The Hero's Journey" is a common story structure shared by many cultures worldwide. The mythologist Joseph Campbell studied human myths throughout history and noticed that the same sequence appeared across cultures over and over again. He wrote about this in his book, "The Hero With a Thousand Faces" and he coined it "The Mono Myth" a symbolic universal story that we can all relate to. And it goes something like this: an ordinary person living their habitual and often ordinary life one day experiences something unexpected. This experience sets them off on a quest, a call to adventure. And during this quest, they meet new friends, allies, maybe even an enemy or two, and they face personal challenges. They find a mentor, and they battle for the greater good. And they finally return home, a changed person. Hollywood uses this as the dominant narrative for many of its movies, from Harry Potter to Pocahontas, King Arthur, and to The Lion King. The hero ventures into the unknown, and after a long journey full of dangerous twists and turns, they return triumphantly with the elixir. Almost always the so-called elixir is not what the hero expected, but if anything, it's something even better. In almost all heroic myths, the elixir takes form of some kind of timeless wisdom both for the hero and their community. You are this hero, the main character in your astral projection story. And whether you know it or not, you've already set off on your quest to find the elixir because you're here. This is why we're going to use "The Hero's Journey" as a framework for our progress. It's an empowering way of making sense of where we're at and understanding what might be to come. It's kind of like a mythical roadmap for tracking self-transformation. Now you might be thinking, well, I'm not a hero, I definitely don't feel like one, but that's exactly how the hero starts off. They're a normal person living an ordinary life until they get the call. In the hero's journey, there are 12 stages through which the hero undergoes inner and outer transformation to varying degrees. And although I've applied these stages to astral projection, see if any of them already sound familiar to you. Maybe you've already experienced some of these stages in areas of your life. Stage one, the ordinary world. You're living your normal life, doing all the everyday things as you've been doing them for a long time probably. Stage two, the call to adventure. Something happens to shake you up. There's a threat or a risk that disrupts your world. It can come in many forms: perhaps a loved one has died, your relationship has broken down, or you've lost your job. Or you've been diagnosed with a chronic illness, or maybe you've had something that you don't quite understand yet, like a spiritual awakening experience. Whatever it is, it calls you to take a new direction with life and presents you with something challenging. Maybe even something unwanted; whatever it is, it is the call to adventure, and your quest awaits. In our case here, right here, right now, it's astral projection. Stage three, refusal of the call. So you've heard the call, you know you kind of have to change lanes and move to this new thing, but you might be scared, full of doubts and unsure, unsure if you can handle it. And it feels far more safe to stay where you are in the comfort of what you know, naturally. So you stay where you are for a while longer until you get the call again, and this time you can't really ignore it. Stage four, meeting the mentor. You search for or cross paths with a mentor. Sometimes this mentor isn't an obvious example, but you soon find that in some way they can be a guide or a teacher for you in this moment. Maybe you sought them out or perhaps stumbled upon them by chance; either way, this mentor dispels your fears and gives you the confidence and the tools to set off on this new adventure. Right now, for you in this moment, that mentor is me. Stage five, crossing the first threshold. The threshold is the point where the hero enters new territory. It's not yet the point of no return, but it is very different to the world and life that they're used to. Your first threshold here with me, is taking your first step on your astral projection journey. The second threshold is learning how to do it. This is what we're going to begin this week. Stage six, tests and allies. This is when you're out of your comfort zone. You've gained confidence and knowledge of astral projection and are now putting it into action. But naturally, there might be some barriers along the way. You're still finding your feet; skills need practice, and you might feel like you're being tested. This is when you call on your tribe for support, reach out to the people who you trust and who can support you through this challenge. Know and call upon your allies. Are you going to give up at the first hurdle, or continue on the quest? Stage seven, approach to the cave. Entering the cave is like facing the abyss. This is when people start having their first out-of-body experience, OBE. Here we are being called to be brave and take a leap of faith. This is the point where you commit; bringing all of yourself to this moment, including all the fearful voices that tell you to quit, you keep going. This is our first real taste of entering the unknown, really going for it. Stage eight, the ordeal. Now you, the hero, may face a major challenge. As astral projection is ultimately a practice of self discovery, it could be that you realize something about yourself, have a profound insight, encounter something unexpected, or face a recurring problem. This might make you deeply question things. Sometimes at this stage, we might feel a bit defeated. And in the case of astral projection, you might find that your interest starts to wane, or a voice in your head says, "This isn't for me; it's not worth my time," or "I'm not ready for this." All of these voices are coming from a belief that is I'm not good enough, but there is always a glimmer of hope. In the Hero's Journey, it's the moment of despair before the hero finds the last bit of courage to slay the dragon in the deepest part of the cave. And we all have these dragons. At this time, you need to dig deep, deep into your inner resources, access the energy, the strength, the faith, whatever it is for you that you need to overcome this obstacle. It's never easy, but it is always worth it. Stage nine, the reward. This is your breakthrough moment. You've stuck it out this far, and you've been through some challenges. And suddenly you see this progress, a tipping point. You might feel you've not mastered it yet, but you're doing something that you didn't do before. It could be experiencing deep altered states, your first astral projection experience, or it might be achieving something specific during your astral travel, such as fulfilling your projection plan. For others it could happen before the out-of-body experience takes place. Perhaps you have a profound insight or realization during the practice for astral projection. This is the reward, the breakthrough; it's your breakthrough, it's real and it's important. Stage 10, the road back, you faced your fears and doubts. You've gained your reward, and now comes the journey back home. You prepare for transitioning back to your life before you embark on your quest, and you start to reflect on how you've changed, what you've learned. There'll be some people you say goodbye to, and some who you'll meet again soon, and you might be wondering, why did I learn astral projection? How will it fit into my life? And it's natural if you don't have a vision for where this practice fits yet; all heroes go through these uncertainties as they prepare for the long road back home. Make a note of all these questions and doubts; the answers will come in time, but for now you allow yourself the knowledge that being in the unknown is exactly where you need to be. And ask yourself, what do I need for support, resources, or practices to help me make this long journey on the road back to safety and wellness? Stage 11, the resurrection. At some point on the road back, the hero has one final moment of either challenge or discovery, or both some times. After this, they discover the final piece of the puzzle. And for now they might experience something of a rebirth. In heroic myths, this is often called the Phoenix rising or the resurrection. Sometimes they encounter someone who at one point might have been a bit of a thorn in that side. In your case, it might not be a person, but it could be a familiar inner voice or a doubt, or a fear that comes back to trouble you one last time. This voice might be telling you, you'll never be able to astral project; it's all nonsense. No one will understand you or believe you if you tell them where you've been and what you've done; but having conquered your dragons and having embraced this one last time, you realize you've become a different person. A part of you is remade, reborn, or even alive for the first time. You are not the same person who started this journey when you heard the call; you're ready to be the new you, all that you've learned will be a part of you. And you will thrive in your life because of it. Stage 12, return with the elixir. Remember within the quest, we will all enter these different stages at various times because we're all on our own unique journey. We're all different. Depending on your practice, you might only get through a few of these stages or you might get through them all quite quickly during our time together; there's no right or wrong pace. And there isn't a prize for who gets to stage 12 first; we can't force the hero's journey; it unfolds in its own time when we go through the training and do our practices. Also, your astral projection quest will continue after you finish this course, so there's no pressure to get to the end. Besides, when we arrive at stage 12 and return home with the elixir, what happens next? We begin another hero's journey. A deeper level of transformation. Joseph Campbell said, "The hero's journey is inside of you; tear off the veils and open the mystery of yourself." So in the spirit of adventure and in acknowledgement of our hero's journey, I'd like to invite you to take the Hero's Oath as a pledge to your own practice. This is four short lines, and after each line, I'll leave some space for you to repeat after me. If you'd like to do this, you can say it out loud or in your own head; either is fine. You might like to close your eyes, and perhaps place a hand on your heart, and then repeat after me. I am here to learn the mysteries of my soul and the universe through astral projection. I hear the call to learn new practices and knowledge. I embrace it with courage, openness, and determination. I am ready for challenge and transformation. Okay, gently opening the eyes. Your actions for today. I'd like you to think about what hero and story you resonate with the most. Choose a character from a book, a film, or a fairy tale, whichever one your heart warms to. This is because we often see ourselves in these heroes, our flaws, our gifts, our obstacles, and our triumphs. Becoming aware of our external hero can help us connect to our inner one. Share which hero you resonate with the most in the tribe. I'll go first, mine is Katniss Everdeen from "The Hunger Games" books. Now you share yours and I'll see you tomorrow.

LESSON 3: Overcome the 3 Common Fears of an Out of Body Experience
--------------------
<v ->Hello, and welcome back heroes.</v> Joseph Campbell, the author of "The Hero with a Thousand Faces" famously said, "The cave you fear to enter holds the treasure you seek." Today, we're going to explore something many of us instinctively shy away from, the F word. So let's do the best thing for fear; let's embrace it by naming it and facing it. It's a perfectly natural response to feel fear about new things that we haven't tried before. We're human after all. And in this session, we'll look at the top three fears related to OBEs, out-of-body experiences, why we feel this fear, and how maybe we can transform it. Before we go on, what is the thing or things you fear the most? Not just your big fears, but small day-to-day worries too. You see, how we react to fear in life is probably how we'll respond to astral projection in some way. Are you aware of your fears and where they come from? When you experience fear, where does it sit in your body and how do you respond? Do you feel fear about having an out-of-body experience, or perhaps you don't feel any at all, or maybe there's a subtle fear occurring for you? The irony is, there have been many anecdotes from astral projectors who have reported a reduction in fear and anxiety, especially death anxiety, after experiencing the astral plane, myself included. Fear is completely normal when it comes to this type of work. So you're not alone. And although it can be one of the biggest stumbling blocks to astral projection, it's something that we can actually work to our advantage. Tibetan Buddhist nun, Pema Chodron, author of "The Places That Scare You," says, "Fear is a natural reaction to moving closer to the truth." So maybe in some instances it's nudging us towards something that we need to look at within ourselves. There are a range of tools I'm going to share with you today to help overcome any fear you might have about experiencing astral projection. More about that in a moment though. First of all, what is fear? Fear is a natural and primitive emotion. It alerts us to the presence of danger or the threat of harm, whether that danger is physical or psychological. Sometimes fear stems from real threats, but it can also originate from imagined dangers, like when we see things in the dark. Of course, fear can also be a symptom of some mental health conditions too. Did you know, we're only born with two fears: falling and of loud noises. Sometimes we can have the sensation of falling when falling asleep, which can cause an involuntary body reaction, such as hypnic jerks. Maybe you've had this experience, this kind of like jolting sensation as you're drifting off and falling asleep. But today we're going to specifically explore the fear connected to having an out-of-body experience, either beforehand in the waking state or in those moments as it's happening. Firstly, it's important to remember that fear is there to help us. Though of course, sometimes our fear can be misguided like an over-protective parent. Fear is unhealthy when it makes you more cautious than you really need to be to stay safe and when it prevents you from doing the things you would otherwise enjoy. But it is a natural emotion and a survival mechanism. When we confront a perceived threat, our bodies respond in specific ways. So it's a helpful emotional response. Physical reactions to fear include sweating, increased heart rate, high adrenaline levels that make us extremely alert. If you have a phobia such as spiders, like me, you might have experienced this before. But sometimes this can happen when we're about to have an out-of-body experience, 'cause we've never had one before. This physical reaction is also known as the fight or flight response, which your body prepares itself to either enter combat or run away. This biochemical reaction is likely an evolutionary development. It's an automatic response that is crucial to our survival. So it's perfectly normal human response to have in a wide range of circumstances. Some people are adrenaline seekers, thriving on extreme sports and other fear-inducing thrill situations. Others have a negative reaction to the feeling of fear and avoid fear-inducing situations at all costs. I'd like to share a story with you now called The Hunter and the Thorn, which exemplifies a lesson linked to this avoidance of fear that I'd like us to learn. The Hunter and the Thorn. A man was out hunting in the woods when he shot a deer. But in the process, he caught his arm on a thorn bush. He cried out as the thorn stuck deep in his arm, but he was too scared of the pain that it might cause if he tried to pull it out. So he decided to not move his arm at all and instead strapped it to his side. But, he couldn't manage to drag the deer with one arm, so he had to leave his catch behind. On his way home, he came to a thick part of the woods where he accidentally brushed his arm on a nearby tree. In anger, he decided to avoid this area and find a different way back. He arrived home late without food, and his family went without supper that night. In the morning, he awoke to find that his arm had healed with the thorn inside it. But it had hit a nerve causing pain in other areas of his body. Without being able to use his arm, he couldn't physically work, and so he had to look for another job which he was given less pay. This troubled the hunter who couldn't use his full potential and he worried about what he was going to do. How different might his life have been if he had just pulled out the thorn? This is a simple example of how fear and the avoidance of pain and suffering can shape our life in unseen ways. We could be the hunter, and the thorn may be the fear lodged in our mind restricting access to our greater potential and our ability to astral project. But we are in a much better position than the hunter because we can choose to turn towards the thorn and see it. And sometimes this is enough to even release it. But for those deeper thorns, which we all have to some degree, we can build the courage to pull them out. So if you're thinking, "Well, I don't have any thorns," that might be the case, but also, we might have some invisible thorns that were lodged in so long ago we've forgotten that they're there. So if we discover any in today's session or over the next few weeks, let's get those tweezers ready and be compassionately curious about what rosebush the thorn came from. So how might these thorns, these fears, interrupt astral projection? In short, our fear response in our body keeps us in our body. So let's look at three common fears of having an out-of-body experience. The first, will I come back to my physical body? This is an underlying fear of, will I die? Number two, will I return altered in some way? The underlying fear here is, will I lose my mind? Number three, can I go where I want? Will I have full control? What do you notice about all of these things? They're all fears related to the unknown. For those who've had an OBE before, you might not be asking these questions or feeling these fears because for you, it's not an unknown. Do you relate to any of these top-three fears, or perhaps you have a different concern? Take a minute or two now to write down in your diary any fear you might have; name it. That's the first step to removing the thorn. Philosopher Ralph Waldo Emerson said, "Knowledge is the antidote to fear." So I'm going to give you that gift right now. Here are the short answers to those big fears. Will I come back to my physical body? Yes; yes, you will. Your consciousness is automatically drawn to its physical body. In fact, it's harder to stay out of body once we're in astral projection. OBE teacher and author, Graham Nicholls, reckons it's around 20 minutes when we begin to habitually shift back into the body. However, because we experience time differently during astral projection, it could feel like much longer or much shorter, but rest assured, you will come back to your body. Look at it this way. At some point, you're going to want to go to the toilet. So that will definitely bring you back. Could I lose my mind? Will I return altered in some way? No, you won't lose your mind, but it's highly likely you will return changed for the better with new insights and wisdom. Like in the return of the hero's journey, sometimes the return can be challenging because we've learned something new about ourselves or the world. So we do need to integrate any new insights into our life and ground back into this reality here and now. Towards end of the Quest, I'll be sharing some ways in which we can do this together. Will I have control? This is a tricky one. The answer is both yes and no. But no isn't a bad thing. In the same way we don't have control over everything in our lives, when we're in the astral plane, we don't have control over everything there, but we do have control over our own actions, and we can choose to leave at any time we wish. You can steer the ship on the astral plane in the same way your mind sails through waking life. And I'll be giving you some tips later for greater control. Now, what if you're overwhelmed with fear just before or during astral projection? In that moment, when you feel the fear take over, what do you do? We take a Metta-Moment. Metta is a loving kindness meditation, and it can help us to shift quickly from the lane of fear to the lane of love. Now we probably won't have time to do a whole Metta meditation right now, but we can take a Metta-Moment. Let's give it a go together now. Close your eyes and drop your awareness into your heart center. Bringing attention to the chest space and tuning into the energy of the heart. You might like to do this by feeling your heartbeat or acknowledging your capacity for love, a capacity which we all have. Sometimes it might be tricky to do this quickly, especially if we're filled with fear. So what can help is thinking of people, pets, or places that you're grateful for. Bring them to mind now. Feel the feelings you have for them, and let these feelings wash over you. And if you'd like to, perhaps send them a smile from your heart. Okay, open the eyes. It's as simple as that. You can take a Meta-Moment whenever you need. With astral projection, one of these times might be when you're about to enter the unknown. Rumi said, "What is fear? The non-acceptance of uncertainty, if we accept uncertainty, it becomes adventure." Gosh, I remember the first time that I experienced the vibrational state, I was so scared. I had this energy flowing through the body. I was hearing these strange sounds. I didn't know what to do. But now when I feel it, I know what's happening. So I'm like, okay, here we go. Roll up my sleeves; let's do this. But what we don't know, we can't control, right? And more often than not, what we do know, we can't control either. That's why an open heart and spirit, a sense of surrender to the moment, helps us to embrace the unknown. This way of responding with surrender rather than reacting from fear is a behavioral habit, but one we can acquire quickly through mindfulness and self-awareness. So let's practice entering the unknown, invite our fears to a tea party, and get to know them over a cup of tea and a biscuit. Your actions for today are going to be just that. For the rest of today, you're going to do the yes man or yes woman challenge. This is inspired from the film "Yes Man" featuring Jim Carrey. He plays a cynical man whose life feels unfulfilled, and he says no to most things a lot of the time. He bumps into an old friend who's been living an extraordinary life, and he gives him a leaflet called Yes Man, about a challenge where you have to say yes to everything. And so Jim ends up saying yes in all sorts of scenarios and finds himself off on crazy adventures. Some he enjoys and some he struggles with, but they always end up being good for his soul in the end. But what it is really about is saying yes to the unknown, bypassing initial judgment and giving in to something, to go with no expectations of the outcome. So here is your task for today. Every time an opportunity presents itself, you enter into the unknown, such as an invitation, a question you might be asked, or a scenario you find yourself in. Don't say no, be with that uncomfortable resistance, that subtle fear maybe, and step into it. See what happens. Say yes and go with the flow. It could be to taste some new food, it could be to go on a trip, join a group, or take a class, maybe have a conversation with a stranger. Now, we still have to have discernment. If someone says, "Do you want to learn gymnastics?" and you've got a bad back, maybe don't say yes to that. As long as you won't be harming yourself or others, it's fine to go ahead and do it. I want to remind you that you have taken the Hero's Oath. So if you find that it feels like a challenge, it's part of the path, remember. So have fun with it.

LESSON 3: Meditation - Metta-Moment Meditation

- Close your eyes and drop your awareness into your heart center, bringing attention to the chest space and tuning into the energy of the heart. You might like to do this by feeling your heartbeat or acknowledging your capacity for love, a capacity which we all have. Sometimes it might be tricky to do this quickly, especially if we're filled with fear. So what can help is thinking of people, pets, or places that you are grateful for. Bring them to mind now. Feel the feelings you have for them and let these feelings wash over you. And if you'd like to perhaps send them a smile from your heart. Okay. Open the eyes.

LESSON 4: Break Limiting Beliefs About Astral Projection
--------------------
- Hello, and welcome back. Yesterday, we addressed our fears, and today, we're setting our unhelpful beliefs free. An unhelpful belief is a limiting belief which is exactly how it sounds. A limiting belief is a thought, a state of mind, an opinion that we believe to be true and limits us in some way. They usually have some kind of negative impact on our lives by preventing us from moving forward or growing on a personal, professional, or spiritual level. You know the score; we've been doing this since we were kids, we make up a story about the why, or the what, or what we've been told by a caregiver or a teacher. And then we take it as fact, until we start to live our life as though this story were true. Often it's because we believe it's keeping us safe, but the truth is these stories are preventing us from flourishing. More often than not, limiting beliefs keep you from reaching your most significant potential. They can get in the way of what you think is possible for yourself. Are you ready to let go of and clear the limiting beliefs that could be keeping you from achieving so much more? Let's jump right in. So, in terms of astral projection, how might these limiting beliefs be showing up? On the surface, they might sound like this. The avoider often makes excuses. "I just don't have enough time to practice." "Oh, it's going to disturb my sleep." "I've heard it's dangerous." They avoid through distraction, excuses, and making themselves busy. The victim usually plays small. "I'm never any good at these things." "It won't happen for me, so why bother trying?" "It will take me ages to learn." They keep themselves small. The catastrophizer believes the worst. "What if I don't come back to my physical body?" Or, "Surely I'm going to go mad." They catastrophize future events. The mental filterer focuses on the negative. "I came out of my body and I went on a journey into the universe, but I didn't do my projection plan, I didn't do all my things, what a waste of time." They fail to recognize the little wins, and so they don't celebrate their achievements. The demander puts pressure on themselves such as, "I've been practicing for ages, I ought to have had an OBE by now." "I should be able to meditate." "I must be able to learn more techniques." They use demanding language to punish themselves into success. Now, I don't know about you, but I've definitely experienced all of those things in the past. But there's usually a dominant one, isn't there, or two, that we fall into the most. For me, it's the mental filterer. And I know it's related to having quite a strong inner critic. I'm a recovering perfectionist, so I struggle with not getting great results straight away, but that's me. Which one sounds more like you? If you listened to those types and you sat there thinking, "Oh, oh, that one's me." Don't worry, we all start out here. These are very common limiting beliefs, especially amongst beginners. And the great thing we can do is be able to release some of these beliefs. If you identified with the avoider, practice self-discipline, set an achievable task that's realistic for you. Maybe writing one sentence in your projection diary every day. Also not comparing yourself to others in the tribe, it will only set you in a position to justify why you should avoid practice. Besides, remember we're all diverse heroes on different journeys. You can't compare Batman to Moana, can you? If you resonated with the victim, be aware of your words, for words are spells that shape our reality. So, cast a good one. Instead of saying, "This is too hard for me," maybe say, "Wow, what an exciting challenge." Reframe how you see yourself; it will make the situation much easier. Don't forget all heroes go through tough patches too, so it might just be one for you. If you are a catastrophizer, rather than focusing on what could go wrong, focus on what might go right. What if I do come out of my physical body and fly through the clouds? Can you be open to possibilities that seem out of your reach? If you focus on the negatives like the mental filterer, practice gratitude, celebrate the positives. You might find it hard to do at first, but try to notice the things that go right. Take a moment to acknowledge it because even the smallest progress is a movement towards your goal. It's the tortoise that wins the race, remember, not the hare. So, if you demand a lot from yourself, just take it easy. The demander. If you demand a lot from yourself, take the foot off the pedal and relieve the pressure, practice patience, and go lightly with yourself. Rather than using should have, would have, couldas, adopt a gentle language, lean into softness. Listening to and letting go of our limiting beliefs is moving closer to our liberation. Now, we know what type of limiting beliefs that we might have, let's take a few minutes to assess them. In a moment, I'd like you to pause this video while you take note of your limiting beliefs in relation to astral projection. You might also just like to make a list of your limiting beliefs in life, too. That's optional. In your diary, complete this sentence. Limiting beliefs I have that could impact my astral projection include... Then just write it all down without any stopping to read, or going back, or editing; don't worry about spelling mistakes, handwriting, or your grammar. Allow yourself time to just free-write, will give yourself a better connection with your subconscious. And you might find that after a few minutes, you start to engage with this part of your mind, and more deeply held beliefs may start to rise to the surface and come onto the page. That's the great thing about free-writing in this way. Even if you can't think of anything, write that down and just keep writing gibberish. Allow it all to pour out, whatever its shape, and see what lands on your page. That's the fun bit. So, let's take five minutes for this or longer if you prefer. And once you're done, start the video again. Okay, are you ready? Pause the video and begin your limiting beliefs free-writing now. Hopefully, you've taken some time to explore your limiting beliefs and write them down. What did you find? Any surprises? Did you discover anything new, or perhaps it confirmed some things that you already knew? You can repeat this exercise again at another point if you'd like to. You may or may not have noticed some fears arising from yesterday's session. Or maybe you didn't; perhaps you don't have any limiting beliefs, but remember, if you do, this is perfectly normal. The great thing is once we've identified them we can do something about it. Let's now take back the power that our limiting beliefs have been holding hostage for so long. We're now going to rewrite the story of our limiting beliefs, releasing ourselves from them. From your list that you just wrote down, next to each limiting belief in your diary, rewrite your story with a positive affirmation. For example, if you wrote something like, "I'm never good at things like this," you could change that to, "I'm confident, I'm capable, I can totally do it." If you wrote something like, "Oh, I'll have a bad experience. I might experience something negative." You could change that to, "I have everything within me to handle any situation." If you wrote down something like, "Oh, I'll get lost," or, "I might not come back to my body." You might like to change that to, "I'm safe, I'm at ease, and I'm calm. I can come back to my body whenever I wish," because you can. So, let's take a few minutes now to do this. And if you have a lot of limiting beliefs, don't put pressure on yourselves to get through them all, you can finish it later if you'd like some more time. Otherwise, take a few minutes to rewrite the story of your limiting beliefs. Now, we're getting somewhere; well done. To help bring new beliefs to life, we are going to cultivate three qualities helpful for astral projection. This is courage, intuition, and calmness. So now, we are going to begin to plow some new neural pathways using neurolinguistic programming. This uses visualization, memory, and our imagination to draw on our inner resources to aid astral projection. Although in this exercise, we are going to harness courage, intuition, and calmness, once you have learned how to do it in the future you can use it for other things too. Taking the time to recognize and release our limiting beliefs can free us up to have astral projection journeys beyond our wildest dreams, and live more fulfilling lives full of confidence and purpose. It can help us to unblock any stumbling blocks that might hamper our progress. Start noticing what these inner voices are saying to you, and listen, take note, but don't be afraid to tango with them. So, let's do an exercise together now. Do this once it's safe and appropriate for you to stand up and move around. This exercise is called the Circle of Power. If it's okay for you to do so, I'd encourage you to do this standing up so we can use our bodies as well as our mind to help us feel and sense into our Circle of Power. When you're ready and standing, closing the eyes. I want you to see or sense a ring of power in front of you. This ring can look like whatever power looks like to you. Some people say flames of fire, blue lightning, strong trees, a tunnel of wind. This ring represents what powerful energy means to you. This can be symbolic or more literal. If you don't see your ring, perhaps you feel it. Is there a magnetic, a warm, or vibrational quality to this power? Maybe you hear your ring, the crackling of electricity, a roar of fire, or a vacuum of light. If you haven't already, tune into your ring of power now. Knowing your ring of power is in front of you, I'd like to invite you to remember a time where you felt full of courage. Nothing can take you down, you are brave in your mind and brave in your heart. See what you saw, hear what you heard, feel what you felt. Take a breath with this confidence as you step into the ring of power now. Feel what it feels like to be courageous, let these sensations enter your body and mind. Notice waves of courage flowing through you like you can do absolutely anything. Fears fall away as you become your most courageous self. You are operating at optimum personal power like you're at the top of the world. As you step out of the circle, you embody this confidence and take it with you. Step out of the circle now. Take a moment to allow this confidence to absorb into your being. I'd like you now to remember a time where you felt strong intuition, or perhaps psychic ability, when you had heightened awareness, or an ability to see or know invisible things, a moment of extra sensory perception. See what you saw, hear what you heard, feel what you felt. Take a breath with this strong intuition or psychic power as you step into the ring now. This extrasensory ability is activated within you. Feel what it feels like to have high intuition or psychic power. Let these sensations enter your body and mind. Your awareness is imbued with this natural invisible force. As you step out of the circle, you are connected to this inner power and you take it with you. Step out of the circle now. Take a moment to allow the strong intuition or psychic ability to absorb into your being. I'd like you now to remember a time where you felt calm and centered, when nothing could disturb your inner sense of calm. This might be entwined with feelings of serenity or perhaps deep peace. See what you saw, hear what you heard, feel what you felt. Take a breath with this deep calmness as you step into the ring now. Allow this peaceful sense of calm to arise. It washes over you, soothing the nervous system into rest and digest, settling the heart, and calming the mind like a warm hug. Feel what it feels like to embody a calm presence. Let these sensations enter your body and mind. You embrace this serene quality, enabling it to become a part of your being. As you step out of the circle, you are aligned with this new inner calm that you bring with you. Step out of the circle now. Having gathered our confidence, calmness, intuition, or psychic ability, we can now release the visualization of our ring of power. Your actions for today. Today, I'd like you to complete the limiting beliefs journaling exercise, and then you can come back to the Circle of Power whenever you need a boost of calm, courage, or intuition. I invite you to do this practice regularly before you fall asleep so that you get into the right mindset before entering the mind awake body asleep state. You don't have to do this physically, you can actually do this lying in bed as a visualization when you do it later on as part of your practice. Okay, have fun, and I will see you tomorrow.

LESSON 4: Meditation - Circle of Power Exercise

Do this once it's safe and appropriate for you to stand up and move around. This exercise is called the circle of power. If it's okay for you to do so, I'd encourage you to do this standing up so we can use our bodies as well as our mind to help us feel and sense into our circle of power. When you are ready and standing, closing the eyes, I want you to see or sense a ring of power in front of you. This ring can look like whatever power looks like to you. Some people see flames of fire, blue lightning, strong trees, a tunnel of wind. This ring represents what powerful energy means to you. This can be symbolic or more literal. If you don't see your ring, perhaps you feel it. Is there a magnetic, a warm or vibrational quality to this power? 

Maybe you hear your ring, the crackling of electricity, a raw of fire or a vacuum of light. If you haven't already, tune into your ring of power. Now, knowing your ring of power is in front of you, I'd like to invite you to remember a time where you felt full of courage. Nothing can take you down. You are brave in your mind and brave in your heart. See what you saw. Hear what you heard. Feel what you felt. Take a breath with this confidence as you step into the ring of power. Now, feel what it feels like to be courageous. Let these sensations enter your body and mind. 

Notice waves of courage flowing through you like you can do absolutely anything. Fears fall away. As you become your most courageous self, you are operating a optimum personal power like you're at the top of the world. As you step out of the circle, you embody this confidence and take it you step out of the circle. Now, take a moment to allow this confidence to absorb into your being. I'd like you now to remember a time where you felt strong intuition or perhaps psychic ability when you had heightened awareness or an ability to see or know invisible things. A moment of extra sensory perception. See what you saw. Hear what you heard, feel what you felt. Take a breath with this strong intuition or psychic power as you step into the ring. Now, this extra sensory ability is activated within you. Feel what it feels like to have high intuition or psychic power. Let these sensations enter your body and mind. 

Your awareness is imbued with this natural, invisible force. As you step out of the circle, you are connected to this inner power and you take it with you. Step out of the circle. Now. Take a moment to allow the strong intuition or psychic ability to absorb into your being. I'd like you now to remember a time where you felt calm and centered. When nothing could disturb your inner sense of calm, this might be entwined with feelings of serenity or perhaps deep peace. See what you saw. Hear what you heard. Feel what you felt. Take a breath with this deep calmness as you step into the ring. Now, allow this peaceful sense of calm to arise. It washes over you soothing the nervous system into rest and digest. Settling the heart and calming the mind like a warm hug. Feel what it feels like to embody a calm presence. Let these sensations enter your body and mind you. Embrace this serene quality, enabling it to become a part of your being. As you step out of the circle, you are aligned with this new inner calm that you bring with you. Step outta the circle. Now, having gathered our confidence, calmness, intuition, or psychic ability, we can now release the visualization of our ring of power.

LESSON 5: The First Step: Mind Awake Body Asleep
--------------------
<v ->Hello, astral travelers.</v> So far, we've looked at our expectations, our fears, our limiting beliefs, and our mindset in preparation for astral projection. If we apply what we've learnt so far and throughout the rest of the Quest, it will enable us to have quicker, longer, and deeper experiences. So now let's remember the three steps to astral projection. Step one is the mind awake body asleep state. This is the altered state of awareness we first need to get into to astral travel. Step two is the vibrational state. This is the transitory precursor experience that often happens just before we leave the body. And step three is the most exciting part: this is the sense of separation, expansion, the act of moving beyond the body. Now don't worry about step two or three right now; we need to master step one. This is because if we don't harness this state, it's very hard to astral project, unless of course it happens spontaneously. The mind awake body asleep state is a type of altered state similar to trance; it's when the mind is awake and aware, but the body's completely relaxed, ideally to the point where we can't feel it anymore, what we call total body dissolution. Think of something in the past where you have felt deeply relaxed, almost like you're melting into the space around you. So just having a massage, a warm bath, or being snug in blankets. We want our mind not to feel the boundary of our body anymore so we can't sense where we are in space. It's a bit like when we doze off in the car or the train, your mind is trying to remain alert so that we can get off at the right stop, but your body is nodding off, wanting to go to sleep. We want to get to that point, except with total focus, not letting our mind drift off but staying concentrated. So it's much deeper than a daydream or being very relaxed. I've got some good news for you. You already do it, you just don't know it. It's called the hypnagogic and hypnopompic state. We pass through this state twice a day without even knowing. It's when we enter the hypnagogic, when we're falling asleep and the hypnopompic, when we're waking up from sleep. Of course, we can also use meditation and deep relaxation to self-induce these experiences. But for beginners, harnessing that cusp of sleep is often easier because we do it anyway. Now, if you're sitting there thinking, "Well, I have terrible insomnia, this won't work for me." Actually, it could work for you more than others and this is because the more nightly wake-ups we have, the more chances we have to build the habit of astral projection. Let me explain. It's said that the light bulb inventor Edison used to sit holding ball bearings in his hand, and then he would enter the hypnagogic state, and his body would fall asleep. So he would drop the ball bearings which would jerk him awake, and he could write down any insights from this state for his creative ideas. This is because when we enter the hypnagogic, we often go into the alpha and theta brainwaves, the same sort of ones we enter into when we're having a relaxing massage, using our imagination, or being creative. When this happens, you might begin to get hypnagogic hallucinations. Let me ask you this. Have you ever experienced any of these things on the onset of your sleep? Colors, spirals, geometric patterns, faces, even glimpses of dream imagery. You might even have auditory hallucinations, hear voices, even your name being called. I get luminous rings of purple and green, and then often followed by intricate moving patterns, like particles that weave in and out of each other. For me, that's how I know I'm on the hypnagogic highway. At one end of the hypnagogic highway, we're awake, and at the other end, we are asleep. Now, as we drift off, we begin to cruise down the highway. Now, we might lose consciousness, black out, and fall asleep and if that happens, maybe that's what our body and mind needs at that time. So whilst it's not great for astral projection, it's okay if that happens. But we might also cruise down the highway, remain aware as we fall asleep, and then enter into a dream or a lucid dream which is a dream in which we know we are dreaming. This is really cool when it happens, because as you're falling through the hypnagogic, you begin to see the dream form all around you: floor, table, window, chair, then pop, you're suddenly in the dream. It's absolutely nuts, and it's so much fun; you can do all sorts of things. But if we cruise along the hypnagogic highway and before we fall asleep, we enter what I call the Goldilocks conditions, not too awake, not too asleep, what I call the sweet spot. If we hit this and at that time we do an exit technique, we can go into astral projection where we leave the body. Now the timing of the sweet spot is different for everybody because we all drop off to sleep at different rates. So starting the car and getting to know the path of our hypnagogic highway is vital if we're going to harness this natural state. Unless of course, we accidentally drift into that sweet spot when we take a nap or we wake up momentarily in the night. One way to hack the hypnagogic highway is mindfulness of dream and sleep. It's a bit like yoga nidra, the yoga of sleep. I teach this mindfulness approach to astral projection, not only as part of preparation, but also for navigating the experience itself. Mindfulness is being aware of what is happening as it's happening with no judgment or preference. It's like a purposeful way of paying attention to the present moment. This is important for the success of the methods that we will use to self-induce astral travel. This helps us to track our progress better and not get distracted. The ability to focus and notice what's happening is vital to simply carry out the techniques, but it also boosts the recall of our experiences after we've had one, and it improves our decision-making during astral travel itself. This is why we're going to become night yogis and learn a beditation known as hypnagogic mindfulness. It's a bit like a slumber party for the brain. The body drops off to sleep, but our mind stays conscious. So like Edison, we're going to try and drift on the edge of sleep. And if you're thinking, "Oh well, this sounds like it's going to keep me awake," think of it this way, you're going to pass through the hypnagogic state anyway every time you go to sleep, so you might as well be aware of it. And we sleep for a third of our lives; that's around 30 years. So we may as well harness that time for self-growth by practicing astral projection. So how do we do this? It's pretty simple. We just bring our attention to the present moment, notice what's happening, and be with that. Let's have a rehearsal. Close your eyes now, notice the black, brown, or grayishness behind your eyes. What can you see? Perhaps not much as we've just shut our eyes and we're not in an altered state, but if we settle for a little longer here, we might be able to make out shapes or notice a different quality to our vision. Perhaps we see nothing at all, but we feel or sense something inside us or around us. We might even hear something. It's not about striving to find stuff, but rather noticing what's already there which might be things that come and go or nothing at all, and that's okay too. And if we get bored, which is a natural reaction, we can just anchor our mind back to whatever we can see behind our eyes. Okay, open your eyes now. When we're in the hypnagogic state on the edge of sleep, there might be a lot more going on, such as hallucinations or sounds. If you can hold your focus here for long enough, you might get a creative insight, a message, or even hear your name being called. I want you to practice this tonight by listening to the guided audio I made for you. But first let me teach you something that will help you drop faster into the mind awake body asleep state. This is the 4-7-8 breath. Using the breath is one of the quickest ways to relax the body. And therefore it supports dropping into the hypnagogic state much faster. This is why we're going to learn the 4-7-8 breath. It's a breathing pattern developed by Dr. Andrew Weil, which is based on an ancient yogic technique called pranayama. It's scientifically proven to deeply relax and replenish the body, switching on the parasympathetic nervous system, helping us to rest and digest. He calls it a natural tranquilizer for the nervous system. It's also good to do anyway if you suffer from anxiety or insomnia. This method involves breathing in for four through the nose, holding for seven, and releasing out for eight through the mouth. Let's practice this together so when you come to do it later, you're familiar with it. But don't worry too much about trying to reach these numbers. I have asthma, so sometimes I struggle with it. The most important thing is that the exhale is longer than the inhale. So just do what you can. Let's have a practice now, but before we start, just notice the air naturally passing through your nose or mouth. Become aware of the rise and fall of the chest. And you might like to place a hand on your belly or chest to bring attention to these areas. Eyes open or closed, either is fine, which helps you tune into the sensation of breath moving through the body. First, let your lips part, making a whooshing sound out, exhaling completely through your mouth. Next, close your lips and inhale through your nose as I count to four. Two, three, four; then holding, two, three, four, five, six, seven. Exhale out two, three, four, five, six, seven and eight; breathing in again for four. two, three, four, holding it here if we can, two, three, four, five, six, seven. Releasing out for eight, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight. One last time, big Buddha belly breath in two, three, four, contain the breath here, two, three, four, five, six, seven, long controlled exhale out, two, three, four, five, six, seven, and eight. Well done, allow your breath to return back to its natural state. It's as easy as that. Your actions for today. I'd like you to practice the 4-7-8 breath tonight, along with your beditation, the hypnagogic mindfulness, as part of the guided audio track that you'll find on this lesson. So both of the exercises will be on there which you'll follow along. Use it before you fall asleep. Now you don't need to remember anything because I will guide you through it. Your job is to relax, follow the instructions, and keep your mind awake and aware. So tonight when you get in bed, put on your headphones, listen to the audio, and don't worry about trying to get out of your body or anything else. Our tasks today is to see if we can enter the mind awake body asleep state, and ride the hypnagogic highway. How long can you keep your mind awake and aware as you drop off to sleep? As an optional practice, you might like to do the Circle of Power Exercise before going to bed to step into the right mindset and connect with your courage, intuition, and a sense of calm. Also remembering in the morning after you have done this, jot down anything: feelings, sights, sounds, anything that comes up; write it all in your projection diary. Okay, I'll see you tomorrow.

====================

LESSON 5: Meditation - Hypnagogic Mindfulness

- Before we begin, limit any distractions that could pull your senses and attention outwards into the physical world. You might like to shut the curtains, close the windows and doors, wear headphones or an eye mask, and get into a comfortable position. If you would like to do this and you haven't already, pause the track now and take a moment to do this. Although we want to get to a place where we cannot feel our physical body anymore, it is okay to adjust your position or scratch an itch at any time if you need to. This is your time to awaken and practice. The skill of astral projection within you is the ability to tap into realms beyond the body. This is because you are a multi-dimensional being with infinite potential. All with this in mind. Let's begin. For now, all we're going to do is just be where we are. Just noticing where we are right now. Perhaps take three deep belly breaths to settle our body and mind. Then becoming aware of the space behind the neck, feeling the length of the spine in our back, noticing the weight of our hips sitting within our body, feeling the legs touch the bed chair or ground arms hanging at the sides of us, hands and fingers loose at the end. Bringing our attention to the texture of the clothes, all blankets, touching the skin and sensing the space around the body. Noticing the physical edges of ourselves, the boundary of our being. Just tuning into any feelings we might have in this moment, not needing to change or do anything about them, just being aware of how we feel right now. And lastly, in our own way, feeling the connection to the earth and the support we gain from it. Let's set a general intention here for the mind to be awake and aware and for the body to become completely relaxed. Maybe we could bring our personal motivation to mind here, our purpose, our reason why we are practicing astral projection. We allow our intention and motivation to drop into our awareness like a pebble sinking in water, letting our intention go. Now, let's shift our attention to the breath, noticing the inhale and the exhale. Becoming aware of how the air passes through the nose or mouth and the rise and fall off the chest, the air coming and going in its own way. In a moment, we will do a breathing exercise called the 4 7, 8 breath. This method involves breathing in quietly for four through the nose, holding for seven, and releasing out forcefully for eight through the mouth like we are trying to make a wishing sound with our lips as we blow the air out. Don't worry too much about reaching these numbers, just do what you can. I will guide this for a few minutes. Okay, let's begin after our next exhale. Breathing out now and breathing in for 1, 2, 3, 4, and holding here, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7. Slowly release. 4, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1. That's it. Breathing in again, 2, 3, 4, and hold in here, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7. Slowly out, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and eight. Breathing in again, big belly breath, 2, 3, 4, holding if we can, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7. Slowly release out all year. 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8. Breathe in in again. That's good. Three, four, and holding. 3, 4, 5, 6, 7. Slowly release, pushing out every bit of air. 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and again, 2, 3, 4, and holding. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. Serve and releasing out. 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and eight last time. Deep breath in filling all the bones in the body with air. 2, 3, 4, and holding. 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7. Releasing out. Squeezing out every drop of air. 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and eight. Well done. Allowing the breath to return to its natural state now. Nothing to do now, nowhere to go. Just rest, drifting in our own time into the hypnagogic state. With each outbreath, we relax deeper and deeper into a wider awareness, leaving any bodily sensations behind. For now, remembering you can come back to the body at any time, but for now, letting it go completely relaxed, completely supported, and completely safe. Notice how relaxed you feel and how good it is to be this relaxed your mind aware your body becoming weightless as it falls. Fast asleep. Staying mindfully aware whilst your body lies in space. Maintaining that soft awareness, allow your focus now to dissolve away any sensations with the body. Completely relaxed, completely supported, completely safe. Although you are deeply relaxed and maybe quite drowsy, I invite you to stay fully aware. Letting go of any remaining bodily sensations, but staying mindfully alert, remembering you can come back to the body at any point you would like to, but for now, letting it go. We might like to let it go on the outbreath, and with this out breath, we drop deeper and deeper into a relaxed state, and if we think we're fully relaxed, let's encourage ourselves to let go even more. Tell yourself it's time to let go. If your mind drifts off, just anchor it back to the black or grayness behind your eyes or anything you can see or sense in your awareness. Just noticing what's there, and if we notice nothing, that's okay too. We're like a calm observer. Being aware of where we are, paying attention to any imagery that may appear, sounds we might hear, or feelings we might have no need to judge or interpret what we notice. Just being with what is. Is there a quality to what you can see or a texture to what you can feel? Not striving to find these things, simply seeing what's there. If your thoughts drift to the past or future, just bring your mind back to whatever is happening in the present moment, even if it's nothing, be with the nothingness. For the next couple of minutes, allow yourself to drop deeply into the hypnogogic state, and if you fall asleep, that's fine. Maybe it's what your body and mind needs. Just gently riding the hypnogogic highway and noticing what passes you by with no sense of rush. It's time to come back to the body. Now, back to the physical world. That's it. Make your way. Remember, you can return anytime you wish, but for now, it is time to come back to everyday reality with full recall and all senses intact. Make your way back now. Follow the sound of my voice and bring your awareness back to the body. Anything you can see or sense in your physical world, you might like to wriggle your fingers and toes or take a nice stretch when you are ready, gently opening the eyes. Welcome back. Take a moment to recall your experience and note it down in your diary. I'll see you again soon.

====================

LESSON 6: Master the Mind Awake Body Asleep State
--------------------
<v ->Welcome back.</v> How are you doing? How was the mindfulness technique that you tried last night? This practice is foundation to the art of astral projection. And whilst we touch on it, pretty lightly so far, it will become central to cultivating the mind awake body asleep state. Although we've just learnt about this state, today is all about mastering it. Now that's not going to happen overnight; it could take days or weeks, depending on our psychological makeup and how much we choose to practice. This is why we're going to look at some common problems so that if they happen, you know how to handle them. It's like learning to ride a bike. Naturally, the first few times we're probably going to fall off, and that's okay. We need to find the best bike for our body, and then get used to the pedals, the balance, and the speed. This is like finding the right OBE tools for our personality, and then practice, practice, practice. Remember the Hero's Journey: this is the montage scene, the part when Luke Skywalker is practicing in the woods with Yoda, the part where Rocky is getting up at sunrise to train, and the part where Erin Brockovich is learning about law to win her case. Remember, you've just started learning these skills. Here are three common problems that you might have and solutions so that you can solve them. Number one, ego resistance. You might find that you get all ready to practice, and then you need the toilet. You have to scratch an itch. You remember that the washing needs doing, or even the sound of your own breath suddenly begins to get annoying. Sometimes these things do just happen, like the itch, but other times it can be our ego. When our ego is about to enter into the unknown or do something new, it will often attempt to distract us, because subconsciously it's worried about what might happen, and it wants to get back to comfort, back to familiarity. Now, when I say ego, I'm referring to the psychoanalysis perspective. What Freud said, simply put, the ego is that part of our mind that tries to match our hidden desires and wishes with the demands of the real world; it's made up of our experiences, opinions, and our preferences. It creates a sense of personal identity, and this protects us; it helps us to survive in the world. So on one hand, it's a good thing, but sometimes it can get us into trouble. But the ego isn't bad; he just wants to keep us safe, a bit like an over-protective parent. It's well-meaning and keeps us away from danger but maybe doesn't allow us to grow, to take on risks. So if you notice many distractions, or you find yourself becoming quite irritable, you might want to ask yourself, is this my ego? If you intuit that it is, I invite you to have a conversation with it. I treat it like a friendly sidekick, sort of like Watson to Sherlock Holmes, Louise to Thelma, or Woody to Buzz Lightyear. You know they've got your back, but they might stop you from doing something they perceive puts you in peril. But the thing is they need your encouragement and curiosity to take them out of their comfort zone, to rise to the challenge. They, the ego, will probably be reluctant at first, but deep down they know that ultimately it will do them good. When we get our egoic sidekick onboard, we become a powerhouse of unstoppable energy. So give it a go. When you're realizing you're distracting yourself, or you're avoiding your practice or becoming quite irritable, take a moment to have an internal chat with your ego, your sidekick, and see what it says. Number two, clicking out. Occasionally you might find that you have a lapse in consciousness during an exercise. It's a bit like momentarily falling asleep, but it feels lighter. For example, you're following a guided meditation, and you lose consciousness, but then suddenly you find yourself back, but at a different point in the meditation, and you're like, how did I get here? Robert Monroe called this clicking out. We lose concentration and we drift off somewhere. It's like zoning out and having a daydream, a daydream that we can't recall. To combat this we need to improve our concentration skills, so that we don't easily get pulled away from what we're doing. The ability to gently hold our attention will not only allow us to enter deeply into the mind awake body asleep state, but it will also help increase our recall, enable more control both in astral projection and our everyday life, because it improves our focus. To do this we're going to learn dharana. This is a one pointed focus meditation from the Yoga Sutras of Patanjali, and it means concentration of the mind in Sanskrit. Simply put, it's the basic action of holding our attention, binding the mind to one thing that could either be externally, so we could look at an object, or internally, such as an idea, feeling, or even hypnogogic imagery. When I was six, my dad taught me how to do this, but to be honest, I didn't really know what I was doing. My bedroom was forest-themed, and at the end of my bed, I had a poster of a tropical jungle. I would glare intensively at a tree, trying not to think of anything at all, giving myself eye strain, and then a thought would come, and I'd shift onto the next tree and I'd start again. I was sort of doing it right, but there was far too much strenuous staring. So here's how to do it right. You can practice dharana anywhere, but wherever you choose to do it, find a comfortable, seated or standing position, one that doesn't take too much effort to stay in. You can choose to close your eyes and focus on something within you, perhaps your astral projection intention, or an affirmation, or you can anchor your mind to a picture or an object in front of you. Imagine giving your mind the freedom to roam around, but in a very restricted area, you can start with a wider area to begin with, such as a large picture frame. And as you progress, you can bring the area smaller, so your concentration becomes smaller and smaller, such as focusing on a candle flame. When thoughts start coming in or muscles start twitching, the mind tends to follow these sensations, and our concentration can be lost. If this happens, it's okay; just bring your mind back again. This is just the monkey mind jumping around which it naturally does. The mind is like a muscle that we can train. We keep getting back on the bike every time we fall off. So at one point in the future, we can ride our bike without stabilizers. I'd like you to do this for a few minutes at some point today. So select your place and what you're going to focus on and when you're going to do it. Three, the emotional mind. When we experience something new, we might become really excited, super scared, or maybe somewhere in between. In fact, the two most commonly reported feelings on out-of-body experiences is awe, awe of where we go and what we see during the experience, and fear, usually of the unknown. This emotional overwhelm can happen just before an out-of-body experience. Often on the cusp of transition, at the vibrational state, especially if we haven't had an experience before and we don't know what to expect. It can end up snapping us out of whatever altered state we're in and bring us back into the body. So remaining calm and collected is key to success. One time I had a really unexpected and fast exit from the body. It wasn't slow or floaty as usual; this time it was like being sucked out of a vacuum, and I shot straight through the roof into the sky at supersonic speed. It was like I was on a rollercoaster heading into space. Now, I knew it was completely safe, but it was a total surprise and pretty intense to be honest. So I had to react immediately and not to let my knee-jerk feelings hijack the experience. So in that moment I said to myself, surrender, surrender, surrender, as I flew as fast as light through the clouds. Luckily, it ended up working, and I had an extraordinary cosmic out-of-body experience. I entered the solar system, and I passed through a meteorite trail; huge rocks the size of skyscrapers tumbled by me in slow motion like sleeping giants. It remains one of the most awe-inspiring experiences I've ever had. And I want you to have these experiences too. Now I want to add that we can have deep emotions during the experience itself. It's just that often, on the onset of exiting and shortly after separation, that intense feelings can bring us back to the body. So here's an affirmation that you can say in a moment of emotional overwhelm: I release control. I surrender to the flow. I release control. I surrender to the flow. It's vital that you try to connect with a real felt sense of letting go and surrender. Actually do it. If you're saying I release control, I surrender to the flow, you're still full of fear, and it's not going to happen. Empty words won't work, because it's about the energy that they evoke from the meaning that we give them and the feelings that we have upon saying them that will transform the space. Basically, we want to feel what we're saying rather than just saying it. So if at any point you feel overwhelmed with emotion, whether it's in the mind awake body asleep state, or you're about to leave the body, try the affirmation. Four, falling asleep and waking up. First things first: out-of-body experiences can be induced in any position, but most people are successful when they're lying on their back, face up. Now, when we're in this position, sometimes it can be a bit difficult to breathe. So just make sure you tilt your chin up; that helps. I often slightly turn my head to the side, but that's just because I feel more comfortable; might work for you. A common problem is that we're too awake or we fall asleep; finding that deep yet focused state where our mind floats freely can be tricky when we're starting out. So if you find yourself snoring away through an exercise or wide awake, not feeling anything at all, know that this is part of the practice and a very common obstacle for beginners. The great thing is if you fall asleep during the practice, the information will still be entering your subconscious as the hypnagogic is a natural hypnotic state, meaning that the exercises will still be landing in your awareness, allowing you to know and do them better next time. You will also still be getting all of the meditative benefits, but let's try avoid falling asleep. If you're someone who nods off very quickly, try to lie in a reclined position or even a seated one, such as a meditation posture. Of course we can practice astral projection via meditation as well. So if you prefer to be seated anyway, that's fine. Being in a slightly uncomfortable position, one that we struggle to fall asleep in, can help us to stay awake. For many, this is lying flat on their back, for others, on their stomach; experiment and see what works for you. Alongside this, you might not need to do a relaxation technique if it's pretty easy for you to wind down and drop off. Staying awake. Now, if you're someone who struggles to relax, maybe your thoughts are whirring in your head or you're feeling restless, whatever the reason you can't seem to settle, it might take you a little longer to enter the mind awake body asleep state, because in this day and age relaxing is pretty challenging, right? What with work pressures, day-to-day activities, and family responsibilities, this is why most of us, including myself, need support to do this. Here's a few things that might help. I suggest lying in your favorite comfortable position one you usually fall asleep in, and limit your distractions; then do a couple of relaxation techniques, such as the 4-7-8 Breath that we learnt previously. You will learn a couple more relaxation techniques that you can also draw from in the next few lessons. Avoid caffeine intake late at night, and schedule your exercising on the same day that you know you're going to do this practice. This will help tire your body out and be able to drop off more quickly. Use these tips to help you master the mind awake body asleep state. Okay, let's look at your actions for today. Your actions for today: I'd like you to practice the dharana meditation for a few minutes at some point. And if your mind drifts away, don't worry; that's why we're practicing. Also, practice hypnagogic mindfulness as you fall asleep with the 4-7-8 Breath. Tomorrow is an important lesson where we'll not only review everything we've learnt so far, but I'll also share some extra techniques that will help you on your journey. In tomorrow's lesson, you will also find an audio track which helps you integrate all the practices that we've learned so far into one guided practice. Good luck with your practice and I'll see you tomorrow.

====================

LESSON 7: Summary of Your First Week
--------------------
<v ->Well done for completing your first week.</v> The key to learning anything is to recap and integrate. So today, we'll do just that. But before then, let's stop to celebrate our journey so far. This week, we've learnt the importance of preparing the body and mind through releasing fears, overcoming limiting beliefs, and honing our mindset. Perhaps you've seen side effects like recalling more dreams, better sleep hygiene, recognizing emotions, and even began to make friends with your ego, your protective sidekick. Now remember, fears and limiting beliefs are the two biggest blocks to astral projection. They won't simply vanish overnight, so we will need to keep working with them in a gentle way as they arise throughout our Quest. This is because how we approach astral projection and the way we work with our inner and outer worlds 90% of the time correlates directly to the experiences that we will have, which is why you can congratulate yourself, because you've already done a lot of the heavy lifting which will help to strengthen those astral wings. The work that you're putting in now will determine the quality of your experiences later down the line. Remember the montage scene, the part where the hero goes to school, practices with the mentor, trains intensively at home. And then later in the story, the hero's big challenge comes, something unexpected, their breakthrough moment. This is when practice meets opportunity. The topics we covered this week will give you the extra edge, the extra confidence, a new technique or a new skill, so that when the time comes to leave the body, to travel to a different realm, or to encounter hidden parts of yourself, you'll have the tools within to break through and make it happen. But we need to walk before we can run, and we need to run before we can fly. So don't forget, astral projection is considered a siddhi, a superpower in the yogic tradition. It's a skill, and we've only been practicing for one week. Today, I invite you to review any lessons, if you've missed them, as they build one on top of the other. The skills and the techniques this week are the foundation to what's coming next. So if you've skipped any of the techniques, today is your chance to try them out. This is why there is optional practice time today. If you would like the extra practice, you can bring your skills together in one session by following my guided audio which encourages you to apply what you've learnt so far. The aim is to connect to our projection plan, use deep relaxation, get onto the hypnagogic highway, draw on Dharana, and deeply enter the mind awake body asleep state, ideally having total body dissolution where we can't feel it anymore. All the while, navigating fear, excitement, and ego along the way. That will be an ongoing practice. Everything is guided in the audio, but just so there are no surprises, I'll share a bit about a new relaxation technique that you'll be prompted to do in the track. This is called Progressive Muscular Relaxation. Dr. Edmund Jacobson invented this technique way back in the 1920s as a way to help his patients deal with anxiety. He was a man ahead of his time. He knew that relaxing the muscles could relax the mind as well. The exercise involves working through each muscle group, first tensing and then releasing them. It usually starts with the feet and works the way up through the body slowly. By tensing and releasing specific limbs, we're more aware of the tension that we hold that we had no idea that was there. As we let this go in our mind, we let that part of our body go too. We allow it to dissolve away. Often, people that have been stressed out for a long time don't actually know that they're tense. But if you ask them to intentionally create tension and then release it, newfound awareness of what relaxation can feel like can then be experienced and absorbed. This is great for the mind awake body asleep state. It can be done at any time, but if we practice it whilst we're drifting towards the hypnagogic, it can lead to a deep state quickly. When we practice this, really feel the tension draining away from those muscles as though they're just melting away. Hello, and welcome to the progressive muscular relaxation exercise. What we're going to do is tense each part of our body, from our feet to our head, one by one for a few seconds. Now, tense as much as you can. Remember, we want to tire out the body so that it falls asleep. You can either do this standing up, or you can do it lying in bed. If you are lying in bed, do it with your eyes closed so it can become part of your practice into the mind awake body asleep state. Okay, are you ready to go? Tensing your feet and toes as much as you can after my count of three. Three, two, one, squeezing the feet, squeezing the feet now as much as you can. That's it, great. Start squeezing the feet, squeezing the feet, and relax. It's as easy as that. Okay, let's move on to the calves and the thighs now, our legs. Tensing here, three, two, one, tensing the calves and the legs, squeezing them, flexing them as much as we can, as much as we can. That's it, and relax. Okay, moving on to our hips and our bottom now. Clenching our bottom, squeezing our hips as much as we can, tensing here, clenching like we're cracking a nut with our bottom. Here we go. Little bit more, and relax. Really nice. Now, can we squeeze our tummy and tense our chest at the same time? Let's give it a go. Squeezing the tummy, pulling it in, holding the chest. That's it, keep going, keep going, keep going, and relax. Really nice. Now we're taking it to our hands. Can we clench our fists and hold our fingers tightly in a fist? Here we go. Three, two, one, tensing, tensing, holding it there; keep going as much as we can, and release. Taking it to our arms now, our lower arm and upper arm. Tensing here, tensing, tensing, tensing, squeezing just a little bit more, and release. Bringing that tensing to our shoulders now. Can we lift them up to our ears as much as we can and tense them at the same time? Here we go. Squeezing, tensing, holding them up, trying to reach the ears, three, two, one, and release. Now closing the eyes if they aren't already closed, lifting the eyebrows as high as you can. Lifting, lifting, lifting the eyebrows, and relax. And keeping those eyes closed, scrunching them shut like we're tightly trying to block out any light, scrunching here, tightly shut, keep going, and relax. And now we're going to take this to our jaw, trying to lift our chin to the top of our forehead, so a bit like we're trying to reach the top of our face to the bottom of our face, making a grumpy kind of expression. Here we go. Reaching them together, reaching, reaching, reaching, that's right, and relax. Okay, are we ready to go all together now? Every body part all at once as much as we can. Three, two, one, tensing the feet, the thighs, the arms, the fists, the stomach, the chest, the face as much as we can, holding it here, tensing, scrunching it all together. Keep going, keep going, last few moments, and relax. Okay, great. Now remember, you can do this exercise for restless legs and also insomnia, so it doesn't just have to be for your astral projection practice. Your actions for today: Today, I'd like you to listen to and follow the guided audio. You can do this at any time, some point during the day or perhaps when you get into bed tonight. And if you find yourself having some of the problems we mentioned this week, apply the solutions that we spoke about, the ones that you've learnt so far. So, congratulations. You've got your equipment together, prepared your flight pad, and you've put on your astral jacket. You know the scene in the film where the hero sets off into the distance on their journey? Usually in slow motion. The sun is rising; the wind's in their hair. This is that moment. So enjoy it. It's the beginning of a great journey. And I'll see you next week when we learn how to fly.

====================

LESSON 7: Meditation - Entering Mind Awake Body Asleep State

- Before we begin, limit any distractions that could pull your senses and attention outwards into the physical world. You might like to shut the curtains, close the windows and doors, wear headphones or an eye mask, and get into a comfortable position. If you would like to do this and you haven't already, pause the track now and take a moment to do this. Although we want to get to a place where we cannot feel our physical body anymore, it is okay to adjust your position or scratch an itch at any time if you need to. This is your time to awaken and practice. The skill of astral projection within you is the ability to tap into realms beyond the body. This is because you are a multi-dimensional being with infinite potential. All with this in mind. Let's begin. For now, all we're going to do is just be where we are. Just noticing where we are right now. Perhaps take three deep belly breaths to settle our body and mind. Then becoming aware of the space behind the neck, feeling the length of the spine in our back. Noticing the weight of our hips sitting within our body, feeling the legs touch the bed chair or ground arms hanging at the sides of us hands and fingers loose at the end. Bringing our attention to the texture of the clothes, all blankets, touching the skin and sensing the space around the body. Noticing the physical edges of ourselves, the boundary of our being. Just tuning into any feelings we might have in this moment, not needing to change or do anything about them. Just being aware of how we feel right now. And lastly, in our own way, feeling the connection to the earth and the support we gain from it. Let's set a general intention here for the mind to be awake and aware and for the body to become completely relaxed. Maybe we could bring our personal motivation to mind here. Our purpose, our reason why we are practicing astral projection. We our intention and motivation to drop into our awareness like a pebble sinking in water, letting our intention go. Now let's shift our attention to the breath. In a moment, we are going to tense each body part using our muscles from feet to head. Holding each limb for a few seconds. We do not tense any place where we feel pain or have an injury. Instead, we might like to scan our attention over this area. Let's tense as strongly as we can for maximum relaxation effect. So we are going to begin by squeezing our feet. Now curl a toe, squeeze the feet, squeeze the feet, squeeze the feet, and relax. Great start. It's as easy as that. Now let's move on to the next limb. Next we are going to the lower leg, below the knee, our calf area. So tensing the lower leg now tensing, tensing, tensing and completely relaxed, allowing any remain intention to dissolve away into the ether. Next, we are going to move to the upper leg, our thighs. So flexing the upper legs now flexing, flexing, flexing and release, letting the muscles melt into a soft goo. Very good. Now we are moving onto our hips and bottom, clenching the muscles here, drawing everything in, holding it, holding it, holding it, and let go, allowing the hips and bottom to soften on the inside and out. Next, we are moving to our chest and stomach. Can we tense them both together? Give it a go. Tensing, tensing, tensing and completely relax. Letting the muscles lift away floating softly where they are. Now we are moving to our arms, both the upper and lower arm, squeezing the muscles here as much as we can. Now, squeezing, squeezing, squeezing, and relax. Let the arms just fall limp at the sides. Next, we are moving to our hands and fingers. Clenching the hand into a fist as though we are gripping onto something. Clenching here. Now clenching, clenching, clenching and release. Let the fingers uncurl and return to their natural position. Now we are moving to the shoulders, lifting the shoulders up to the ears and tensing. Here tense the whole area as much as you can. Tensing, tensing, tensing. That's it. And completely relax, allowing them to drop back down to where they were. Next we are going to move on to our face, keeping the eyes closed. Let's see if we can lift our eyebrows as high as we can. Lifting the eyebrows to wrinkle the forehead. Now lifting, lifting, lifting, and let them go. Allowing them to drop back down to then natural position. Now we are moving to our eyes, keeping them closed, but scrunching them shut and holding them here. Holding, holding, holding and release. Let the eyes soften and float gently in the sockets. Next, we are moving onto our lips, cheeks, and jaw. Let's tense these areas by pulling a grumpy face like we're trying to reach our chin to our forehead. Reaching, reaching, reaching and relax. Relax all the facial muscles now, including the jaw. And we might like to let the jaw hang freely here, open slightly. Maybe peel the tongue away from the roof of the mouth and encourage this whole area to gently soften. And finally, after my count of three, we are going to tense all the body parts all together, everything at once as best we can. Ready? 1, 2, 3 que in the feet, legs, hips, belly, chest, arms, hands, shoulders, face, all together. One last time. Now as much as we can hold it. There you are. Doing great. Tensing, tensing, tensing and completely relaxed. Every fiber in your being becomes lighter and lighter. Muscles dissolve away like they are melting into the face of the earth. Noticing the inhale and the exhale. Becoming aware of how the air passes through the nose or mouth and the rise and fall off the chest, the air coming and going in its own way. In a moment, we will do a breathing exercise called the 4 7, 8 breath. This method involves breathing in quietly for four through the nose, holding for seven, and releasing out forcefully for eight through the mouth. Like we are trying to make a wishing sound with our lips as we blow the air out. Don't worry too much about reaching these numbers. Just do you can, I will guide this for a few minutes. Okay, let's begin after our next exhale. Breathing out, now I am breathing in four. 1, 2, 3, 4. And holding here. 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7. Slowly release. 4, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1. That's it. Breathing in again. 2, 3, 4. And hold in here. 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7. Slowly out, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, and eight. Breathing in again, big belly breath, 2, 3, 4, holding if we can, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7. Slowly release out all the air. 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8. Breathe in in again. That's good. Three, four. And holding. 3, 4, 5, 6, 7. Slowly release, pushing out every bit of air. 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8. And again, 2, 3, 4. And holding. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7. Releasing out 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and eight last time. Deep breath in. Fill in all the bones in the body with air. 2, 3, 4. And holding. 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7. Releasing out. Squeezing out every drop of air. 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and eight. Weld. Done. Allowing the breath to return to its natural state now. Nothing to do now, nowhere to go. Just rest. Drifting in our own time into the hypnagogic state. With each outbreath, we relax deeper and deeper into a wider awareness, leaving any bodily sensations behind. For now, remembering you can come back to the body at any time, but for now, letting it go completely relaxed, completely supported, and completely safe. Notice how relaxed you feel and how good it is to be this relaxed your mind aware your body becoming weightless as it falls. Fast asleep. Staying mindfully aware whilst your body lies in space. Maintaining that soft awareness allow your focus now to dissolve away any sensations with the body. Completely relaxed, completely supported, completely safe. Although you are deeply relaxed and maybe quite drowsy, I invite you to stay fully aware. Letting go of any remaining bodily sensations, but staying mindfully alert, remembering you can come back to the body at any point you would like to, but for now, letting it go. We might like to let it go on the outbreath. And with this out breath, we drop deeper and deeper into a relaxed state. And if we think we're fully relaxed, let's encourage ourselves to let go even more. Tell yourself it's time to let go. If your mind drifts off, just anchor it back to the black or grayness behind your eyes or anything you can see or sense in your awareness. Just noticing what's there. And if we notice nothing, that's okay too. We're like a calm observer. Being aware of where we are. Paying attention to any imagery that may appear, sounds we might hear, or feelings we might have no need to judge or interpret what we notice. Just being with what is. Is there a quality to what you can see? Or a texture to what you can feel? Not striving to find these things. Simply seeing what's there. If your thoughts drift to the past or future, just bring your mind back to whatever is happening in the present moment. Even if it's nothing, be with the nothingness. For the next couple of minutes, allow yourself to drop deeply into the hypnogogic state. And if you fall asleep, that's fine. Maybe it's what your body and mind needs. Just gently riding the hypnogogic highway and noticing what passes you by with no sense of rush. It's time to come back to the body. Now, back to the physical world. That's it. Make your way. Remember, you can return any time you wish, but for now, it is time to come back to everyday reality with full recall and all senses intact. Make your way back now. Follow the sound of my voice and bring your awareness back to the body. Anything you can see or sense in your physical world, you might like to wriggle your fingers and toes, or take a nice stretch when you are ready, gently opening the eyes. Welcome back. Take a moment to recall your experience and note it down in your diary. I'll see you again soon.

LESSON 7: The Art of Astral Projection Live Experience Bonus Call #1: Preparing the Body and Mind to Fly

Hello everyone and welcome to your first live experience call with the art of astral projection with Jade Shaw. This is preparing your mind and body to fly. We've got a great call planned tonight. Jade is joining us live from London and we are going to be doing a little bit of sharing your experience of the quest so far. We also have a live Q &A plan for the second part of the call. And Jade is going to be giving you a bunch of tips and doing a little teaching around the first two weeks of the quest. So I would love to introduce your teacher of the art of astral projection, Jade Shaw. Welcome to the call. Hi, thanks, Ezra. Hello, everybody. It's so nice. to see you. I'm recovering from COVID, hence where my voice is really husky, so I'm going to try and speak clearly and slowly. so you can hear me I just got my voice back yesterday so I was like thank goodness I'm going to be able to talk on the call so I'll be very thankful for your patience with me but I'm very glad to be here and that you're all here too and that you've done two weeks so far two weeks of training which is fantastic so congratulations for getting this far a lot of people drop out of astral projection after a few days when they don't see results realizing it it's quite a skill so you're still here and you're going which is fantastic so what we've done so far over the first two weeks is mind awake, body asleep state. So this is step one. And we've also been looking at the astral projection of the energy body as well and working with that. So preparing our body and mind to leave. Now, I've had a few comments and some messages on my Instagram. And some of you are like, I haven't got out of body yet. I have an astral projected. And I'm like, oh my God, you're only on day nine. you know it's a skill um you haven't learned how to exit and to leave the body yet that comes you haven't actually learned all of the steps yet. But that is very much, oh, it hasn't happened for me yet. I haven't had an experience. Do not worry. You can relax. It's okay. It is a case of learning the technique, motivating the right conditions. And that is what week one was focused attention and enter an altered state without fault. It's basically like holding meditation. So if you're already doing that or you're tapping into that, that is fantastic. You are nailing step because it involves holding an altered state for so long, although it just depends. on the circumstances, how long we have to hold it for. So we have to mind awake, body asleep state. And we've started looking at working with our astral body as well. Now, when you come to learn the exit techniques, I just want to be a little clear here. I don't actually like using the term. exit and i'll probably say this at some point in the quest as well or leaving or separating from the body because effectively it is our self -awareness where we perceive ourselves to be in time and space. So I perceive myself to be here, sat in this chair. That is what kind of leaves that aspect of our conscious awareness seems to expand beyond and shift out. And I'm just making that clear because often there's a lot of fear around if we leave the body, can we get back and can something happen? And there's a lot of fear mongering, particularly. online as well so i just want to curb any fears with that there's always um your consciousness remains within your body otherwise how would our heart keep beating how would our lungs keep breathing if it wasn't and so you will always come back in fact it's hard to stay out of body and there'll be a session on how we can have longer experiences and also more clearer ones because we might find that some of the astral projection experiences we have a skewed vision or way of being in that place. Anyway, so I just wanted to make that clear. Now, the exit techniques you're going to learn are going to be quite a few, particularly in week three. You're going to be given at least two in a session every day. So I don't want you to get overwhelmed because you can just try one of these on that day and then try the other one a different day. So don't feel like you have to do them all in that day. And the other reason I'm giving you quite a few is because, and this is something important to note for your progress in your journey, is that we are all uniquely different. We all have various psycho spiritual makeup, meaning. Different types of psychology, different types of spiritual journeys that we're on and different personality types. And some of us may be neurodiverse, maybe on the spectrum in some way. So the different techniques to be played with to see what works for you. An exit technique such as rollout, which you're going to learn in a couple of days, might not be as good for you as a visual exit for someone who's more visual. So this is why you're getting given. quite a lot, a toolbox to take away. So I just wanted to make that clear in the forthcoming week. Basically, give everything a go. Don't give up after trying once or twice. You're not going to get a handstand balance in your first few yoga classes. So it will take a little bit of time for some of these. I'm going to give you three tips in anticipation. of some of the things that you may have encountered so far or that you might find in the next week. The three tips are based on common questions that I always get and also some of the best ways I think to have the experience quickly, meaning we can bring it on faster rather than slogging it out every week trying to practice. So the first technique and tip really is to do with the vibrational state now I think you learned about this yesterday so you might have a few questions and that's cool so with the vibrational state if you enter it um there's I'm just going to reiterate some of the points because they're so important the first is to accept and surrender what is happening as soon as we don't accept the sensations we might feel, such as energy flowing, we might hear radio frequencies, we might hear voices, there might be music, we might feel the whole bed shaking. or we might feel just a subtle hum or movement as soon as there's any kind of resistance in our mind it's going to become a block and it's going to hinder and in many cases completely make the vibrational state vanish and if you felt it so far maybe some of you've sat there thinking oh my god i felt it and it just went like that as soon as i thought about it it was gone that happens so often so it is important we accept and surrender whatever we're feeling and then we go along with that the second part of this is then using our intuition to follow the vibrations out of the body now you might be thinking oh my god What do you mean intuitively follow vibrations out of your body? It seems quite subjective, quite obscure experience. But when you start to feel it, you might get a sense of a pulling sensation or a sucking sensation. Or you might feel like you want to go down rather than up or backwards instead of forwards. when you feel that there's a pulling towards some sort of direction. That's what I mean about using your intuition to go with what feels natural in the moment. So using your intuition. If that doesn't work, meaning if you feel the vibrations and nothing seems to be happening, then you can do an exit technique from today. I know we haven't learned them yet, but you will learn one in a couple of days and you're going to have a week of them. Then we do to actually leave and lift out of the body. So I just wanted to reiterate that. Yes, David. Amazing. Great. Well remembered. So that was the first tip on the vibrational state. But if you've got a question that wants to go a bit deeper, we can answer that in the Q &A. The second one. and i am going to talk about exit techniques again and i appreciate you haven't learned one yet but when you do i want you to double them up so this is a tim then have a second backup the reason for this is that when you get to a certain state you might go for an exit technique you might go too soon you might not be in the right place in that sweet spot and you might find that as soon as you go for an exit technique We let our mind hook onto the second one rather than questioning why didn't it work? Oh, I haven't left my body. Oh, I'm not going to be able to do it to you out of the altered state. Unless you're very deeply in it, it does lift most people out. So double up your techniques. Does my sound keep coming and going? Can you just nod your head yes or no if my sound keeps coming and going? OK, it does. Apologies for that. It says I've got full bar here. I'm not sure why. OK, thank you. I'll try my best, even though it keeps coming and going. OK, the third tip is I'm just going to reiterate this. I cannot stress. I cannot stress how how important this next one is. The disruption technique, meaning when you wake up in the middle of the night or the morning and you go for an exit technique or you go into mind, awake, body, sleep state, is to build that habit. This is going to be your shortcut to astral projection. This is going to be your secret to success, is the disruption. tech building works animals your kids the next door neighbor stress nightmares insomnia whatever it is where you can't sleep go into the mind awake body asleep state and then try an exit technique straight away don't worry about doing too many relaxation things you're already in bed just go for an exit technique i know i've mentioned this before but sometimes you can just enter that sweet spot and so Find yourself floating out. This is what happens when you hear about people having spontaneous experiences and just finding themselves floating out of bed. One of my friends, Dr. David Luke, who is a leading researcher at the University of Greenwich in the UK for the effects of psychedelics for mental health and well -being. He was asleep one night. He hadn't had any psychedelics. He was completely sober, but he went to sleep. He woke up in the middle of the night. He got up to go to the toilet and his hand went straight through the door, straight through the door handle. And it's because his mind had woken up. and his body was still asleep he'd entered the mind awake body asleep state and his intention was to get up and without even thinking he got up and he was his astral body that had got up and put his hand through the door so that's an example of how when we rouse in the night we can do a technique and then have the experience most people's spontaneous ones happen in that way so disruption technique try and cultivate that habit so you could say something like next time i wake up i'll do my exit technique next time i wake up i'll do my exit technique and you would have chosen one beforehand that you know you're going to do to try out so those three techniques i'm just going to reiterate one more point for the vibrational state remember only 30 % of people do not go through the vibrational state or they don't feel it as strongly as others. So don't get too attached to, oh my gosh, I must feel a vibrational state because you might not go through it. You might be able to pass straight from step one, mind awake body sleep into a full on out of body experience. So don't grip too much onto that. Okay. So those are my three tips. There may be more questions related to more of the basic end or slightly more advanced, but we can go into that, I think, after I pass you back over to Ezra, if that is okay. Sure thing. Thank you so much, Jade. While I bring some people on to talk, you might want to check your internet connection. We're getting you kind of intermittently in and out. I'm going to bring some people on and it'll give you a little bit of time to check and see if you've got a strong connection. I would love to bring on some of you to share your experience of the quest so far. We're about two weeks through and we'd love to know how are you experiencing this so far? Are you having these experiences? Are you having difficulty, challenges? What's going on? with it and so uh you can raise your hand a little virtual hand at the bottom of the screen under reactions and i'll put you put you in a queue and i'd love to bring some of you on make sure that you put your camera on so that we can see you and i'll be bringing you on live all right cynthia you can unmute yourself welcome to the call hi thank you um so I'm really enjoying the quest so far. I had a question, though, about the first meditation, which is to enter the mind awake body asleep. At the end of the meditation, Jade brings us back. And so the thing is, I get to the point where I'm really relaxed and then I am back aware and awake. And then it takes me like double the time to go back to sleep again. So would it be possible to have like a different audio when we are not brought back? Because I see that in the second meditation to the vibrational state, we do have two audios. One that she brings us back and the other one where she doesn't. So I was wondering if that would be possible with a mind awake, body asleep, or if it would be counterproductive to just fall asleep right after. I'm like, can you hear me? Am I muted? I can't find where I am. Yeah, we can hear you. You can hear me. So thank you for raising that, Cynthia. I've got a vague memory that we... actually might have an audio without the returning on the end. It was discussed because of the issues that you actually have just mentioned. And we spoke about it with the Monroe Institute. And I think we made two different versions. But I'm going to double check that. I don't want to say for sure. If we haven't made two different versions, I'm going to ask them if they can create a version without the bringing you back at the end. Because, yes, obviously, if you're in a very deep state and then I bring. you back out uh it's good practice for going in and out of altered states but you want to remain there so that you can then go into the vibrational state ideally um so i'm going to ask them i'm going to make a note of that and see if we can get a version of that first meditation is it the mind awake body asleep one right yes thank you no worries thank you for raising that it's very important Great. Thank you, Cynthia. So I'd love to bring a couple more of you on. Just remember, this is a sharing session. We're going to do a Q &A at the end of the call, the last half. So I'd love to bring on some of you to actually share your experience of the quest. So I'm going to bring on Bridget next. Hi, Bridget. You can unmute yourself. Hi, enjoying the quest. Thank you so much. Love Mindvalley and everything you guys do. So I've been doing the meditation. I'm a meditator instructor, so I've been meditating for years. Love it. However, when I'm doing the meditation, I feel the tingles and I'm gone. I'm out. I fall asleep every single time. So is it just that's what my body needs? Be more patient. I know I have a lot of, not a lot, a few crosstalk of words, my negative. talk is pretty much gone but i just question a lot of things so any anything you can add to that i'm really glad you brought that up bridget can i have a show of hands who else is just falling asleep at random times see like half of the people over half of the people on the screen It is such a common problem. And this is why we spend a whole week on just the mind awake body asleep stay, because it's the hardest one to master. So you're completely right. You either fall asleep or some people have the opposite problem where they just remain completely awake. This is why I must reiterate the wake back to bed method. Remind me, have you learned the wake back to bed method yet? Thumbs up or down? Thanks. Yeah. Okay. So this is exciting. You have the wake back to bed method to come. I'm going to touch on it here very briefly, which will probably be very confusing because I won't explain it in full. However, it is coming. You're going to spend a whole class on it. The wake back to bed method is where you go to sleep for four to six hours. And that can be your own choice. And then you wake up and then you do a number of techniques and you go into the alternate day and then you do the practice effectively between four and six o 'clock in the morning. Now, if that's freaking you out and you're like going, oh my God, she's going to make me get up at the crack of dawn to do this practice. Yes, I am. But if you want to have an out -of -body experience, this is the best time. But also this. is why I say the disruption method when you wake naturally to harness those natural moments of wakefulness is going to be a really good part of your armor but wake back to bed is you go to sleep You wake up, you do your techniques, you listen to the audio, and then you should be able to get into the right state without falling asleep. And this is because you've given your body enough time to rest. Because you're right, Bridget, sometimes you just need to rest, your body needs to sleep. And other times it can just be a bit of a habit. You get so relaxed that then you drift off, which is fantastic. We're calming the body down. which is so important in this day and age. So you're learning lots of relaxation techniques as well. But the wake back to bed method, I would really encourage you to do that. And I'm just going to throw it out there. And I don't think I say this in the quest, and this is pretty advanced, but you can do two wake back to beds where you go to bed, you go to sleep, you set your alarm and wake up, put the audio on. Do the techniques and then you might end up falling asleep again. You wake up a second time and then do the techniques. When I got really into it, I was doing four wake -ups a night. So I'm only asking you to do one. So do be aware of that. Only one. If you want to go for it, you can do two. It will make a lot more sense when you get to the class, when you do the wake back to bed, which I think is in about four days from now. So that will help you, Bridget, basically. But cultivate those things that we're doing so far. And that's going to really help when you do the wake back to bed method. Alternatively, you could try afternoon naps or late in the morning, depending on what type of person you are. You might find doing it in the afternoon is easier than. than at night. Thank you. Well, thank you, Bridget, for that question. Thank you. All right. Michael, welcome to the call. You can unmute yourself. OK. Yeah, hello. Yeah, my question is following what I struggle with. How can you have control? Because I do this with my mind. that I focus on the body is asleep and everything. And somehow always is this thought in me, okay, I'm doing this with my mind. And on the other hand, I have to let go. And somehow I'm struggling with this too. I don't know. Is the question clear? It is what I wanted to say. Yeah, Michael, would you just sort of know what you were talking about, but just to be super clear? You can repeat yourself, Michael. Aha, yeah. Yeah, so one day you say also, fake it till you make it. And so I'm very good in fake it. And then I think, but is this now real? Does I feel this or is it only that I pretend to feel this? And so somehow I struggled with this. I feel it then because I pretend to feel it. But then never I go really to this state where I think now I'm taken by another force or something like that. I always then think, okay, it's me, I'm doing this, and I'm feeling it, but maybe this is not the real feeling. Yeah, thank you for sharing that experience, Michael. It's, yeah, so two things with this. Again, it's very common, so it'd probably be helpful for lots of others, so it's a great question. We are effectively using our imagination and memory to kind of dupe ourselves into a certain altered state. So we get into an altered state and then we're trying to trigger the vibrational state and a sense of... a different reality and it does feel a bit like fake it before you make it and pretending and in effect we kind of are in the same way that you might do a guided meditation or hypnotherapy might take you into a scenario however when you get to exiting the body and you actually then float out or shift out You can let all of that go, all of the pretending, all of the techniques, all of the fake it till you make it, because you will be in the out -of -body experience. There'll be no questioning whether or not it, let's say it's real or not real, because you will be in it. So you won't need to do anything. For example, let's just say I came out of my body right now. So I'm not, but let's say, right, I've come out of my body. It looks like this. I mean, I could question, is this pen real? Can I, you know, is this pen real? Is this glass real? But I can feel, I can touch it. It's as real. as this. It's mad. It's mind -blowing. This is why I left my career in dance. I was like, what the actual fuck is going on? This is mad. But it is very real. So there won't necessarily be a questioning of, oh, am I just imagining? Now, what you might enter into that isn't astral projection, but it is just as useful. is you might go into active imagination where your mind begins to spin a narrative and you might see visuals because we might enter into the hypnagogic and you might retrieve information insights or realizations from this active imagination journey which is valuable because that can give us things that can help us in our various different aspects of our lives so if you're entering into that embrace that and accept that as well as part of the journey, part of the practice, because it is very valuable. I would say it's probably not astral projection, but it's a good sign that you are on the way. If you're hitting active imagination and you're feeling things and you're questioning it, you're definitely a deep in the mind, awake, body, asleep state. So that's fantastic. You're on track. We're in week one. or just past week one so you're on track of where we need to be so that's a positive thing and i just want to add here for everyone else to not miss the potential of the of the process as you go into the hypnagogic and you enter these altered states you will be practicing meditation which can help with flow states you will be entering into what um the famous painter um da vinci used to use and the edison with the light bulb the hypnagogic state one of my students on one of my recent courses didn't have an out of body experience but she had the most profound experience in the hypnagogic where she tuned into and heard a very heavenly divine singing voice it was so powerful she um she really had to go and do some deep work she she genuinely felt like a belief she tapped into some sort of frequency that she had access to this divine teaching person. sorry if my internet went then that was just through the hypno vivid dreams because you're trying to keep awareness and you might drop off to sleep and you might have as a side effect more lucid dreams and you're going to learn one session in week four on how to springboard from the lucid dream state into astral projection so if you find you're having more lucid dreams you can then use that as well as well as sleep paralysis if anyone has that that can also be used as a portal into astral projection. And there's a whole class on that. I think later this week or no, in week three, week three, they all blend into one after a while. Thank you for that question. That was really good. Thank you so much, Michael. I'd love to bring on Monica next. Monica, she is one of our ambassadors for Astral Projection. You may have seen her around the tribe. And I'm bringing Monica on to share her experience of Astral Projection and one of the reasons why she became an ambassador of this quest. Thank you so much, Ezra. Thank you, Jade. Oh my God. This experience had been amazing for me. So I bet I tested the quest one month or something ago. I had three experiences. uh my intention for this quest was to overcome my fear of death and not only that i get that but in such an unexpected way uh one of my experiences was that i was talking with osho but not but downloading from him some I experienced some knowledge. I was flying in that day after that experience. Everything shifted for me. I had in the past some accidental obese, but this has been known. amazing and you know it's so easy so much easy than I thought or presumed before so that this experience has been truly amazing for me and now I have another intention for redoing the quest with the group because i'm i'm holding space guys every week as a astral projection circle we started last week we had 50 people in the call so i really hope to have some of you join because doing it together, it's much easier. And we feel that, you know, as Jade said before, you fail when you give up. So coming there every week, you get inspiration from others. And also I posted in the chat, we have a Telegram group. So there you can ask questions, express your fears. Yeah, that's my sharing. Thank you, Ezra. Thank you, Jade. Wonderful. Thank you so much, Monica. Yeah, we've got a lot going on in the tribe. Make sure you check out the tribe after this call. We've got a telegram group. She's going to post that link again and the quest circles as well. Now I'd love to open it up to some Q &A. I know you guys have plenty of questions for Jade. So we'll use the last part of the call to do some Q &A. You can raise your hand again and I will bring you guys on. Make sure you turn on your camera if you'd like to come on to the call live and ask Jade a question. And I'm going to start with Maria. Hi, Maria. Welcome to the call. Hi, hello. Thanks for having me. I have a question. Is it possible to have an out -of -body experience while having a lucid dream it happened to me i was having a lucid dream and in my lucid dream i was sleeping and i have i came out from my side like a regular thing then i knew i was dreaming first before i did that and i started to fly you know and i started looking through the buildings and i said to myself oh i'm having an astral projection And then I thought about the place I wanted to go and it happened twice. So is it possible to have a natural projection while having a lucid dream? And it happened to me two times. Yeah, great question to kick this off. This is something that Charlie Morley, who's done the lucid dreaming quest and I've spoke about quite a bit. So you're going to have a whole class on lucid dreaming, how to springboard or alchemize, transform a lucid dream into astral projection. Now, there's not a lot of research on this because it depends on someone being proficient at lucid dreaming and proficient at astral projection. Usually people are better at one or the other. There does seem to be a space where we can shift from the dream state to the dream state being, let's just say our own mind, 300. 60 degree hyper -realistic own hallucination of our own unconscious to astral projection being other collective realms that we can tap into. I often describe it as it's like in a dream we have access to the laptop of our own mind, the hard drive, the files and the pictures of our past memory, imagination, desires. And astral projection seems to be the internet. So the laptop connects to the internet through a cable. So we can shift through the cable into the internet and visit different sites, get information that we couldn't have possibly known before and able to visit people as well. So it does seem we can shift beyond that there is a boundary. between ourself and other worlds, let's say, and we can shift. Now, when that shift occurs, there's several different signs. The weight often feels different. The person has a sense of knowing. Maria, you said you knew you as astral projection, like it felt different. You just knew it. We call this a gnosis, an inner knowing. So often someone has that. And then there can be telltales. signs such as the shifting out of the landscape that you're in so you're in your dream maybe you're in a shopping mall or a marketplace and then suddenly you might be going through a wormhole you might find yourself shifting through the sky and you enter what seems to be a different dimension realm or landscape that feels different and often we lose our dream body and then we've got our astral body Or as I mentioned, sometimes you're just a floating point of awareness. So there are certain signs that can happen. Short answer is yes, it can happen. I should have said that first. And there's different ways to do it, but I'll just share one now in case you have the opportunity. So let's just say you have a lucid dream, which is a dream in which you know you're dreaming. You're in a lucid dream. make a big gesture to the dream I do this opening up my arms looking out and call out with great intention and well out of body now out of body now I call it three times and then just see what happens to your dream state when you shift uh shift beyond uh you often you feel the vibrational state sometimes in the dream for me the whole dream goes and it shakes and sometimes something can pick you up and shoot you somewhere you can end up in a different place altogether if you get lucid shout out out of body now and just see what happens doesn't always work so i actually give you two more techniques in the class in case that one doesn't work thank you Let it go. That's fantastic, Maria. That's really cool that you've had that experience of astral projection from the dream space. Yeah. Thank you. Thank you, Maria. If you are a natural lucid dreamer or you find it easier, you might find that astral projection from the dream space will be one of the pathways that might work better for you. So just keep that in mind if you are a dreamer. Great. Thank you, Maria. Next up, Elizabeth. Welcome to the call. Hi, everyone. Can you see me? Oh, there I am. Okay. I was on the first call to talk about an experience I had 50 years ago. And I just wanted to say that everything that you're talking about, I experienced 50 years ago and was very fearful of it. And it has given me so much relief to know that the vibrations, the sounds, the everything that I felt then is okay. So thank you so much for that. I relate to that. And when you talked about flying out of your body into the space and seeing things as tall as skyscrapers, hey, I saw all of that. Now, here's where I am and here's my question. I have released, I've surrendered. And I keep waiting to hear the sounds and get the vibrations again. And they're not coming yet. I'm sticking with it. I'm going with the course. And I'm questioning, why is this taking me so long since I've already been there? and I've done it and I know what to expect and it's not happening. So I'm wondering if you have any tips, if it's just a matter of practice or what, but I miss it. I want it. It's not happening yet. I'm just making a note so I don't forget. Yeah. Okay. So two things, two things, there's more, but I'll mention two minutes. So the first thing is, So we're only on, I think you're on day nine or day 10. So we haven't actually learned how to leave the body at that moment that we choose to do that technique to shift out. So that is yet to come. We haven't actually practiced that bit yet. That's the first thing. So do be aware of that. We've got that yet to come. The second bit is... And this goes for everybody. This is usually, as Vishen said, an advanced spiritual skill. So in the Tibetan Buddhist tradition, the four -year retreat that lamas go on to train their body and mind and to become a Tibetan Buddhist lama, they don't even practice astral projection in those four years because it's considered very advanced. They only start... lucid dreaming at the end of year four. So astral projection, they have to be practicing longer than four years before they start to be taught astral projection within the traditional Vajrayana lineage. And this is because they are said that they have to develop a stable mind first, which involves the energy body and the chakras as well, and also to become a bodhisattva, which is they've got to devote their practice to others to have a higher motivation to be of service. So those are the two reasons that they have to have first before they're taught how to astral project. And in the yogic tradition, it is considered an advanced siddhi, something that only comes after many years of advanced meditation practice. Now, I'm not saying that to everyone to deter you. Don't think, well, oh my God, is it going to happen for me? I'm not a monk in a cave, you know. It happens naturally to humans all of the time. So don't worry, you're not in a traditional... buddhist lineage but i'm just saying that so you understand as a whole how much this is a technique and a skill we have to hone now the third thing i wanted to say is that i have found through my research and many interviews that we tend to have spontaneous out -of -body experiences at varying times of our life if you have had them on their own and that's for a certain reason so it could also be that and this is I wouldn't say this is the main reason but it would be something to consider that maybe there's no need to have an out -of -body experience right now and that we'll have one at the right time for the right reason. So that's also something to consider because when people have had what I call evolution out -of -body experiences, it's been a time in their life where they've needed that access. So their soul has called on an out -of -body experience to give them what they need for a difficult situation or a big decision and their needs come spontaneously. So that point that you had in your life, Elizabeth, a long time ago, and for anybody else that's had a spontaneous one a few years ago or even recently, I would hanker a guess that there would have been a reason for that happening at that time. So if it's not happening right now, it could be just we haven't got there yet in the techniques. It can also be just practice, unfortunately. And also it could be well. Maybe it's not the time to actually have one, but it might happen two weeks down the line, three months down the line. And one little extra tip here. I hear so many times people say, I gave up practicing. I stopped trying. And then it happened. So there's something to do with letting go, but really letting go, not just saying, oh, yeah, I let go. I'm not practicing, but then secretly still wanting it. So there's something to do with giving up and then the experiences might come. Hope that made sense with those three different points there, Elizabeth. Thank you. I remember your experience. I remember you from the first call. Thank you so much, Elizabeth. Right. Next, I'd love to bring on Colton. Hi, Colton. You can unmute yourself. Hello, Jade. Hello, everybody. So you mentioned how being able to interact with a deceased loved one will help relieve grief. So my question in that is, if you're still having ego resistance in getting to the actual exit, and then also, I guess, like healing that grief before you get there could some of the ego resistance be healing that grief or is it more so like you got to get there to have that enlightenment and then also um when you get there and you actually you know if you do meet that person is it that conception of that person when they left or is it like this updated evolved spiritual conception of that person Okay, I'm going to answer the second question first. I wasn't 100 % clear on the first one, but I'm just going to answer the second one first. So this blows my mind because there's a lot going on here. And I'm not going to be able to explain it in two to three minutes. So you'll have to also wait for the class that talks about meeting other people and deceased people. So I'm going to sort of reel off some quite deep stuff that will probably need more questions, but hopefully it will be helpful. So the first thing is the reports that people have. Often from meeting particularly a deceased person that has passed over, many of them say that they present themselves or they seem to be in their most best self. So they're often very young, very healthy, they seem very alive. In these moments that they have them, they often want to give a message or some sort of information across to the other person as well. So this is what people report. And it was certainly my experience in meeting my dead father. He was very young, very fit, his most healthiest when I met him in my body experience, which was interesting because I wouldn't have perceived him to be that way. I would have expected. through my predictions of seeing him that he would be like how I saw him before he died. The reason why I'm pointing that out is because neuroscience says that our whole realities are based on our predictions and our expectations of them. But in astral projection, this is questioned because that isn't the case. Anyway, so this is really interesting that they come in that way. But also... Some people have a visual representation, and mine very much was. Some people feel a presence, but they don't see them, but they know that they're with them. And it's that gnosis, that inner gnosis. that they're there and they still receive a message or information or a sense of feeling so the level of communication is usually telepathic it's not often through voice or in that kind of way it's usually a feeling sense of exchange that happens which you might think well how would you know what they're saying but It seems to be naturally and intuitively very clear at the time it happens. So just trust that that will unfold in the way that it needs to. So you may see them, you may sense a presence of them, or you might get a sign. So if you ask to... near them or close to them or meet them, for whatever reason, you also might have a sign. Now that sign might come in your astral projection experience, or you might find that you get signs in this reality, in our everyday existence. And that could be... for many different reasons and this is why i said it could get a bit deep it depends where that let's say for simplistic ways i'm going to take a spiritualist term here uh that they might be on their own soul's evolutionary journey and let's just say not accessible right now not that because this is what it's going to be because space and time doesn't operate in the same way for us as it does there that's not to say we can't access them because we can get into quantum states as well so it just depends on your exit your intention, your level of awareness, where you astral project to, whether they are able to receive you, and then whether you are open to listening to whatever they might receive. And that might come straight away, or it might come later down the line, depending on how things come together. That's the easiest way that I can explain it in simple terms -ish. Yeah, thank you. That was very helpful. No worries. Great. Thank you so much, Colton. That's about all the time we have for questions today. Jade, if I didn't get to you guys, don't worry. We've got two more calls planned. And also, you don't have to wait until the next call for questions. You can dive into the community and help each other out there as well. Jade, as the students prepare for the next two weeks before the next call, how can they prepare most effectively? How can they allow themselves to experience what needs to come up? I'm laughing because what's initially coming up, which is we need to get out of our own way. And I say this to myself as well, because I'm still practicing. We need to get out of our own way. And by that, I mean... expectations we might have about what we might experience, anything that we might think should be happening or must be happening or where we should be. Or, you know, we have to sort of be gentle with ourselves on this process and train the techniques. So we have to move out of our own way, our own limitations and fears and have to gently place them aside or move through them, allow them to be. But also. Do practice. There is a balance between intuition and actual practicing every day. So those of you that practice, you will begin to build a habit and that habit will create and cultivate the conditions that allow for the astral projection to arise. As an example of that, I woke up in the middle of the night because I've had COVID. So I was like, yes. I'm not going to be able to sleep so I can practice more astral projection. Genuinely, I said that. And because I'd cultivated the habit of using disruption to my sleep to do a technique, I was able to have two or three out of body experiences more so than I would have normally done had I not had COVID and I'd not had disturbed sleep. And that was only because I'd built that habit to be able to recognize the altered state and then do those techniques. So it is very practical. as well as intuitive. So it's a balance between the two. But don't give up. Do not give up. William Buhlman, who is the trainer at the Monroe Institute, he's the main out -of -body experience teacher. If you go there, you're going to be trained by him. He's very no -nonsense. He's very no -bullshit. He's very masculine in his energy and assertion. And he says, Jade, if you're going to just practice for two weeks, just... up give up right now if you're only gonna practice for two weeks there's no point sorry that was my terrible american accent i apologize for that um but basically he was saying you need to stick with it stick with it stick with it so stick with it move out of your own way and then cultivate a habit with the practices and it will happen it will happen uh good luck week four one last thing Week four is more advanced stuff that is mainly for once you begin having experiences. So take on board everything in week four and you might want to put some into practice, but be aware they're mainly things to do once you start having out -of -body experiences because I wanted to give you some deep stuff right at the end to be cracking on with. Thank you. Great. Thank you so much, Jade. And thank you tribe for tuning in for this week's first live call. Our next live call is in two weeks. It is exiting the body and. and preparing to fly for the astral realms. Same time in two weeks, we'll be doing another Q &A with Jade and we'll be covering the next two weeks of the quest. Thank you everyone for joining. Thank you, David and Monica, the ambassadors for being here on the call as well and active in the tribe. And as you guys know, you can continue this conversation in the community and on the quest circles. So we'll see you in two weeks. Thank you everyone. And thank you, Jade. Thank you. Take care.

Week 2: Learn to Fly

====================

LESSON 8: Tune Into the Energy Body for Astral Projection
--------------------
<v ->Welcome back.</v> Today, we are talking about energy. I'd like to start with this astonishing quote by astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson. He says, "The atoms of our bodies are traceable to stars that manufactured them in their cores, and exploded these enriched ingredients across our galaxy billions of years ago. For this reason, we are biologically connected to every other living thing in the world. We are chemically connected to all molecules on earth, and we are atomically connected to all atoms in the universe. We are not figuratively, but literally, stardust." Well, less than 1% of us is stardust; actually the rest is empty space. Everything is made of energy. The sun, the moon, your mum, everything. Many traditions around the world have versions of energy systems that run through the body, from chi in traditional Chinese medicine to prana in the Indian schools of yoga. They believe that we have an energy body meshed with the physical one within which energy flows freely. For example, you might have heard of the chakra system which is an example of this. Through our life experiences, this vital energy can become clogged and blockages can occur which treatments and practices such as acupuncture, reiki, and yoga can help with. Most of the time we're not really in tune with the energy body; we live in our minds, don't we? Thinking about the past, or the future, what we're going to make for dinner, or what we should have said or not said in the argument that we had, we lose sense of our body, our sematic awareness. So, although we talk about going out of body, we're very rarely connected to it anyway in our everyday life. Paradoxically, in order to have a successful out-of-body experience we need to build a relationship in body. Otherwise, we cannot tune into our energy system or safely ground back when we return from astral travel. It is this bioenergy part of us from which the energy body during an OBE is created. Tibetan Buddhist scholar and dream yoga expert, Alan Wallace, calls it an ethereal body which he says is projected out into ordinary reality. He says, "What you send out is not some ghostly emanation, not the intuitive power of clairvoyance; you are actually sending something out that is physical and imbued with your awareness and localized." From this point of view, we project our conscious awareness away from the body in a non-physical but tangible form. The Dalai Lama said, "Consciousness can be trained to leave the physical body." And this is what we're training to do. This energy body is sometimes called the subtle or second body, or referred to as the projectable double. There are also different types of OBEs, so different ways in which we experience this double body. And sometimes it's not like a body at all; we can actually just be a floating point of perception with no shape or form. Some people experience the energy body in the felt sense, like a vibration, a floating sensation, tingling feeling. Others might experience it more visually, see a body of light or a cloud of color like an aura. And others might intuitively know that it's there; it's very subtle. But generally, the deeper the trance state, the stronger the energy body will be. Different traditions talk about different types of bodies, such as emotional bodies, mental bodies. But to be honest, all we rarely need to know at this stage is about three of them, the core ones which you're most likely to experience. These are the dream body, the etheric body, and the astral body. The dream body is what we enter into when we fall asleep and we're dreaming. It's usually experienced the same way as the physical body; it looks and feels fleshy and physical most of the time. Of course because it's a dream, weird stuff might happen. The body can change, we can become a giant or tiny, we might have a robot arm, we might grow a pair of wings or even become a zombie. But generally, the dream body looks and feels the same as the physical one. Due to this, dream sex is experienced the same way as in the physical too. Important to flag this up because it's not the same as in the astral, which we'll come to in a bit. The dream body is also the same when we're in a lucid dream which is a dream in which we know we're dreaming. Due to realizing, "Oh, I'm in a dream," we might have more control and the ability to influence things such as shiftshaping our body, but it's still very much experienced in the same way as the physical one, here and now. For example, one time I got lucid, and I changed my body to a man's to see what it would feel like. It was good, but I definitely prefer being a woman. Another time when I used to dance, I practiced no-handed cartwheels in the lucid dream state. And I scraped my hand along the floor; it stung and it bled as it would have done in the real world. Our dream body reflects the physical one and everything that comes with it. The etheric body is very much tied to the real world, what we call physical matter reality or the human realm. It's like the energetic duplicate of this body. And although it's non-physical, it generally has a feeling of mass, a kind of density to it. I often describe it like a heavy shadow or a fat cloud, and it can float and it can fly, so it's malleable and has a tangibility to it. So, it's different to the dream body in that it doesn't appear physically real. There's no flesh to touch, no hands to clap. In fact, they'd probably go through each other, but you might feel a pressure, so there's still a sort of sense, a weight to it. Some teachers say the etheric body is like a low-powered projection. It can kind of collapse on the floor after exiting the body, and sometimes it feels like you're wading through mud when you move forwards. I've experienced both of those things; it's like I'm trudging to the window and other times I can fly, but sometimes I'm slow and clumsy, and I fly like a drunk Superman. However, there are ways to power up the etheric body. William Buhlman, the lead OBE trainer at the Monroe Institute, suggests drawing energy from your physical one through a sort of sucking motion to charge it up. The only trouble with this is that if we think of our physical body during a projection, it can often bring us out of the journey. So that's quite an advanced skill, but give it a go if you find yourself having this problem. The astral body gives us access to and interacts with the astral planes: these expansive, colorful, extraordinary places full of weirdness and wonder such as astral cities and beings. The astral body is still made of energy like the etheric one, but it has less tension; there's less pressure. It usually has a lighter feel, a brightness. It's easier to move; there's less of a restriction and a sense of freedom. I'll give you two examples of mine. In the powerful OBE I had which led to my career change, my astral body looked transparent. It was see-through like a shimmering mirage or a heat wave in the desert. If you've seen the 1980s movie "Predator" with Arnold Schwarzenegger, I looked like the Predator when he goes into stealth mode. But other times I've been more of a luminous light like in the film "Twilight" when Edward goes into the sunlight, and he looks like a glowing ghost. I remember looking at my astral hands for the first time and thinking, "This is so cool," and I can't wait for you to experience it. Everyone is different though, so don't forget everyone will experience various types of bodies in different ways. Yours might not look like mine or somebody else's. And more often than not, you might just be a disembodied point of awareness. In fact, most of my experiences, I'm a floating point of perception like a moving invisible eye. Wherever we find ourselves, the most important thing to do is to release expectation and accept the body that we're in and work with that. To help us prepare energetically, let's learn an exercise to clear the energy body. Clearing energy is like taking a shower. If we don't wash, we'll begin to get a residue, a film across the skin, and over time it will build up, and we'll get pretty dirty, right? So to avoid this, we need to detoxify the energy body. Now, there are diverse ways of clearing or alchemizing energy, depending on the tradition or the school that you're from. We are going to learn a basic and fun tool to purify energy and keep it flowing. This one not only clears the energy system, but it also doubles up as protection. Some people like to do psychical protective exercises as part of their preparation for astral projection, particularly from the shamanic and the spiritualist traditions. It brings a sense of safety and confidence, especially for beginners. This is why I've chosen Robert Monroe's Resonant Energy Balloon Technique, but I've adapted it, and I've added two more layers for extra power. Welcome back. Today, we're going to look at doing an energy clearing exercise that also serves as a kind of protection by making a sphere or a bubble around us. Now, it's in three parts. The first part is creating energy flowing through the body using the breath and moving the arms to clear the system. The second part is holding our hands in this position to create a symbol or an image on the bubble that represents protection. The third part is where we're kind of going to lock the bubble in place with a command, and we do this by just closing our fists and bringing our elbows into our sides. So, it's a bit like this, but you can do it in your own way if you like. Okay, are we ready? Standing with feet slightly apart, soft knees in a comfortable position. We're going to bend slowly, bringing the arms down, gathering the energy through the feet, up the body, turning the palms away, reaching up over the head, and then opening the fingers as we bring the arms down. And we follow again by bending, gathering the energy up the body through the central channel, unfolding the arms up and out the top of the head. Now, we might like to bring the breath in with this, breathing in as the arms come up. Breathing out as the arms come up and over. So, this would be breathing in and out. Really nice; that's it. Breathing in and out. And at the same time, you might like to imagine that energy rushing up through the body like a river. And as it moves through the central channel and out the top of your head, you might like to think about the river flowing through, clearing out any stagnant energy in the system. So, breathing in, energy coming through, up, and out, clearing any blockages, detoxifying the system as we move through. Energy coming up through the feet, flowing through like a river, gushing through, and spraying out the top of our head. And as it comes up and out the top of our head, we imagine there is a film like a spray landing all around us, creating a bubble or a sphere from top to bottom, all around. And out. Spraying out the top of the head, falling all around like a fountain. And as we go through each one, the bubble becomes stronger and stronger as the energy clears out the system and creates this protective sphere all around us. A couple more times here. And then eyes open or closed, either is fine, but bringing your arms to their natural position resting at the sides. And bringing your hands up so your palms face your bubble, your sphere that is surrounding you, this protective energy. And then bringing a symbol or an image to mind and projecting this onto the sphere. You might like to picture this in your mind, or perhaps imagine that energy is coming out of your hands and creating the picture on the bubble around you. The symbol or the image is anything that represents protection and safety for you. Do this in whatever way feels best through images or a felt sense. And when you're ready, locking your bubble in place by curling your hand into a fist and bringing the elbows in. And if you'd like to, you can further strengthen the lock of your bubble by repeating this command after me. Only that of benevolent energy may enter. Only that of benevolent energy may enter. Only that of benevolent energy may enter. Okay, and releasing the hands and opening the eyes. Well done. You can do this exercise standing up just before you lie down to do your practice, or you could decide to do it just as a visualization as you're already lying down in your practice. If you choose this version, you don't do the physical parts of it, you just imagine the energy flowing through, imagine the symbol, and then you say the command at the end. Only that of benevolent energy may enter. Okay, see you tomorrow. If you'd like to get more involved in energy practices to work on your energy body, you might like to explore reiki, qigong, or Kundalini yoga. They're three of the best. Your actions for today: I'd like you to do exactly what we just did, but before you get into bed tonight. So, you picture and feel into the energy coming up through the body, out the top of the head, shower and spray down all around you, which forms a bubble. Then imprint onto that bubble your symbol, mantra, or affirmation. Then you lock it with your command. So, put on your energy body goggles as we play around with something that's a little bit more subtle but always present. Because like the physical body, it's a natural part of who you are.

LESSON 9: Enter & Ride the Vibrational State for Triggering OBEs
--------------------
<v ->Fellow travelers, grab your sails</v> and fasten your parachutes because today we're going to ride the winds of the Vibrational State. I'm going to share with you everything you need to know about this Vibrational State. When it happens, how it happens, and how you can work with it to sail into the astral plane. But what is the Vibrational State? Before you fully enter an out-of-body experience, more often than not, you'll transition through the Vibrational State first. This is an energetic gateway that you pass through in order to become out of body. It's the stage of phasing from the physical into the non-physical. But how can we recognize it? For some, it can be like a gentle or subtle hum or the sensation a bit like if a bee was buzzing inside of us. But for others, it can be more intense. It can feel like you're in a vacuum or like a rocket or you might experience this flurry of energy or almost like lightning electricity flowing through your body. You might even hear voices or sounds like radio frequencies. There might be flashes of color, bright white lights. And you might have one dominant sensation such as the vibrations, several symptoms all at once, like light and energy. When I was a child, it felt like someone had grabbed the edge of my bed and was shoving it back and forth, quite erratically, and I ran down the stairs to say to my mom if she'd been shaking my bed. And so it can feel that intense. But now, it feels like a subtle hum, tiny waves rippling through my body. But if you were to see me in the Vibrational State, I wouldn't be moving at all. It would look like I was just fast asleep. These are internal sensations that feel extremely real. The experience can be vastly or subtly different from one person to the next. But generally, the overarching signature of the Vibrational State is a felt sense of physical feeling, sometimes with a visual aspect too, and often involves this sense of vibration. Think of it like the white noise of a radio before tuning into a new channel, except you are the radio and the new channel is your new reality. To understand this, it might be worth knowing what it is and what it isn't. There are five things that you might experience that could be confused with the Vibrational State. One, exploding head syndrome. Exploding head syndrome is a rare parasomnia in which the affected person is startled from sleep with the sensation of a loud noise, like a bang. But don't worry. The head doesn't actually explode. It has been described as a painless, loud bang, a clash of cymbals, or kind of like a bomb exploding. I've had this a couple of times and it's pretty alarming. Both times, it was a one instant sensation, like someone had whacked me over the head with a wooden plank or kind of like a gunshot was firing. You wake up going, "Oh my God, what was that?" It's quite shocking, but it's within a moment. Researchers don't know why exploding head syndrome happens. And sometimes it can be confused with headache syndromes, but it's normally painless and it has no lingering pain. Two, an epileptic fit. This is a seizure that can happen whilst awake or asleep, suffered by someone with epilepsy. It can look like an uncontrollable shaking and jerking. The person might collapse and lose awareness and not remember what's happened. Despite feeling uncannily real, the Vibrational State is an internal sensation. We don't actually move through it physically although it could feel like a seizure of sorts. Three, restless legs. You have the urge to move your arms and legs. They feel twitchy, tingling, like little bugs are creeping under the skin. You might be experiencing restless legs if you feel this. This is also known as Willis-Ekbom Disease. It's a disorder that causes an uncontrollable urge to move your arms and legs, and it typically happens in the evening or nighttime hours when you're sitting or lying down. If you suffer with this, I empathize, because I do too. If you're a highly sensitive person, or you're low on iron, or you have kidney issues, or maybe you're pregnant, you might experience restless leg syndrome. Depending on the cause, moving can ease this unpleasant feeling temporarily. Sometimes, iron or magnesium supplements can help with this, too. Apparently, masturbation can alleviate the symptoms due to the dopamine release. So, you know, if you run out solutions. Four, your heartbeat and blood flowing around the body. The echo-free chamber at Orfield Labs in Minnesota is nicknamed "the quietest place on earth." It absorbs 99.99% of sound, meaning you can hear your heartbeat, your lungs breathe, and your stomach digest. It's really freaky. However, similar things can happen when we're in a deep meditation state. You might hear your own heartbeat or feel your digestion. You can tune into the intricate movement of blood flowing around your body. Because when we're attempting to be totally relaxed, but alert at the same time, noticing these things can happen in the Mind Awake Body Asleep State. And it can sometimes be mistaken for the Vibrational State. This is why practice is key so we know the difference. Five, the hypnagogic and hypnopompic states. You already know what the hypnagogic state is, that drowsy in-between stage where auditory sounds such as voices, imagery, and conceptual dream-like displays occur as you drift off to sleep. These hallucinations are usually made up of memories in the day, mental preoccupations, and the displays of the mind's content. The Vibrational State doesn't usually contain dream-like images. It's more of a psychical sense of subtle movement, energy, and frequency. You might notice light and vibration or varying sounds, and it can differ from time to time. For me, it sounded like the wooden bow of an old ship creaking; but another time, there was a high pitch radio frequency; and another time, it felt like a balloon bursting. So be open to any sensations. But will you always pass through the Vibrational State? Beginners usually experience the Vibrational State more intensely than advanced practitioners. But, some don't seem to enter it all. And actually, once you've had quite a few OBEs, out-of-body experiences, the Vibrational State may feel far less noticeable. Some researchers explain the decreasing sensations over time as kind of an unsticking. It's as though the glue has softened after a few OBEs, and it becomes easier and more subtler to detach or unstick your energy body from the physical one the more we practice it. So when does the Vibrational State occur? It usually happens spontaneously when you are deep in that sweet spot of the Mind Awake Body Asleep State. It can occur though during meditation or deep relaxation and on the cusp of sleep. Though, some astral projectors have reported experience it during the waking state, ordinary reality, but this is very rare. How do we bring on the Vibrational State? When transitioning from Mind Awake Body Asleep into the Vibrational State, it's quite an artful move. It's easy to bypass it completely and head straight into sleep. However, there is a small window of opportunity, and the idea is to sail through that window because when it's open, it can often come on spontaneously. However, we can bring it on through various breathing, visualization, and active imagination techniques, like the ones that you'll follow in the guided audio today. If you start to experience it, the best thing to do is what surfers do which is relax and then ride the wave as it reaches you. So you want to escalate the overall vibrational feeling, the buildup of energy. It's like your body is kind of powering up, and we want to encourage that in some way, encourage these sensations to get more and more. Sometimes, we may only feel them in one part of our body, or they might come and go erratically. So escalate that feeling. If this happens, gently move the vibrations to other areas of your body using your mind and your intent. Now you might be thinking, "How do I move something with my mind?" Through intention and direction. It sort of happens of its own accord, to be honest, and it can be pretty hit and miss, because this state is so fleeting. But as long as you don't have strong emotions or thoughts which can kind of wipe the state away, it should work. How do we approach the Vibrational State when it's happening? Mindfulness teacher and author Clive Holmes has a wonderful butterfly analogy. I always like to use this as a way to explain the best mindset to adopt during the Vibrational State. It's similar to the art of catching a butterfly. A butterfly is very likely to fly off if we try to grab it. If you keep your hands still, the butterfly might temporarily land on your hand, but then fly off again. But if you move your hand steadily and slowly towards the butterfly, you can tentatively catch it. It's almost as though you're not really looking at it at all. Sometimes, you can see something in your peripheral vision, right? If you look directly at it, it disappears. The Vibrational State is a bit like that. It's elusive. And unless we're in a very deep trance state and the Vibrational State is coming on heavy, it can be hard to catch. And remember, strong emotions or hard thoughts can evaporate it an instant. As soon as we begin to bring our rational mind in and overthink it, it's gone. This is why a mindful mindset is vital for mastering the state. It's a bit like you're eating a ripe peach. You don't narrate the fact that you're going to eat and bite into the peach. "Oh, isn't this a smooth peach. It's very ripe. Oh, it looks very juicy. Oh, there's a little bit there." You don't do that, right? You just eat it. So you don't comment on the experience as it's happening. You just bite into it. This is helpful to remember because in the Vibrational State, as soon as logic and reason starts to come in and you narrate too much, this can disperse the state. So stay with the experience, don't overanalyze, and allow it to unfold, and enjoy the ride. Your actions for today: today, I would like you to listen to the guided audio track, which involves a visualization technique to spark the Vibrational State. This involves using active imagination to effectively kind of fake it before you make it and bring it on. Remember, this will only work if you are deep in the Mind Awake Body Asleep State or the hypnagogic state. But give it a go, and good luck.

====================

LESSON 9: Meditation - Inducing the Vibrational State - Option 1

Before we begin, limit any distractions that could pull your senses and attention outwards into the physical world. You might like to shut the curtains, close the windows and doors, wear headphones or an eye mask, and get into a comfortable position. If you would like to do this and you haven't already, pause the track now and take a moment to do this. Although we want to get to a place where we cannot feel our physical body anymore, it is okay to adjust your position or scratch an itch at any time if you need to. This is your time to awaken and practice. The skill of astral projection within you is the ability to tap into realms beyond the body. This is because you are a multi-dimensional being with infinite potential. With this in mind, let's begin. This audio uses hypnosis techniques and active imagination to stimulate the vibrational state. And if you experience this state today or feel close to it, this may be a new sensation for you. So remember, be open to whatever occurs. You can always return to your bodily sensations at any time, just as you would during an actual out of body experience. Now keep your eyes open for the time being and just check in with the motivation for your practice. Take a moment to recall why you would like to astral project. 

Now take three deep belly breaths in through your nose and slowly out through your mouth. And while you're taking these deep breaths, set an intention to relax your body fully and stay mindfully aware for the duration of this guided session. 

Now that you are nicely settled down, I'd like you to look up and find a spot to fix your gaze. Maybe a mark on the wall or ceiling, something that's not directly in front of you, but slightly above your eye line. If you are laying down or propped up with cushions, just be careful not to overstretch your neck in any way. You're just looking very slightly above the eye line, so you shouldn't need to tilt your head back very much at all. And from this moment on, just fix your gaze on that spot and on that spot alone. And as you do this, you'll find very quickly that your vision will get hazier and hazier as your eyes get tired and sleepy. Until soon, they will be closed. But for now, keep them open and you will be drifting into a very pleasant, relaxed condition very soon. 

But for now, I'd just like you to keep your eyes focused on that point for a little while. And while you'll listen to the sound of my voice, keep your eyes focused on that point. And soon you'll notice your eyes blinking. Blinking is fine, blinking is good as you keep your eyes on that same spot. Now, I don't want you to close your eyes, but just keep them fixed on that spot whilst you concentrate on my voice and your eyes might water a bit or feel a little blurry, and that's okay. Remember, blinking is good, and these sensations are all just temporary. 

And while you are doing this, you'll find your vision is getting hazier and hazier. As your eyes get tired and sleepy, soon they will be closed and you'll just drift into a very pleasant relaxation. It doesn't matter if your mind wanders a little, you can always bring it back to the sound of my voice. Just be comfortable. And when you find that it would be so nice to just let those eyes close all on their own, you can stop trying to keep them open. Close your eyes now. See how comfortable they are when you let them go and relax. 

Settle yourself right down and just let yourself drift gently and and easily into relaxation. As I count slowly up to seven, I will start that count for you now. One, relax and already you can feel yourself calming down, becoming much more relaxed now, beginning to drift away. Two, relax. You're feeling comfortable, beginning to feel peaceful. Two, just feel into that relaxation, working its way through your body, bringing every part of you to rest. Three, relax. And now just breathe a little slower and deeper. And each deep breath you take is making you more and more relaxed. Settling yourself right down. 

Four, relax. Just feel your whole body getting heavier and heavier. Now almost as though you are sinking pleasantly down, sink into sheer comfort, body asleep, mind awake as each deep breath you take relaxes you more and more. Five, relax. You are feeling drowsier and drowsier, tired and sleepy body. Now mind aware and calm, body totally relaxed. Six, relax. Every part of your body is coming to rest. Now settling down into sheer comfort, body feeling tired, sleepy, calm and at peace, mind gently aware. Seven, relax. Just continue drifting now deeper and deeper into that relaxation. Resting so comfortably now you are deeply calm and relaxed focused, stand aware. 

In this peaceful state, you notice in your mind's eye a flickering dot far in the distance. It looks or feels like a tiny speck of light, and it's slowly floating towards you. As it gets closer, you see or feel that it's a beautiful, pure white light. You know that somehow it's come to age your journey. It drifts nearer sparkling with crystal clear rays of light, and you begin to notice that it beams with a powerful energy. Perhaps you can sense this energy, hear it, see it, or feel it. And as it gets closer, you can sense a healing vibrational quality to it. Don't worry if you can't clearly see or sense it. Just tap into the white light in any way that feels natural to you. As it makes its way over becoming bigger and bigger, you start to feel energy radiating from it. You sense that it's safe and welcoming. How does this feel? Much closer. Now the light has become bigger, and you notice that at its core it carries a powerful charge. As it travels towards you, you begin to feel into its magnetic quality. It drifts closer and closer, becoming bigger and bigger until finally, it pauses right in front of you. You have a good feeling about it, and you are open to what it has to offer. Slowly, the white light begins to pour into you through your forehead, just above your brow, opening up your innate perception. It's a gateway to your higher consciousness. Feel this powerful pure white light flooding your body and being. 

Imagine the light enters all your cells, clearing out any restrictions or blocks that might holding you back from astral travel. The wonderful light weaves in and out of every fiber, every muscle, releasing all the doubts and all the fears which simply dissolve away. Feel your limitations leaving your body and mind by being absorbed into the pure white light. You notice the light begins to travel down your legs towards your feet, gathering all its energy in along the way. It begins to pulsate at your feet like a sound wave. Vibrations penetrating through like a speaker at your toes. Feel this vibration ber through your feet. 

This wave of vibration begins to travel up your body now like a strong tide pulling in and out of the shore. Feel it past the ankles, calves, knees, thighs, hips, stomach, arms, chest, shoulders, neck and head. Before ricocheting, back down the body from the head, neck, shoulders, chest, arms, stomach, hips, thighs, knees, calves, ankles, and feet like a laser beam scanning your body. Now this vibrating wave of energy begins to travel back up again past the calves, knees, thighs, hips, stomach, chest, arms, shoulders, neck and head where it reverberates back down again from the head, neck, shoulders, chest, arms, stomach, hips, thighs, knees, calves, ankles, and feet. Feel into the wave of vibration, getting stronger and stronger, faster and faster. As it makes its way up and down the body from head to toe, feet, ankles, calves, knees, thighs, hips, stomach, arms, chest, shoulders, neck, head, neck, shoulders, chest, arms, stomach, hips, thighs and knees, calves, ankles, feet. You know it's safe. So you surrender to the vibrations and they become stronger and stronger, up and down and up and down it goes. Continue to whip the wave up and down your body in your own time. Now becoming faster and faster. Vibrations more and more. More and more. 

Feel it pinballing back and forth, back and forth, shooting up and down and up and down the body. Ever increasing in power and speed. Pulsations powering stronger and stronger and stronger. Becoming so fast, so strong, so intense. Now that this wave of energy engulfs your whole body with vibration, feel it flooding your entire being. Encourage the vibrations to become more and more. Then intuitively follow them out of the body or do your chosen exit technique. Encourage the vibrations to become more and more. Then intuitively follow them out of the body or do your chosen exit technique and then go on your journey with no sense of rush. It's time to come back to the body. Now, back to the physical world. That's it. Make your way. Remember, you can return any time you wish, but for now, it is time to come back to everyday reality with full recall and all senses intact. Make your way back now. Follow the sound of my voice and bring your awareness back to the body. Anything you can see or sense in your physical world, you might like to wriggle your fingers and toes, or take a nice stretch when you are ready, gently opening the eyes. Welcome back. Take a moment to recall your experience and note it down in your diary. I'll see you again soon.

Now settling down into sheer comfort, body feeling tired, sleepy, calm, and at peace, mind gently aware. Seven, relax. Just continue drifting now deeper and deeper into that relaxation. Resting so comfortably now you are deeply calm and relaxed focused, stand aware.

It drifts closer and closer, becoming bigger and bigger until finally, it pauses right in front of you. You have a good feeling about it, and you are open to what it has to offer. Slowly, the white light begins to pour into you through your forehead, just above your brow, opening up your innate perception. It's a gateway to your higher consciousness. Feel this powerful pure white light flooding your body and being. 

Imagine the light enters all your cells, clearing out any restrictions or blocks that might be holding you back from astral travel. The wonderful light weaves in and out of every fiber, every muscle, releasing all the doubts and all the fears which simply dissolve away. Feel your limitations leaving your body and mind by being absorbed into the pure white light. You notice the light begins to travel down your legs towards your feet, gathering all its energy. In along the way. It begins to pulsate at your feet like a sound wave. Vibrations penetrating through like a speaker at your toes. Feel this vibration reverberate through your feet. 

This wave of vibration begins to travel up your body now like a strong tide pulling in and out of the shore. Feel it past their ankles, calves, knees, thighs, hips, stomach, arms, chest, shoulders, neck and head. Before ricocheting, back down the body from the head, neck, shoulders, chest, arms, stomach, hips, thighs, knees, calves, ankles, and feet like a laser beam scanning body. Now this vibrating wave of energy begins to travel back up again past the calves, knees, thighs, hips, stomach, chest, arms, shoulders, neck and head where it reverberates back down again from the head, neck, shoulders, chest, arms, stomach, hips, thighs, knees, calves, ankles, and feet. Feel into the wave of vibration, getting stronger and stronger, faster and faster. As it makes its way up and down the body from head to toe, feet, ankles, calves, knees, thighs, hips, stomach, arms, chest, shoulders, neck, head, neck, shoulders, chest, arms, stomach, hips, thighs and knees, calves, ankles, feet, you know it's safe. So you surrender to the vibrations and they become stronger and stronger, up and down and up and down it goes. Continue to whip the wave up and down your body in your own time. Now becoming faster and faster. Vibrations more and more. More and more. 

Feel it pinballing back and forth, back and forth, shooting up and down and up and down the body. Ever increasing in power and speed. Pulsations powering stronger and stronger and stronger. Becoming so fast, so strong, so intense. Now that this wave of energy and GUFs your whole body with vibration, feel it flooding your entire being. Encourage the vibrations to become more and more. Then intuitively follow them out of the body or do your chosen exit technique. Encourage the vibrations to become more and more. Then intuitively follow them out of the body. Or do your chosen exit technique and then go on your journey.

LESSON 10: Lift Off: Exiting the Body With the Roll Out Technique
--------------------
<v ->Fellow astral projectors,</v> did you manage to connect to the vibrational state? I hope so, but don't worry if not. Remember, this is the first time you have given it a go. Sometimes we can feel a subtle sensation, and other times it can be quite intense, but around 30% of people don't actually experience it. So although we are learning to bring it on, don't get too attached to wanting to feel the vibrational state. You might be one of the people who don't enter it. Today, we're getting into the juicy stuff. We're going to learn how to fly, AKA exit the body. Now, as I said in the preparation video, I don't particularly like the word exit because it suggests we've totally gone. We've grabbed our coat, and we've left the house. Which isn't entirely true because an aspect of our consciousness, our awareness, is still there. Remember, this is what keeps the lungs breathing and the heart beating. And it brings us back immediately if our body gets disturbed or distracted. But it does feel like a separation or a step out or an expansion out of the physical body. So I'll say exit for simplicity's sake but also to refer to the actual moment of shifting beyond the body, the transition into the astral. An exit technique aims to make this happen. It's a way of propelling our energy body out of the physical one, or as OBE author William Buhlman calls it, our flesh suit. Right now, your awareness is firmly rooted in your physical body, right? Due to outside sensory information coming in. Exit techniques try to override your mind's grip on sense information coming through the physical body. Touch, taste, sound, smell, and sight. So that your mind can't quite place where you are anymore because it can no longer sense the outside world or feel the body which is where we habitually perceive ourselves to be most of the time. Effectively, we try to blur the lines of where our physical body begins and ends. Ideally obtaining total body dissolution where we can't feel it at all anymore. Thus fooling our mind that it isn't there. This works in a similar way to how magicians do a trick. They make you look at the colorful scarf, so you don't see them prepare it. Then they use misdirection to dupe you into believing that what is happening is real. We're doing the same thing. We are trying to hoodwink the mind into detaching its location from the body, but this can only happen when we are deep in an altered state. And there are hundreds of ways to do it. The exit techniques that we learn over the next few weeks draw from memory, visualization, active imagination, and meditation techniques. This is supported by using brainwave technology, called binaural beats and isochronic tones. These sorts of frequencies range from alpha to gamma waves, helping to place the brain into the best conducive states for astral projection. Now don't worry; it's completely safe. These are used in many therapeutic settings, such as relaxation, self-hypnosis, to enter these non-ordinary states of consciousness. Another example of this would be like when the shaman beats her drum in a repetitive motion; it has a similar effect. Although there are some cross-cultural commonalities on leaving the body such as floating upwards, there are various ways in which we can exit. For example, did you know you can slide up and out of your head or sink backwards through your body. The process can be a spectrum between soft and floaty feelings or intense and quick. I have literally sat apart of my body, swung my legs over the bed, and stood up, a bit like ghost. But sometimes it feels like pulling a sticky toffee off a sofa; my awareness stretches away from my body. Another time I was a pinpoint of awareness that was slingshot out at lightning speed. And another one, I was more like static electricity, dissolving and phasing out. It's a bit like when Scotty beams the crew back to the starship enterprise in "Star Trek." And now you know I'm a nerd. The reason I'm telling you this is so you know there's nothing to be afraid of. And that one exit might look different to another. Plus, yours might not be the same as other projectors in the tribe. With practice, you get used to the diverse sensations, and you become better at recognizing the different states and knowing where your personal sweet spot is. That's the perfect place to exit. So let's learn a technique. The roll out method is popular amongst projectors. Many people have success with it which is why I'm teaching you this one first. It's a kinesthetic exit technique. This means that to trigger a separation from the body, we're going to draw on the memory of our felt sense, how something physically feels. For example, the motion of rocking from side to side. This is so we can draw on the sensation and then recreate it later during our guided practice. It's a bit like when you remember how it feels to swing high on a swing or sway in a hammock. The best way to do this is to tune deeply into retrospective memory of the movement, imprinting a feeling of rocking to our mind so that we can easily connect to it during an altered state and recreate it. We do this by rehearsing the action physically for real before our guided practice, but we don't actually move our physical body during our practice. So let's give it a go together now. You might like to watch me first, then rewind and do it with me, or do it in your own time. Today, we're going to learn the roll out exit technique. So if you haven't already, pause this video, and get yourself laying down on your back in a comfortable position. Okay, let's begin. Close your eyes. And take three deep breaths. And with each exhale, allow your awareness to drop into the body, becoming more present in the moment, and tuning into your inner world. Allowing your breath to return to its natural pace, but feeling the body on the bed or ground, any contact points with parts of the body, and how the clothes or blankets touch the skin. Let the bed or ground hold you, take your weight. And then very slowly, using your feet and hands, pressing them into the bed or ground, begin to slowly move from side to side, like a small rock gently moving from side to side. Use your hands and feet to help you as much as possible. But remembering it's not about getting the rock right or the turn to the side right; it's more about how it feels. So tune into the sensation and capture this rocking sensation to your mind. And as you do so, perhaps pick yourself up a little further, so the shoulders and the hips begin to lift off with each turn. To help do this, you might like to press your hands and feet more firmly into the bed or ground. And rock your knees from side to side to help take you over. Maybe adding in a little weight. More power. More speed. Until you find yourself turning almost on your side, rocking from one direction to the other. And soon you'll find the weight of your body, the momentum of the movement, will take you from side to side. So allow your shoulders and hips to go with you. And then when it feels... when it feels like you could almost roll all the way over, use your hands and the movement to take you all the way out to one side, rolling off. So don't forget, when you do this for real, you only rock out to the side when it begins to feel real, like it's really happening, like you sense your body actually moving off to the side, which of course it isn't because we keep our physical body very still; we don't move it at all. We actually draw on the memory of this motion when we come to do our practice later on lying down. So just to be clear, when we come to do this later on, you do not move your physical body. You bring the motion to mind, the movement of the rocking from side to side, and we want to fool our body, trick our mind into that we're really moving. And if you're in that sweet spot, you will begin to feel like you're really moving. And when you do, you make that decision to turn off and roll out to the side. How do we know when it's the right time to separate from the body? To take that action of rolling or floating or stepping out? Often we just intuitively know, and sometimes the vibrational state will do it for us. And occasionally, we might have help, a guide. When none of this happens, we can do the phantom limb test. The phantom limb test is applied when you think you might be able to leave your physical body, but you're not too sure. You feel like you could be in the right place, but you don't know whether to fully go for an exit, because if you're not in the right place it could send you back to the beginning and wake you up out of the trance state, taking you back to square one. Let's practice it together now. We're not in an altered state, so it might not feel as strong as when you do it in the mind awake body asleep state or in the vibrational state where you will feel your energy arm exit. Hello, and welcome to the phantom limb test. This is not only a great way of tapping into and tuning into the energy of your body, but it's a great way to start sensing your astral body. And we do this test when we think we might be ready to exit, leave the body. So it's a nice one to learn. So to do this, what we're going to do is we're going to have our hand like this, and we're just going to move our hand up and down. That's all it is. But then we're going to stop moving our hand and we're actually going to see if we can feel or sense the energy moving up and above it. It'll make sense in a moment when I guide you through it. Now I would like you to close your eyes 'cause then you're less distracted from outside things, and it's easier to tune into the energy. So closing the eyes, and bringing our arm to a 90 degree angle, so just out to the side, so it's horizontal in space, palm facing down. And we're going to slowly begin to lift our arm up from the elbow, and then placing our hand down again. So lifting the hand up and bringing it down. Bit like we're doing a robotic goodbye or hello. And as we do this, tune into your hand and your arm. Feel into how it feels. Just bring your attention to how your arm feels moving through space as it lifts up and down. Up and down. Not too quickly. So we have plenty of time to tune into how it feels. Noticing how the hand feels as it moves up and down. And when you're ready, when your hand is on its way back down, leaving it there, bringing it to a pause. But with your intention and imagination, see if you can still move your hand and your arm up and down, like your energy arm is moving forwards and back. The astral arm moving up and down as the physical one just did. Tuning into any sensations you may or may not feel as you use your intention and imagination to shift your energy arm, your astral arm up and out and back down. As you move your energy arm, your astral arm up and down. Can you sense anything? Are there subtle sensations or nuances that you feel in your arm or the space around you? And if you're thinking, well, I can't feel anything at all, that's perfectly fine. Just keep your attention there. And use your imagination to feel a sense of movement up and down. And then when you're ready, releasing the arm and opening the eyes. So if you feel like you're in that sweet spot, a very deep mind awake body asleep state, and you think, oh my gosh, I think I could do an exit technique, you can try to lift your arm out of your body. Now, you don't need to keep doing this. This is just an exercise to get us to tune in to the astral body. But what you can do is try to lift a finger out, your energy finger, or a hand. Or you can really go for it and try and lift your whole arm out. Now, if that happens and it feels real where you're like, oh my God, my arm just moved, but your physical arm didn't, then you know you can go for the full exit technique and come all the way out. Good luck. Your actions for today: we normally do an exit technique when we are in the mind awake body asleep or vibrational state. But for now, don't worry about that. We're going to try and do this on the cusp of sleep in the hypnagogic and the hypnopompic. Remember, the hypnopompic is when we're waking up out of sleep, and the hypnagogic is when we're going in. So when you go to bed tonight, and during any time you wake up in the middle of the night, first thing in the morning, whenever, I want you to try this technique. Use your imagination, and draw on the memory of your felt sense of how it feels to roll from side to side. Do a few rocks, and then if it feels like it's really happening, you're really moving, go to roll all the way out. And if you're not sure, remember, you can do the phantom limb test. But don't take longer than 10 seconds; go for it straight away. The reason I'm getting you to do it faster than I showed you is because often we can enter the sweet spot without knowing. And when we rouse in bed or wake up in the morning, if we waste too long rocking from side to side, we could lose the opportunity. Whereas if we were to practice it right now from being wide awake, we would have to do it for much longer because we're not in an altered state. Does this make sense? A reminder here, we do not move our physical body for real. Effectively, we're trying to roll our energy body out. But the thing is, when this happens, it will feel real, like you're actually rolling out. So, let's rock and roll.

====================

LESSON 11: Mapping the Multiverse
--------------------
<v ->Hello heroes. How did you get on?</v> Did you manage to sense an exit technique or even roll all the way out? Don't worry if you didn't; this does take time and it takes practice, but it will happen, and I'm cheering you on. Remember before when we talked about the fact that we can use astral projection to fly high and far, not only in our rooms. Well today, I'm going to give you a map to the multiverse, but first, let me tell you a story. In 1995, wolves were reintroduced to Yellowstone National Park in the United States. What happened next, no one expected. They changed the behavior of the rivers. The wolves had been absent for over 70 years with no natural predator. The deer population rose sharply, and the park's vegetation suffered from overgrazing. While the wolves were few in number, they radically changed the deer's behavior. The deer avoided areas where they risked being trapped in the valleys and gorges. And so the flora in these spots soon started to regenerate. In six years, trees grew five times their normal height, long-departed bird species returned to nest, and the number of grizzly bears increased owing to new abundance of berries on the trees. But what about those rivers? Well, the regenerating forest improved the quality of the soil which stabilized the riverbanks, and of course the trees absorbed more water which slowed the river's flow and dramatically reduced soil erosion. The wolves, although only small in number, transformed not only the ecosystem, but the physical geography of the land. Why am I telling you this? Because I want you to recognize the potential of your power. Do not underestimate the impact of your presence in the astral plane. It's easy to assume that we're merely visitors traveling through these other realms of reality, but actually we do hold some influence. Our presence and our observation has an effect. We can pass through some places kind of unnoticed, but we can influence others greatly. Just like the wolves in Yellowstone Park, we can produce a positive impact in both our everyday reality and in other dimensions of existence such as the astral realm. So let's find out what these different dimensions might be. The multiverse is the idea that our universe and all that's contained within it is just one part of a larger structure, a bigger entity with other universes. Some spiritual traditions believe that we can access these vast other worlds through non-ordinary states of consciousness. That rather than them being places far away in terms of distance, that they're actually interdimensional, meaning we can access these other places by shifting states of consciousness and thus spacetime. In an explanation of the universe from a spiritual perspective, a dimension is known as a plane. It's conceived as a level or a region of reality corresponding to some category of being. The concept is found in shamanism, Sufism, and Tibetan Buddhism to name a few. There are whole series of these subtle planes or worlds which interrelate, that interact with the physical plane in which we live, with the solar system, and all the physical structures in the universe. So how do we fit in with all of this? Well, think of yourself as a prism. Light hits the prism, passes through it, and then a rainbow of colors separate out at the other side. Let's say this light is consciousness, and that the prism is all the wonderful things that make you you, and that the rainbow represents the astral planes. The unique composition of your prism dictates the astral planes that you're able to access. It's as if the frequency that we operate on grants us entry into certain dimensions. Many traditions believe that via a process of raising your vibration or clearing the energy system can help reach higher planes. So whilst dedicating yourself to purification is a positive and helpful experience, it's not quite as black and white as a bottom-up hierarchal system, and that's because us humans are complex creatures. We don't operate in a kind of clear-cut linear fashion. Consciousness can hold all the many parts of us all at once. We could be in high vibration in one area and therefore close to one plane and in another aspect of our lives simultaneously lower in another. In other words, we're more like a multidimensional disco ball with different shades of lights beaming out in different directions, and we can dance between them all. This is important to know because we can find ourselves in all sorts of weird and wonderful places. To explore what these might be, let's keep it simple and look at Robert Monroe's locale model. Robert Monroe wrote "Journeys Out of the Body" and founded the Monroe Institute, where the CIA trained astral projection. He was one of the first people to start looking at out-of-body experiences from a more secular viewpoint without the dogma of religion. In his early days, he understood there to be three planes. Locale one, objective reality here and now, the human plane. Locale two, the astral, the spirit world or the afterlife. Locale three, wider dimensions of reality, planetary systems beyond the astral plane. After more research, he realized that these planes were more nuanced and he split the locales into a spectrum of stages that he calls focus levels. For example, focus level 10 is the mind awake body asleep state. Then as we become more practiced, we can enter wider realms of reality. Focus level 15 is a state of no time. Focus level 23 is the place that he says we find ourself in after death. Focus levels 24 and 26 are what's known as belief system territories, places where people with shared beliefs experience the same things such as particular heavenly realms. He categorizes up to 49 levels, but there are infinitely more. These various environments typically correlate to the type of OBEs we can find ourself in. I've selected four of the most common for you to familiarize yourself with, though there are many more. Number one, physical plane OBEs. You come out of your body. You're in objective reality, the physical earthly plane as we know it. This is when you can turn around and look back at your body lying there. You can go visit a friend and see what they're up to, or do verifiable experiments, or simply just explore the neighborhood. These are the ones that the CIA trained in the Stargate program back in 1978, along with remote viewing, to become better spies. Two, interplanetary OBEs. We're not in Kansas anymore, that's for sure. This is when we have an experience of space and planetary systems. These are interstellar experiences of vast proportion. You can fly to the edge of the earth and look back at it or visit other worlds. Hindu monk Yogananda, the author of the famous book, 'The Autobiography of a Yogi," said the astral universe is hundreds of times larger than the material universe, with many astral planets. With these celestial experiences, you can help explore new places and contribute to the hitchhiker's guide to the astral galaxy. It's going to be a pretty big book. Three, time travel OBEs. Because we're not limited to sensing space and time through the physical body and the five senses in our ordinary world, you will find that time and space operate differently in the astral plane. Sometimes we experience different time periods at once, kind of like overlapping realities. For example, we can come out of the physical body, into the real world, which appears normal, but the buildings could be 18th century, like two different time filters overlapping with each other. Equally, we can seem to access past and future events. In 1999, my friend and OBE researcher Graham Nichols was teaching an exit technique in front of three colleagues when he unexpectedly found himself out of body on the corner of Dean Street in Soho, London. Before having the time to think about why he was there, he was confronted with a huge explosion coming from a pub called the Admiral Duncan around 25 feet in front of him. People ran out and fled past him. He turned to see the Pollo restaurant over his right shoulder, and then a wave of emotion hit him. It was the collective experience of the people. He felt the intensity, and it was too much to bear so he snapped back to his physical body. At the time, he knew he'd instinctively seen something that hadn't happened yet. And so he told his colleagues. Five days later, the London nail bombing happened. It occurred exactly as he had seen in his experience, had he been stood on that corner, 25 yards ahead, outside the Admiral Pub, next door to the Pollo restaurant. His three colleagues confirm that he had known these details before the event had happened. There was no way he could have known this in advance. This is known as a precognitive OBE, one of the various time-travel experiences we can have. Also other people report having past life experiences too. Four, soul retrieval OBEs. Soul retrieval is a core concept of shamanism. It's about integrating aspects of yourself that are somehow split off. This splitting off usually happens at a time of trauma, either in this lifetime or a previous one, where fragments of the self are stuck in different realities. And so the task is to find, reclaim, and integrate them back into the total self, our soul, so that there aren't any aspects of the soul that are disconnected. When astral traveling, you might find yourself in a place where there's an opportunity to do this, to heal. This type of OBE is really close to my heart which is why we spend a whole session on it in the last week. People have also reported visiting mythical civilizations such as Atlantis and accessing mystery searches that Akashic records, which is a universal book of everything that's ever happened. So you can see the possibilities are endless. Now usually when we leave the body, while we move from one realm to the next, we enter it right away such as shifting from the body into your room. However, sometimes we can enter the void. The void is like an in-between place of nothingness. There's no thing there. Hence the name, the void. Sometimes it's described as a blank grayish place, but it's got a tangibility to it, kind of like an empty room with no floor and the lights are out. There's nothing in it, but you can still feel that you're in a sort of space. If you find yourself in the void, you're incredibly lucky. You see, because it contains nothing, it has the potential for everything. Anything can happen here, all possibilities, you can go anywhere. Just use your intention and your will and choose to do so. But if you want to try something pretty advanced, you could stay and meditate in the void. This is where people have reported experiences of non-duality and oneness. It's a great way to explore ourselves and the nature of reality beyond the body and beyond the mind. So let's look at how to navigate a plane, an astral landscape, when we're in one. Wherever we find ourselves whilst having an out-of-body experience, we need to bring the rain. The RAIN technique was invented by mindfulness teacher Tara Brach to navigate emotions, but I've adapted it to the astral planes. You can also use the RAIN technique anytime you're in an altered state of awareness. So it's useful for things like meditation and working with dreams as well. Okay, you've come out of your body, you're in your room; this is what you're going to do. Recognize, this is the R. Recognize what is around you; notice the space. When we mindfully observe the landscape, a small gap emerges, providing a space from which decisions can be made from a more authentic place rather than emotional reactions. This helps us to steadily take in the landscape and gain control over where we are and what we're doing. Then accept, A, accept where we are; easier said than done. This means we have to accept the place, the landscape that we're in, in order to navigate it. Now that doesn't mean we endorse it by doing this, but once we accept where we are, we can recuperate any energy lost by fighting it. This provides more fuel for our mental faculties so we can operate more optimally. Then investigate, I. Investigate with detailed attention, investigate the landscape as if we're observing a detailed painting. What are the features, the colors, the textures, and the feelings that we find in the place. We can't be anxious and curious at the same time, so exploring the environment with a sense of childlike wonder also helps with nervous reactions. This will also improve how much we can recall after the adventure comes to an end. Then N, non-attachment: don't self-identify with where you are. For example, I'm in a dark place. Oh my goodness, I must be a terrible person. Or, I'm in a light place; ah, I must be an enlightened guru. Narrating a story over the scene can sometimes send us into a negative thought spiral or make us miss opportunities. Those pesky limiting beliefs popping up again. So recognizing, accepting, investigating, and not attaching in the way that I've described might take a matter of moments or minutes, depending on how long you choose to spend on each process. I tend to take around 20 seconds to pass through all the stages. You might take a little longer as you familiarize yourself with what to do. Try not to take longer than two minutes though. We want to get moving on to our projection plan as soon as possible. Your actions for today: your practice for today is to do the RAIN technique. Doesn't matter when you do it, but take the time to recognize, accept, investigate, and non-attach to wherever you are just as we did together today. This helps us to make it a habit. You could do it while brushing your teeth, waiting in a queue, or traveling to work. But remember, just two minutes. Also keep up all the other practices so far; keep trying to get into the vibrational state, practicing the rollout technique, and of course, passing through the hypnagogic state with mindfulness. I hope you're on the edge of your seat with excitement because other worlds are waiting for you. In the words of Dr. Seuss, oh the places you'll go.

====================

LESSON 12: Develop Clarity & Control During Astral Projection
--------------------
<v ->Welcome back.</v> Yesterday, we looked at the different places that we could go. And some of the types of out-of-body experiences that we might have, including how the makeup of our own consciousness, and our skill as a projector, can give us access to particular planes. What I want to talk about today is how our perception impacts our experience during the OBE itself. This is important because the way that we see things influences our impression of them. It's a bit like the puppeteer pulling the strings that shape our experience and thus our reality. If we become aware of the puppeteer, the way we perceive things, we take back the strings and in turn can have more clarity and control when we astral project. In order to explore this in the astral plane, we have to examine our everyday life first. How much of our day-to-day reality do we really perceive? Is what we see the whole truth, or are we merely seeing the smoke and mirrors of a deeper reality? One clue is in how we experience the world very differently to other animals. Dolphins and bats use echolocation, sound, to feel their environment. Bees use ultraviolet light to find flowers. Their whole world is like kind of purple. Also, dogs are partially colorblind and cannot recognize green, yellow, or red, but their smell is up to 100,000 times better than ours. Under perfect conditions, they've been reported to smell objects as far as 20 kilometers away. Can you imagine what your reality would look like if you couldn't see most of the colors in your room but you could smell the bacon sandwiches your neighbors were cooking around the corner. And even though we can see more colors than a dog, the vast majority of the light waves are not visible to the human eye. In fact, we can only see a tiny portion of the light spectrum. Ultraviolet light, infrared, microwaves, and x-rays are just some of the electromagnetic waves that are outside the human range. In fact, the room you're in right now is full of invisible light waves which you can prove just by turning the dial on your radio. That's right. Radio waves are simply light waves of a much lower frequency than the human eye can see. It's absolutely bonkers, isn't it? But reality may extend far beyond what even our scientific instruments can measure. Einstein knew this. He said, "It is entirely possible that behind the perception of our senses, worlds are hidden of which we are unaware." Everything we currently know about our world and the cosmos is based on less than 5% of it. All the information we have currently collated so far, our findings, from what we can see, the observable universe, we don't really know what the other 95% of it is, which is theorized to be dark energy or dark matter. So it's easy to assume that what we perceive out there in the world is what is really there, but it turns out, psychology has a role in shaping what we experience as well. Think about it. We see something, and then we have to make sense of it. What we see is often dependent on what we're looking for, and how we make sense of things is dependent on the makeup of our own psychology, our personal experience, our culture, and our religious views. A simple way to illustrate this is to look around the space you are in right now and notice how many blue objects you can see. I want you to do this; go for it now. Look around your room, and see how many blue things you can see. All directions: up, down, side to side, spot as many blue items as you can. Big ones, small ones, don't leave any out. Do you think you've seen them all? I'll give you three more seconds. Three, two, one. Okay, stop. Well done; I put you on the spot there. Now I'd like you to close your eyes. Now remember how many objects were red? Did you see any red objects? Probably not many, right? This is because you were searching for the blue ones. Okay, if you haven't already, open your eyes; I'm sorry for tricking you, but this is a really simple way to show you that what we look for will have a huge effect on what we notice and remember. This is true also in terms of how we feel. Have you ever finished watching a horror movie, and then every creak, bump, or rustle in the house can sound eerie. It can make you jump, right? If we're scared, our nervous system can interpret quite innocent sounds as alarming before we even get a chance to think about it. Imagine being with a friend who's scared of traveling to new places. Their fear means they're always on the lookout for danger. Their mind is full of thoughts like, what if the plane has a fault? What if I get lost when I arrive? What if someone tries to rob me? What if, what if, what if? Whilst you're enjoying the view out the window, they are busy double checking if the seatbelt works or reading the emergency evacuation procedures. You're both in the same place, having a totally different experience. But what's worse is that when the plane lands, your friend will unconsciously seek out threat where there isn't even any and even self-prophecize it into being. The writer Anais Nin named famously said, "We don't see things as they are. We see them as we are." And modern neuroscience is proving her right. Cognitive neuroscientist Anil Seth goes as far to say that our perception of reality is a kind of controlled hallucination determined to a large degree by what we expect and what we predict to be there. But how does all of this apply to astral projection? The same thing can happen with the astral planes, because our mind, our psychology, comes with us. Your personal beliefs can hijack your perception and totally transform what you notice, like the person who's scared of traveling, but it goes even deeper than that. Because the places we have access to are also somewhat dependent on the content of our consciousness. This is what frequency we operate on. This frequency can kind of resonate with what environment we then have access to. For example, people who believe in angels and demons are more likely to meet them because they are resonating on that plane. Robert Monroe called these belief system territories or consensus realities. You can check this out in his book Journeys Out of the Body if you want to find out more, but this is why it's handy to be aware of your own perception when visiting different planes. What I want to do now is to give you some tools that will help you to see more clearly and gain more control during astral travel. Because our sight can sometimes cause all sorts of problems. So first off, some people successfully leave their body but then find that their vision is blurred. Or it's like they're looking through a tunnel or they're even partially or fully blind. Here are three things you can do if this happens. The first is simply demand, "Clarity now." Simply being clear with what you want, and demanding it with energy and expectation, can influence your perception of the environment. The exact phrase doesn't really matter. It's the intention and the energy you put behind it. You could also try saying, "Awareness now." This is William Buhlman's technique. I've done this a few times when I've entered into my room but it's been complete darkness. The lights kind of lift up and phase into view, but sometimes it's still not crystal clear. So you can say, "Make it clearer." If that doesn't work, or if there's still some kind of block to the clarity of your perception, try to simply relax and tune in. Check if you notice any straining in your awareness and see if you can shift from doing to being, a bit like eating the peach, when we were talking about riding the vibrational plane. The second thing you can do is to try and draw energy from your physical body. This can be a bit of a risky strategy since thinking about the body can snap people back to it. So do this one gently. Simply intend to feel into your body, your physical one, and draw energy from it. It might feel like a kind of sucking sensation towards your current location. When you feel the energy coming into you, guide it towards your sense of perception, so where you would imagine your astral eyes to be. You can also use this technique if you feel stuck, heavy, or unable to move. If neither of these techniques work, check to see if you can perceive your environment using a different sense. Most of us in our society favor sight as their predominant way of navigating the world. But actually, some people can't see at all, and so they have to rely on their other senses. One of my students is completely blind, and he managed to have an out-of-body experience. Now he'd been trying for a while. And when he had one, he phoned me up, and he left me a message at four in the morning, going "Jade, Jade! I've had an out-of-body experience!" And I said, well, how did you feel it? How did you sense into it? And it was very much through all of his other senses, but he did manage to see some things. And there's a book by Kenneth Ring called "Mindsight." He did many studies on how blind people are able to have out-of-body experiences and not only how they can see, but how they can sense reality in other ways. So notice how much you can sense your surroundings with your inner knowing, or by feeling, or through insight. See if you can sense into where you are without just wanting to look visually for it. You can even try it now, let's just do this for a moment. Close your eyes. And just by listening, and feeling, and sensing, notice what information you can pick up about the room that you're in. Does it seem like you can feel how big the room is? And can you sense if there are other people there or not? Is there anything you notice that you may have not paid attention to before? Okay, opening the eyes. This is a great way to enhance your sensitivity and perception in day-to-day life as well as when leaving the body. Now that you know how to induce more clarity into your astral travel, let's talk about the other component, control. Sometimes when we leave the body, we find our movement is restricted. It might feel like it takes all of your energy to fly. You could even be suspended in midair or kind of stuck partially through a wall that you've tried to pass through. Either way, movement is limited, and you can't really go where you want. If this happens, start by reviewing your motivation for astral projection. If you have a really meaningful reason to want to leave the body, hold that in mind; it can help direct the experience and sometimes even shift you to another location out of that place of being stuck. Equally, it's worth letting go of expectations. It can seem like a paradox, but being clear with what we want, whilst unattached to getting it, can bring the experiences we want into fruition without forcing it. It's also a really powerful way just to live our lives. After all, we may be limiting what is possible by being too focused on what we think would be good for us. There may be experiences waiting for us out there that are beyond what we could even imagine. You might also find that you lose focus or concentration during the out-of-body experience and end up phasing back to the body or falling asleep. This can arise from doing the technique too passively. If this happens, try practicing at a different time of day when you would be more alert. An afternoon nap works perfectly fine for many people, but you could also try adjusting your position so you're not completely lying flat and you don't fall asleep. It's all a matter of trial and error, finding what works for you. If you're feeling any anxiety or fear during the OBE, do the Metta-Moment to calm yourself down. Remember, this is when we dropped into the heart space and changed from the lane of fear to love. You can then do the RAIN technique. Remember, recognize, accept, investigate, and non-attach. If you leave your physical body but find yourself energetically stuck somewhere such as in a wall, which has happened to me, try shifting your attention from the problem to the solution. Energy follows focus. So if you get too busy thinking about the wall and how stuck you are, you're probably going to stay there for longer. Instead, focus on your desired destination and where you want to go. This is called anchoring awareness. Concentrate on something you can see or an intent that you have. For now, let's say that we can see a garden gate. We're stuck in a wall, and there's a garden, and we can see a gate. In the same way that a cowboy would lasso the horse, I want you to hook your awareness onto the gate by focusing on it. Then pull yourself towards the gate with strong intent and will. Try to move there at the same time, a bit like you'd try to move your energy body out of your physical body; try and move out of the wall or wherever you're stuck. You should break out of where you are, and shift towards it, sometimes instantaneously. But if it doesn't work, you can always call on a helper, a guide. But finally, if you're not experiencing as much control over your experience as you would like, it's a great time to simply accept that, ultimately, we don't really have any control. Offer up your desire, and instead go with the flow of what is already happening. One time I got stuck half out of my body and half in. My energy legs were floating up, but the top half of my body was glued to the physical, which can happen sometimes. I tried all sorts of things in that instance to lift out, but none of it worked. So I just decided to accept the situation. And I ended up having a kind of out-of-body in-body experience. At the time I had toothache, so I was pulled to the area where I could feel the toothache. Didn't hurt, because I was in my energy body, not my physical one, but I decided to send healing energy to it whilst I was in this awkward position. And when I woke up, it had disappeared. I didn't have toothache anymore. I wouldn't have had that opportunity had I not released control of the situation. This is a useful perspective to take both whilst out of body and in body in our everyday life. Your actions for today: practice the anchoring awareness exercise in your everyday life. Now, this won't be experienced exactly the same as when you're in an OBE because it's in the physical world, not the non-physical world. But what I want you to do is that when you find yourself stuck in a situation, anchor your mind to an object, and then walk towards it, focus in on it completely with strong intent. Perhaps, you're stuck in a physical way. You're caught in a crowded busy place, maybe a shopping mall or a marketplace. Or maybe you're stuck in a more abstract way such as you're overwhelmed with emotion, or you're in a thought spiral. Wherever you are, if you feel stuck in any way, practice the anchoring awareness technique. Remember, when in the astral, you will gravitate towards it spontaneously. But when we do this in our everyday life, we want to physically walk towards the object instead. So put on your hat, and lasso that horse, and I will see you tomorrow.

LESSON 13: The Wake-Back-to-Bed Method
--------------------
<v ->Welcome back night yogis.</v> Today, I'm going to share a brilliant astral projection hack with you. It's a sure-fire way to accelerate your practice and a very popular tool among astral projectors. In fact, this technique is used in sleep laboratories across the world. It's actually proven to boost your chances of lucid dreaming, the dreams that you know you're dreaming, by about 2000%, and as we know, there are parallels between these two practices. This approach is also a super efficient way to increase your chances of being out of body too. It's called the wake back to bed method and it's dead easy to learn. Why use the wake back to bed method? So we've spoken about the hypnagogic now a few times, the state we experience just before we fall asleep, that transitory drowsy state, often accompanied by dreamlike displays as we drift off. Practicing our beditation after a period of sleep is much easier way to access the hypnagogic highway. So although you can practice at any time of day, the chances of entering the astral plane increases considerably if you try this after you've already had some sleep. This is because your body and mind isn't as tired, and you can enter the hypnagogic more quickly. So how do you do this exactly? It's super easy, and there's a few simple steps. Set your alarm; simply wake up at least two hours earlier than your usual wake up time. So let's say if you wake up at six normally, you would then wake up at four. If you often wake up at eight, you would then wake up at six. Schedule the time however you like, but make sure that it is at least two hours earlier than when you usually wake up. I know this might seem a bit disruptive, but stay with me on this; this technique significantly boosts your chances to astral project so it's well worth the disruption and the effort. Stay mindfully awake then. So when you wake up, for about 30 to 60 minutes, immerse yourself in an activity linked to astral projection. This could be reading a book, writing in your projection diary, meditating on your motivation, rehearsing even your chosen exit, or reviewing your notes from the course so far. It's important that you stay awake, but you're not wired. So avoid screen time; don't go on your phone; don't watch TV. So after about 30 minutes or 60, set your alarm for two or more hours time, whatever time you want to wake up to start your day. Then play the guided audio, and follow the instructions and the practice. It will take you through the three steps, mind awake body asleep state, vibrational state, and exit technique. Remember the tips and tools to prevent staying awake or falling asleep, and put some of these in place before you start the audio such as thinking about the position you're going to lie in and the way that your room's set up. A reminder here that your motivation is so important at this point because apathy is a big killer and can block progress at this stage. So when you are prompted in the audio to bring your intention and motivation to mind, really feel it in your body; it has to be strong, yet not too charged, too enthusiastic, so avoid feelings of tension or forcefulness; just take it easy. So we are going to do the wake back to bed method tonight, but you might like to do it at the weekend or when other work commitments and responsibilities are minimal so that the following day you've got a lie-in. For future practice, try setting aside one night a week to give this technique a go. Treat it like your astral projection date night with yourself. Don't forget to set your alarm two hours earlier. You might like to have a nightlight on in your room, not too bright so that it will keep you awake, but just very low, like a soft glow in the corner of the room. Some people find this comforting; others find that it stops them from falling asleep completely, so it kind of works for keeping them on that cusp, but it could be too distracting for you, and you might prefer the darkness. Do which you think would be best for you. You might like to consider buddying up with a friend, so you do the wake back to bed method together on the same night as each other. This peer support can add an extra layer of motivation and commitment. Plus, it's a fun thing to do with your friend or partner. Even if you live in separate houses, you can still get up at the same time and do the practice. Then in the morning, you can ring each other up and share your experiences. Decide what your immersive activity will be, and by your bed, have your projection diary ready and waiting just in case you need it. Your actions for today: practice the wake back to bed method with the guided audio. This is in the early morning, so prepare everything you need the night before: your audio, cushions, your projection diary, or any notes you need. Tomorrow, we will finish the week reviewing everything we've learnt so far as well as give you some additional option practice time. In the meantime, good luck, and I will see you on the other side.

====================

LESSON 13: Meditation - Wake Back to Bed & Choice of Exit - Option 1

Welcome back. I'm now going to guide you through some exercises to bring on the mind awake body, sleep state, and trigger the vibrational state. Before we begin, choose an exit technique you wish to practice for this session. You will be prompted to do it at the end. After this, the music will continue and eventually phase out, leaving you to continue your journey or wake up when you are ready. If at any point during the audio you feel vibrations or sense the time is right to exit the body, then go with your intuition. It's okay to steer away from the audio if you need to. 

Everyone's experience will be different, so release expectations, be open, and remember, there is no right or wrong. We're each finding our own way. What we're doing here is preparing our mind and body so that it becomes familiar with the wide spectrum of these states. Building the best habits for astral projection. You'll hear this sound after each exercise. This sound helps to bring us back if we have lost awareness. When we hear this sound, we do not open our eyes or move our body. We just bring our attention back to the task at hand and okay, then let's begin. For now, all we're going to do is just be where we are. Just noticing where we are right now. Perhaps take three deep belly breaths to settle our body mind. Then becoming aware of the space behind the neck, feeling the length of the spine in our back, noticing the weight of our hips sitting within our body, feeling the legs touch the bed chair or ground arms hanging at the sides of us, hands and fingers loose at the end. Bringing our attention to the texture of the clothes or blankets, touching the skin and sensing the space around the body. Noticing the physical edges of ourselves, the boundary of our being. 

Just tuning into any feelings we might have in this moment, not needing to change or do anything about them, just being aware of how we feel right now. And lastly, in our own way, feeling the connection to the earth and the support we gain from it. Let's set a general intention here for the mind to be awake and aware and for the body to become completely relaxed. Maybe we could bring our personal motivation to mind here, our purpose, our reason why we are practicing astral projection. We allow our intention and motivation to drop into our awareness like a pebble sinking in water, 

Letting our intention go. Now let's shift our attention to the breath. In a moment, we are going to tense each body part using our muscles from feet to head. Holding each limb for a few seconds. We do not tense any place where we feel pain or have an injury. Instead, we might like to scan our attention over this area. Let's tense as strongly as we can for maximum relaxation effect. So we are going to begin by squeezing our feet. Now curl a toe, squeeze the feet, squeeze the feet, squeeze the feet, and relax. Great start is as easy as that. Now let's move on to the next limb. Next we are going to the lower leg below the knee, our calf area. So tensing the lower leg now tensing, tensing, tensing, and completely relax, allowing any remain intention to dissolve a way into the ether. 

Next, we are going to to the upper leg, our thighs. So flexing the upper legs now flexing, flexing, flexing and release, letting the muscles melt into a soft goo. Very good. Now we are moving onto our hips and bottom, clenching the muscles here, drawing everything in, holding it, holding it, holding it, and let go, allowing the hips and bottom to soften on the inside and out. Next, we are moving to our chest and stomach. Can we tense them both together? Give it a go. Tensing, tensing, tensing and completely relax, letting the muscles lift away floating softly where they are. 

Now we are moving to our arms, both the upper and lower arm, squeezing the muscles here as much as we can. Now, squeezing, squeezing, squeezing, and relax. Let the arms just fall limp at the sides. Next, we are moving to our hands and fingers. Clenching the hand into a fist as though we are gripping onto something. Clenching here. Now clenching, clenching, clenching and release. Let the fingers uncurl and return to their natural position. Now we are moving to the shoulders, lifting the shoulders up to the ears and tensing. Here tense the whole area as much as you can. Tensing, tensing, tensing. That's it. And completely relax, allowing them to drop back down to where they were. 

Next, we are going to move on to our faith. Keeping the eyes closed. Let's see if we can lift our eyebrows as high as we can. Lifting the eyebrows to wrinkle the forehead. Now lifting, lifting, lifting, and let them go. Allowing them to drop back down to their natural position. Now we are moving to our eyes, keeping them closed, but scrunching them shut and holding them here. Holding, holding, and release. Let the eyes soften and float gently in the sockets. Next, we are moving onto our lips, cheeks, and jaw. Let's tense these areas by pulling a grumpy face like we're trying to reach our chin to our forehead. Reaching, reaching, reaching and relax. Relax all the facial muscles now, including the jaw. And we might like to let the jaw hang freely here, open slightly, maybe peel the tongue away from the roof of the mouth and encourage this whole area to gently soften. And finally, after my count of three, we are going to tense all the body parts all together, everything at once as best we can. Ready? 1, 2, 3. Squeeze in the feet, legs, hips, belly, chest, arms, hands, shoulders, face, all together. One last time. Now as much as we can hold it. There you are. Doing great. Tensing, tensing, tensing and completely relax. Every fiber in your being becomes lighter and lighter. Muscles dissolve away like they are melting into the face of the earth. 

Noticing the inhale and the exhale. Becoming aware of how the air passes through the nose or mouth and the rise and fall off the chest, the air coming and going in its own way. 

In a moment, we will do a breathing exercise called the 4 7, 8 breath. This method involves breathing in quietly for four through the nose, holding for seven, and releasing out forcefully for eight through the mouth. Like we are trying to make a wishing sound with our lips as we blow the air out. Don't worry too much about reaching these numbers, just do what you can. I will guide this for a few minutes. Okay, let's begin after our next exhale. Breathing out. Now I'm breathing in for 1, 2, 3, 4, and holding here, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7. Slowly release. 4, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1. That's it. Breathing in again, 2, 3, 4. And holding here, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7. Slowly out, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and eight. Breathing in again, big belly breath, 2, 3, 4, holding if we can, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7. Slowly release out. 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8. Breathe in in again. That's good. Three, four, and holding. 3, 4, 5, 6, 7. Slowly release, pushing out every bit of air. 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8. And again, 2, 3, 4, and holding. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7. Releasing out 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and eight last time. Deep breath in. Fill in all the bones in the body with air. 2, 3, 4, and holding. 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7. Releasing out. Squeezing out every drop of air. 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and ate. Well done, allowing the breath to return to its natural state. Now 

Let's now call on our circle of allies, an exercise in which we invite a gathering of fearless and loving protectors to join our journey. Who might our allies be? Anyone or anything that offers us a feeling of love, safety, allegiance, and protection. Our protectors can be living or dead, real or unreal, known or unknown, such as friends, family, animals, ancestors, deities, or spirit guides. We can decide on and invite in which ones we are going to call on. Now, imagine that our allies are surrounding us. We might like to imagine four principle allies standing to the north, south, east, and west of us. Feel free to fill in the gaps with as many others as you like. So you are surrounded by love and protection, knowing that our circle of allies will remain with us and that we can call upon them whenever we wish. Let's release the visualization of them now. Now either out loud or in your head, I'd like to invite you to repeat the following affirmation after me, we will do this twice. Ready? I awaken the ability of astral projection to be in service of myself and others. I do this with courage and compassion. I awaken the ability of astral projection to be in service of myself and others. I do this with courage and compassion. Nothing to do now, nowhere to go. Just rest 

To drifting in our own time into the hypnogogic state. With each outbreath, we relax deeper and deeper into a wider awareness, leaving any bodily sensations behind. For now, remembering you can come back to the body at any time, but for now, letting it go completely relaxed, completely supported, and completely safe. Notice how relaxed you feel and how good it is to be this relaxed your mind. Aware your body becoming weightless as it falls. Fast asleep. Staying mindfully aware whilst your body lies in space. Maintaining that soft awareness allow your focus now to dissolve away any sensations with the body. Completely relaxed, completely supported, completely safe. Although you are deeply relaxed and maybe quite drowsy, I invite you to stay fully aware. Letting go of any remaining bodily sensations, but staying mindfully alert, remembering you can come back to the body at any point you would like to, but for now, letting it go, we might like to let it go on the outbreath. And with this outbreath, we drop deeper and deeper into a relaxed state. And if we think we're fully relaxed, let's encourage ourselves to let go even more. Tell yourself it's time to let go. 

If your mind drifts off, just anchor it back to the black or grayness behind your eyes or anything you can see or sense in your awareness. Just noticing what's there. And if we notice nothing, that's okay too. Two, we're like a calm observer. Being aware of where we are, paying attention to any imagery that may appear, sounds we might hear, or feelings we might have no need to judge or interpret what we notice. Just being with what is. Is there a quality to what you can see or a texture to what you can feel? Not striving to find these things. Simply seeing what's there. If your thoughts drift to the past or future, just bring your mind back to whatever is happening in the present moment. Even if it's nothing, be with the nothingness. For the next couple of minutes, allow yourself to drop deeply into the hypnogogic state. And if you fall asleep, that's fine. Maybe it's what your body and mind needs. Just gently riding the hypnogogic highway and noticing what passes you by 

In this peaceful state, you notice in your mind's eye a flickering dot far in the distance. It looks or feels like a tiny speck of light, and it's slowly floating towards you. As it gets closer, you see or feel that it's a beautiful, pure white light. You know that somehow it's come to age your journey. It drifts nearer sparkling with crystal clear rays of light, and you begin to notice that it beams with a powerful energy. Perhaps you can sense this energy, hear it, see it, or feel it. And as it gets closer, you can sense a healing vibrational quality to it. Don't worry if you can't clearly see or sense it. Just tap into the white light in any way that feels natural to you. As it makes its way over becoming bigger and bigger, you start to feel energy radiating from it. You sense that it's safe and welcoming. How does this feel? Much closer. Now the light has become bigger, and you notice that at its core it carries a powerful charge. As it travels towards you, you begin to feel into its magnetic quality. It drifts closer and closer, becoming bigger and bigger until finally, it pauses right in front of you. You have a good feeling about it, and you are open to what it has to offer. Slowly the white light begins to pour into you through your forehead, just above your brow, opening up your innate perception. It's a gateway to your higher consciousness. Feel this powerful, pure white light flooding your body and being. 

Imagine the light enters all your cells, clearing out any restrictions or blocks that might be holding you back from astral travel. The wonderful light weaves in and out of every fiber, every muscle, releasing all the doubts and all the fears, which simply dissolve away. Feel your limitations leaving your body and mind by being absorbed into the pure white light. You notice the light begins to travel down your legs towards your feet, gathering all its energy. In along the way. It begins to pulsate at your feet like a sound wave. Vibrations penetrating through like a speaker at your toes. Feel this vibration reverberate through your feet. 

This wave of vibration begins to travel up your body now like a strong tide, pulling in and out of the shore. Feel it past their ankles, calves, knees, thighs, hips, stomach, arms, chest, shoulders, neck and head. Before ricocheting, back down the body from the head, neck, shoulders, chest, arms, stomach, hips, thighs, knees, calves, ankles, and feet like a laser beam scanning your body. Now this wave of energy begins to travel back up again past the calves, knees, thighs, hips, stomach, chest, arms, shoulders, neck and head where it reverberates back down again from the head, neck, shoulders, chest, arms, stomach, hips, thighs, knees, calves, ankles, and feet. Feel into the wave of vibration, getting stronger and stronger, faster and faster. As it makes its way up and down the body from head to toe, feet, ankles, calves, knees, thighs, hips, stomach, arms, chest, shoulders, neck, head, neck, shoulders, chest, arms, stomach, hips, thighs and knees, calves, ankles, feet. You know it's safe. So you surrender to the vibrations and they become stronger and stronger, up and down and up and down it goes. Continue to whip the wave up and down your body in your own time. Now becoming faster and faster. Vibrations more and more. More and more. 

Feel it pinballing back and forth, back and forth, shooting up and down and up and down the body. Ever increasing in power and speed. Pulsations powering stronger and stronger and stronger. Becoming so fast, so strong, so intense. Now that this wave of energy and golfs your whole body with vibration, feel it flooding your entire being. Encourage the vibrations to become more and more. Then intuitively follow them out of the body or do your chosen exit technique. Encourage the vibrations to become more and more. Then intuitively follow them out of the body, or do your chosen exit technique and then go on your journey With no sense of rush, it is time to come back to the body. Now, back to the physical world. That's it. Make your way. Remember, you can return any time you wish, but for now, it's time to come back to everyday reality with full recall and all senses intact. Make your way back now. Follow the sound of my voice and bring your awareness back to the body. Anything you can see or sense in your physical world, you might like to wriggle your fingers and toes, or take a nice stretch when you are ready, gently opening the eyes. Welcome back. Take a moment to recall your experience and note it down in your diary. I'll see you again soon.

Then becoming aware of the space behind the neck, feeling the length of the spine in our back, noticing the weight of our hips sitting within our body, feeling the legs touch the bed chair or ground arms hanging at the sides of us, hands and fingers loose at the end. Bring bringing our attention to the texture of the clothes, all blankets, touching the skin and sensing the space around the body. Noticing the physical edges of ourselves, the boundary of our being. 

Just tuning into any feelings we might have in this moment, not needing to change or do anything about them, just being aware of how we feel right now. And lastly, in our own way, feeling the connection to the earth and the support we gain from it. Let's set a general intention here for the mind to be awake and aware and for the body to become completely relaxed. Maybe we could bring our personal motivation to mind here, our purpose, our reason why we are practicing astral projection. We allow our intention and motivation to drop into our awareness like a pebble sinking in water, letting our intention go. Now, let's shift our attention to the breath, noticing the inhale and the exhale. Becoming aware of how the air passes through the nose or mouth and the rise and fall off the chest, the air coming and going in its own way. 

In a moment, we will do a breathing exercise called the 4 7, 8 breath. This method involves breathing in quietly for four through the nose, holding for seven, and releasing out forcefully for eight through the mouth like we are trying to make a wishing sound with our lips as we blow the air out. Don't worry too much about reaching these numbers, just do what you can. I will guide this for a few minutes. Okay, let's begin after our next exhale. Breathing out now and breathing in for 1, 2, 3, 4, and holding here, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7. Slowly release. 4, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1. That's it. Breathing in again, 2, 3, 4, and hold in here, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7. Slowly out, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and eight. Breathing in again, big belly breath, 2, 3, 4, holding if we can, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7. Slowly release out allier. 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8. Breathe in in again. That's good. Three, four, and holding. 3, 4, 5, 6, 7. Slowly release, pushing out every bit of air. 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and again, 2, 3, 4, and holding. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. Serve and releasing out. 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and eight last time. Deep breath in filling all the bones in the body with air. 2, 3, 4, and holding. 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7. Releasing out, squeezing out every drop of air. 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and eight. Well done allowing the breath to return to its natural state. Now 

Let's now call on our circle of allies, an exercise in which we invite a gathering of fearless and loving protectors to join our journey. Who might our allies be? Anyone or anything that offers us a feeling of love, safety, allegiance, and protection. Our protectors can be living or dead, real or unreal, known or unknown, such as friends, family, animals, ancestors, deities, or spirit guides. We can decide on and invite in which ones we are going to call on. Now, imagine that our allies are surrounding us. We might like to imagine four principle allies standing to the north, south, east, and west of us. Feel free to fill in the gaps with as many others as you like, so you are surrounded by love and protection. 

Knowing that our circle of allies will remain with us and that we can call upon them whenever we wish. Let's release the visualization of them now. Now either out loud or in your head, I'd like to invite you to repeat the following affirmation after me, we will do this twice. Ready? I awaken the ability of astral projection to be in service of myself and others. I do this with courage and compassion. I awaken the ability of astral projection to be in service of myself and others. I do this with courage and compassion. Nothing to do now, nowhere to go. Just rest, drifting in our own time into the hypnogogic state. With each outbreath, we relax deeper and deeper into a wider awareness, leaving any bodily sensations behind. For now, remembering you can come back to the body at any time, but for now, letting it go completely relaxed, completely supported, and completely safe. Notice how relaxed you feel and how good it is to be this relaxed your mind. Aware your body becoming weightless as it falls. Fast asleep. Sleep. Staying mindfully aware whilst your body lies in space. Maintaining that soft awareness, allow your focus now to dissolve away any sensations with the body, 

Completely relaxed, completely supported, completely safe. Although you are deeply relaxed and maybe quite drowsy, I invite you to stay fully aware, letting go of any remaining bodily sensations, but stay mindfully alert, remembering you can come back to the body as any point you would like to, but for now, letting it go. We might like to let it go on the outbreath, and with this out breath, we drop deeper and deeper into a relaxed state, and if we think we're fully relaxed, let's encourage ourselves to let go even more. Tell yourself it's time to let go. If your mind drifts off, just anchor it back to the black or grayness behind your eyes or anything you can see or sense in your awareness. Just noticing what's there, and if we notice nothing, that's okay too. We're like a calm observer. Being aware of where we are, paying attention to any imagery that may appear, sounds we might hear, or feelings we might have no need to judge or interpret what we notice. Notice just being with what is. Is there a quality to what you can see or a texture to what you can feel? Not striving to find these things. Simply seeing what's there. 

If your thoughts drift to the past or future, just bring your mind back to whatever is happening in the present moment. Even if it's nothing, be with the nothingness. For the next couple of minutes, allow yourself to drop deeply into the hypnogogic state, and if you fall asleep, that's fine. Maybe it's what your body and mind needs. Just gently riding the hypnogogic highway and noticing what passes you by 

In this peaceful state, you notice in your mind's eye a flickering dot far in the distance. It looks or feels like a tiny speck of light, and it's slowly floating towards you. As it gets closer, you see or feel that it's a beautiful, pure white light. You know that somehow it's come to age your journey. It drifts nearer sparkling with crystal clear rays of light, and you begin to notice that it beams with a powerful energy. Perhaps you can sense this energy, hear it, see it, or feel it, and as it gets closer, you can sense a healing vibrational quality to it. Don't worry if you can't clearly see your sunset, just tap into the white light in any way that feels natural to you. 

As it makes its way over becoming bigger and bigger, you start to feel energy radiating from it. You sense that it's safe and welcoming. How does this feel? Much closer. Now the light has become bigger, and you notice that at its core it carries a powerful charge. As it travels towards you, you begin to feel into its magnetic quality. It drifts closer and closer, becoming bigger and bigger until finally, it pauses right in front of you. You have a good feeling about it, and you are open to what it has to offer. Slowly, the white light begins to pour into you through your forehead, just above your brow, opening up your innate perception. It's a gateway to your higher consciousness. Feel this powerful pure white light flooding your body and being. Imagine the light enters all your cells, clearing out any restrictions or blocks that might be holding you back from astral travel. The wonderful light weaves in and out of every fiber, every muscle, releasing all the doubts and all the fears which simply dissolve away. Feel your limitations leaving your body and mind by being absorbed into the pure white light. You notice the light begins to travel down your legs towards your feet, gathering all its energy. In along the way. It begins to pulsate at your feet like a sound wave. Vibrations penetrating through like a speaker at your toes. Feel this vibration ate through your feet. 

This wave of vibration begins to travel up your body now like a strong tide, pulling in and out of the shore. Feel it past their ankles, calves, knees, thighs, hips, stomach, arms, chest, shoulders, neck and head. Before ricocheting, back down the body from the head, neck, shoulders, chest, arms, stomach, hips, thighs, knees, calves, ankles, and feet like a laser beam scanning your body. Now this vibrating wave of energy begins to travel back up again past the calves, knees, thighs, hips, stomach, chest, arms, shoulders, neck and head where it reverberates back down again from the head, neck, shoulders, chest, arms, stomach, hips, thighs, knees, calves, ankles, and feet. Feel into the wave of vibration, getting stronger and stronger, faster and faster. As it makes its way up and down the body from head to toe, feet, ankles, calves and knees, thighs, hips, stomach, arms, chest, shoulders, neck, head, neck, shoulders, chest, arms, stomach, hips, thighs and knees, calves, ankles, feet. You know it's safe, so you surrender to the vibrations and they become stronger and stronger, up and down and up and down it goes. Continue to whip the wave up and down your body in your own time. Now becoming faster and faster. Vibrations more and more. More and more. 

Feel it pinballing back and forth, back and forth, shooting up and down and up and down the body. Ever increasing in power and speed. Pulsations powering stronger and stronger and stronger. Becoming so fast, so strong, so intense. Now that this wave of energy engulfs your whole body with vibration, feel it flooding your entire being. Encourage the vibrations to become more and more. Then intuitively follow them out of the body or do your chosen exit technique. Encourage the vibrations to become more and more. Then intuitively follow them out of the body or do your chosen exit technique and then go on your journey With no sense of rush, it is time to come back to the body. Now, back to the physical world. That's it. Make your way. Remember, you can return any time you wish, but for now, it's time to come back to everyday reality with full recall and all senses intact. Make your way back now. Follow the sound of my voice and bring your awareness back to the body. Anything you can see or sense in your physical world, you might like to wriggle your fingers and toes or take a nice stretch when you are ready, gently opening the eyes. Welcome back. Take a moment to recall your experience and note it down in your diary. I'll see you again soon.

LESSON 14: Summary of Your Second Week
--------------------
<v ->Well done on completing week two.</v> We have now learned the three fundamental steps to self-induce an out-of-body experience. These are the mind awake body asleep state, the vibrational state, and exiting the body. Not only that, but we've learned how to approach different planes, navigate the multiverse, and gain more clarity and control, if needed. We've begun to tune into different states, train new habits, and fill our toolbox with different techniques. Now it's a case of trial and error, finding the right method that works for us, and honing our skills. Practice, practice, practice. As part of practice, we need to balance work with play. Otherwise, the mind can become too clingy, too rigid and grasping, for the OBE to happen, which can generate some tension within our consciousness and cause a bit of a roadblock. To soften this straining and free friction from our mind, I'd like you to do an awe-walk today. Awe is one of the most commonly reported emotions felt during astral projection. It's associated with the gamma brainwave, heightened levels of focus, and it expands perspective. It creates an opening in consciousness for wider possibilities. Plus, it's scientifically proven to increase well-being, so win-win all 'round. Awe can be defined as an overwhelming feeling of reverence mixed with fear and wonder. It's often produced by an experience in nature, of which feels vast and mysterious, sacred, sublime, or beyond our conceptual understanding. You might have felt it holding a newborn baby, or watching someone complete a marathon, visiting a beautiful landscape, or staring out at the vastness of the ocean or the starry night sky. In these experiences, we often feel small in the grand scheme of things, and it's this that connects us to something larger. There's a tremendous openness and freedom that comes when you consider yourself a speck of dust in the middle of the universe, or a grain of sand on an expansive beach. You don't stand in the way of anything. You don't overcrowd or obstruct yourself. Instead of trying to be all that, you're humbled by the spaciousness and the smallness. Yet at the same time, you feel bigger than life. Studies show that in an awe state, you feel the presence of something larger than you. You're engaged with the expansiveness of the external world, focused less on yourself and more on others which takes your mind off burdens, trials and tribulations, your worries, anxieties, and frustrations. Whilst these kind of macro-awe experiences can be very powerful, micro-awe is something that we can mindfully cultivate into our normal lives. So let's make every day awe-some. Here's how we can do it. Normally, if someone does an awe-walk, you would go to somewhere awe-inspiring, such as forest, a desert, a beach, or a huge mountain, and I encourage you to definitely do that. But we're going to aim to see awe in the everyday. So I'd like you to go to a garden, a park, a cafe, maybe a busy street, or even when you ride public transport. I'd like you to turn off your phone and tune your awareness outwards into your environment. Watch people walk by. Become aware of the details in things. Maybe pick an area in a garden or a cafe, and look at the intricacies of things such as leaves or the patterns in coffee. Dedicate at least 10 minutes to mindfully observing your senses, and notice how you feel in your body in that moment. Awe often starts as a subtle feeling around your bellybutton. If you pay attention to it, mindfully, you can expand and deepen this sensation. It's a bit like a meditation practice. But bring attention to what seduces your curiosity and attracts your senses outwardly. This could be the symmetrical patterns of colorful flowers, the fractal branching shapes of large trees, the perceptual vastness of the distant horizon, or the golden light after a sunrise or before sunset. The feel and the flow of the breeze or the symphony of bird songs. Even the rain falling on your face, hundreds of feet from the sky. The laughter of children playing, or the power of engines making machines work, or the hustle and bustle of many people on their day's journey. Set an intention to let go of the analytical mind's compulsive labeling of things, and explore more how your environment makes you feel by observing the felt presence in your body. When we ground ourselves in this sense of feeling and aliveness in our bodies, we can awaken a childlike sense of wonder, a mystery of all that we don't know and understand, rather than focusing on what we think we already know. These awe-walks can be powerful experiences for relaxing the mind and helping our bodies recharge. In fact, there's a lot of research showing that cultivating awe and a childlike sense of wonder and curiosity can improve our mood and make us feel more satisfied with life. It can decrease our rumination by making us feel smaller and more humble. It can expand our perception of time, make us feel less rushed, can restore our attention span, and enhance our creative thinking. It can also increase pro-social behaviors, like generosity and kindness. You also begin to notice all sorts of little miracles around you, like how bumblebees can fly. They shouldn't be able to do it! Their bums are too big, and their wings are too small! When I first noticed this, I looked up a picture, and it made me laugh so much. Aerodynamically, they shouldn't be able to fly, but they can! They're like a flying beach ball! So your action for today is to connect to a sense of childlike wonder through doing a 10 minute awe-walk. Of course, it can be longer if you really want to go for it. And of course, keep practicing the techniques we've learnt so far, whichever ones you feel you'd need a bit more practice with, and I'll see you next week.

LESSON 14: The Art of Astral Projection Live Experience Bonus Call #2: Exiting the Body and Exploring the Astral Realms

Welcome to your live experience for the Art of Astral Projection with Jade Shaw. This is call number two, exiting the body fly into the astral realms. Welcome, everyone. Welcome to our new platform for these live calls. As you guys can see, there's a chat in the top right corner here. I see everyone's already tuning in. Hey, Adam from Missouri, Vonda from Toronto, Katie from Birkhamstead. Welcome, everyone. You can use this chat to interact with each other. Also, right next to the chat is a Q &A. So we are going to be doing a live Q &A with Jade, second half of the call. So you can put your questions in there and make sure you upvote your fellow students' questions, the questions you really want to hear the answers for. We're going to be bringing on the most upvoted questions, the most upvoted questions onto the call to Ask Jade. And we are going to get started in just a minute. Jade Shaw is coming live from London. I'm going to bring Jade on now. Welcome to the call, Jade. Hello, everybody. Lovely to see you. I'm looking at your messages and where all of you are from all over the world. So it's wonderful to be here with you, beaming in in the digital realm from London. So hey, hey, everybody. Okay, so we've got more people turning up, more people showing up from Berlin, London, India, Los Angeles. South Africa, Ukraine, Toronto, the Philippines, Canada, Lithuania, we're all coming in now. Do you know what this reminds me of? All these beautiful countries and places around the world. It reminds me of the places we are kind of attempting to go in. the astral realm so this week's theme is all about the astral realms these non -physical realities dimensions realms these places where we can go once we've had an out -of -body experience when we're in it when we've left the body and we finally can explore where we are so i wanted to give a bit of a reminder of what we've been doing in regards to looking at the astral realms and also maybe share a couple of questions that i commonly get asked that might be useful for you so Let's start with something huge and zone down and into our own experiences. So I want to start with the multiverse. Now, we don't have a lot of time, so I'm just going to keep it quite simple. And then if you want to ask some details, we can go into that in the Q &A. So the multiverse is this mesmeric idea that we... Earth, our galaxy, our universe is actually part of a bigger multiverse, this huge, vast expanse of other dimensions, other realms, other levels of reality that exist and may exist simultaneously with our reality. So in most religions, spiritual traditions around the world, they all have, even though they're very different in some respects, they all have some iteration of the multiverse. Some call it the spirit world. Others call it the imaginal realms. Others, some call it the afterlife. But effectively, they all say on some level, yes. There are these other places that we can go to when we go and turn inwards and have astral projection experiences. So there are thousands of different layers and levels of places where we could go. So you might be thinking, well, oh my gosh, where do I start? Where should I go? This directly relates to your projection plan, your intention. What do you want to do when you have an out -of -body experience and why do you want to do it? Now remember, the why, the motivation is the most important thing because your reason, your purpose for doing this practice is heavily going to correlate with the way you go and where you end up. And this is because the places in which we go to that we enter into are not necessarily completely separate from our own consciousness, excuse me, our own psyche. So I spoke a bit about this when I spoke about this idea of a prism. So it's a bit like... We are a prism, a triangle, and all of the things that make us, all the messy parts of us, all the magnificent parts, all the juicy bits in between, we are all of this wonderful, lovely, little conscious triangle. And we might like to think that... is light coming into this prism. And then as the light expands out, it goes into all of this beautiful rainbow of places. And depending on where we are operating, our own consciousness, our intentions, the makeup of our own psyche, depends on what planes of existence we then correlate with in terms of where we can go. So this depends on our belief systems, our spiritual journey, wherever we're at. And we don't have to be spiritual to be on it. deep journey and then our intention of where we want to go and this brings me to the different i'm going to just point out three types of realities dimensions so i'm not going to go into all of the different sorts of obe's but actually the types of realities that can correlate with our own conscious mind and experience so we have objective reality experiences meaning we can come out of our body into the same room that we're in our everyday reality and then we can go and find a door number or we can go visit a friend or see a place come back to our body and then go and verify it by getting telling our friend what they was up to i'm going to tell a funny story here i'm not sure if it's a the right one to share because it's a bit naughty but i think you'll like it so one of my case studies for my research um who's called paul he was at university at the time he came out of his body into his university dorm room and he thought i'm gonna go visit my friend you know just for fun see what they're up to he went to visit his friend and his friend was um getting intimate let's say with a young lady and then he was like oh gosh i you know i shouldn't I walked into this room. So he came out straight away, very embarrassed, went back to his own room, back to his body. And then he visited his friend in the physical. He went to see him and he said, was you with such and such young lady at this time? And his friend was like, yes. How did you know? In which case. He then had to explain himself. But this is an example of an objective reality experience where we come out into our everyday world, let's say the physical plane. And so we can also have subjective reality experiences. Now, these ones are more intertwined with our own psyche. So you've done the two days of soul retrieval and the shadow work. So if we enter into a reality that seems somewhat reflective of a part of ourselves, that seems separate, but we might get an inner knowing that actually there is something here that needs to be healed, a part of myself which needs to be integrated, made whole again. This could be a subjective... experience so something that's more tied in with our own psyche rather than seemingly separate the third one is now this is where it gets freaky this is where it gets weird in which case i love it so you can have inter subjective experiences now this is when people with the same belief systems the same perhaps collective history, the same culture can tap into and access the same collective spaces in these non -physical realms. This is what Robert Monroe from the Monroe Institute called consensus realities, or they're also known as belief system territories. So let's say you have three people from the same religion who believe in the same place. So I'm just going to choose Tibetan Buddhism because it's i know the most um so there might be this place called the pure realms which apparently is a place of enlightenment purity um beyond concepts beyond the mind beyond ourself beyond ego basically kind of like a bit of a heavenly place so People that are practicing Buddhists may have access to this place because it's a collective place that they all believe they all have this, they're in frequency in tune with. It's kind of the same if you have a Christian heaven or a Muslim heaven. It's the same sort of thing. So there's this idea of intersubjectiveness. which also means you can have shared experiences with other people. So if you both have the same shared culture, history, religion, or you just both decide to visit the same place. So you could have two people go and visit a beautiful temple in Mexico, and you could both try to visit there at the same time. This is an intersubjective shared... out -of -body experience. Now, I'm not going to get too deep, okay, because we've already spoke about objective realities, subjective realities, and inter -subjective realities. Now, within the spectrum of those spaces, there's all sorts of things in between, and I'm going to drop a couple of things, and then I'm going to leave it there, because this will have more questions than anything. Here's where it gets quantum, where you get quantum out -of -body experiences. You could come out of your body into the objective reality and see the room as it is. The top of that, you might be able to tune into a different timeline. So I might be in my room, but my room and my house might be in the 18th century. So I could see two overlapping realities at the same time. This happened to me once. I came out of my body, flew out the window and went into the park and I could see cars going by and people moving around. But I was able to see what may have been under the being or a spirit, however we want to interpret it. It was something that else was in the space, in the park. And I was so excited. I was like, oh my gosh, I'm going to go over and interact. interact with this being in this space and I did and I had a wonderful exchange which was um which was actually quite hilarious it was quite a the the energy of the being or the spirit of whatever it may have been was very playful and and very humorous it's one of my most playful experiences um but I could see this being at the same time as I was seeing people operating in their everyday reality so this is what I mean about Are these places we go to actually far away in terms of space and time? Or are they intersubjective, interdimensional, operating simultaneously at the same time? If they are, because this is a theory, we don't know this 100 % for sure, but it certainly seems this way with what people report. If this is the case, this means you have the power to project into and tune into any one of these realities that may align with your projection plan and what you want to go and do. Now. Moving on from here, how does our projection plan actually interact with the space? How does it affect kind of where we go when we do have an intention? So if you've had an intention, you meditate on it, you make sure you know it really well. Let's just say my intention is to experience another reality, experience another reality other than our everyday one. Let's just say that's my intention. When I have my outer body experience, before I've done a thing, before I've even had time to think or blink an eye. an astral eye i might enter into that reality already and this is because remembering that space and time doesn't operate in the same way in the astral experience because we've had that strong intention we've called out for it we've made it part of our um this is what we want to manifest this is where we want to go we might find ourselves already in that space already connected with that place when we enter so you might not find yourself in your room in your everyday reality you might find yourself already entering into the place you want to go in which case amazing Fantastic. You don't need to make an effort to go there. You're already there. The other way that your projection plan can interact with where you go is that you might come out of your body. be in the same space your room but then actually manually need to go there in a very linear fashion in the same way you'd come out your house and you'd walk to work or you'd go pick the kids up you'd need to go there in a very linear fashion which means you need to fly there so sometimes you have to go there in the way that we do in everyday life other times you come out of your body in your room You call out where you want to go. You think where you want to go. And you immediately teleport there. Like in Star Trek, where they beam back up to the Starship Enterprise and they beam back down to a planet. So any of these three things could happen when you have your intention and your projection plan. I just wanted to point that out so that you knew that if one of those things occurs, they're all right. It would just be unique to you and where you're currently at in your practice. So these are the projection plans that could happen. I'm just going to have a quick look at my notes. Aha. OK, yes. Now, you're in your place where you want to go or you might be somewhere completely different. Either way, you're in some kind of dimension realm or everyday physical world. How well you access what you want to go and do depends on how experienced you are as an astral projector. And what I mean by that is how well have we learned the practices? I'll give one example. The RAIN technique, which we learn in how to steady our environment and be able to access it. RAIN being recognize where you are, accept. the place you're in, investigate with detailed attention and then non -attachment. So don't get too attached to where you are and start spinning stories in your mind about it. So if we come out of the body and you're a mature, an experienced astral projector, you will naturally do the RAIN technique to calm your emotions and to be in that space to accept it. Once you've done that, you can then navigate where you are. This is one of the ways we control how we have the experience. You cannot control the space in the same way that we can't control life and we can't control what happens to us. We can only control how we react to it and how we are able to navigate. It's the same thing. So our success. In these other worlds, these other realms, it's largely determined by how much we've practiced the tools and the techniques, which you've got now in your bag, that they've become a habit. So then when we have an out -of -body experience, we can navigate it very easily and with a lot more control. I want to add one more thing before I hand back over to Ezra. This is very important. probably will change the way you think if you have had an out -of -body experience when you have your next one. There are billions of potentialities, possible dimensions and realms which we could access, right? Because there are unlimited, eternal capacities of mind, of space, of time. Why would you, if you came out of your body... go into that specific realm of all of the ones that you could access. Why that one? Especially if you feel it doesn't relate to your projection plan, you think, well, why am I here? This doesn't seem like the place where I wanted to go or the person I wanted to see. Why am I here? Almost always, not all the time. But I'd say about 95 % of the time, there is a reason, a purpose, why you are being taken or you're accessing that astral realm in particular. So even if it appears maybe quite dark or perhaps quite awe -inspiring or quite heavenly, however you feel about the space, know this. There is a reason why you are there. There will be some insight, a message or wisdom for you to take away from it. Or you might have actually been called upon to be in service of someone or something else in that space. So you might be able to help someone else that is there. So I want you to, if there's one thing you remember of all this very short... Short space of time, talk about the multiverse. That's that one thing. There's a reason why you're there and there's something for you to take away or something for you to give in the astral realm. OK, so you probably got more questions than than since what we've been talking about. So I'm going to hand over to Ezra. We're going to hear some stories, I think, and then we'll go into questions. Awesome. Thank you so much, Jade. Great tips and teachings of the last couple of weeks. We do. We have a couple of students that have actually had astral projection experiences, and we would love to bring them on to share their experiences so far. So I'm going to bring on first Shamath to share his experience. Welcome to the call, Shamath. Shamath, it looks like we can't hear your audio. We can't hear your audio. Let me try bringing you back. In the meantime, we'll bring up Maria. Welcome to the call, Maria. Can you hear me? Okay. Well, hi. Thank you. Hi, everybody. Thank you for having me. I'd like to share my experience I had actually last week. In the past, I think in the call one, I mentioned a couple of lucid dreams that turned into astral projection. But this time, it just happened normal. I was in my bed sleeping. But it was funny this time because that night, I decided to take a break. It was my off night. I decided not to hear any audio. Just go to bed because I was tired. So I woke up around 5. to go to the bathroom like i always do so i came back and i just was in that sweet spot i reached the sweet spot okay i was like in that moment that i was falling asleep and i felt my right hand a little bit like numb and i had a vibration feeling before so i started to feel the vibration i knew it was coming okay so i surrender i sometimes i freak out so i decided just to go with the flow And I said a quick prayer. I'm Christian. Just a very quick prayer just to feel safe. And I was sleeping on my side. So I let it go. And I felt so light that I was already floating. But I decided to do a little bit of the roll up. I shake. I move my arms, my shoulders right and left. Only one time. And I was totally happy. So something you mentioned is true. I didn't. I didn't appear in my room. I went straight to my intention. Because my intention is I would like to talk with a spirit guide about my health. So I went straight to a room. I knew I was having a natural projection. I was very light. I saw a few people. I tried to understand where I was. And I think I was in a doctor's room. from what i i remember okay i was a bed it was like a you know when there's a computer there's a bed and i approached one of the persons to start talking right because that was my intention but this person turned around and moved to the computer so i turned around and i see more people coming like three or four but all were ladies okay and then i went to approach again the person to talk about my issue And at some point when I was there, I thought about my body. I don't know, for one second I said, oh, I'm going to go back to my body. I woke up. I was like, oh, no. And then I just but it was a really nice experience. And then I woke up and it was already like 630. So I think it took like an hour and a half. I don't know exactly, but I know you say that time is so different. And I was like, no, I wanted to stay longer. I shouldn't have thought about my body. Because I remember you said, as soon as you close your eyes or face your body, you just wake up. It was really nice. But this week, I had the same thing. I woke up at 5. I got down to the bathroom. And I was in that spot. And I started to feel numb my feet. And I started the vibrations. And I said, yes, I'm going to let it go. I started to do that, but this time it was not an easy way. I was in my left side, but I was pulled up from the top. So I was like, what should I do now? So I wasted my time thinking what exit technique I should use. And I woke up. So my question is, is there any point where I'm thinking too much that I will wake up or I will fall asleep? Because I couldn't really have to try. to do any exit technique and i was like no so that was actually one of the questions i have based on my last experience but it was great i mean i loved it and it was i was so close and i said okay next time i'm not going to think about my body at all oh my gosh um Well, firstly, congratulations. Oh, my gosh. On your on your out of body experience. I like how you're like, oh, yeah. And then I was going into my second one in the vibrational state. And then, you know, I didn't quite get out. I'm like, oh, my God. But you've had an out of body experience. The first one. That's fantastic. Well done. I mean, this is, you know, it's relatively a high skill. And the fact that you've had one this week or so soon is is quite, you know, that's quite. It takes people a long time, often a month, maybe a little bit longer. So that's really, really good that you've had that so soon. I just want to point out one thing related to what I said earlier, because I think it's a perfect example, Maria, how Maria had this intention of she wanted, I imagine you wanted to connect with a guide to give you wisdom or advice about your health. Am I right in saying that? Yes. Yeah, and then when she came out of her body, you accessed a doctor's room. I think so, yeah. And that's an example of how if you've got a very strong intention, then you have your out -of -body experience. Where you need to go can almost appear or you can be taken to it almost immediately. So this is why it's good to have that connection to that intention and for it to be meaningful. So that was, I'm glad you shared that, Maria, because that's a really strong example of how your projection plan relates directly then to your out -of -body experience. It is just unfortunate that you then thought of your body. then you came back um but it does often happen but also i don't want to um placebo that even more so if you do think of your body when you're out in and out of body experience um you know still try to be there if you can often we do come back but i don't want to kind of reiterate it by saying it but it's very common in regards to your question this so Yes, the more the mind starts thinking or narrating or chatting, what happens is you start to come out of that deep mind awake body asleep. So the more the mind chitter chatters, the more that we come out of the altered state to the point where we can just wake up. Or if we're too drowsy, we fall asleep. So this is why it's good not to give the mind space to start talking. So this is where we double up technique. So you had one, I think, did you say you naturally started to come out the second time? Yes, I see. It's just I got like a little stuck on my body. So I was thinking, okay, how do I do? I cannot do the rollout because I felt... So then I thought I should have done maybe the door technique. you know, or something or the ladder, you know, but I started to think about that when I was already awake. Yeah. So this is a cool little tip. And this is, this is really helpful to stop our mind from chatting to worrying about what technique we want to do. Have two backed up. So you've got your main exit technique, which it sounds like for Maria, it's the rollout, but then have a one, a backup one that you always go to. So you could go, okay, I'm going to roll out. I can't roll out, something's happened, but I'm still in the sweet spot. I'm going to go for, and then maybe the sinking technique or the door technique, as Maria suggested. Have your second one backed up straight away. So your mind doesn't get time to anchor itself to thoughts and you get caught in a thought spiral. But saying that, even though we might have a backup, which we remember and becomes a habit. I would say something to do with you started or feeling like you might go upwards. If you feel like you're already going... towards a direction. That seems like a very felt sense one rather than a visual exit. Go with another felt sense one. So if you did the rollout and it didn't work, you could try going upwards. I'm actually going to give a free exit technique here. So this is a new one that isn't in the quest. And this is quite a common one as well. And it's inspired by Maria talking about potentially going upwards. So you can thank Maria for learning this. New exit technique. So when you're in mind awake, body asleep. state you're very deep in it normally you know you would draw on the feeling and the sensation of rolling out i want you to draw on the sensation of spinning so it's you're spinning and then as you spin when the spinning begins to feel real in the same way that when we feel like we're really rocking from side to side you would roll out when you feel like you're really spinning you then move your awareness your consciousness up out of the body through your intention to go upwards Or you can choose to go down through your feet. So I would do that spiraling. And the way you can connect to the motion, like the same way we practiced for real when we did the rocking. I'm going to stand up. You can stand and you can turn in the space slowly, tuning into how this feels with your eyes closed. And then you tune into that spinning sensation and then you stop and then you'll notice you still feel a slight subtle sensation of turning. Then when you're in your bed, you're doing your practice, you bring your memory back to that spinning sensation and you send it up or you send it down. So you could use that as a second backup technique. as a felt sense one, or we call them a kinesthetic, a physical sense because of the motion. But yeah, have a backup technique, Maria, a backup one, but always have intuition as the first four go -to. So always rely on intuition. If intuition isn't saying anything at that point, go for your backup technique. But yeah, I would definitely say to build that as a habit. Hope that's helpful. Oh yeah, sure. Thank you. Thank you for sharing, Maria. Thank you. Very cool. Thank you so much, Maria, for that experience, sharing that experience. I'd love to bring on Shamath next to share his experience. And then just to remind you guys, we have a Q &A next to the chat. You can put your questions there, upvote your fellow students' questions, and we'll get right to the Q &A after this. Welcome to the call, Shamath. Yeah. Can you hear me? See me? Hello, Jade. Hello, Ezra. Thank you for this, first of all, for this amazing quest. And I would like to share my experience. Just to give you a context, I was part of the beta test, astral projection beta test. So this happened a little more than a month ago. And I have done the lucid dreaming quest from Charlie Morley, which the quest in Mindvalley. So I had the OBVI lucid dream. So I became lucid. I did the reality check. And I just said, out of body now. And I just floated up all of a sudden. I floated up and I wanted to meet my brother -in -law who had passed away a year ago. He passed away. And you mentioned some similar about your healing grief with your father. and I just floated up and I was able to see his aura like I was not able to interact with him or do anything but I just felt it was him when I called him out in the astral plane and I was able to see his aura his soul or whatever you can call it just his aura and then that was it and again I came back to the lucid plane or something and I again kept doing the reality check to enhance the lucid to prolong the lucid dream and i have to confess you know i had this thought and i wanted to check on my ex -girlfriend and but that did not happen i said uh let me go and meet uh check on my her my ex -girlfriend uh but that did not happen it was like something prevented me from going there twice i did that but twice it did not happen i have to confess and the third time again after again i did the reality check for a third time i said out of body now And I did not do any portal or any door which you mentioned in the lucid dreaming class, in the astral projection to lucid dreaming, changing plane class. I just said out of body now with intention and I was able to float out. And third time, I just floated up and up and along the astral place. I just remember seeing some different colors. And yeah, that was it. And how the lucid dream ended was I came back to a non -lucid dream. And I just had some normal dream after that. I have written it. I give a dream diary. So I have noted all of them down. So, yeah, that was my experience with an OBVI lucid dream. Wow. Amazing. Wonderful. You sound very, are you a lucid dreamer? You're a natural lucid dreamer. Not much. Like I have been from the quest. I've had a few lucid dreams. Four or five in the last one year I have learned. 9 months I have learnt the lucid dream. OK, well, that's great. And that's that's actually there's a lot of tips in lucid dreaming for those that maybe haven't done that quest that can really set a bit of a foundational foundation to springboard from into astral projection, exactly how Shamanth has spoken about. And yeah, the way that you went out of body now, that's the easiest way to go from the lucid dream into an out of body experience. But you naturally. So this is why I said, are you a natural lucid dreamer? Because some of the things that you mentioned were quite intuitive for lucid dreamers. So when you just said then about flying up, you just went up and you just went up and you just went up. That's actually another technique. So you can thank Shaman for this extra technique now that I'm going to share with you. Or he shared it really is you're in the astral projection dream. You can do the calling out, outer body now, or you could manifest a door or a portal, or you can just fly up and up and up and up and up and you just keep. going with the intention that you're going to leave your body so knowing that as you fly up if you like to i do the iron man hands at the same time If you've seen the movies, I have my hands like this. This is how I fly. But I'm in a lucid dream. Not when I'm astral projecting because I don't have a body. But yeah, you can do the Ironman hands if some sort of image helps it. But that's wonderful that you were able to springboard. You had the confidence to do that. You had the foundation. You did the technique. And then you had that connection with your father. You know, I often get asked... Brother -in -law. Not very long, did you say? Yeah. Would you like to share a little bit more about it? No, I mentioned brother -in -law to us, my brother -in -law whom I saw. But it was not long. Yeah, it was not long. I just saw his aura and then I came out of that plane. When did your brother -in -law transition? You won't believe it if I tell you. He passed away on December 21st. 2020 and this dream habit exactly on the day he passed away it did oh exactly on the on his year that the anniversary was first death anniversary i had this lucid dream and this out of body experience exactly on the first year like i too was blown away when i realized it Wow. And so I just got, when you said that, I just got shivers run all throughout my body. It's very auspicious. The anniversaries of certain things are very auspicious dates. So I'm inclined to say that, you know, that was meant to happen and it was meant to be. So that was wonderful connection for you to have. And often I get asked. Because the way in which we can connect with and meet people who have passed over, sometimes we have an expectation of what we think they're going to look like or how we're going to see them or how we're going to connect. But there's lots of different things at play from where we're at and our consciousness. the dimension that we meet them in and also there's something about wherever they are on their let's say soul's journey or evolutionary journey as well so how when these things come together that denotes how the experience then unfolds and so one of the ways in which you said about you know connecting and sensing to his aura is one of the ways in which people say that they often see or feel or connect with those that have passed over so thank you for mentioning that as an example of another way in which we can experience a connection with someone who has passed over that might not be in quite a stereotypical way of seeing them like a person and having an exchange like we might do on a human play because we do have to remember this is a non -physical reality which is why we've got to be open and accepting to other things that might not appear the same way as on the physical play. But thank you for sharing that. I was not completely in control, but it's still a part. I was able to do my intention. But when I wanted to check on my ex -girlfriend, I was not able to do that. Well, you know, there is Charlie Morley, who did the Lucid Dreaming Quest. There is a word for this, which I can't remember in this moment. There's a word for when you try to do something and you can't quite access it or it doesn't quite happen. He suggests it's to do with this idea of the larger awareness, the larger system or the university saying, oh, not right now. This isn't for you just yet. Or maybe you shouldn't do that. So there's this higher knowing. This bigger knowing that maybe this is not right or at this time, in this time and place. So maybe there was something saying, maybe you shouldn't be doing that. Yeah. But it's okay. And I want to point out to do, you know, fun things as well. It's important to do the healing and connecting with oneself. Also, it's got to be fun. You've got to have play, right? So do do those things that just bring you alive as well, like go and visit Hawaii or I don't know, something that makes you bring a childlike joy and wonder is important to do, as well as all the kind of serious healing stuff, you know? Sure. Thank you. Thank you once again for this beautiful quest. Thank you so much for sharing your experience. Yeah. Great. Thank you so much, Shama. I'd love to jump into Q &As for the rest of the time that we have together with Jade. We have an upvoted question here from Katie. I'm going to bring Katie on. Welcome to the call, Katie. Hi, Jade. Hey, how are you? I'm very well, thank you. Very excited to be talking to you. Yay! Where are you based? Where are you? I'm back in Hertfordshire. Hertfordshire. Yay, UK. Yeah, UK, yeah. So... Yeah, so I wasn't expecting this, but my question, I've loved this course, been doing it enthusiastically, excitedly, every day, practicing, but I'm imagining lots of stuff, but I'm not getting anything. You know, in my head I am, but I'm not getting a vibrational state. Is that kind of normal? I know you said it takes a while, but you then say a month. And we're in week three. So I kind of, and I'm trying not to get impatient. You know what I mean? It's sort of, I'm listening to all your tips. Yeah. Any advice? Yes. And great question. I imagine there's many others in your place as well, which is probably why your question got upvoted. So just a few things at play. And it's slightly different for everyone. So see maybe what resonates for you. So the first thing is just simply, continuing to practice the techniques and dedicating that time and continuing with that. That's just a real discipline thing. And everyone kind of knows that. A little tip on the side of that is, you know, like Maria said, she just decided to not practice anymore and to let it go. And then she had her out -of -body experience. Often that can happen when we've been practicing, practicing, practicing, channeling this focused energy into something, and then we let it go. Sometimes that can spontaneously happen. So just to throw that out there. that could happen in the future the second thing is um it might be a case of um Not having time yet, because it is only week three, to experiment enough with the tools and the techniques and pick and mix in the right ones that work for your psycho -spiritual makeup. So where you currently are on your journey and what your type of personality is as well. Are you a visual person, a more logical one? And then using those techniques. And even sometimes someone who thinks, oh no. a visual technique would probably work for me. But they try them on and go, oh, no, actually, I really felt that the felt sense one I connected with more. So they even went against their own expectations of what worked for them. So it is picking the right techniques to work for you as well and then practicing them. And then the third thing is, three more things I want to say is, one, only 70 % of people experience the vibrational stay. So you could be one of the 30 % that don't. So just be aware of that. And also... The more astral projection experiences we have, the less we seem to feel the vibrational state. Graham Nichols, who wrote the book Navigating the Out -of -Body Experience and whose OBE I shared about the bombing, he believes that the more experiences we have, it's a bit like the glue between our astral body and physical body gets thinner and thinner. And that means the vibrational state gets less intense, less intense, less intense. So that's something to note for everybody. else as well over time that that will get less and less to the point where you might just feel a subtle hum so don't grab onto the vibrational state you may not feel it and then the last one what was I going to say yes so I say average a month that for me it was a month But I was a lucid dreamer beforehand, quite an advanced lucid dreamer. So there was a lot of foundations I'd already cultivated, like holding mind, awake, body, sleep state. Same with William Buhlman was a meditator. So it took him a month, but he was quite an advanced meditator. He's a lead OBE teacher at the Monroe Institute. So we kind of say a month. But for some people, it happens. I had a student on a four week course. It happened the night. of the course which is not normal and i was saying like who does that yes that's not fair they're very lucky but that's a fraction of people will have it on the night some people a few days usually others it's around a month but some students it can take them three months to six months and even a year okay so don't be discouraged and just don't be yeah don't be discouraged with it and sometimes It depends on, I spoke about finding the right techniques and tools, but it's also about finding the right time of day. I've got one student who cannot do the wake back to bed technique. It just does not work for them. They just fall asleep. So they have most of their experiences when they take a nap in the afternoon, like a siesta. Whereas I've got another student who, well, many, the wake back to bed works for many people who swears by doing that. I'm the same. I find the wake back to bed. I would maybe say as a little tip, try to cultivate the disruption technique. So this is the one where you get roused in the middle of the night, pets, maybe you're ill, whatever the reason is, building works, and then just have it as a habit to just go for an... exit technique so you wake up you rouse you don't move your body that's important don't move your body and then just go for an exit technique so you're kind of chancing it you're kind of going i'm just going to give this a go and hope for the best you're not doing all of the techniques yes just go for it most of my experiences that are spontaneous are from the disruption technique so i mentioned i had covid and i had two spontaneous out -of -body experiences because i couldn't sleep properly because the cough was keeping me up um but because i built the habit of going for an exit technique from when i'm roused in the middle of the night i was able to have two spontaneous out -of -body experiences so again Some of it is just habit and then dedication. So I actually have quite a lot of disrupted sleep, so I should have lots of chances. Lots of chances. But you've got a gift there if you've got disrupted sleep, but if you haven't built the habit yet of being able to recognise, because also recognising you're awake, most of us kind of stir and turn over. So it's recognising in our awareness, oh, I'm awake. I'm going to do an exit technique. Oh, I'm awake. I'm going to, and you're not completely awake, but sometimes you can hit that sweet spot. I talk about on the hypnagogic highway. The second key with that one more, because I know we've got more questions. The second one with that is holding awareness because we've just woken up. We might do the rollout technique or whatever technique to exit, but then we still might be quite sleepy in our awareness and actually come out of our body, but be pulled back into sleep. So just be aware of that. We have to have that focused awareness. That's where the Durana technique comes in, where it's the one -pointed focused attention. Brilliant. All right. Well, thank you so much. Thank you for your time. And I will try that many times tonight. Yes. Okay. Thank you, Katie. Thank you. Bye. Thanks so much, Katie. And up to the call next is Alicia. Hi, everyone. Welcome to the call, Lisa. Thank you so much for having me. I think a lot of us get really, really excited and inspired hearing your personal stories. So a lot of us were hoping we could either hear a story where you are interacting with a guide or another being. I know you got one story at the beginning of the call, but another sort of interesting story like that I think would really get us all excited and inspired for our next plan. yeah i'm just that's really so i was thinking whilst he was talking then about which one to potentially share there's just so many i'm thinking about what might be the most useful one as well um okay so so i had an out body experience and i i came out of my body and i didn't have a plan it was it was spontaneous i hadn't really prepared and uh but there was a guide already there So there was already a guide with me. Now with guides, this happens very often in astral projection experiences. Sometimes you know they're there and you can feel their presence, but you can't see them. Sometimes you can, sometimes you can't. And so I knew it was with me and I got a sensation or a knowing, this intuitiveness to follow them, to know where to go. So they took me to my childhood home where my mum still lives. And I was in my garden of my childhood home way back when, when I was very, very younger. So my mum was in the bathroom window, just looking out the window. And this is some interstellar stuff going on here. If you've seen the film Interstellar. I'm taken to a period that would be in the past, my childhood garden, my mum was in the window when she was very young, when she had me, we moved to this house when I was three or four. And this is quite a simple OBE, as some of the most powerful ones can be quite simple. And I'm just in the garden and I feel this overwhelming... gratitude and love for my mother and everything she sacrificed for me as she's single mom accidentally got pregnant didn't have any money brought me up on her own you know um And I had this overwhelming love, love where it's so intense and immense, you just cannot contain it. You cannot contain it. There isn't a body because we have an astral body, but I couldn't even be within the experience because it was so phenomenal, effectively. And so all I could just think to do is to yell. at my mom in the bathroom window. I love you. I love you. I love you. And my mom, cause I just, it was so much to hold. I just wanted to express it. And I think like, and I was like crying, but I wasn't crying. My being was crying cause there's, there's no body. And it was so overwhelming. I just came back to my physical body. And in reflection of that, it seemed quite. It was very poignant at that time. This is why I talk about evolutionary out of body experiences, ones where you seem to be taken to somewhere for a reason to experience, learn or get a message at that particular point in your life. So there's often a correlation to what's happening in your everyday world. And at the time I'd been doing shadow work, parental shadow work. so I've spoken about the shadow and you can have shadow around your parents you know what you've suppressed about them or what you don't like and things and and and yeah so I had this spontaneous out -of -body experience taken with a guide who I instantly felt like I trusted who had my best intentions at hand we call them helpers as well in the secular world without the spiritual connotation and they'd taken me to have that experience to reconnect to a deeper love that I had for my mother that was being clouded by the shadow I had with my relationship with her. So this was one of the most powerful for me because it was able to open my heart a lot more towards my mother. And when I came back from the OB, I was just crying. It was just tears and tears and tears. And I really felt like something had been released and had shifted and that I was giving that for a particular reason. So it's not, that's not such a wacky or far out one perhaps, but it was one of the most powerful that I'd had, even though it seems quite simple, perhaps. No, that's beautiful because those are the most important ones, right? The ones that really touch our lives and our heart and help us move on. And hopefully maybe in the astral, maybe your mom got some of that love really projected to her, you know? So it could have been this really amazing sort of loop of energy and love given back and forth and healing for all of you. So thank you so much for sharing, Jade. Enjoying the quest. thank you no worries i really wanted to touch on what you said then so in the experience i really felt that which is why i said there was some interstellar shit i really felt like she saw me or she noticed me on a visceral energetic playing whilst I was in the garden a bit like in the film Interstellar where he's in the bookcase and there's the correlation you have to watch the film if you haven't seen the film it's amazing but yeah so I'm really glad that you said that because I wanted to reiterate there was this giving an exchange as you pointed out so thank you for reminding me of that thank you thank you thank you so much Alicia and for our final question of the evening or morning is Nadia. Welcome to the call, Nadia. Hello, Jade. Hello, everybody. And of course, I also want to say that I really appreciate this course. It's giving a lot of techniques, not only for astral world, but for this world as well. So I feel that I have been doing all this inner work all this month. And I'm... uh maybe i was also a little tired and desperate that's why i came up with this question um jade if you know some techniques when uh real people like on this plane on the planet earth can help us to have this first OBE. Like I can call my friend and say, okay, maybe we can have tonight. Could you help me? And could you share some techniques we should follow if you have any? So some techniques to share in regards to what specifically, sorry, could you just make it a little bit clearer? yes uh i've heard from one interview it was unconscious tv on youtube uh that presenter that lady said that she uh helped many people to have their first obe but she's like in our physical body she's not like spiritual guides she's just a human being so she She helped people by teaching and giving techniques in the same way I am, or she helped people by actually giving an OBE. In astral, sorry, I didn't mention that. Sorry, sorry. Yes, in astral plane. Yes. So I haven't actually done this. I've never had it as a projection plan. And to be honest, I haven't attempted it. Although I have said to Vishen that... was like, can you come and take me out of body, see if it works? And I was like, okay, I will make that as part of a future projection plan. I'm going to come and I'm going to see if I can get vision out of his body. I haven't actually done that yet. So apparently, yes, this can happen. And very advanced people that in astral projection can come out and go and sort of pull others out. Again, it's never black and white in how easy it is. It depends on a few things, the skill of the teacher who is coming to help pull them out of body. It also depends on where that person is in terms of, you know, their awareness. Are they so asleep that they wouldn't even notice if the person was there? And if they are in a place where they are being able to be pulled out, have they got the maturity to go with that experience and see it clearly for what's happening? Which they would do, perhaps, if they'd agreed to this beforehand. But I want to tell a story of Luigi Scamro Bella, who is the UK teacher for the Monroe Institute. He's on one of the podcasts that we spoke about, the CIA document. He went to go pull his friend out of his body. and he did it and his friends saw luigi as like a cloud um like a like a dark cloud of consciousness almost like a bit of a shadowy figure but luigi uh came out of his body went there that's how his friend saw him so his friend just freaked out and was like, no, no, no, no, I'm not going with you. I'm not going with you. And then Luigi came back to his body and he spoke to his friend because his friend had requested what you're talking about. Can you come put me at my body? And Luigi was like, I came to pull you out and you refused. And I think this is a really good example of how sometimes we can make assumptions and have beliefs around what we think is there when it's not all. that clear cut so it's a shame that um he didn't go with luigi because maybe if he had allowed him to to be taken out luigi's form might have got clearer he would have perceived him in a different way um so yes it can happen no i haven't done it there are some teachers who can do it It's relatively hard. It's an advanced skill and technique to do, but it is possible. But also it depends on the person. The teacher could be an amazing teacher and come and try to get them out of body. But if that person doesn't have a level of skill and they're not in the right place in their mind at the time, then there's going to be a bit of friction, let's say, being able to go out or not go out. But that's a great question. Not many people ask that. that's that's very rare so thank you once the course you will include this technique as well and uh one short uh The question is also about technique because I think I might have a spontaneous OBE when I was a child and it was very conscious one because I went to that state, I talked to somebody and I was scared. I went out and then it was very interesting. I pulled this feeling again and I went again to this OBE. But I felt like you said today, actually, like spiraling or like I was fainting, losing my consciousness, like, you know, physically when your body is falling down. And I felt this twice during that time. So maybe you have or you can point out where I can find and Google it some vigorous breathing technique that you feel this, you know. dizziness or some altered state of mind because of this breathing maybe like this yes okay so i'm going to suggest a technique which is quite powerful so if breath work works for you and i'm talking to nadia but also everyone else if you feel really connected to breath work there's two which which could be used um so one is um a bhakti breath is it breath of fire which is a kundalini breath which is kind of like that can take you into an altar the thing is that will take you into an altered state and have certain effects anyway but you have to be able to navigate and hold that altered state to then springboard from there into astral projection you might also have other experiences if you do that you might get a vision you might because it's a bit like a crossroads you know when we're in the hypnagogic you can have a lucid dream you might get a vision you might hear a message or you could astral project so The Bhakti Rift takes you into an altered state, which is like a crossroads. And from there you could go anywhere. So then you could springboard. The other one, and this is a technique unto itself, which is very powerful, is holotropic breathwork by Stanislaw Grof. So you could do a holotropic breathwork. I haven't worked with... breath work in that way yet with holotropic but it's something I want to do so you might find that interesting it is certainly very powerful you probably need to go on a retreat to do that properly because you have someone that assists you and they sit with you because it can be holotropic breath work can be as powerful as taking psychedelics or a very deep meditation retreat so just a a gentle word of warning these are two very powerful techniques if you do them you might get a big experience so okay thank you thank you very much sorry i kept you uh okay thank you thank you nadia thanks Thank you so much, Nadia. And we complete this call. Jade, as the students progress to the last week of the quest, before we meet again for the celebration call, how can they continue to prepare and be most effective with the art of astral projection? Yes. Let me just have a moment to tune in. Just to reiterate the point really that, you know, we're having these experiences and we're going out into these non -physical realms and dimensions in order to retrieve insights, lessons and effectively... gain wisdom we can bring back to this reality here and now our everyday life to help ourselves but also be in service of others so just to keep that in the background that you know i'm doing this practice to bring all of this back and to integrate and embody it into this life in the here and now because it's really that integration that is then going to have that that radical shift of consciousness which they will then released what needs to be released and will bring through all and everything that is need to come into form for your new reality for your whatever you want to bring into this world so without that integration and that embodiment which you will learn on the very last day some techniques of how to do that um we won't really get the true wisdom the essence uh the depth of those experiences so remembering that we need to bring it back into this reality that might also help you with your projection plan if you don't feel like you've got a strong intention yet but good luck in your last week oh you're going to do something so much fun you're going to do an experiment yes you have the experiment coming up so you get to put into practice all the techniques you've done so far um so yes you've got a very fun experiment coming up as well so i hope you enjoy it Awesome. Thank you so much, Jade. And thank you, Tribe, for tuning in to another live experience call with Jade Shaw in the Art of Astral Projection. We have our last call, the celebration call happening in two weeks, where we will share our stories of this quest, more astral projection stories. And we might even have some time for a little bit more Q &A from Jade. So also don't forget, you don't have to wait to these live calls to continue the conversation. We have them going on in the Tribe. We've got our ambassadors there as well. shout out to Monica Ducu and we will see you guys in two weeks same time thank you so much Jade thank you everybody take care good luck and I will see you on the other side on the other side

Week 3: Advanced Techniques for Exiting the Body

====================

LESSON 15: Lift Off: Exit the Body with the Ladder & Doorway Techniques
--------------------
<v ->Hello, astral projectors.</v> Welcome to week three. This week is all about learning how to fly. It's jam-packed full of exit techniques that are going to enable us to leave the body in different ways. I hope you're ready because this is when we open our wings and we start to soar. Today, we're going to learn two exit techniques: the ladder and the doorway. I will describe what they are and how to do them. And then you can give them a go by listening to the guided audio afterwards. If you've researched astral travel online or perhaps read a few books, you might have stumbled upon the popular rope technique. This involves imagining pulling yourself out of the body by a rope hanging from the ceiling. Now, the only problem with this is that if you haven't pulled yourself up a rope before, or you don't believe you can do it, then it's going to be harder to connect with this technique. This is an example of how our limiting beliefs can directly impact our practice. It's important to show you this so that when you choose your tools to create your bespoke practice later on in the quest, you select the method that works best for you. This is why I have chosen the adapted version of the ladder technique. It's more accessible and easier to envision because most of us have used a ladder before. And I think we can all agree, it's much easier to climb than a rope. When we begin the ladder technique, we will ideally already be in the Mind Awake Body Asleep State, or the Vibrational State. From there, I'll encourage you to not only visualize the ladder, but also to feel it. We will attempt to bring in our felt sense to what it's made of along with the visual. What color is it? I'll guide you up the ladder, step by step. Technically, this is the end of the exit technique as it should shift you out of your body. However, in the guided audio, I'm going to take you straight into a second exit technique. There's an important reason for this which I'm going to explain at the end. But for now, let's look at our second exit technique we're going to learn. The doorway is a visualization using active imagination. We build our own special door that represents a passage between the physical and the non-physical. It's like a virtual reality game. We're going to create the size, decide the shape, mold the details, and paint the colors. It can look like a beautiful heavenly gate, a futuristic space hatch, or an ancient crooked door. Whatever you wish, you can't get this wrong because it's your personal gateway into the astral realm. So make it magical. And remember, like the ladder, this would normally be done as a stand-alone technique, but I've linked the two together. So in the audio, one method will go right into the next. You can follow along, or you can go with your intuition at any stage. For example, if you start to feel the vibrations or you feel like you're floating out of the body after one of the techniques, go with that. You don't have to keep following along if the technique is working. That's what it's for. When we go to perform an exit technique, if we don't leave the body, because not every technique will work for every person, more often than not it can bring us out of the altered state altogether. Here's an example of a problem of how to solve it. Let's say we're in the vibrational state and we reach out for the ladder. We try to climb up it, but maybe we've gone for the exit technique too early. We weren't deep enough in the state. This is what might happen. We wake up completely; it's a bit like sliding down the snake in a game of Snake and Ladders. We have to start again from square one. Or we might find ourselves still in the Mind Awake Body Asleep, or Vibrational State. But now, our mind chatter has come in. Why didn't it work? What did I do wrong? What do I have to do next? And this can dissolve the altered state and snap us out of it. To avoid this, what we might want to do right away before we go back to square one, before the mind chatter comes in, or before the state breaks, is to do another exit technique. This is called doubling up. By bringing in another method immediately, you give your mind something to do which combats the overthinking. And you also give yourself a second chance to exit, to grab that opportunity to leave the body. So if the ladder technique works, fantastic. Go on your astral journey, and ignore the rest of the guided audio. If you don't find yourself out of body though, or you want to practice both methods anyway, continue to follow my instructions for the second technique, the doorway. Your action for today is to follow the guided audio. But as always, it's better if you get your room set up in the most conducive state for astral projection for you beforehand. So set the space, limit any distractions, and get comfortable. Good luck with climbing your ladder and creating your door. See you on the other side.

====================

LESSON 15: Meditation - Ladder & Doorway Exit Techniques

<silence> 

Before we begin, limit any distractions that could pull your senses and attention outwards into the physical world. You might like to shut the curtains, close the windows and doors, wear headphones or an eye mask, and get into a comfortable position. If you would like to do this and you haven't already, pause the track now and take a moment to do this. Although we want to get to a place where we cannot feel our physical body anymore, it is okay to adjust your position or scratch an itch at any time if you need to. This is your time to awaken and practice. The skill of astral projection within you is the ability to tap into realms beyond the body. This is because you are a multi-dimensional being with infinite potential. All with this in mind. Let's begin. For now, all we're going to do is just be where we are. Just noticing where we are right now. Perhaps take three deep belly breaths to settle our body and mind. Then becoming aware of the space behind the neck, feeling the length of the spine in our back, noticing the weight of our hips sitting within our body, feeling the legs touch the bed chair or ground 

Arms hanging at the sides of us, hands and fingers loose at the end. Bringing our attention to the texture of the clothes or blankets, touching the skin and sensing the space around the body. Noticing the physical edges of ourselves, the boundary of our being. Just tuning into any feelings we might have in this moment, not needing to change or do anything about them, just being aware of how we feel right now. And lastly, in our own way, feeling the connection to the earth and the support we gain from it. Let's set a general intention here for the mind to be awake and aware, and for the body to become completely relaxed. Maybe we could bring our personal motivation to mind here, our purpose, our reason why we are practicing astral projection. We allow our intention and motivation to drop into our awareness like a pebble sinking in water, letting our intention go. Now, let's shift our attention to the breath. Nothing to do now, nowhere to go. Just rest, drifting in our own time into the hypnagogic state. With each outbreath, we relax deeper and deeper into a wider awareness, leaving any bodily sensations behind. For now, remembering you can come back to the body at any time, but for now, letting it go completely relaxed, completely supported, and completely safe. 

Notice how relaxed you feel and how good it is to be this relaxed your mind aware your body becoming weightless as it falls. Fast asleep. Staying mindfully aware whilst your body lies in space. Maintaining that soft awareness, allow your focus now to dissolve away any sensations with the body. Completely relaxed, completely supported, completely safe. Although you are deeply relaxed and maybe quite drowsy, I invite you to stay fully aware. Letting go of any remaining bodily sensations, but staying mindfully alert, remembering you can come back to the body at any point you would like to, but for now, letting it go. We might like to let it go on the outbreath. And with this outbreath, we drop deeper and deeper into a relaxed state. And if we think we're fully relaxed, let's encourage ourselves to let go even more. Tell yourself it's time to let go. If your mind drifts off, just anchor it back to the black or grayness behind your eyes or anything you can see or sense in your awareness. Just noticing what's there. And if we notice nothing, that's okay too. We're like a calm observer. Being aware of where we are, 

Paying attention to any imagery that may appear, sounds we might hear, or feelings we might have no need to judge or interpret what we notice. Just being with what is. Is there a quality to what you can see or a texture to what you can feel? Not striving to find these things. Simply seeing what's there. If your thoughts drift to the past or future, just bring your mind back to whatever is happening in the present moment. Even if it's nothing, be with the nothingness. For the next couple of minutes, allow yourself to drop deeply into the hypnogogic state, and if you fall asleep, that's fine. Maybe it's what your body and mind needs. Just gently riding the hypnogogic highway and noticing what passes you by 

The following technique works best when you are deep in the mind awake, body asleep state. Although you might feel some sensations or perhaps even astral project during this guided audio. Generally, this is a dress rehearsal for when you do the technique in your own time in this way. Once you know it well, you can make the method longer or shorter and undertake it at any given moment in your practice. But for now, let's go through the steps so you can learn it, rehearse it, but most importantly, implement it when you are ready to exit the body. So imagine that you are deep in the mind awake, body asleep state. You cannot sense your body, it's gone to sleep, but your mind is awake and aware, deeply relaxed, completely calm, and totally safe. As we lay here, we notice a ladder appear next to us. It is close by and within arm's reach as we bring our attention to it, it seems safe, strong, and stable. What does this look or feel like to you in your own way? Reach out and place a hand on the ladder. Bring your attention to the size and texture. Place a second hand on the ladder and in whatever way feels easiest, begin to pull yourself up and towards it. 

If you can't see or sense the ladder, imagine what it might be like to do this right now. Become aware of the feeling against your hands and the sense of motion as you pull yourself up. Remember that any limitations you may have in your physical body are not present in the astral. You can move freely, concentrate on climbing, moving from one rung to the next. Hope you go now. If you haven't already, you look up and you notice that the ladder passes into a different place with ease and curiosity. You move up the ladder and enter this new space. Explore where you are for a few moments. You can revisit this place anytime you wish. But for now, we're going to go into our second exit technique. Wherever you are right now, I'd like to invite you to create a doorway in your mind's eye. This doorway will represent a passage between the physical world and the astral plane. It's like a virtual reality where you create the shape, color, and detail of the door. You can't get this wrong because it's whatever you can imagine. So let's start with the size and shape of your door. What does this look like to you? 

If you don't see your door, perhaps you feel it or sense in other ways. What material is your door made from? Perhaps it's physical, like wood or stone or something intangible like energy or light. What type of handle does it have? A doorknob, key card, password, or code? Decide how it will open and close, but don't open it just yet. Notice the environment that surrounds your door. Is it crafted in nature, a building or somewhere else? Where is it placed? Add the finishing touches to your door. Any last details you wish to add? Finally, create a symbol that for you represents a passage from the physical to the non-physical world. When you have chosen your symbol, place this on or around the door, wherever you think is best. Now, take a step back and admire your work. This is your gateway, your personal portal to the astral plane. Only you can use it. Are you ready to walk through it? If so, take a moment to remind yourself of your projection plan. If you would like to repeat after me in your head the following command, when I walk through this door, I will enter the astral plane. When I walk through this door, I will enter the astral plane. When I walk through this door, I will enter the astral plane. 

Knowing you are safe and always in control. When you are ready with an open heart and a strong spirit, unlock your door and walk through it. Using your intuition takes some time now to explore where you are. You may return to your door whenever you wish. Go on your journey now with no sense of rush. It's time to come back to the body. Now, back to the physical world. That's it. Make your way. Remember, you can return anytime you wish, but for now, it is time to come back to everyday reality with full recall and all senses intact, make your way back now. Follow the sound of my voice and bring your awareness back to the body. Anything you can see or sense in your physical world, you might like to wriggle your fingers and toes or take a nice stretch when you are ready, gently opening the eyes. Welcome back. Take a moment to recall your experience and note it down in your diary. I'll see you again soon.

====================

LESSON 15: Meditation - Bonus: MABA & Ladder Exit

Welcome back. I'm now going to guide you through some exercises to bring on the mind awake, body, sleep state, and trigger the vibrational state. After this, the music will continue and eventually phase out, leaving you to continue your journey or wake up when you are ready. If at any point during the audio you feel vibrations or sense the time is right to exit the body, then go with your intuition. It's okay to steer away from the audio if you need to. Everyone's experience will be different. So release expectations, be open. And remember, there is no right or wrong. We're each finding our own way. What we're doing here is preparing our mind and body so that it becomes familiar with the wide spectrum of these states. Building the best habits for astral projection. You'll hear this sound 

After each exercise. This sound helps to bring us back if we have lost awareness. When we hear this sound, we do not open our eyes or move our body. We just bring our attention back to the task at hand. Okay, then let's begin. This audio uses hypnosis techniques and active imagination to stimulate the vibrational state. And if you experience this state today or feel close to it, this may be a new sensation for you. So remember, be open to whatever occurs. You can always return to your bodily sensations at any time, just as you would during an actual out of body experience. Now keep your eyes open for the time being and just check in with the motivation for your practice. Take a moment to recall why you would like to astral project. Now take three deep belly breaths in through your nose and slowly out through your mouth. And while you're taking these deep breaths, set an intention to relax your body fully and stay mindfully aware for the duration of this guided session. 

Now that you are nicely settled down, I'd like you to look up and find a spot to fix your gaze. Maybe a mark on the wall or ceiling, something that's not directly in front of you, but slightly above your eyeline. If you are laying down or propped up with cushions. Just be careful not to overstretch your neck in any way. You're just looking very slightly above the eye line, so you shouldn't need to tilt your head back very much at all. And from this moment on, just fix your gaze on that spot and on that spot alone. And as you do this, you'll find very quickly that your vision will get hazier and hazier as your eyes get tired and sleepy. Until soon, they will be closed. But for now, keep them open and you will be drifting into a very pleasant, relaxed condition very soon. 

But for now, I'd just like you to keep your eyes focused on that point for a little while. And while you listen to the sound of my voice, keep your eyes focused on that point. And soon you'll notice your eyes blinking. Blinking is fine, blinking is good as you keep your eyes on that same spot. Now, I don't want you to close your eyes, but just keep them fixed on that spot whilst you concentrate on my voice. And your eyes might water a bit or feel a little blurry, and that's okay. Remember, blinking is good, and these sensations are all just temporary. 

And while you are doing this, you'll find your vision is getting hazier and hazier. As your eyes get tired and sleepy, soon they will be closed and you'll just drift into a very pleasant relaxation. It doesn't matter if your mind wanders a little. You can always bring it back to the sound of my voice. Just be comfortable. And when you find that it would be so nice to just let those eyes close all on their own, you can stop trying to keep them open. Close your eyes now. See how comfortable they are when you let them go and relax. 

Settle yourself right down and just let yourself drift gently and easily into relaxation. As I count slowly up to seven, I will start that count for you now. One, relax. And already you can feel yourself calming down, becoming much more relaxed now, beginning to drift away. Two, relax. You're feeling comfortable, beginning to feel peaceful. Two, just feel into that relaxation, working its way through your body, bringing every part of you to rest. Three, relax. And now just breathe a little slower and deeper. And each deep breath you take is making you more and more relaxed. Settling yourself right down. 

Four, relax. Just feel your whole body getting heavier and heavier. Now almost as though you are sinking, pleasantly down, singing into sheer comfort, body asleep, mind awake as each deep breath you take relaxes you more and more. Five, relax. You are feeling drowsier and drowsier, tired and sleepy body. Now mind aware and calm. Body totally relaxed. Six, relaxed. Every part of your body is coming to rest. Now settling down into sheer comfort, body feeling tired, sleepy, calm, and at peace, mind gently aware. Seven, relax. Just continue drifting now deeper and deeper into that relaxation. Resting so comfortably now you are deeply calm and relaxed focused, stand aware. 

Now, either out loud or in your head, I'd like to invite you to repeat the following affirmation after me, we will do this twice. Ready. I awaken the ability of astral projection to be in service of myself and others. I do this with courage and compassion. I awaken the ability of astral projection to be in service of myself and others. I do this with courage and compassion. As we lay here, we notice a ladder appear next to us. It is close by and within arm's reach as we bring our attention to it, it seems safe, strong, and stable. What does this look or feel like to you in your own way? Reach out and place a hand on the ladder. Bring your attention to the size and texture. Place a second hand on the ladder and in whatever way feels easiest, begin to pull yourself up and towards it. If you can't see or sense the ladder, imagine what it might be like to do this right now. Become aware of the feeling against your hands and the sense of motion as you pull yourself up. Remember that any limitations you may have in your physical body are not present in the astral. You can move freely, 

Concentrate on climbing, moving from one rung to the next. Oh, you go now. If you haven't already, you look up and you notice that the ladder passes into a different place with ease and curiosity. You move up the ladder and enter this new space. Explore where you are for a few moments. You can revisit this place anytime you wish. But for now, we're going to go into our second exit technique. Wherever you are right now, I'd like to invite you to create a doorway in your mind's eye. This doorway will represent a passage between the physical world and the astral plane. It's like a virtual reality where you create the shape, color, and detail of the door. You can't get this wrong because it's whatever you can imagine. So let's start with the size and shape of your door. What does this look like to you? If you don't see your door, perhaps you feel it or sense it in other ways. What material is your door made from? Perhaps it's physical, like wood or stone or something intangible like energy or light. What type of handle does it have? A doorknob, key card, password, or code? Decide how it will open and close, but don't open it just yet.

Finally, create a symbol that for you represents a passage from the physical to the non-physical world. When you have chosen your symbol, place this on or around the door, wherever you think is best. Now, take a step back and admire your work. This is your private gateway, your personal portal to the astral plane. Only you can use it. Are you ready to walk through it? If so, take a moment to remind yourself of your projection plan. If you would like to repeat after me in your head the following command, when I walk through this door, I will enter the astral plane. When I walk through this door, I will enter the astral plane. When I walk through this door, I will enter the astral plane. Knowing you are safe and always in control. When you are ready with an open heart and a strong spirit, unlock your door and walk through it. Using your intuition takes some time now to explore where you are. You may return to your door whenever you wish. Go on your journey now 

With no sense of rush. It's time to come back to the body. Now, back to the physical world. That's it. Make your way. Remember, you can return anytime you wish, but for now, it is time to come back to everyday reality With full recall and all senses intact, make your way back now. Follow the sound of my voice and bring your awareness back to the body. Anything you can see or sense in your physical world, you might like to wriggle your fingers and toes or take a nice stretch when you are ready, gently opening the eyes. Welcome back. Take a moment to recall your experience and note it down in your diary. I'll see you again soon.

LESSON 16: 3 Steps to Transform Sleep Paralysis Into Astral Projection
--------------------
<v ->Hello, and welcome back.</v> Today, we are going to talk about a phenomena related to sleep that you might encounter: sleep paralysis. We're going to look at how to transform it into astral projection. You wake up in the middle of the night and feel a pressure on your chest and a feeling of fear in your heart. You try to move, but your limbs will not budge. You try to call out, but no sound comes out. It's as though you're partially awake but somehow stuck in sleep. Everything seems so real, and you ask yourself, is this a bad dream? This might sound like a nightmare, and in many ways it is, but what you might be experiencing is sleep paralysis. For many, this strange occurrence of feeling half asleep and half awake, not being able to move, locked in your body, can be a frightening experience. However, if armed with a couple of simple approaches you can not only overcome this phenomenon but you can also harness it as a way to experience the out-of-body state. For the record, astral projection does not cause sleep paralysis, but as astral travelers, we can certainly use it to our advantage. Firstly, what is sleep paralysis? It's important to understand why sleep paralysis happens. When you understand this process, it will help you to overcome it, should you ever encounter it. The reason you can't move or speak is because your body is fast asleep. Most likely in REM, rapid eye movement dream sleep. During REM sleep, your physical body can't move. It's a protective measure the brain uses, so you don't move or act out your dreams, or fall out of bed, or wander outside. Although your body is asleep, your brain has partially woken up, and your senses are taking in some sensory input. This means your mind is half awake. You can sense some things from the outside world, but your physical body cannot move. And sometimes because you're half in a dream and half awake, you might see pictures or scenes playing out in front of you. It's almost as if there are images superimposed over your normal bedroom scene. There may even be some sounds that you might hear. The fear that this altered state generates can also lead to hyperventilation and in turn, a feeling of a weight on the chest. However, rest assured sleep paralysis is more common than you might think. Around 40% of people have experienced it to some degree before. When can it occur then? It can happen at any point during your night's sleep, but sleep paralysis is most commonly occurring during the hypnopompic, the transitional state of waking up out of sleep and dream. But sometimes it can occur in the hypnagogic too. For many people, this phenomenon of partially waking up from sleep, but the body remaining paralyzed, can be terrifying in which they get hallucinatory images and sounds that may lead them to believe that demons are trying to possess them. So now, it's a good time for some myth-busting with this. Firstly, rest assured, sleep paralysis isn't anything external, such as a demon or a spirit, though it can be really scary. But we've just discovered that it's simply a mechanism of the brain. Astral projection doesn't cause sleep paralysis. Sleep paralysis and astral projection are not the same thing. They're two different phenomena with different attributes and sensations, two different states of consciousness. Although our natural response is to fight sleep paralysis, actually, the harder you struggle to move, the less likely you are to wake up out of it. Lastly, the great thing is is that you can harness sleep paralysis to enter an out-of-body experience. So if that's the myth, then what's the reality? The reality is that sleep paralysis is a natural phenomena that we need not fear, and can instead utilize for our astral projection practice. I've experienced it a lot over the years, and depending on my level of awareness, how clear I am in my mind at the time and also my skill at that time as an astral projector, depends on how I deal with it and what happens afterwards. Here's an example. One night, I woke up in sleep paralysis. I was lying on my back with my head turned towards the window. I could not move my body or speak, and my eyes were open. So sometimes you can have your eyes open and still see dream imagery overlaid over your room at the same time. My gaze was fixed in the direction that my body was laying. All of a sudden, the curtain morphed into a hooded figure. It looked like the Ringwraith from Lord of the Rings or the Death Eaters from Harry Potter. It turned to face me menacingly. Instantly, I did the Metta-Moment, where we drop into the heart space and we bring ourselves to a place of gratitude. The hallucination vanished. Then all of a sudden, straight after, a giant spider from the ceiling dropped down towards my face. I'm scared of spiders. Again, I took a Metta-Moment, and before the spider landed on my face, it dissolved away. This is what I call neutralizing the space during sleep paralysis. We have the power to influence what is happening, but only when we control our emotions. Because our emotions affect the hallucinations. If you're full of fear and panic, guess what is going to happen? You're going to manifest a personification of those feelings. So what do we do if we find ourselves in sleep paralysis? Here are three options. One, the prevention and the release of sleep paralysis. To prevent episodes before they happen, avoid anything that might disrupt your usual sleep routine, and avoid sleeping on your back. It's often the fear of this altered state that can lead to the fast breathing and sometimes a feeling of a weight on the chest. However, there are some other simple ways to overcome sleep paralysis once you're in it. If you want to snap out of it, try this nifty breathing technique. Relax, and exhale through your front teeth, making a sound similar to letting air out of a tire. It's a little bit like whistling through your teeth like this. Let's try it together now. See if you can go longer than me when you do it. Okay, deep breath in, and keep going as long as you can. If you're still going, keep with it, keep with it, keep with it. Okay, maybe you're still going; well done. This will help to disengage the sleep paralysis mechanism and bring you out of it. The key is to relax and stay calm. Easier said than done, right? But you can do it. And once you've done that, it's recognizing that it's not a threatening situation or nightmare. There's nothing to fear, and you will wake up at any moment. You're safe, and this will pass. Two, use it as a gateway to astral project. If you're feeling brave, you can alchemize sleep paralysis into a gateway for astral projection. The good thing is you already know a couple of skills to help make this happen. Here's how to do it. Try to stay in sleep paralysis instead of resisting and fighting it. So we're going to learn an affirmation that we can use in that moment where we're feeling overwhelmed with emotions. The affirmation is, "I release control; I surrender to the flow." "I release control; I surrender to the flow." If you say this with feeling, so genuinely feel that surrender, and offer it up to that moment, it should be able to help disengage that resistance and that fight or flight that you feel yourself in. You can back this up with RAIN technique. Remember, recognize what's happening. Okay, I'm in sleep paralysis. Accept that you're here. Okay, accept I'm in sleep paralysis. Investigate, what is in this space? What can I see or sense around me? And non-identification. Don't attach a story to your surroundings. Oh my God, I'm going to get possessed by a demon, attacked by a negative entity. This is just a story that's going to send us into a negative thought spiral. Then if during this process, you notice more scary hallucinations, or perhaps you don't see anything at all, but you sense a negative presence, you can take a Metta-Moment, dropping into that feeling of loving kindness and gratitude, just like I did. This will neutralize the space. Remember, this is dropping into the heart space and connecting with feelings of love, gratitude, and compassion which can help shift our psyche from fear to love. Alternatively, if you have a strong association with a spiritual practice such as prayer or mantra, you could use this instead, especially if it means a lot to you. In some cases, this might even work better than the Metta-Moment because it holds a special place in your heart, and it's more familiar for you to do it in that moment. For example, I lived in a Tibetan Buddhist Center for five years. So I take influence from some of their practices, one of which is Guru Rinpoche, or Padmasambhava's, mantra which is all about purification, overcoming obstacles, and cutting through our own limitations. So when I see something scary, I kind of yell at it. And then that kind of disperses the state. So I take kind of a wrathful loving approach to the hallucinations. You might do something similar from your own spiritual practice or lineage. Then do an exit technique right away. Don't give yourself time to think about it, and I suggest a felt sense one like sitting up or rolling out of the body. Time is of the essence here. The state might fade, or you could click out of it. So move straight away into your exit technique. At the same time, as you attend to the exit, use your willpower. And if you really want to go for it, you can say a command at the same time, such as, "Out of body now!" Really go for it. Some people break through just with sheer force sometimes. But if you find you are still stuck in sleep paralysis, you can request help from a spirit guide, an ancestor, or even maybe your higher self, or you can even leave it open to any benevolent force. In Batman, when the head of the police needs Batman's help, he uses the Bat Signal. He projects the symbol of a bat from the top of the police station, using a huge light that beams into the sky. When Batman sees it, he knows he's needed, and he goes to help. This is the same thing, except it's beaming from you, and you're calling on your cavalry, your backup team. When you do this, drop all expectations of how you think help will arrive though. This is because you could miss the response due to what you think it's going to look or feel like. Some people report the feeling of a tug, or a tap, or a pull on their energy body, and they follow this sensation. Whilst others are pulled all the way out straight away. Alternatively, you might get a sudden insight, or your fear just falls away. We can be helped in both literal, symbolic, and quite abstract ways. What that means is it might be very obvious, or it might be more subtle. The best thing to do is be open to whatever happens next. Let's rehearse this now. Of course, we're not in an altered state, so it's not going to look or feel the same as if we were in sleep paralysis, but it will enable us to do this more easily when the time comes because it will be in our retrospective memory. Okay, closing your eyes now. And you might like to place a hand on the heart and one on the stomach and take three deep breaths in your own time. Dropping into the present moment on the exhale. And tuning into your internal world. Feeling into the heart space. And in whatever way feels right for you, calling out with your whole being for support from a spirit guide, ancestor, higher self, or benevolent force to assist you out of body. Do this in your own way now. And if you're struggling, perhaps imagine a beam of light bursting out of you like a laser, penetrating into the universe. And that beam of light carries your core. Take a few moments to make your request with no sense of rush. And when you're ready, opening the eyes. Your actions for today: so here's your assignment for tonight. You can ask for help at any time during your astral projection journeys, whenever you need to. You don't need to wait for sleep paralysis. The support is available for you at any time. And I would like you to do this tonight, as you drift off to sleep. The exact same thing that we just did, calling on a guide to support your astral travel as you drop off to sleep, as you go through the hypnagogic state. You never know, they may have already heard this call, and show up to aid your journey tonight. So don't forget, call out to your guide in your own way as you drift off to sleep tonight. And I will see you tomorrow.

LESSON 16: Meditation - Calling Your Guide

- Close in your eyes. Now, you might like to place a hand on the heart and one on the stomach. And take three deep breaths in your own time. Drop dropping into the present moment on the exhale and tuning into your internal world, feeling into the heart space, and in whatever way feels right for you. Calling out with your whole being for support from a spirit guide, ancestor, higher self or benevolent force to assist you out of body. Do this in your own way now and if you are struggling, perhaps imagine a beam of light bursting out of you like a laser penetrating into the universe, and that beam of light carries your call. Take a few moments to make your request with no sense of rush, and when you are ready, opening the eyes.

LESSON 17: Lift Off: Exit the Body With the Corkscrew & Caterpillar Techniques
--------------------
<v ->Hello, and welcome back.</v> Today, we're going to channel our inner caterpillar as we learn two new exit techniques: the Caterpillar and the Corkscrew. These are both similar to the Roll Out Technique in that they are both a kinesthetic way to leave the body. We tune into a feeling of a specific moment, imprint it to our felt-sense memory, and then draw on this later on when we do our practice. When we rehearse it beforehand, it's fresh in our minds. So there's less thinking and remembering for our mind to do when we're in that sweet spot, deep in the Mind Awake Body Asleep State. This is why we're going to practice the motion of a Corkscrew and a Caterpillar beforehand. Well, not exactly the same, more like our own interpretation of it. So let's learn them now. The first one we're going to do is the Corkscrew. Today we're going to have a look at the Corkscrew Exit Technique. So what this involves is using our memory and imagination to connect to a spinning corkscrew movement. And we do that by physically doing it first, so then later on in our practice, we can more easily draw on that memory, that felt sense of motion, and bring it to mind. To do that, we're going to turn on the spot slowly around and bring our attention inwards to try and remember and connect to that feeling. So it's not about getting a step right or getting the motion right; it's more about how it feels for us individually as we're turning. Okay. Let's give it a go. So standing on the spot and closing the eyes and just to tune into the felt sense of motion and energy in the body. I'd like you to bring your attention to your right hand, just tuning into how your right hand feels right now, bringing all your focus to that area. Noticing any sensations you might feel. No need to judge what's happening or think about your right hand, just bringing your attention to it. And then shifting your focus now, your attention, to your left ear. Can we sense into our left ear? What happens when we notice and focus on this area? Does our left ear feel any different to our right when we focus on it? And now turning our attention to our spine. Our spine which holds us up throughout the day, keeps us straight. Noticing how the spine sits in the body. And whilst we're here, slowly, in your own time, I'd like you to move on the spot in a circle, not too quickly, and notice how it feels to turn in space. Noticing the shifting of weight from one foot to the other, connection between the feet and the floor, how this spinning sensation sits in your body. Not striving to find an answer, but just noticing how it feels. And if you get a little dizzy or feel that you're going to go off balance, that's okay. Just take a step and open the eyes if you need to. But for now, a couple more turns on the spot, tuning into that motion, that sensation of turning in space. Imprinting the feeling of that movement to your memory. Remembering how this feels right now to spin in space. And when you're ready, slowly coming to a pause. It doesn't matter which way you finish, which direction you're in, slowly bringing it to a stop. And can you still feel any sense of movement? Sense of turning in your body? What does it feel like now you've stopped moving? Can you still sense any motion or energy moving in the body? Or, maybe nothing at all. Either is fine. And when you're ready, opening the eyes. Well done. So that sense of turning and the connection to that is what we want to imprint to our mind. So then we can draw on it later on when we're lying down in bed. Now I just want to make it clear: when you do this later on in your practice, you don't move your physical body. You don't do this for real. What we're doing here is tuning into the memory of the motion and using our imagination to try and recreate this spinning sensation. So we can blur the boundaries of our physical body with the space around us. So you don't do it physically for real, but you imagine that it's happening. So you're kind of tricking your body in a way to think that it's moving. Make sense? Okay. Well done. Now we're going to learn the second one, which is called the Caterpillar. This technique is similar to the Roll Out in that it draws on our felt sense by remembering a movement that could trigger an exit technique. So we're going to learn how to do that now. So if you haven't already, pause the video, lie on your back in a comfortable position, and let's begin. Close your eyes, and take three deep breaths. On the exhale, dropping your awareness into the body. Becoming present, and letting yourself be in this moment. Tuning into your inner world. And allowing the breath to return to its natural pace. Slowly begin to shift your shoulder and lift your knee to edge upwards, moving towards your head quite slowly, like you're crawling on your back. Using your elbows to press into the bed or ground to shift yourself upwards. And you'll begin to notice that you shift from side to side, inching slowly up towards your head. As this happens, just tune into how it feels, notice the movement, and try to capture it to your memory. Like taking a photograph of the movement or imprinting the movement to your mind as you use your arms and legs to slowly shift up the bed or ground. Like we're inching our way out of the chrysalis like a caterpillar. You can go as slow or fast as you like. The important thing is to capture the movement to your memory. So when you feel you've done this for a couple of minutes or so, and you think that you've really captured this movement to mind, you can just bring yourself to a pause. Maybe just feel into how that felt. Inching from side to side, shifting back and forth, shuffling upwards like a caterpillar. And when you're ready, opening the eyes. Well done. Remember, when you do this later on in your practice, you don't physically move your body. We're just bringing the memory to mind of shuffling back and forth so that we can fool our body into thinking it's really happening. And if we're in that sweet spot, it will feel real. And when it does, you can keep going up and out of the body and you'll slide out a bit like the snake shedding its skin, or you might slip out very quickly. Everyone is different, but give it a go. Just for fun, here's a fact about caterpillars: did you know that when caterpillars enter the chrysalis in order to change into a butterfly, they have to let go of their caterpillar form, completely dissolve? They literally go into mushy goo, this bowl of soup. This is called the imaginal cell. Imaginal cells hold all the potential for the future, everything that they need within them to create an incredible change. That is an evolution of their previous existence. Scientists can't explain it. They literally don't know how it happens. The caterpillar goes into a complete meltdown and somehow re-forms into a beautiful butterfly. This relinquishing of form is quite similar to what we go through when we pass from the physical body to the energy body. We have to release our attachment to the physical world in order to fly in the astral. Your actions for today: listen and follow the audio to practice the Corkscrew or Caterpillar Technique. Choose one to do, unless you just want to give both a try. Remember, we're learning two so that we can double up our exit techniques later on as a way to make the most of that sweet spot to give us the best chance of entering the astral plane. Good luck, and I'll see you tomorrow.

====================

LESSON 17: Meditation - Corkscrew & Caterpillar Exit Techniques

Before we begin, limit any distractions that could pull your senses and attention outwards into the physical world. You might like to shut the curtains, close the windows and doors, wear headphones or an eye mask, and get into a comfortable position. If you would like to do this and you haven't already, pause the track now and take a moment to do this. Although we want to get to a place where we cannot feel our physical body anymore, it is okay to adjust your position or scratch an itch at any time if you need to. This is your time to awaken and practice. The skill of astral projection within you is the ability to tap into realms beyond the body. This is because you are a multidimensional being with infinite potential. With this in mind, let's begin. For now, all we're going to do is just be where we are. Just noticing where we are right now. Perhaps take three deep belly breaths to settle our body and mind. Then becoming aware of the space behind the neck, feeling the length of the spine in our back, noticing the weight of our hips sitting within our body, feeling the legs touch the bed chair or ground 

Arms hanging at the sides of us, hands and fingers loose at the end. Bringing our attention to the texture of the clothes or blankets, touching the skin and sensing the space around the body. Noticing the physical edges of ourselves, the boundary of our being. Just tuning into any feelings we might have in this moment, not needing to change or do anything about them, just being aware of how we feel right now. And lastly, in our own way, feeling the connection to the earth and the support we gain from it. Let's set a general intention here for the mind to be awake and aware and for the body to become completely relaxed. Maybe we could bring our personal motivation to mind here, our purpose, our reason why we are practicing astral projection. We allow our intention and motivation to drop into our awareness like a pebble sinking in water, letting our intention go. Now let's shift our attention to the breath. Nothing to do now, nowhere to go. Just rest, drifting in our own time into the hypnagogic state. With each outbreath, we relax deeper and deeper into a wider awareness, leaving any bodily sensations behind. For now, remembering you can come back to the body at any time, but for now, letting it go completely relaxed, completely supported, and completely safe. 

Notice how relaxed you feel and how good it is to be this relaxed your mind. Aware your body becoming weightless as it falls. Fast asleep. Staying mindfully aware whilst your body lies in space. Maintaining that soft awareness, allow your focus now to dissolve away any sensations with the body. Completely relaxed, completely supported, completely safe. Although you are deeply relaxed and maybe quite drowsy, I invite you to stay fully aware. Letting go of any remaining bodily sensations, but staying mindfully alert, remembering you can come back to the body at any point you would like to, but for now, letting it go. We might like to let it go on the outbreath. And with this outbreath, we drop deeper and deeper into a relaxed state. And if we think we're fully relaxed, let's encourage ourselves to let go even more. Tell yourself it's time to let go. If your mind drifts off, just anchor it back to the black or grayness behind your eyes or anything you can see or sense in your awareness. Just noticing what's there. And if we notice nothing, that's okay too. We're like a calm observer. Being aware of where we are, 

Paying attention to any imagery that may appear, sounds we might hear, or feelings we might have no need to judge or interpret what we notice. Just being with what is. Is there a quality to what you can see or a texture to what you can feel? Not striving to find these things, simply seeing what's there. If your thoughts drift to the past or future, just bring your mind back to whatever is happening in the present moment. Even if it's nothing, be with the nothingness. For the next couple of minutes, allow yourself to drop deeply into the hypnogogic state, and if you fall asleep, that's fine. Maybe it's what your body and mind needs. Just gently riding the hypnogogic highway and noticing what passes you by 

The following technique works best when you are deep in the mind awake, body asleep state. Although you might feel some sensations or perhaps even astral project during this guided audio. Generally, this is a dress rehearsal for when you do the technique in your own time in this way. Once you know it well, you can make the method longer or shorter and undertake it at any given moment in your practice. But for now, let's go through the steps so you can learn it, rehearse it, but most importantly, implement it when you are ready to exit the body. So imagine that you are deep in the mind awake, body asleep state. You cannot sense your body, it's gone to sleep, but your mind is awake and aware, deeply relaxed, completely calm, and totally safe. I'd like to invite you to bring to mind the memory of spinning on the spot. Feel into how this felt and tune into the sensation of turning in space. That's right. Circling slowly, like a log rolling in water. Imagine what this would feel like if it was happening right now. Remember, the astral body can move through physical matter, so nothing restricts your rotation easily and freely spinning in space like an oily cork screw. You turn with ease, 

Keep going, bringing your mind back to the sensation if the connection goes safely, spinning around and around, turning in space, remember how it felt. Tune into how it feels. If you get dizzy, that's okay. Allow the disorientation to shift you out of the body. Go with it. Let yourself be carried along by the motion. Shifting your awareness into the spinning sensation and intuitively following the flow, becoming one with the movement. When it begins to feel like you are really moving, use your intention to spin out of the body in any direction that feels right for you. Practice this for a few moments, and if your mind drifts away, that's fine. Just bring it back to a sense of turning in space, the spinning sensation. Keep going. Now whilst we're here, bring to mind the memory of inching from side to side. Feel into how this felt. Shifting from one shoulder to the other. Tune into this sensation, wriggling from side to side. Loosening the astral body from the physical one, like a caterpillar moving in its chrysalis. Imagine what it would feel like if it was happening right now. Shifting back and forth from side to side. Remember that astral body can move through physical matter, so nothing restricts your motion. 

Easily edging from side to side. Notice what this feels like. If you can't feel anything, that's okay. Bring back the memory to mind. Tuning into the sensation of inching from side to side. Keep going back and forth, back and forth. That's it. It's a bit like we're crawling on our back or crawling on our front. If you notice, only one part of your astral body is moving. Encourage the sensation to your whole being, shifting your awareness into the shuffling sensation, and when it begins to feel real moving with it. Using your intention to guide yourself out of the body. Slipping out like a caterpillar, leaving the chrysalis. Practice this for a few moments, and if your mind drifts away, that's fine. Just bring it back to a sense of shifting from side to side. Keep going. Now with no sense of rush, it's time to come back to the body. Now, back to the physical world. That's it. Make your way. Remember, you can return anytime you wish, but for now, it is time to come back to everyday reality with full recall and all senses intact. Make your way back now. Follow the sound of my voice and bring your awareness back to the body. Anything you can see or sense in your physical world, you might like to wriggle your fingers and toes or take a nice stretch when you are ready, gently opening the eyes. Welcome back. Take a moment to recall your experience and note it down in your diary. I'll see you again soon.

====================

LESSON 18: Changing Planes: Lucid Dream to Astral Projection
--------------------
<v ->Hello, astral travelers.</v> Today, we're going to talk about how we can enter the astral plane through secret doors, specifically, how we can use a lucid dream as a gateway to an out-of-body experience. On one hand, you could call this a shortcut. On another, it's a bit like trying to get through the front doors of Buckingham Palace. It's dependent on how easily and often you lucid dream. Let me explain. Firstly, what is a lucid dream? Well, it's not a vivid dream. It's not an out-of-body experience. A lucid dream is effectively a dream in which we know we are dreaming, and we're able to exert some influence over the environment. Humans have been doing this for many years. It's only been recently though, that we've realized that you can actually do some pretty powerful inner growth work with lucid dreams, including entering the astral plane. In sleep labs across the world, it's been proven that one of the best ways to evoke a lucid dream is to use the wake back to bed method. Researchers in labs found that two-thirds of their participants experienced a lucid dream after using the wake back to bed method. So although the wake back to bed method is a great tool for astral projectors, it's also an excellent tool for lucid dreamers, making lucid dreams a happy bonus and just one positive side effect from this wake back to bed method. How to check whether you are lucid dreaming. Reality checks. Lucid dreaming can feel very lifelike at times, so it's important to test whether you are dreaming or not. In a dream, to test whether or not you are actually in one, you can perform a reality check. Here's how to do it. You look at your hand, you look away, and you look back. When you look back at your hands, they will be blurry or misshapen or growing a tree. Something weird will be happening. And this is because the mind can't replicate the same image twice in quick succession. Or try to switch on a light switch on the wall. Your brain won't be able to make the light appear as quickly as you press the switch. You can also try to read the text on your mobile phone or screen in a dream. You'll find that the words are illegible. They might be jumping around or difficult to read. So what are the differences and similarities between astral projection and lucid dreaming? People often report that having an out-of-body experience feels realer than real. It feels way more than a very vivid dream. The difference is that you have the sensation of separating from the body, the exit, and you know that you're not dreaming. You have a profound gnosis that it's definitely not a dream. It can feel a little surreal and yet can be profoundly exhilarating. You can see why lucid dreaming and astral projection are sometimes mixed up, 'cause lucid dreaming can feel very real as well. However, there are some marked differences and a few similarities too. Some of the differences between lucid dreams and out-of-body experiences include the physical sensation. The onset of an OBE is characterized by a distinctive physical sensation, this moving beyond. It can include the vibrational state. So we don't have the vibrational state before you went to a lucid dream; you just suddenly know you're in a dream. But with astral projection, a lot of people pass through the vibrational state. Two, connection to your body. In an OBE, you suddenly become aware that your consciousness seems to be outside of your body. Remember, you can turn back and look at it lying there. And don't forget, we learned about the two different bodies, the difference between the dream body and the energy body; they feel and look very different. Also in a lucid dream, you know that you're in a dream, you typically accept, oh, I'm dreaming. So subjectively, the experiences are different, and you're still connected to your body because that just feels like a given. Three, awareness of the physical world. So in an out-of-body experience, you can come out of your body and you can go do experiments. You could go check a door number down the road; you can go see what your friends are getting up to. There's this sense that you can come out and you can be in objective reality here and now. Whereas a lucid dream, you arrive in the dream itself, and you're within 360 degrees of your own psychology that feels incredibly real. So in a lucid dream, you can change the environment because it's your own psyche, a bit like a video game, where you can build different villages and influence different things. In an OBE, you can't really do that, because we are entering into objective realities or other dimensions that are interacting with our own psyche, but are not fully 100% a part of it. So this is why the environments might be different. So this is also why the call and response doesn't really work in the same way. So what I mean by call and response, is in a lucid dream you could call out as I suggested, and then something would change in response to it. Whereas in an out-of-body experience, that won't really happen because it's not our own psyche that we're in to be responding. But I do want to point out something that's similar and quite subtle. Even though in an OBE, we are not sat 100% within our own psyche, it is a thought responsive environment in a way, meaning that what we think of can take us to a certain place, our intention and our will, but we can't directly change the environment too much. This also depends on what place we're in. Some places we do have some influence, as I mentioned before, but we cannot completely change it like a lucid dream. So we've looked at some differences. So now what are some similarities? In both of these experiences, we can have heightened emotions where we get insights and realizations. It can be very powerful and have an impact on the way we feel. In both of these phenomena, it might feel difficult to gauge time. There might be a sense that a few moments feel like a long time, or it might be perceived that a long time in our ordinary reality is in fact just a couple of minutes. So time can be experienced differently in both as well. It's also possible to ask for guidance and healing in both a lucid dream and an out-of-body experience. I like to use this computer analogy. It's a way of comparing the two. The lucid dream is as though you're inside the laptop of your own mind where you have access to your hard drive, the files and pictures, your memories, beliefs, and internal psychology. Whereas in astral projection, it's like going into the internet. You can visit different sites, connect to different people, and access knowledge you didn't know before. But there is a cable connecting the computer to the internet. We can use this as a gateway to go through. We can move from the boundary of our own mind, our dreaming world, into astral projection, the collective consensus realities. Let's talk about how to change planes from lucid dreaming to the astral plane. Two ways to springboard from lucidity to the astral plane is this. So, you know you're lucid, you've done your reality check, you know that you're dreaming. You're definitely not on the astral plane. You can either choose to explore the lucid dream or you can use it to springboard into astral projection. Here's how. Number one, command, "Out of body now." Make a big grand gesture, arms open, looking out. Call out to the dream space, "Out of body now!" So really strong with strong intent and will. Two is the portal technique. You're going to create a portal within the wall or the floor or in thin air in the space directly in front of you. Literally take your hand or a piece of chalk or a pen, or even use your nail and draw a portal wherever you are. Today, we are going to learn the portal technique. So this technique is only administered in the lucid dream state. A lucid dream is a dream in which we know we are dreaming. So for example, so if I was dreaming right now, it would feel and look as real as this. There's no imagining, no trying to picture anything. You are in the dream itself, in a 360-degree, high-definition virtual reality. Now when you're here, you can do various things. You can influence your environment, and you can manifest things into being. So when you get lucid, and one way to check that is by reality checking, looking at your hand, looking away, and looking back again in quick succession, your hand will change. You'll grow an extra finger, it will do something weird, it might grow a tree, because your brain can't recreate the same detailed image twice in the dream state. So when you do a reality check, you know you're dreaming because your hand changes, I'd like you to create a portal. To create a portal, you just need a wall. So it doesn't matter where you are in the dream, as long as you can get to a wall, you can do this technique. So what you do is you go up to the wall and I just use my finger, or you can use your nail. Doesn't really matter 'cause you're dreaming. You then create a circle with your finger on the wall. Now, when you do this, something might happen. A color might come out your hand. You might find that your finger traces a circle in the wall itself. But we create the circle in the wall, and then we step back and then we say, "When I pass through this portal, I will leave my physical body." We say it with strong will, strong intent, like we're actually going to go through the wall. "When I step through this portal I will leave my physical body." And then you step through the portal. I like to actually dive through it. So it might disappear, you might get a tunnel, something might happen, but go to dive, step, or jump through the portal. Now, if you don't have access to a wall, maybe you've ended up in a field somewhere in your dream, you can do the same thing on the floor. So you can create a circle with your finger on the floor, and then you can take a step back, and you can say, "When I jump into this portal, I will leave my physical body." And then you jump into the portal, and then you go through into your out-of-body experience. Now, when you go through the portal, a few things might happen. You might find you've slipped through some sort of tunnel or a wormhole, and you've traveled through time and space. It could be that you jumped straight through and you land in a different area, a different landscape altogether. Or you might find yourself in what we call the void, which is this dark, almost place of nothingness, but it's got a tangible energy to it. And that's great, because from there you can go anywhere. But if you're thinking, well, I don't really have lucid dreams. Remember, as a side effect from practicing astral projection, you might have a lucid dream. And even if you don't, you can do this same technique in the hypnagogic state. So when you're deeply in it, you begin to see hypnagogic hallucinations or you have auditory ones, you can do this portal technique. Reach your arm out; draw the portal in front of you. And in your mind you say, "When I step through this portal, I will leave my physical body." "When I step through this portal, I will exit my physical body." Choose what words are the easiest to remember and that resonate for you. Your actions for today: if you have an ongoing lucid dream practice, today I invite you to try and change planes from a lucid dream and try astral projection using the portal technique, like we just learned. If you don't have lucid dreams, you can try tonight the portal technique from the hypnagogic state. Now, this won't be quite the same because you're not in a lucid dream where it feels real and you haven't got things to touch. But what you can do is almost visualize a portal in your awareness in front of you. And if you're deep in the mind awake body asleep state, you can almost enter into that portal with strong will and intent. So you can give it a go then as well. If you'd like to start a lucid dreaming practice, you could actually take my former husband, Charlie Morley's, lucid dream quest, where he teaches you how to do it and gives you loads of tips. Okay, I will see you tomorrow. Sweet dreams.

LESSON 19: Lift Off: Exit the Body With the Levitation & Sinking Techniques
--------------------
<v ->Today, we're going to do something a bit different.</v> A bit like Alice in Wonderland, we're going to change our bodies, but instead of becoming bigger and smaller, like when she eats the tea and drinks the drink, we're going to get lighter and heavier. Are you ready? Today, we'll be covering an exit technique called levitation and sinking. The idea is to shift your energy body out of your physical body using retrospective memory and active imagination to suggest to the body that you're levitating above it or sinking below it. You will develop a buoyant floating motion to alternate between the two. It's also great practice for tuning into and controlling your energy body. We will go through the technique step by step so that you become familiar with it. Later, when you're prompted via the audio to do the technique, your mind has less figuring out to do, and it can just follow along. If we do it now, we might get some tingles or floaty sensations, but it generally won't work unless we're in an altered state. Let's walk through it now. Levitation technique. When we are deep in the Mind Awake Body Asleep State or hovering on the cusp of sleep, we're going to do this. Vividly, as much as you can, imagine that you could become very light and floaty, so much so that you rise above your bed. If we struggle to do this, we might imagine clouds are coming underneath us, under our arms and legs, to lift us out or a beautiful waterfall is flooding into our room as we float up with the rising water. Then, we're going to focus on the floating sensation, being suspended in the air. Make it as vivid as you can. Try to convince yourself that you're actually floating. This is your experience; it's happening. In your imagination, float up fairly quickly. Don't dawdle. You might even whoosh up in a sudden blurring motion as the clouds lift you up or the water swiftly rises. Float as light as a feather. Here's the secret: the quicker you imagine moving, the less time your brain has to decide whether or not it's actually happening. We don't want to give our brain any time to sort out whether this motion is real or imagined. It's just forced to accept what you're telling it. What you're doing here is using your imagination to override everything your brain accepts as reality. Up to this point, your experience is that you reside in your physical body, but your imagination is telling you to ignore all of that and accept a different mode of perception, an out-of-body perception. For some people, this is enough to propel them out into an out-of-body state. You might find that you enter the vibrational state or that you exit the body right away. This could feel like you're floating above it or that you've shifted onto another plane and that your energy body is now upright. It depends what environment you exit into. Remember not to question too much. Just go wherever you find yourself; surrender. Straight after this, we will go into the sinking technique. Now, if you find yourself out of body, feel free to go on a journey and explore. Do your projection plan. You don't have to hang back and follow me in the audio if you're headed out on an adventure. But if you didn't get any of those exit sensations that I just mentioned, you can go straight into the sinking technique. Personally, I have more success with this one. When I sink out through my back, it feels like falling through thick space in slow motion. There's a gravity to it of sorts. But spacetime feels different. Sometimes, I sink back through the bed and then roll out from underneath it into my room. Other times, it's like I'm falling out my back, but then suddenly, I'm kind of going sideways or down or up, head first. It's like dropping through the universe in different ways. Whatever happens to you, let go; surrender to the flow. So let's learn the sinking technique. With this one, we imagine that we're sinking down, down, down. Our energy body goes right through the chair or bed. We pretend that we're so heavy, dropping like an anchor of a ship to the sea floor or a sand bag from a hot air balloon dropping down. You are released from your physical body in this moment as we go down and down. We imagine how it would feel to pass through the bed, which we move through with ease. Perhaps, you feel the coils of the spring here or you sink all the way through, but we want to bring on this sense of falling and going backwards. So how do we switch between the two? If we haven't exited at either point, we can keep switching between the two techniques until one of 'em begins to feel real, and then, boom, we're out. To go from one to the other, when you've sunk back and you've reached the floor, imagine you're incredibly light again, like a beach ball underwater popping upwards above your body. Keep alternating between floating up and then sinking back down below your body, floating up, and then back down, between extreme lightness and extreme heaviness. Try this at a pace which feels right for you. Once you have tried five or six times, practice with different speeds. You might find you have more success with a quicker or slower pace. Don't forget, it's a great practice for tuning into and controlling your energy body. Now, you might get some side effects, so I want to point out what these are so if they do happen, you know that they're normal. The first one is a bit of motion sickness. Because we're imagining moving up and dropping down, this means that it might make you feel a little bit sick or nauseous. This is normal, and if it happens, just slow the process down; take your time. Or if it's too much, just take a break, and then try again later. The second thing that might happen is you might spontaneous bring on the vibrational state. This is due to attempting to shift out of the body, which is great. Do an exit technique from here, such as the roll out, or intuitively follow the vibrations. Number three is that you might feel that something is expanding beyond your body, but you are remaining where you are. What's happening here is that you are expanding your energy out or you can make it smaller, which is great. This is an energy technique, so you're doing something related to energy, but you're not quite moving into an exit technique itself. To do this, you need to shift your self-awareness, your perception, out with the expansion, so you don't feel that you're just projecting something, but you're actually going out with it. So if this is my physical body and this is my eye, I would want this to go out with it rather than feeling just a sense of expansion beyond. Give yourself a pat on your astral back because this week, you've learned many exit techniques, but also, you now know how to alchemize lucid dreaming and sleep paralysis into astral projection. Now, that's quite advanced stuff to be honest. So if you've never experienced those things before, don't worry; it's something that you could explore later in your journey. But don't forget, as a side effect, you might end up in a lucid dream or enter sleep paralysis, so it's good to know what to do just in case. So here are your actions for today: this evening, get your audio ready to go so that in the morning, when your alarm goes off, you can play the track right away. Do not open your eyes or move your body, as much as you can. You want to remain very sleepy. Then, play the track and follow along. Good luck and I will see you tomorrow.

====================

LESSON 19: Meditation - Levitation & Sinking Exit Techniques

Before we begin, limit any distractions that could pull your senses and attention outwards into the physical world. You might like to shut the curtains, close the windows and doors, wear headphones or an eye mask, and get into a comfortable position. If you would like to do this and you haven't already, pause the track now and take a moment to do this. Although we want to get to a place where we cannot feel our physical body anymore, it is okay to adjust your position or scratch an itch at any time if you need to. This is your time to awaken and practice. The skill of astral projection within you is the ability to tap into realms beyond the body. This is because you are a multidimensional being with infinite potential. With this in mind, let's begin. This audio uses hypnosis techniques and active imagination to stimulate the vibrational state. And if you experience this state today or feel close to it, this may be a new sensation for you. So remember, be open to whatever occurs. You can always return to your bodily sensations at any time, just as you would during an actual out of body experience. Now keep your eyes open for the time being and just check in with the motivation for your practice. Take a moment to recall why you would like to astral project. 

Now take three deep belly breaths in through your nose and slowly out through your mouth. And while you're taking these deep breaths, set an intention to relax your body fully and stay mindfully aware for the duration of this guided session. 

Now that you are nicely settled down, I'd like you to look up and find a spot to fix your gaze. Maybe a mark on the wall or ceiling, something that's not directly in front of you, but slightly above your eye line. If you are laying down or propped up with cushions, just be careful not to overstretch your neck in any way. You're just looking very slightly above the eye line, so you shouldn't need to tilt your head back very much at all. And from this moment on, just fix your gaze on that spot and on that spot alone. And as you do this, you will find very quickly that your vision will get hazier and hazier as your eyes get tired and sleepy. Until soon, they will be closed. But for now, keep them open and you will be drifting into a very pleasant, relaxed condition very soon. 

But for now, I'd just like you to keep your eyes focused on that point for a little while. And while you listen to the sound of my voice, keep your eyes focused on that point. And soon you'll notice your eyes blinking. Blinking is fine, blinking is good as you keep your eyes on that same spot. Now I don't want you to close your eyes, but just keep them fixed on that spot whilst you concentrate on my voice and your eyes might water a bit or feel a little blurry, and that's okay. Remember, blinking is good, and these sensations are all just temporary. 

And while you are doing this, you will find your vision is getting hazier and hazier. As your eyes get tired and sleepy, soon they will be closed and you'll just drift into a very pleasant relaxation. It doesn't matter if your mind wanders a little, you can always bring it back to the sound of my voice. Just be comfortable. And when you find that it would be so nice to just let those eyes close all on their own, you can stop trying to keep them open. Close your eyes now. See how comfortable they are when you let them go and relax. 

Settle yourself. Write down and just let yourself drift gently and easily into relaxation. As I count slowly up to seven, I will start that count for you now. One, relax and already you can feel yourself calming down, becoming much more relaxed now, beginning to drift away. Two, relax. You're feeling comfortable, beginning to feel peaceful too. Just feel into that relaxation, working its way through your body, bringing every part of you to rest. Three, relax. And now just breathe a little slower and deeper. And each deep breath you take is making you more and more relaxed. Settling yourself right down. 

Four, relax. Just feel your whole body getting heavier and heavier now almost as though you are sinking, pleasantly down, singing into sheer comfort, body asleep, mind awake as each deep breath you take relaxes you more and more. Five, relax. You are feeling drowsier and drowsier, tired and sleepy body. Now mind aware and calm, body relaxed. Six, relax. Every part of your body is coming to rest. Now settling down into sheer comfort, body feeling tired, sleepy, calm and at peace, mind gently aware. Seven, relax. Just continue drifting now deeper and deeper into that relaxation. Resting so comfortably Now you are deeply calm and relaxed, focused and aware. In fact, you are feeling so relaxed and so at peace that you notice you are becoming very light. Imagine you are weightless, like your body is floating in clear, calm water. You become lighter and lighter. It feels peaceful and safe. So you let go. You let go of anything that might be weighing you down. Imagine these things are like sandbags, dropping away from a hot air balloon. Anything heavy just falls away now no need to carry it. You can just set it down and let it go. 

As you let go of these heavy things, you become lighter and lighter and lighter. Feel into how weightless you are, how free you are. You are so light. Now that you feel a sense of hovering an inch or two out of the body, remind yourself you feel safe and serene. Here. It's as if you are floating on a beautiful cloud made just for you. Fluffy clouds are gathering under your arms, legs, hips and head floating you just above the body which lies resting safely, beneath. Enjoy how relaxing this floating sensation is. Knowing you can return at any point you decide to float a little higher, gently drifting upwards, going with the flow, but always in control. You float higher and higher and higher like a feather on the breeze. Tune into a sense of floating upwards so high. Now that you choose to have a look around, see or feel where you are, perhaps you look back at your body lying peacefully below you, you decide to return to your body. This is a flying visit and you can always come here again later in your own way. Go back down to your body. Now. 

Full awareness is back in the body, settled in, calm and relaxed. Imagine yourself becoming very heavy now sinking into a big bed of cozy cushions. It's the softest, most comfortable bed you have ever laid in. So you lean back like you don't have a care in the world. Lean back. As the bed cradles you allow it to hold your weight. As you sink deeper and deeper, dropping down, down, down. The further you go, the more relaxed you become. Like sinking into a field of flowers, you become even heavier As you drop downwards, embrace the heaviness and let yourself fall backwards out of the body like a pebble sinking in water. Remind yourself that you are completely safe and always in control. Allow yourself to descend even deeper down. Surrender to gravity, gently pulling you back until you find yourself dropping away from the body. If you haven't already drop away from the body. Now remembering, you can return at any point you wish. Take a few moments to have a look around. 

You might like to look back at your body from wherever you are. You can visit here at any time, but for now, go back to the body. It's waiting for you. You make your ascent higher and higher, feeling lighter and lighter. As you make your way back. You are like a helium balloon rising up into the sky as you float back to your physical body. When you reach your body, it's like breaking the surface of water. As you phase back in, take a big breath as you reenter the physical world. Finding yourself refreshed with full awareness. All senses returned. You are back in your physical body. Bring your attention to the environment around you. Anything you can see or sense in your bodily awareness. Notice in the atmosphere, things you can feel or sounds in the room you might like to wriggle. Your fingers and toes will take a nice stretch. And with no sense of rush, opening the eyes, welcome back.

====================

LESSON 20: Wake-Back-To-Bed: Create Your Own Ganzfeld Experiment
--------------------
<v ->Today, I'm going to teach you a technique</v> on how to tune in and strengthen your polyphasic perception. This is the same type of perception that we're honing for our astral eyes. Polyphasic perception is ways of knowing information other than through the five senses. You might like to think of it as extrasensory perception or perhaps even a sort of psychic ability. The Ganzfeld experiment tests a person's extrasensory abilities such as intuition, telepathy, psychometry, and clairvoyance, and precognition. It helps one to tune in to what's called a sixth sense or a second sight. The power to perceive things that are not present to the five senses but whereby a person can perceive information in the form of a vision, a future event, things before they happen, or at a remote location, such as remote viewing. This not only helps us to develop these abilities for and within astral projection, but if we get into the Mind Awake Body Asleep State during the experiment, we can harness the Ganzfeld effect to springboard into an OBE. It was first used by Charles Honorton when investigating telepathy in waking and dreaming states at the Maimonides Medical Center in New York. The procedure involved placing the participant, who was called the receiver, in a chair and inducing a state of reduced sensory input. This is believed to remove the sensory noise of everyday life which may mask or weaken the telepathy signal. This state is achieved by covering the participant's eyes with halved ping pong balls, with a red light shining on them to create a homogenized visual field, as well as playing white noise through a headset at the same time. The sender, a participant in another room, or in some cases, the computer in the autoganzfeld studies, is given a randomly selected target picture which they attempt to transmit to the receiver. The receiver is asked to describe any images that they might see within their awareness. The receiver's description is then compared to the target. And this is usually independent by a panel of judges who don't know about the experiment's objectives or the target. Now, we aren't going to do this specific experiment. I just wanted to give you an idea of how it's been used in the past so you can see how it works. But what we are going to do is create our own Ganzfeld experiment and see if we can launch into the astral planes from there. This is pretty exciting. Okay, here's what you need to do it: a ping pong ball, tape, a bright solid light that can flood the whole room, your face as much as possible. Otherwise, it won't work. Headphones, preferably noise-canceling ones, and an uninterrupted static white noise. So you can use the audio track for this. So what do we need to do? We want to cut the ping pong ball in half; shape the half balls to our face so that it covers the eyes without leaving any gaps around the edges of our visual field. You don't want to see any of your room. This is really important. Then we want to turn on the light to fill the room so it's a solid, uniform, bright light. Then, we want to sit and lie down in a comfortable position, just like we would do for our practice. Then we put the headphones on, and we play the static white noise. We want to cover each eye with a ping pong ball and hold it in place with tape. From here, it's just a case of relaxing. So you might like to do the 4-7-8 breath, the tension exercise, or anything you can do to relax. After a short amount of time, sights and sounds and perceptions might arise as your mind starts to fill in the blank space of the uniform sensory field, AKA create hallucinations, similar to the hypnagogic and hypnopompic imagery. In fact, you might find that this is even more vivid than those states. Then, I'd like you to do an exit technique to springboard from this state into astral projection. So before you start, choose two exit techniques that you would like to practice, because remember, we'll be doubling them up, and we'll do this when we do the experiment. When you begin to not feel your body anymore and you enter the Mind Awake Body Asleep State, along with any visuals that you might perceive from the Ganzfeld effect, I want you to do your exit technique. Your actions for today: create your own Ganzfeld experiment for astral projection. Remember, set this up in the way that I've explained, and you can do this at any point in the day, before you go to bed, or if you're feeling really enthusiastic, you can do it as a wake back to bed method which is one of the best times to do it. So, if you want more powerful results, do it in the early hours of the morning. But don't forget, write down your experience, and share it with the tribe. I'll see you tomorrow.

====================

LESSON 20: Meditation - Ganzfeld Experiment

Welcome back. Choose an exit technique you wish to practice for this session. The music will continue and eventually phase out, leaving you to continue your journey or wake up when you're ready. You will hear this sound. When we hear this sound, we do not open our eyes or move our body. We just bring our attention. Back to the task at hand. Let's begin. you With no sense of rush. It's time to come back to the body now. Back to the physical world. That's it. Make your way. Remember, you can return anytime you wish. But for now, it's time to come back to everyday reality. With full recall. and all senses intact. Make your way back now. Follow the sound of my voice, and bring your awareness back to the body. Anything you can see or sense in your physical world. You might like to wriggle your fingers and toes, or take a nice stretch. When you are ready, gently opening the eyes. Welcome back. Take a moment to recall your experience and note it down in your diary. I'll see you again soon. 

====================

LESSON 21: Summary of Your Third Week
--------------------
<v ->Hello, and welcome back.</v> You've now got a bag of exit techniques which you can draw from and play with at any time. Today, we're going to do something really fun. We're going to look at how to do therapeutic tremoring. Therapeutic tremoring is also known as shaking therapy. It's a phrase coined by Dr. David Berceli. This involves shaking the body to release tension and trauma. It helps to regulate the nervous system. Have you ever seen a dog or a cat shake something off? Rainwater, a buildup of stress after a cat fight, or being prodded by the vet. They shake the tip of their nose to the end of their tail and almost immediately recover from something physically or emotionally uncomfortable. You might have seen this in a nature documentary where the lion is hunting the antelope. It escapes, and then it shudders afterwards, releasing the stress of the chase. We too, like all animals, have the ability to do this. We shake involuntary after intense experiences, like being in an accident, giving birth, or public speaking. And we often tell people to stop shaking, but it's the shaking it off that is actually a valid thing to do for your nervous system. We've been socially conditioned to grin and bear it. But this isn't natural, and it traps the stress in our bodies. And this can impact our health in the long term. Trauma expert, Steve Haines, explains, "We don't shake because we're traumatized, we shake as a response." It's a very primitive mechanism to reset muscle tension from a stuck state to release stress and to enhance the mind-body connection. Effectively, it encourages the body to return back to a state of balance. We're going to learn how to do this for two purposes in astral projection. The first is called the exhaustion method. We physically exhaust our body as a way to help it fall asleep faster, so we can enter the Mind Awake Body Asleep State more quickly. This is great for anyone who struggles to relax or settle their mind because it exhausts the body and then eases our psyche. The other reason is that it gets us back in our bodies. So when we come back from an emotional out-of-body experience, perhaps we've received a message, had a realization, or even encountered a dead loved one, naturally, we might feel quite overwhelmed. So it's a useful way to embody the experience and bring us back into the physical world. So therapeutic tremoring can be done before an OBE for deep relaxation, or after an OBE for embodiment and grounding. Let's practice it together now. It's simply shaking the body in different ways. So we're going to go through all the limbs, one by one, adding them together until we're shaking everything at once. Now, we all have different bodies and shake in different ways. So there's no right or wrong way to do it. But I do want you to shake everything as energetically as you can. Follow me and I will guide you. And then towards the end, you can do your own thing. Improvise, freestyle, dance it out. Welcome to the therapeutic tremoring exercise. So just start by shaking one hand. Perfect, great start. Bring in the other hand. There you go. Maybe let's go forward and back. Like we're flicking the hands, flicking away all our stresses, all our worries. Up to the ceiling. Maybe out to the side. Maybe a little bit faster. Take it down to the floor. Shoulders. Little bit quicker maybe. Maybe a little quicker. Side to side even. Forwards and back. Really nice, good. Taking it to the hips. Shaking in any which way you want. Remember, you can't get this wrong. Maybe add a little bounce. Taking it to one leg. However you like, let your foot hang loose. Give it a little shake. Changing legs. Okay, are you ready to do everything together? Hands, arms, shoulders, chest, hips, knees, feet, go around in a circle. Moving to the side. Traveling around the room. Freestyle, move in any which way, shaking your body across the room, wherever you like, okay? You ready? Three, two, one, shake it out. Keep going. I know you're tired, but just keep it going. Extra energy for the last few moments. Keep shaking it out. You're doing so well. Well done, everybody, I know you're tired. You're supposed to be. This is why it's so good for the Mind Awake Body Asleep State. Oh, side note here, when you do this on your own, you can do it with or without music. If I'm going to do it as part of the exhaustion method, I find a bit of music helps to get me going. Your actions for today: feel free to repeat the exercise and build it into your practice if it resonated with you. Have fun, and I will see you next week.

====================

LESSON 21: Meditation - Bonus: MABA & Choice of Exit - Option 1

<silence> 

Welcome back. I'm now going to guide you through some exercises to bring on the mind awake body, sleep state, and trigger the vibrational state. Before we begin, choose an exit technique you wish to practice for this session. You will be prompted to do it at the end. After this, the music will continue and eventually phase out, leaving you to continue your journey or wake up when you are ready. If at any point during the audio you feel vibrations or sense, the time is right to exit the body, then go with your intuition. It's okay to steer away from the audio if you need to. 

Everyone's experience will be different, so release expectations, be open, and remember, there is no right or wrong. We're each finding our own way. What we're doing here is preparing our mind and body so that it becomes familiar with the wide spectrum of these states. Building the best habits for astral projection. You will hear this sound after each exercise. This sound helps to bring us back if we have lost awareness. When we hear this sound, we do not open our eyes or move our body. We just bring our attention back to the task at hand. Okay, then let's begin. For now, all we're going to do is just be where we are. Just noticing where we are right now. Perhaps take three deep belly breaths to settle our body and mind. Then becoming aware of the space behind the neck, feeling the length of the spine in our back, noticing the weight of our hips sitting within our body, feeling the legs touch the bed chair or ground arms hanging at the sides of us, hands and fingers loose at the end. Bringing our attention to the texture of the clothes or blankets, touching the skin and sensing the space around the body. Noticing the physical edges of ourselves, the boundary of our being. 

Just tuning into any feelings we might have in this moment, not needing to change or do anything about them, just being aware of how we feel right now. And lastly, in our own way, feeling the connection to the earth and the support we gain from it. Let's set a general intention here for the mind to be awake and aware and for the body to become completely relaxed. Next, maybe we could bring our personal motivation to mind here, our purpose, our reason why we are practicing astral projection. We allow our intention and motivation to drop into our awareness like a pebble sinking in water, letting our intention go. Now let's shift our attention to the breath. Let's bring a memory to mind. Now think back to a time where you were safely wrapped in a warm blanket. Connect back to the sensations of being draped in its soft material. How does this make you feel? Imagine this cozy blanket melts into you like sugar in a hot chocolate. It 

As soon as the soft blanket melts into your being, another one appears. You are being bathed in comfortable blankets. Feel them pervading to your being. This continual supply of warm blankets eases your mind and relaxes your soul. Take a moment to bask in the blankets they're yours. Now, either out loud or in your head, I'd like to invite you to repeat the following affirmation After me, we will do this twice. Ready? I awaken the ability of astral projection to be in service of myself and others. I do this with courage and compassion. I awaken the ability of astral projection to be in service of myself and others. I do this with courage and compassion. 

Take a moment now to create your energy balloon, a sphere of energy that surrounds and protects you on your journey. You might like to imagine this like flowing water, rushing into your feet like a river, running up your central channel and spraying out the top of your head like a fountain. With this, do a short inhale and a longer exhale When you breathe in, visualize or feel yourself drawing in this fresh energy through your feet and up the center of your body. When you breathe out, visualize or feel it spraying out the top of your head and all around you flowing in with the in-breath, spraying out with the out breath. As it falls all around you, it begins to form a protective bubble. You are becoming calm and centered within your own energy or flowing in with the in breath and spraying out with the out breath. As it sweeps through, it clears away any stuck or stagnant energy detoxifying your system and cleansing the astral body, flowing in with the in breath and spraying out with the out breath. Repeat this process in your own time for a few moments, the sphere around you getting stronger and stronger with each flow. 

Very good. You may stop drawing in the energy. Now your sphere is strong and stable. Tune into it surrounding you. Now imprint a symbol or image that represents protection onto your bubble. This can be anything that expresses safety and security to you. Well done. Now, let's lock the sphere around us by using the following command. Only that of benevolent energy may enter. If you'd like to repeat this in your mind after me, only that of benevolent energy may enter. Only that of benevolent energy may enter. Only that of benevolent energy may enter. You are now completely safe and totally protected. Nothing to do now, nowhere to go. Just rest, drifting in our own time into the hypnagogic state. With each outbreath, we relax deeper and deeper into a wider awareness, leaving any bodily sensations behind. For now, remembering you can come back to the body at any time, but for now, letting it go completely relaxed, completely supported, and completely safe. Notice how relaxed you feel and how good it is to be this relaxed your mind aware your body becoming weightless as it falls. Fast asleep. Staying mindfully aware whilst your body lies in space. Maintaining that soft awareness allow your focus now to dissolve away any sensations with the body. 

Completely relaxed, completely supported, completely safe. Although you are deeply relaxed and maybe quite drowsy, I invite you to stay fully aware, letting go of any remaining bodily sensations, but stay mindfully alert. Remembering you can come back to the body at any point you would like to, but for now, letting it go. We might like to let it go on the outbreath, and with this out breath, we drop deeper and deeper into a relaxed state, and if we think we're fully relaxed, let's encourage ourselves to let go even more. Tell yourself it's time to let go. If your mind drifts off, just anchor it back to the black or grayness behind your eyes or anything you can see or sense in your awareness. Just noticing what's there, and if we notice nothing, that's okay too. We're like a calm observer. Being aware of where we are, paying attention to any imagery that may appear, sounds we might hear, or feelings we might have no need to judge or interpret what we notice. Just being with what is. Is there a quality to what you can see or a texture to what you can feel? Not striving to find these things. Simply seeing what's there. 

If your thoughts drift to the past or future, just bring your mind back to whatever is happening in the present moment. Even if it's nothing, be with the nothingness. For the next couple of minutes, allow yourself to drop deeply into the hypnogogic state, and if you fall asleep, that's fine. Maybe it's what your body and mind needs. Just gently riding the hypnogogic highway and noticing what passes you by 

In this peaceful state, you notice in your mind's eye a flickering dot far in the distance. It looks or feels like a tiny speck of light, and it's slowly floating towards you. As it gets closer, you see or feel that it's a beautiful, pure white light. You know that somehow it's come to age your journey. It drifts nearer sparkling with crystal clear rays of light, and you begin to notice that it beams with a powerful energy. Perhaps you can sense this energy, hear it, see it, or feel it, and as it gets closer, you can sense a healing vibrational quality to it. Don't worry if you can't clearly see or sunset, just tap into the white light in any way that feels natural to you. As it makes its way over becoming bigger and bigger, you start to feel energy radiating from it. You sense that it's safe and welcoming. How does this feel? Much closer. Now the light has become bigger, and you notice that at its core it carries a powerful charge. As it travels towards you, you begin to feel into its magnetic quality. It drifts closer and closer, becoming bigger and bigger until finally, it pauses right in front of you. You have a good feeling about it, and you are open to what it has to offer. Slowly, the white light begins to pour into you through your forehead, just above your brow, opening up your innate perception. It's a gateway to your higher consciousness. Feel this powerful pure white light flooding your body and being. 

Imagine the light enters all your cells, clearing out any restrictions or blocks that might be holding you back from astral travel. The wonderful light weaves in and out of every fiber, every muscle, releasing all the doubts and all the fears which simply dissolve away. Feel your limitations leaving your body and mind by being absorbed into the pure white light. You notice the light begins to travel down your legs towards your feet, gathering all its energy. In along the way. It begins to pulsate at your feet like a sound wave. Vibrations penetrating through like a speaker at your toes. Feel this vibration reverberate through your feet. 

This wave of vibration begins to travel up your body now like a strong tide, pulling in and out of the shore. Feel it past their ankles, calves, knees, thighs, hips, stomach, arms, chest, shoulders, neck and head. Before ricocheting, back down the body from the head, neck, shoulders, chest, arms, stomach, hips, thighs, knees, calves, ankles, and feet like a laser beam scanning your body. Now this vibrating wave of energy begins to travel back up again past the calves, knees, thighs, hips, stomach, chest, arms, shoulders, neck and head where it reverberates back down again from the head, neck, shoulders, chest, arms, stomach, hips, thighs, knees, calves, ankles, and feet. Feel into the wave of vibration, getting stronger and stronger, faster and faster. As it makes its way up and down the body from head to toe, feet, ankles, calves, knees, thighs, hips, stomach, arms, chest, shoulders, neck, head, neck, shoulders, chest, arms, stomach, hips, thighs and knees, calves, ankles, feet. You know it's safe. So you surrender to the vibrations and they become stronger and stronger, up and down and up and down it goes. Continue to whip the wave up and down your body in your own time. Now becoming faster and faster. Vibrations more and more. More and more. 

Feel it pinballing back and forth, back and forth, shooting up and down and up and down the body. Ever increasing in power and speed. Pulsations powering stronger and stronger and stronger. Becoming so fast, so strong, so intense. Now that this wave of energy engulfs your whole body with vibration, feel it flooding your entire being. Encourage the vibrations to become more and more. Then intuitively follow them out of the body or do your chosen exit technique. Encourage the vibrations to become more and more. Then intuitively follow them out of the body or do your chosen exit technique and then go on your journey With no sense of rush, it's time to come back to the body. Now, back to the physical world. That's it. Make your way. Remember, you can return any time you wish, but for now, it is time to come back to everyday reality with full recall and all senses intact. Make your way back now. Follow the sound of my voice and bring your awareness back to the body. Anything you can see or sense in your physical world, you might like to wriggle your fingers and toes, or take a nice stretch when you are ready, gently opening the eyes. Welcome back. Take a moment to recall your experience and note it down in your diary. I'll see you again soon.

====================

LESSON 21: Meditation - Bonus: MABA & Choice of Exit - Option 2

Welcome back. I'm now going to guide you through some exercises to bring on the mind awake body, sleep state, and trigger the vibrational state. Before we begin, choose an exit technique you wish to practice for this session. You will be prompted to do it at the end. After this, the music will continue and eventually phase out, leaving you to continue your journey or wake up when you are ready. If at any point during the audio you feel vibrations or sense the time is right to exit the body, then go with your intuition. It's okay to steer away from the audio if you need to. 

Everyone's experience will be different, so release expectations, be open, and remember, there is no right or wrong. We're each finding our own way. What we're doing here is preparing our mind and body so that it becomes familiar with the wide spectrum of these states. Building the best habits for astral projection. You will hear this sound after each exercise. This sound helps to bring us back if we have lost awareness. When we hear this sound, we do not open our eyes or move our body. We just bring our attention back to the task at hand. Okay, then let's begin. For now, all we're going to do is just be where we are. Just noticing where we are right now. Perhaps take three deep belly breaths to settle our body and 

Mind. 

Then becoming aware of the space behind the neck, feeling the length of the spine in our back, noticing the weight of our hips sitting within our body, feeling the legs touch the bed chair or ground arms hanging at the sides of us hands and fingers loose at the end. Bringing our attention to the texture of the clothes or blankets, touching the skin and sensing the space around the body. Noticing the physical edges of ourselves, the boundary of our being. Just tuning into any feelings we might have in this moment, not needing to change or do anything about them, just being aware of how we feel right now. And lastly, in our own way, feeling the connection to the earth and the support we gain from it. Let's set a general intention here for the mind to be awake and aware and for the body to become completely relaxed. Next, maybe we could bring our personal motivation to mind here, our purpose, our reason why we are practicing astral projection. We allow our intention and motivation to drop into our awareness like a pebble sinking in water, letting our intention go. Now let's shift our attention to the breath. 

Let's bring a memory to mind. Now think back to a time where you were safely wrapped in a warm blanket. Connect back to the sensations of being draped in its soft material. How does this make you feel? Imagine this cozy blanket melts into you like sugar in a hot chocolate lit. 

As soon as the soft blanket melts into your being, another one appears. You are being bathed in comfortable blankets. Feel them pervading to your being. This continual supply of warm blankets eases your mind and relaxes your soul. Take a moment to bask in the blankets they're yours. Now, either out loud or in your head, I'd like to invite you to repeat the following affirmation After me, we will do this twice. Ready? I awaken the ability of astral projection to be in service of myself and others. I do this with courage and compassion. I awaken the ability of astral projection to be in service of myself and others. I do this with courage and compassion. 

Take a moment now to create your energy balloon, a sphere of energy that surrounds and protects you on your journey. You might like to imagine this like flowing water, rushing into your feet like a river, running up your central channel and spraying out the top of your head like a fountain. With this, do a short inhale and a longer exhale When you breathe in, visualize or feel yourself drawing in this fresh energy through your feet and up the center of your body. When you breathe out, visualize or feel it spraying out the top of your head and all around you flowing in with the inbreath, spraying out with the outbreath. As it falls all around you, it begins to form a protective bubble. You are becoming calm and centered within your own energy or flowing in with the in breath and spraying out with the out breath. As it sweeps through, it clears away any stuck or stagnant energy detoxifying your system and cleansing the astral body, flowing in with the in breath and spraying out with the out breath. Repeat this process in your own time for a few moments. The sphere around you getting stronger and stronger with each flow. 

Very good. You may stop drawing in the energy. Now your sphere is strong and stable. Tune into it surrounding you. Now imprint a symbol or image that represents protection onto your bubble. This can be anything that expresses safety and security to you. Well done. Now, let's lock the sphere around us by using the following command. Only that of benevolent energy may enter. If you'd like to repeat this in your mind after me, only that of benevolent energy may enter. Only that of benevolent energy may enter. Only that of benevolent energy may enter. Yuan, you are now completely safe and totally protected. Nothing to do now, nowhere to go. Just rest, drifting in our own time into the hypnagogic state. With each outbreath we relax deeper and deeper into a wider awareness, leaving any bodily sensations behind. For now, remembering you can come back to the body at any time, but for now, letting it go completely relaxed, completely supported, and completely safe. Notice how relaxed you feel and how good it is to be this relaxed your mind aware your body becoming weightless as it falls. Fast asleep. Staying mindfully aware whilst your body lies in space. Maintaining that soft awareness allow your focus now to dissolve away any sensations with the body. Completely relaxed, completely supported, completely safe. Although you are deeply relaxed and maybe quite drowsy, I invite you to stay fully aware. Letting go of any remaining bodily sensations, but stay mindfully alert. 

Remembering you can come back to the body at any point you would like to, but for now, letting it go. We might like to let it go on the outbreath. And with this out breath, we drop deeper and deeper into a relaxed state. And if we think we're fully relaxed, let's encourage ourselves to let go even more. Tell yourself it's time to let go. If your mind drifts off, just anchor it back to the black or grayness behind your eyes or anything you can see or sense in your awareness. Just noticing what's there. And if we notice nothing, that's okay too. We're like a calm observer. Being aware of where we are, paying attention to any imagery that may appear sounds we might hear, or feelings we might have no need to judge or interpret what we notice. Just being with what is. Is there a quality to what you can see or a texture to what you can feel? Not striving to find these things, simply seeing what's there. Uh, if your thoughts drift to the past or future, just bring your mind back to whatever is happening in the present moment. Even if it's nothing, be with the nothingness. 

For the next couple of minutes, allow yourself to drop deeply into the hypnogogic state. And if you fall asleep, that's fine. Maybe it's what your body and mind needs. Just gently riding the hypnogogic highway and noticing what passes you by 

In this peaceful state, you notice in your mind's eye a flickering dot far in the distance. It looks or feels like a tiny speck of light, and it's slowly floating towards you. As it gets closer, you see or feel that it's a beautiful, pure white light. You know that somehow it's come to age your journey. It drifts nearer sparkling with crystal clear rays of light, and you begin to notice that it beams with a powerful energy. Perhaps you can sense this energy, hear it, see it, or feel it. And as it gets closer, you can sense a healing vibrational quality to it. Don't worry if you can't clearly see or sense it. Just tap into the white light in any way that feels natural to you. As it makes its way over becoming bigger and bigger, you start to feel energy radiating from it. You sense that it's safe and welcoming. How does this feel? Much closer. Now the light has become bigger, and you notice that at its core it carries a powerful charge. As it travels towards you, you begin to feel into its magnetic quality.

Feel your limitations leaving your body and mind by being absorbed into the pure white light. You notice the light begins to travel down your legs towards your feet, gathering all its energy. In along the way. It begins to pull ate at your feet like a sound wave. Vibrations penetrating through like a speaker at your toes. Feel this vibration reverberate through your feet. 

This wave of vibration begins to travel up your body now like a strong tide, pulling in and out of the shore. Feel it past their ankles, calves, knees, thighs, hips, stomach, arms, chest, shoulders, neck and head. Before ricocheting, back down the body from the head, neck, shoulders, chest, arms, stomach, hips, thighs, knees, calves, ankles, and feet like a laser beam scanning your body. Now this vibrating wave of energy begins to travel back up again past the calves, knees, thighs, hips, stomach, chest, arms, shoulders, neck and head where it reverberates back down again from the head, neck, shoulders, chest, arms, stomach, hips, thighs, knees, calves, ankles, and feet.

As it makes its way up and down the body from head to toe, feet, ankles, calves, knees, thighs, hips, stomach, arms, chest, shoulders, neck, head, neck, shoulders, chest, arms, stomach, hips, thighs and knees, calves, ankles, feet. You know it's safe. So you surrender to the vibrations and they become stronger and stronger, up and down and up and down it goes. Continue to whip the wave up and down your body in your own time. Now becoming faster and faster. Vibrations more and more. More and more. 

Feel it pinballing back and forth, back and forth, shooting up and down and up and down the body. Ever increasing in power and speed. Pulsations powering stronger and stronger and stronger. Becoming so fast, so strong, so intense. Now that this wave of energy engulfs your whole body with vibration, feel it flooding your entire being. Encourage the vibrations to become more and more. Then intuitively follow them out of the body or do your chosen exit technique. Encourage the vibrations to become more and more. Then intuitively follow them out of the body or do your chosen exit technique and then go on your journey.

Week 4: Explore the Astral Realms

====================

LESSON 22: Encountering Other Travelers & Meeting Ancestors
--------------------
<v ->Welcome back travelers.</v> Did you shake it off? I hope so. If you haven't had a full-blown OBE yet, don't worry. Remember it's considered a siddha, a superpower, in many spiritual traditions. So it takes time. In fact, it took me four weeks of practice before I had my first adult one, and it took William Buhlman, the lead trainer at the Monroe Institute, a month too. So you are on the right track. Stick with it, and don't forget, you're on the hero's journey. When visiting the astral planes, there are all sorts of beings we can encounter. What we think these entities are is very much dependent on our own belief system which is often the religion we were brought up in or what our parents or school taught us. Some people believe these beings to be spirits. Others think they're part of our own mind. From my experience, it's not that black and white. We still don't really know the depth of how consciousness and our reality interact with each other. It's a great mystery. But what we do know, in regards to astral projection, is that we can seem to enter objective environments, our reality here and now, and subjective environments made entirely from our own mind, and intersubjective environments. These consensus realities, where people with shared belief systems access the same planes and even meet each other. From my trips to the Astral, there certainly seems to be a broad spectrum between the places we visit and the beings we encounter. A bit like the animal kingdom; there are many lands with all sorts of beasts who have different degrees of intelligence and self-awareness. From monkeys to jellyfish and elephants to ladybugs, all sorts of beautiful creatures. We can be afraid of them and stay in the house or we can be curious and go on astral safari. Let's look at the types of encounters that you might have so you know what to expect. Are you ready for your astral safari? You might meet a thought-form. The most common type of encounter is meeting a thought-form. Thought-forms can seem like other beings. In fact, they're often mistaken for spirits separate to ourselves. These types of entities are created purely by thought. They are personified aspects of our own mind. Now, it can be confusing because they seem to have some self-autonomy. In the same way a zombie looks alive and make sounds and is driven by primal instinct, the same can be said for thought-forms. It's a projected thought made real. They can take on their own independent reality and can even behave in very surprising and spontaneous ways but are nonetheless generated by an individual or even a collective group. This is how consensus realities are created. Think of it this way. When we dream, we meet thought-forms all the time. In our dreams, the characters are us, and we can have chats with them. They go about their day-to-day activities, operating on their own terms, right? Sometimes they're friendly and have exciting messages. Other times they're scary and have urgent warnings. If we meet a thought-form in the astral, we can do the RAIN technique, but instead of doing it with the environment, we can do it with the thought-form. So, we'd recognize what it is and maybe tune in to see if we can get a sense of its energy. What does it want? What does it need? Accept its presence in the space with us; allow it to be there, and investigate; ask it questions. Who are you? Do you have a message for me? And then non-identify; don't start spinning stories in your mind about the thought-form, but instead, be open to what it has to say. Often, they can be unintegrated parts of our shadow, parts of ourselves we've pushed away, but more on that tomorrow. You might meet helpers or intruders. From time to time, we might find ourselves out of body and know that there's someone with us. Occasionally, we can see this presence, but a lot of the time we just might feel it. We might sense it's in the same space, or it could even be right beside us like a companion. These are called intruders and helpers. Helpers appear like positive guides nudging us in the right direction. Intruders appear like negative strangers encroaching on our space. They can appear threatening, but often intruders are just a shadow thought-form. A part of ourself we've pushed away, that wants to be integrated, but we'll look at the shadow tomorrow. During these moments, we get a sense that we're being told or shown something or guided to go somewhere. We can choose whether or not we engage and interact with them, or we could go on our own journeys. If I had a penny for every time a friend told me they astral-projected out of their body but then felt a presence and got too scared and shot back into their body, I'd be a pretty rich woman. This is why overcoming fears and limiting beliefs is so important. You don't want to miss a special opportunity because you got scared. If you sense someone is with you, turn towards whoever it is and tune in using your intuition to read why they might be with you. You know when you have a chat with a friend and you read between the lines of what they're saying, when you sense into what they really want to say behind the words, it's a bit like that. So be calm and open and receptive. If you want to leave, you can choose at any time to go to a different place or back to your body. Many beginners are passive. They just accept and go with the circumstance that they find themselves in. Don't forget: you have the power; you have power to control what you do and where you go. So you can do whatever you wish. Don't forget that. Communication in the astral is usually telepathic. Like you just know each other's intentions. In non-physical realities, information can come as an intuitive knowing, a sort of energy ball of information. What Robert Monroe called a ROTE which is a Related Organized Thought Energy. Basically, it's a download that's instantaneously transmissible from one person to another. It might take you a while to get used to this, but if you meet a being, it usually happens without much effort. You just seem to know how to do it, like it's natural. The key to this communication is to be clear, to be open to receiving information, however that comes. Not thinking that you have to receive it just through a visual or an auditory way, but rather it's like an intuitive wave of data. Of course you might see and hear things too. For example, you might be taken to see something, or you might hear a message, but often the language is intuitive. You also might meet someone who's passed over. When I met my dead father during an out-of-body experience, his message was communicated through knowing, feeling, and words. I had entered into this beautiful garden, and he appeared from behind a fountain, and he was so happy to see me. I couldn't believe it was happening. It was so unexpected, and we ran to each other and embraced. And when I touched him, I shrunk down into my four-year-old self, which was completely unexpected, and I was just so overwhelmed with emotion. And he bent down on one knee, the way you do when you're with a child, and he looked me in the eye, and he said, "I'm so sorry. I didn't know. I didn't know." You see, I had a dysfunctional relationship with my father in my life, and his behavior hugely impacted me in a negative way which he didn't realize at the time. Somehow he knew that, and there was this wonderful exchange of love and forgiveness. And then he took my hand, and he led me to a huge door which he pushed open into a great hall. And he said, "Look where I've been!" And there were all these people dancing everywhere. My dad loved to dance, and he took my hand, and he pulled me through the crowds like he used to do when I was a little girl, and everyone was so joyful, smiling at me. And then the journey continued on. And at the end of that, he waved me goodbye from a mountain top as I returned back to my body. That remains to be one of the most beautiful experiences I've ever had. And when I came back from it, it felt as though a weight had been lifted. I couldn't believe that I'd got to see him one last time. And it helped me heal the grief that I've been holding on for for so long. It is possible to encounter your own loved ones and others that have died, in the astral planes. And in some traditions, they use astral travel to help people move on in after-death states. So we not only have the power to connect to our own ancestors, but also, we can help others. If you would like to connect with a loved one in an OBE, you might like to do this exercise to call them in and to connect with them in the astral. Step one, create a new projection plan focused on meeting your loved one who has passed away. For example, "I call on my ancestors to help me go beyond the body to meet my dead father for the purpose of healing grief." You can change the words to make it more personal for you. Step two, find a quiet place where you can do this meditation. If you have a space that you meditate in or a favorite spot, you could do it there. Just make sure you feel comfortable. Then, light a candle in acknowledgement of the person who has passed and give them an offering. An offering is something to honor them, maybe something you know they'd like: it could be a flower, their favorite chocolate, you could even play a piece of music that they love. When I did this recently for my grandma, I gave her a cup of tea because she used to go through about 10 cups a day. So choose what you think is best. Step three, then, hold or look at a photo of them and bring them into your heart. Call them into your awareness. Do this in whatever way feels right for you. It could be through a feeling, through words, or a picture in your mind. Step four, then, do your astral practice as normal. And when you find yourself in the mind awake body asleep state, remind yourself of your projection plan; say it, then continue with the exercises that you've chosen for that specific practice to self-initiate an OBE. Step five, when you leave the body, you might already find yourself being taken to where you need to go. Whoever you have called in might even be with you right away. But if you find yourself in your room, call out to your loved one in the same way that you did in the meditation. Then, back this up with a command to be taken to where they are. Dropping into the feeling of why you want to meet them is a really good thing to do at the same time in that moment. Remember, it's a thought-responsive environment. So don't forget to release attachment to any outcome. Once you've done the practices, let go of any expectations, and then be open to whatever happens. A reminder that the non-physical planes don't always operate on the same linear timeframe that we experience from day to day. You could do this practice, and then the OBE might spontaneously happen five days later. It doesn't always occur that night or unfold in the way we expect. Some traditions believe that the soul, the person, may be on their own evolutionary journey. So if you don't get an immediate response, don't be disheartened, and look out for their presence or message in other experiences such as dreams. People have also had visitation dreams from a dead relative after this practice. Lastly, doing this can be quite emotional. So allow any feelings to come up and express themselves in whichever way they arise, and then maybe write them down in your diary. Good luck. And I'll see you tomorrow.

====================

LESSON 23: The Descent: Soul Retrieval & Shadow Integration
--------------------
<v ->Hello, dear night yogis.</v> I've mentioned that astral projection can be used as a spiritual tool for healing and elevating consciousness. Today, we're going to learn how to integrate pieces of our own soul and our shadow, the parts of us that are separated from ourself and in the shadows, back in again. This is because we might manifest and even meet this side of ourselves in our astral journeys. One of the ways in which we're going to do this is through soul retrieval. The word shaman comes from the Tungus tribe in Siberia, and it means one who sees in the dark. Shamanism has been practiced in parts of Asia, Europe, Africa, Australia, Greenland, and native North and South America. In her book, Soul Retrieval, Sandra Ingerman explains that a shaman is a man or a woman who interacts directly with spirits or elemental energies to address the spiritual aspects of illness, divine information, and help the spirits of dead people cross over. Also to perform a variety of ceremonies for their community, including something called soul retrieval. The term soul retrieval is usually used to describe the process of reintegrating aspects of the self that have somehow become split off. This splitting off, or fracturing, often occurs due to trauma, whether it's in this lifetime or a previous one, and it can lead to fragments of the self being kind of stuck in different times, realities, or in simply different parts of our psyche. Whenever or wherever we experience a heavy trauma, parts of our self or soul may flee or fracture, kind of hide in an effort to protect itself. This is often referred to as soul loss. The trauma that creates this soul loss might be as obvious as an injury, an assault, or war. It could also be from the death of a loved one, a divorce, even physical and emotional abuse. Or it might be seemingly a hidden thing, such as womb trauma, or intergenerational trauma that's been passed on, even past life trauma. Depression, dysfunctional relationships, a sense of separation, inability to move forward, and inherent lack of self-awareness can all be hallmarks of soul loss. And so the task of soul retrieval is to find the parts of our soul and to reclaim them, to reintegrate them back into wholeness of the self. The end goal of which is to fully integrate all aspects of ourselves. Although soul retrieval is often performed by a shaman on our behalf, once we learn astral projection, we can practice soul retrieval for ourselves. In the OBE state, we can become our own shaman. Soul retrieval in OBEs can happen in one of two ways: either the parts of our soul that have split off try to sort of seek us out in the astral, and we might stumble upon them spontaneously, or if we feel ready to do so, we can intentionally invoke them, seek them out, once we are out of body, to then integrate them. In the first option, during an astral projection experience, split-off parts of ourself might appear to us as thought-forms that might seek us out for reintegration. The reason for this might be because the more subtle energetic form that we inhabit in an OBE, so our energy body, is easier to reintegrate with than the physical grosser form of waking life. Or it could be that the ego is somewhat weakened in the OBE state, our sense of self. So we're more open and more able, more flexible, to reassimilate the lost parts of ourselves than in the ego-dominated waking state. Whatever the case, what we know for sure is that this can happen. So let's be prepared for it and be open to the healing that it offers. Sometimes in the OBE state, these fragments of the split-off self or soul may appear as if they were autonomous individuals and crucially, as if they were separate from you. In fact, many of the thought-forms that we encounter in these non-physical realms can often take on multiple manifestations that are seemingly independent to ourselves. A very common response upon meeting these aspects is no, that was definitely not a part of me. This is a totally natural response because these are parts of your soul, your psyche, that are fragmented and split off. And so naturally, they do feel unfamiliar, but because they are already split off, if we then react with fear or aversion, or by pushing them away, they will remain split off, separate, and unintegrated from us. If you can be willing to integrate the energy that they hold though, by facing and embracing them in some way, either through dialogue, showing them love, or even literally embracing them if that feels good for you, then we can have a powerful healing experience. But what about that other option? The one in which you intentionally seek out lost parts of your soul to reintegrate. For this, you make it a part of your projection plan. You simply make it part of your purpose and intention. Can you remember when we wrote in our projection diary in week one, our meaningful motivation and our intention, what we wanted to do. This is where you can add in the purpose of soul retrieval as part of your plan. You might want to write down, "I call on my highest self to help me go beyond the body, to unify my whole self for the purpose of soul retrieval." We can also integrate our shadow. Just as we may encounter split parts of our soul, our psyche, in an OBE, we might also be able to encounter unintegrated aspects of our shadow too. So, what is the shadow, and what is the protocol for if we encounter it in our astral travel? The shadow is the part of ourself that is made up of all we hide from. And all that has been split off from who we think we are, our shame, our fears, our wounds, but also our divine spirit, our blinding beauty, and our hidden talents. The concept of the shadow is found within most cultures and spiritual traditions all over the world, but it was first popularized in the West by the legendary Swiss psychiatrist, Carl Jung. He used it to describe the part of the unconscious mind that was made up of all the seemingly undesirable aspect of the psyche, ourselves. The shadow is our dark side, but not dark as in negative or malign, but rather dark as in not yet illuminated. It consists of everything within us that we don't want to face and that has become split off. That is everything both seemingly harmful and potentially enlightening. All that we've rejected, denied, disowned, or repressed. So the shadow is not evil or bad. It is simply the parts of ourself that seem incompatible with who we think we are. These might include our shame, our fears, our emotional wounds, but also crucially, our awakened essence, our unexpressed talents, and our highest potential. Shadow integration involves shining light into the dark caves of our minds to reintegrate the split-off traumatized parts of ourselves. Any spiritual path that aspires to psychological wholeness will incorporate shadow integration to some degree, simply because unless the shadow is integrated, made whole, the mind remains divided. Any of this sound familiar? Reintegration of split-off parts of ourself, traumatized aspects that we unconsciously hide in the shadows of our minds. Although soul retrieval and shadow integration aren't exactly the same, they are quite similar. And so the same face and embrace advice goes for both. So if you meet a shadow aspect in the astral which, just like a lost-soul part, may well appear as an independent energy that seems separate from you, you know what to do. Accept it, show it love, send it positive energy, or do whatever feels right for you in that moment. And that might even feel like embracing it, giving it a hug. How will you know what's your shadow, and what isn't? If we look at dreams, anything that is in the dream that makes us feel scared, so even to the point of maybe being disgusted, or repulsed, or petrified, it could be our shadow. Or it might be something we are absolutely dazzled by, we're in awe of, a blinding brilliance, our divinity: that is your shadow. It can take a bit of time to build intuition, and one way of doing that is getting to know ourselves in the waking state, so we can sense into what could be shadow, and what might not be, but those are some good signs to see whether it might be. Once you see any shadow aspect, go towards it; you'll want to run away, but see if you can have the courage to move in its direction. Interact with it, dialogue with it, ask it what its name is. What does it represent? What message or insight does it have for you? And if you feel called to, maybe even see if you can hug it with fearless compassion. All this, embracing split-off shadow aspects, and reintegrating traumatized parts of our soul can sound pretty intense, right? If you're afraid in the OBE, when it's actually happening, remember you can take a metta-moment. Step back into your heart space, and remind yourself of the crucial truth. You can never be harmed in a non-physical environment because there's simply nothing to attack. There's no body or no thing that can be harmed. You are made of energy, not matter. And remember, this is a part of yourself. It wants to be integrated; it wants to be seen. So see it. And don't forget that the astral is a thought-responsive environment. And so if we take our fear into a thought-responsive environment, then that fear may be instantly projected and reflected back to us as an embodied part of what we fear. In the astral, it is our fear that creates fearful experiences, much more than anything else being objective to be afraid of. And remember, your beliefs are often reflected in the frequency of the realms you have access to. As Luigi Sciambarella from the Monroe Institute says, "Remember, many who have ventured into these territories before you haven't been harmed. And that actually what is coming to confront you is just a part of you that wants to be integrated. If only you could move beyond the fear and judgment that may prevent that." One thing we can do to help with healing our soul and shadow parts is a practice called Ho'oponopono. Ho'oponopono is a beautiful practice. It's one of my favorites. It's a Hawaiian forgiveness practice that allows us to create new connections and rejuvenate our relationship with the shadow, or those soul parts of ourself that are split off. In Huna, the ancient Hawaiian discipline of energy and healing, the Ho'oponopono process is essential if we want to be Pono, right and congruent with ourselves. The Hawaiian word Ho'oponopono comes from Ho, to make, and Pono, right, to make right. The repetition of the word Pono means doubly right, or being right with both ourselves and others. In a nutshell, Ho'oponopono is a process by which we can forgive ourselves and others that may have contributed in some way to soul loss and our shadow. Forgiving ourselves and others for anything we did or didn't do in the moment when the soul loss occurred, or when the shadow was formed, is a very powerful thing to do in the astral plane. It has a profound healing impact. Here's how to do it. Okay, let's say in the astral planes, you are faced with your shadow self or in an environment where you sense soul loss. What do you do? This is what you do. You say and feel these words as deeply as possible. "I'm sorry, please forgive me. Thank you. I love you." "I'm sorry, please forgive me. Thank you. I love you." And then just be open to whatever might happen afterwards. This is a very, very powerful practice, and it's not limited to astral projection. You can also do this in other altered states, such as meditation or dreamwork. Your actions for today: your action for today is to listen to the guided shamanic journey. It will guide you to meeting your shadow self through following a story and filling in the gaps. You don't have to do anything to prepare, just follow along, and then afterwards, journal anything that comes up for you in your projection diary. The reason that we're doing this is because the more we integrate our shadow self and lost parts of our soul in the waking state, the less it will appear for us to work on in the astral planes. Remember how the hero enters into the cave to retrieve the gold? This is it. Enjoy the shamanic journey. It's a really beautiful one. And I'll see you tomorrow.

LESSON 23: Meditation - Meeting Your Shadow

Take a moment to make yourself comfortable. And when you are ready, close your eyes. Just finding ourselves where we are. Nothing to do. Nowhere to go. Just be here. And whilst we're here, we might like to bring our right hand to our chest and our left hand to our belly. Noticing the inhale and the exhale. Becoming aware of the air passing through the nose or mouth and the rise and fall of the chest. Breathe deeply into the belly. Big belly breaths. Let's do a few here. In the out breath, we might like to imagine our outer layer of skin disintegrating. falling away, dropping down. It's like we're letting go of this whole costume that we wear day to day. Allow it to dissolve into the ether with each out -breath. I'd like to invite you now, in your mind's eye, to bring to mind a beautiful place. Perhaps a beach, lake, forest or meadow. Somewhere that resonates with you. Let's picture ourselves in this place now. We feel safe, serene and at peace. We look around and see the opening of a cave before us. It looks dark initially. so we move closer towards it to get a better look. We notice the cave is vast and deep, and as we approach it, we realise it's not as dark as we thought. In fact, golden torches line a pathway into the cave, and the glow of the light is warm and welcoming. It feels good, so we decide to step into the cave. As we enter, and begin to walk through it, it's easier than we thought. We hear the drip of water, smell of earth, and notice friendly creatures. It's full of unseen life. We make our way further in, and as we do so, We take one of the torches on the wall of the cave and use it to guide us. The pathway meanders through the cave and we notice a large opening with daylight far at the other end. We begin to make our way towards it. As we tread closer, we notice a figure emerging from this opening. It's hazy at first. as the light is bright. But then something blurs into shape, and we see it. It's our shadow self in human form, waiting for our arrival. It's us, just with a different essence. It walks up to us, and we are unafraid. It raises its hand in greeting. offering its palm to ours. We reciprocate, pressing our palm against its palm. As we do so, we feel fear dissolve away. We understand that the shadow self is a part of us, a hidden part that is keeping us safe. We look into our shadow self eyes and thank it for helping us in its own way. The shadow self nods in understanding and then our hands part. As we stand face to face, we now ask our shadow self if it has a message for us. We are open to however this message may present itself. We now ask our shadow, if there is any fear, or limiting belief, any restrictions we impose on ourself linked to astral projection. If we struggle to make sense of what it says, we can ask our shadow to make it more obvious, more clear please. We ask our shadow, what underpins this fear or limiting belief? Where does it come from? Finally, we ask our shadow what we can do to help ourself transform this fear or limiting belief. In our own way, we thank our shadow self. Our shadow self smiles warmly. and begins to walk away. It turns around to give us one last nod of reassurance before making its way into the distance. We can revisit this part of us whenever we need, but remember, it's not the entirety of who we are. Let's return to the cave now, and make our way back from where we came. The warm embrace of the glowing lights guiding our way. As we make our way back, we walk a little lighter, a little taller. We notice that place where we touched our shadow, our palm. We feel or sense the energy of our shadow self integrating with our everyday self. And we feel stronger. Braver and wiser, we have made our way back and enter into the beautiful place where we began. We feel at peace and happy to be under the blue sky again. We decide to lay down here and look up at the clouds passing by. We feel a weight has been lifted. We know that we are not ultimately our shadow, but that it is a friendly part of us. And we realise that we have within us the ability to hold all the darkness and all the light. We hold all the space of all the parts within us. The fear, the love, And even more than we can imagine, we all have that capacity. And we can take this knowing, this power, into both our everyday life and astral travel journeys. Let's take a few breaths here together, just a few moments, to reflect on anything that we might have experienced. With no sense of rush. Very gently. Let's bring our awareness back to the physical body. And the sounds in the room. Anything we can see or sense in our physical awareness. Coming back to our everyday world now. Feeling at peace. And in our own time. Opening the eyes. ready for whatever experiences may unfold in our everyday life or astral travel journeys. I'll see you again soon. 

====================

LESSON 24: The Final Flight: Conscious Dying
--------------------
<v ->Welcome back, everyone.</v> I'm going to give it to you straight: today is going to be challenging. It's not going to be easy, but it will be very insightful, possibly one of the most beneficial days we've had so far. This is because I want to talk about something that most of us naturally turn a blind eye to. I want to talk about death. While we are alive, we have a wonderful opportunity to prepare ourselves for death and dying. And that starts by being willing to have a conversation about it. And having an out-of-body experience can help overcome the fear of death even further. So today, we will be focusing on the Tibetan Buddhist teachings and how astral projection offers the opportunity for enlightenment upon death. My former husband and lucid dreaming teacher, Charlie Morley, often says, death is not a swear word, because in today's society, the word "death" has become pathologized into an almost dirty word. In Charlie's book, "Dreaming Through Darkness," he notes how each day, 150,000 people die and that of course, one day you and I will do too. But he asks, when was the last time you reflected on the fact that you're going to die? In the West, most of us live for about 1000 months, but of those 1000 months, how long do we spend preparing for everything that those 1000 months have been leading up to? Death is the greatest equalizer, a shared commonality of human experience, a natural part of life. We will all die, definitely, and successfully, and yet, we never really prepare for it, and we hardly ever talk about it, but why is that? Fear, mostly, but also denial, suppression, and shame. Death is for many people the greatest fear, and so transmutation of this fear can reap the greatest benefits. We need to begin readdressing this imbalance and start waking up to the reality of our own mortality. Talking about death shouldn't be taboo, but it kind of still is. Anthropologist Ernest Becker wrote in his Pulitzer Prize-winning book, "The Denial of Death," that Sigmund Freud was wrong and that, "It is death, not sex, that is the primary suppression of mankind." If this is true, then we can see why it might be a sensitive subject to broach. The interesting thing is awareness of our mortality can actually improve our physical health and help us reprioritize our goals and values. Even nonconscious thinking about death, such as walking by a cemetery, can prompt positive change and promote helping others. As an example of how awareness of death can be of benefit is the work of Bronnie Ware. Bronnie Ware is an Australian nurse who spent several years working in palliative care, looking after other patients in the last 12 weeks of their lives. She recorded their dying epiphanies and noticed the same five recurring themes. She put these revelations into a book called "The Five Regrets of the Dying." This is what the five regrets are. Number one, I wish I'd had the courage to live a life true to myself, not the life others expected of me. Number two, I wish I'd had the courage to express my feelings. Three, I wish I'd stayed in touch with my friends. Four, I wish I had let myself be happier. Five, I wish I hadn't worked so hard. When people first hear about the Five Regrets, it often inspires them to contact that friend they lost touch with, go for that new job, share their feelings, or start a creative hobby, or simply just take the pressure off themselves and say, this is where I'm at right now, and that's okay. So paradoxically, thinking about death can help us live more fully. Granted, this is easier said than done, isn't it? But one of the most direct ways that we can harness this paradoxical benefit is through astral projection. Having an OBE has been scientifically proven to show a radical decrease in death anxiety and to help grief. Almost all people who have an OBE come back convinced that they are not ultimately just their physical body, and in the same way that near-death experiencers return convinced of an afterlife or a spirit world, projectors usually return believing that they have a spirit or a soul or a consciousness that will in some way go on after death. Now, whether or not we personally believe that to be true maybe doesn't matter because either way, the lessening of death anxiety happens, and that can be very comforting to many people. As the American neuroscientist Sam Harris points out, whether or not a person's consciousness can actually be displaced is perhaps irrelevant. The point is, it can seem to be. Dr. Mel Slater's team at Barcelona University showed that even a virtual reality experience mimicking an OBE can decrease the fear of death. As Eckhart Tolle says, the secret to life is to die before you die and to find out that there is no death. This is what many near-death experiencers report. The world's largest near-death experience study was led by Dr. Sam Parnia, a professor at New York Langone Medical Center. It involved 2060 patients from 15 different hospitals in the UK, United States, and Austria. Physicians used the latest technologies to study the brain and consciousness during a cardiac arrest, a heart attack. The clinical timing of death currently in the West is when the brain shuts down and the heart stops. You shouldn't be able to sense or feel anything. However, many people in the study had a spectrum of perception and awareness after this moment had happened. It proved that death isn't a moment, but it's a process. Yet, some traditions have known about this for centuries and use it to die consciously. Dying consciously with awareness is seen as a possibility within both the ancient Mexican shamanic tradition of the Toltec, the Sufi lineages and of the Middle East, and in Tibetan Buddhism. So the idea of death being an opportunity seems to be found cross-culturally. Astral projection, as well as lucid dreaming and conscious sleeping, make up the practice of what is known in Tibetan Buddhism as dream yoga. In some lineages, dream yoga was reserved for those on a three year retreat and was only taught as part of the famous Six Yogas of Naropa. These days, however, some of the veils of secrecy have been lifted and allowed it to become a practice that allows dedicated practitioners to extend meditative awareness throughout sleep and liminal states, subsequently, throughout death and dying as well. Apparently, if we can truly master astral projection, then at the point of death, when our consciousness separates from the physical body, as believed in this tradition, we will be accustomed to this process and be able to guide it consciously, recognize the nature of mind, and reach full spiritual enlightenment, rather than kind of faint into unconsciousness. As the late great Tibetan master Akong Rinpoche once said, learning the basics of astral projection is good. At death, the same things happens, so it's good to practice. Essentially, for a seasoned astral projector, when death leads to the separation of consciousness from the body, it will not be their first rodeo. This idea of being able to consciously guide our death experience rests upon the concept of something called the "Bardo." The Bardo is a Tibetan Buddhist word that means place in between, and it's used to describe any transitional state of existence. Just as the dream is the bardo between falling asleep and waking up, life is the bardo between birth and death. However, usually when you hear the term, it refers to the after-death bardo which describes the intermediate states between death and rebirth. The after-death bardo state is said to be dreamlike in nature and our entry similar process to that of falling asleep. So it's believed that if we are able to fall asleep consciously and astral project, then we can use these skills in practices to die consciously and then recognize the dreamlike bardo lucidly, or, project our mind stream to a favorable rebirth, because the Tibetan Buddhist practice this to choose where they want to be reincarnated next, and also to receive teachings from masters that have passed on already. And, it's said that if practitioners can do this, then they can recognize the nature of their mind and have the potential to reach full spiritual awakening. Essentially, astral projection training can be used to prepare us for the bardo that we enter once we have left the body at the point of death. It is said that even if a yogi has practiced meditation for a whole lifetime and still hasn't attained full realization, he has one last shot at it: death. I want to tell you the story about Mindrolling Rinpoche. Mindrolling Rinpoche was an old Tibetan Buddhist lama, known for seeming to be asleep for the majority of his last years of his life. Why would he do this, spend these years sleeping? Because he knew that his body was dying, and so he knew that there was only one practice to focus on before death: astral projection. He spent most of his days sitting upright in meditation, but on the cusp of sleep, in that liminal space where entry into either a lucid dream or astral projection is easiest. This didn't stop students coming to receive his blessing, though, so his wife would briefly wake him up, and still half-asleep, he would give them a blessing and then go back into his dream yoga meditation. One day, he woke up suddenly and yelled to his wife to make tea for five people, before dropping back to sleep. Half an hour later, five travelers turned up at the door. Their Land Rover had broken down in the valley, and they had walked to his monastery for help. The story goes, he had astral projected out of his body, and he'd seen them walking up towards the monastery, so he wanted their tea ready for their arrival. Although we're probably not at his level yet, we can begin to think about death and our mortality and reap some of the benefits that comes with it. This is why we're going to do an exercise called "Things I Might Have Done Differently." And we're going to explore what we would do differently in our own life, if we knew that we were going to die. Just take a moment now to come into an awareness of your body and breath. You might like to close your eyes, and then just notice how you're breathing. Rise and fall of the chest, air coming in through the nose or out through the mouth, bringing your attention to the inhalations and exhalations, dropping into an awareness of the body, tuning into how you feel right now, accepting any feelings that might be there. And I'd like to invite you to imagine that you're on your death bed. Your mind is clear and you have no fear. A nurse you particularly like and who is kind is by your bedside. And she asks you, what things might you have done differently in your life? Take some time to consider this question, with no pressure to find an answer, just seeing if anything comes up. When trying to think of what we might do differently, it doesn't have to be big things, just real things, personal to you. Try to think of at least three things that you might have done differently. For example, spent more time with my friends, said "I love you" more, or been more generous with money maybe. What is it for you? Okay. Release the visualization now and remind yourself that as you're not on your death bed, you have the opportunity to actually do things differently from now on. Can you make a pledge to do those three things so that you can die without regret whenever death comes? If you feel that would be too challenging, try and at least do one. And whenever you're ready, open your eyes. Your actions for today: in your projection journal, write down the insights that came up for you during this exercise. Commit to doing at least one thing differently in your life moving forward. It might be scary, but you'll see how good it feels. And then maybe you'll find the courage to do the other two things as well. If you feel confident or comfortable, share that point with your tribe, what are you going to commit to. And as always, keep practicing the techniques and passing through the hypnagogic state consciously. Well done! Today was pretty tough. I'll see you tomorrow.

LESSON 24: Meditation - Death Contemplation Meditation

You might like to close your eyes and then just notice how you're breathing. Rise and fall of the chest air coming in through the nose or out through the mouth, bringing in your attention to the inhalations and exhalations, dropping into an awareness of the body, tuning into how you feel right now, accepting any feelings that might be there. And I'd like to invite you to imagine that you are on your deathbed bed. Your mind is clear and you have no fear. A nurse you particularly like and who is kind is by your bedside, and she asks you what things might you have done differently in your life? 

Take some time to consider this question with no pressure to find an answer. Just seeing if anything comes up and when trying to think of what we might do differently.

From now on, can you make a pledge to do those three things so that you can die without regret whenever death comes. If you feel that would be too challenging, try and at least do one. And whenever you are ready, open your eyes.

LESSON 25: Lift Off: Exit the Body With the Target Technique
--------------------
<v ->Hello, beloved travelers.</v> Get your bow and arrow ready because today, we are going to learn The Target Technique. This excellent method was invented by author Edward Peach, AKA Ophiel, who called it The Little System. Later, it was refined and reworked by several other authors. The idea is to exit the body by using active imagination and memory to pretend you're at a different location. As always, we do this when we are deep in the mind awake body asleep state. We tune into the energy body so that the shift becomes real and then we exit. We're going to learn how to do this today. Then you'll practice it tonight when you listen to the guided audio. Here's how to prepare. Step one, first, you pick out a target location. Usually it's a location that you're very familiar with. One popular location is your front door or your bathroom, maybe where you get ready in the morning. Step two, the next bit is to take three minutes to visit that location physically; go there for real in your physical body. When you're at your target location, keeping to your spot, I'd like you to investigate the space through your touch, your sight, your smell, and hearing. Use your hands or body to explore the space. What does it feel like? What does it look like? Bring your attention to the surfaces. What's the texture? Is it flat or smooth? Round or rigid? Does it feel cold or hot? Can you smell anything in the space? And what does the ground feel like beneath you? Notice what sound you can hear and what you can see surrounding your area. How far away are you from the wall or a chair or any item in the space that you can see? Commit this to your memory. What does the atmosphere feel like to you as you stand there? Focus all your senses on perceiving the space around you. Capture a detailed snapshot like a living photograph to your mind. For example, if my target location was my front door, I'd try to notice everything about it. The doorknob, the grooves, the features, the color, and the texture. Where does it connect to the floor? And what's above the door? What could be to the right side or the left? And I'd turn the doorknob and I'd feel its texture; is it cold or warm? How heavy is it when I open it? Does it make a swing ,or is there a creaking noise? Then I'd step inside, and I'd notice the surroundings in the hallway. Are there shoes on the door or is there coats hanging nearby? Is it dark or light? Maybe there are things in the hallway, pictures on the side. I'd close the door behind me, walk inside the house or apartment, and notice things that I pass by, decorations, photos, what do the walls look like? I'd saturate my memory as much as I can with all of these surrounding features, and I'd engage not only my sense of sight but also my other senses as well. Do this with your target technique. Then, get your room ready, so you're all settled to do a practice, and follow the guided audio. When you've done everything you can to create the best conditions, been to the toilet, chosen your position, got your cushions ready, then listen to the guided audio. This will take you into the mind awake body asleep state through to the Target Technique. During this process, I'll ask you to use your imagination to pretend that you're back at the target location. Let's use the door as an example again. Imagine you can see your front door as vividly as you can. Let's say it's your target and you're recalling it now. Remember what it looks like. Recall what you saw looking down at the door. Remember what it felt like to look to the right and to the left, and remember what the doorknob felt like, the colors and the grooves and the patterns, the textures; was it cold or warm? And then you turn the doorknob, and then you'd step inside. You'd look around and use your imagination to recall the objects, everything that you can remember, the entryway, shoes on the floor, coats hanging nearby, and in your imagination, you would reach out and touch the wall. Feel the textures; you'd sniff the air. Try to imagine the same smells as before. We're trying to create the same atmosphere by using our active imagination to walk through the target location exactly as you did when you were in the physical body. When we do this in the guided audio, convince yourself as much as possible that you're in your target location. When you do this for long enough, you might feel a sudden shift of awareness. You might find yourself suddenly at that target location and fully out of body. Alternatively, you might suddenly find yourself back at your body's location but in the vibrational state. If this happens, you can respond by following the vibrations, using your intuition, or you could switch to an exit technique such as the Rollout or Levitation or Sinking. It's okay to leave the Target Method if another exit technique feels right for you in the moment. There is that flexibility. Now, I want to stress that the target could be anything or anywhere. I just used the front door as an example, but you could easily use your target as your bathroom. If this was the case, you'd imagine the mirror or the toilet or the toothbrush, your soft towels, the cold tiles maybe, the floor, so on and so forth. Don't forget to start with somewhere familiar and nearby. This makes it easier to remember. Some people find it's much more effective to practice the Target Technique when they're away on holiday or on a trip or perhaps in a hotel bed. In other words, you're lying down on the hotel bed, and your Target Technique could be your home bedroom where you'd imagine you're looking back at your home and lying on your own bed surrounded by all your familiar things in your room, lamp, bedside table, blankets, a favorite pillow, and so forth. When you get better at it, you can then have a target that's far away, such as on a white sandy beach in Florida, or even further away, targets like the Pyramids in Egypt, maybe even a crater on the moon. Try to make it fun and see how realistic you can do this. Your actions for today: so your task is to practice the Target Technique following the three steps as laid out in this session. Go for a bullseye, and if you miss the mark, don't worry. It's your first time trying this. Just next time, move the target closer. Good luck.

====================

LESSON 25: Meditation - Target Exit Technique

Before we begin, limit any distractions that could pull your senses and attention outwards into the physical world. You might like to shut the curtains, close the windows and doors, wear headphones or an eye mask, and get into a comfortable position. If you would like to do this and you haven't already, pause the track now and take a moment to do this. Although we want to get to a place where we cannot feel our physical body anymore, it is okay to adjust your position or scratch an itch at any time if you need to. This is your time to awaken and practice. The skill of astral projection within you is the ability to tap into realms beyond the body. This is because you are a multidimensional being with infinite potential. With this in mind, let's begin. For now, all we're going to do is just be where we are. Just noticing where we are right now. Perhaps take three deep belly breaths to settle our body and mind. Then becoming aware of the space behind the neck, feeling the length of the spine in our back, noticing the weight of our hips sitting within our body, feeling the legs touch the bed chair or ground arms hanging at the sides of us, hands and fingers loose at the end. Bringing our attention to the texture of the clothes or blankets, touching the skin and sensing the space around the body. Noticing the physical edges of ourselves, the boundary of our being. 

Just tuning into any feelings we might have in this moment, not needing to change or do anything about them, just being aware of how we feel right now. And lastly, in our own way, feeling the connection to the earth and the support we gain from it. Let's set a general intention here for the mind to be awake and aware and for the body to become completely relaxed. Maybe we could bring our personal motivation to mind here, our purpose, our reason why we are practicing astral projection. We allow our intention and motivation to drop into our awareness like a pebble sinking in water, letting our intention go. Now let's shift our attention to the breath. Nothing to do now, nowhere to go. Just rest, drifting in our own time into the hypnagogic state. With each outbreath, we relax deeper and deeper into a wider awareness, leaving any bodily sensations behind. For now, remembering you can come back to the body at any time, but for now, letting it go completely relaxed, completely supported, and completely safe. Notice how relaxed you feel and how good it is to be this relaxed your mind. Aware your body becoming weightless as it falls. Fast asleep. Staying mindfully aware whilst your body lies in space. Maintaining that soft awareness, allow your focus now to dissolve away any sensations with the body. 

Completely relaxed, completely supported, completely safe. Although you are deeply relaxed and maybe quite drowsy, I invite you to stay fully aware. Letting go of any remaining bodily sensations, but staying mindfully alert, remembering you can come back to the body at any point you would like to, but for now, letting it go. We might like to let it go on the outbreath. And with this outbreath, we drop deeper and deeper into a relaxed state. And if we think we're fully relaxed, let's encourage ourselves to let go even more. Tell yourself it's time to let go. If your mind drifts off, just anchor it back to the black or grayness behind your eyes or anything you can see or sense in your awareness. Just noticing what's there. And if we notice nothing, that's okay too. We're like a calm observer. Being aware of where we are, paying attention to any imagery that may appear, sounds we might hear, or feelings we might have no need to judge or interpret what we notice. Just being with what is. Is there a quality to what you can see or a texture to what you can feel? Not striving to find these things. Simply seeing what's there. 

If your thoughts drift to the past or future, just bring your mind back to whatever is happening in the present moment. Even if it's nothing, be with the nothingness. For the next couple of minutes, allow yourself to drop deeply into the hypnagogic state. And if you fall asleep, that's fine. Maybe it's what your body and mind needs. Just gently riding the hypnogogic highway and noticing what passes you by 

The following technique works best when you are deep in the mind awake, body asleep state. Although you might feel some sensations or perhaps even astral project during this guided audio. Generally, this is a dress rehearsal for when you do the technique in your own time in this way. Once you know it well, you can make the method longer or shorter and undertake it at any given moment in your practice. But for now, let's go through the steps so you can learn it, rehearse it, but most importantly, implement it when you are ready to exit the body. So imagine that you are deep in the mind awake, body asleep state. You cannot sense your body, it's gone to sleep, but your mind is awake and aware, deeply relaxed, completely calm and totally safe. I'd to invite you to bring to mind your chosen target location. Use your memory and imagination to take yourself there. Evoke a felt sense of the space by tuning into the physicality of it. What can you see around you? Can you feel the place? Maybe you can hear it. Is there an atmosphere, an energy to it? Fully focus your senses on perceiving your target location as though you are truly there. Maybe you already are, but if not, that's okay too. Continue to paint a picture in your mind's eye. 

Where do you find yourself within this location? What do you notice? Close by or far away from you, perhaps significant objects, other people or something else. If you are moving through your location, pay attention to things you pass by. Make a note of them in your mind. Let's pause for a moment. Maybe you are here for a reason. If you came to seek something, search for it now. If you are not sure, that's totally fine. Use your intuition to guide you. Take some time now to explore your environment and go on your journey with no sense of rush. It's time to come back to the body. Now, back to the physical world. That's it. Make your way. Remember, you can return any time you wish, but for now, it is time to come back to everyday reality with full recall and all senses intact. Make your way back now. Follow the sound of my voice and bring your awareness back to the body. Anything you can see or sense in your physical world, you might like to wriggle your fingers and toes or take a nice stretch when you are ready, gently opening the eyes. Welcome back. Take a moment to recall your experience and note it down in your diary. I'll see you again soon.

LESSON 26: Test Your Projection Skills With a Group Experiment
--------------------
<v ->Welcome back, dear travelers.</v> Today, it's time to roll up your sleeves and put into action everything that you have learnt so far because we're about to do an experiment. I hope you are as excited as I am. Let's begin. Dr. Charles Tart studied a gifted astral traveler, Miss Z. One night in a laboratory, she was lying in bed. He was on the other side of the screen, and he'd set a five-digit random number high above her bed where she couldn't see it. Then when she awoke out of the altered state, she called out the correct five digit numbers in the right order. The odds of this are one in 100,000. He tried a similar experiment with Robert Monroe. Monroe didn't get the numbers, but he saw the laboratory technician talking to a strange man outside the building which later turned out to be true. Just like Monroe and Miss Z, we're going to test our projection skills with an experiment. Every Astral projector comes to a point where they want to know, "Am I just hallucinating or is astral projection real?" Of course, that depends on how you define reality. But what we usually want to know is am I seeing objective everyday reality? So we go through this phase where we try to get verification that what we see and experience is true. One actual projector who in an attempt to prove the reality flew down to the parking lot whilst he was out of body to find his own car. He soon realized that all the cars were white. So he concluded, "Oh, I must be hallucinating." Then when he went back to his body and looked outside, he discovered it had been snowing, and all the cars were indeed white. These little pieces of proof often seem to happen by accident. There also seems to be more success when there's an emotional bond involved such as with a friend or family member. When we try to prove it for ourselves, it's often a little bit hit and miss. Let me explain. I do experiments with my workshop participants. This one time I placed a specific object, one that I had a strong emotional connection to, on the top of my wardrobe. I gave consent for the participants to project into my room and verify what it was. The object was a purple cuddly toy named Ms.Lavender Rabbit who represented fertility and children to me. What I didn't tell them to make it even harder was that I'd moved house the day before the experiment. So not only did they not know where I live, but also I'd spent five years in my old house and only one night in my new one. So which one would they know to go to in the out-of-body state? There were some very curious hits. One student said, "I saw a glass rose holding up an egg." Another said, "I saw a rose quartz crystal shaped like an egg." A couple said there were children's toys on the floor and down the side of my bed. But another one saw something completely different. She said, "I see you near lockers with groups of kids." There were a few interesting things here. I have a rose quartz egg that looks like glass in my bedroom right next to my wardrobe on my meditation altar. So one person got that and almost another did, but it wasn't the object that I placed on top of my wardrobe, although it was linked to fertility. Also the theme of children kept coming up, which is what the rabbit represented. And lastly, in my wardrobe, I have a bag of t-shirts with street dance crews names on them. These are sentimental to me because I used to teach dance in schools and I'd call the groups my kids. I'd often be in the PE area where there were lockers, getting them ready for dance rehearsals. Did the projectors somehow pick up on the memory and emotion of the energy associated with those items as well as seeing them? This is why I think it's easier to evidence experiences with meaningful objects or symbols rather than letters or numbers. Not only is it easier to remember during the OBE itself, but often we tend to be more right-brained, and the language area of the brain is on the left side. So identifying shapes, colors, and concepts is a lot easier which is why I have hidden the perfect object just for you. But before I explain how to do the experiment, there are some things that you might like to know to try for yourself. When setting up observations like this, make sure to keep them simple and close distance, at least at first. Don't expect to travel to Hawaii and identify a refrigerator magnet on the 12th floor of an apartment building on the third street. Keep it close by. The reason is when we're out of body, we can get easily distracted by things. So, here are three tests that you can do for yourself. The playing card experiment. Author Robert Bruce suggests shuffling a deck of playing cards or tarot cards and then placing the deck on a shelf above your head and then flip the top card up so that it's only visible from up in the air. After you leave your body, go to look at the card and memorize it. When you get back to your body, look at the card and see if it matches what you saw in your OBE. The door number experiment. Find a door number or a car license plate from a street you haven't been down before. It's important it's a new place, otherwise skeptics can just say, "Well, you're drawing on memory and imagination." So it needs to be a place that you haven't seen or been to before. This is great to do whilst on holiday or traveling. Visiting your friend experiment. Ask your friend for consent to visit them around the time that you plan to do your experiments such as at the weekend. Go to their house, and see what they're up to. Then when you get back, report back to them what you saw and see if your experience matches up with what they were doing. If your friend is up for doing something a bit more scientific, you can give them five index cards and draw a symbol on each one, such as a yellow circle on the first, a red plus sign on the second, on the third draw blue wavy lines, on the fourth a box that's black, and on the last, a green star. Number them from one to five, and have your friend use the random number app on their phone to choose a card; have them set it somewhere you can easily travel to, then leave the body and try to identify the card. So these are some things that you could do in your own time. Your actions for today: our group experiment. Are you ready? Here's what we're going to do. I'm going to place an object on top of my wardrobe for you to find. I give you consent to enter my room to see what that object is. Tonight, you get ready, and set up for practice as usual. You then do the Wake Back To Bed technique. And during that, you do 10 minutes of meditation where you have full intention to successfully locate the object, then get back in bed and use the target technique which will be guided on the audio track to get into the mind awake body asleep state and do the target technique exercise. Don't forget to make the object on top of my wardrobe your main target, the place where you want to end up, the thing that you want to see last. Then when you return, write in your projection diary anything you saw or you felt or you sensed. Remember, information in the astral is not just visual. So write anything and everything down. You never know, that little thing that you thought was nothing could end up being an important part of the puzzle. I'll see you tomorrow when we'll find out what the mystery object is. Good luck. See you then.

====================

LESSON 26: Meditation - MABA & Target Technique

Welcome back. I'm now going to guide you through some exercises to bring on the mind awake, body, sleep state, and trigger the vibrational state. After this, the music will continue and eventually phase out, leaving you to continue your journey or wake up when you are ready. If at any point during the audio you feel vibrations or sense the time is right to exit the body, then go with your intuition. It's okay to steer away from the audio if you need to. Everyone's experience will be different. So release expectations, be open. And remember, there is no right or wrong. We're each finding our own way. What we're doing here is preparing our mind and body so that it becomes familiar with the wide spectrum of these states. Building the best habits for astral projection. You'll hear this sound after each exercise. This sound helps to bring us back if we have lost awareness. When we hear this sound, 

We do not open our eyes or move our body. We just bring our attention back to the task at hand. Okay, then let's begin. This audio uses hypnosis techniques and active imagination to stimulate the vibrational state. And if you experience this state today or feel close to it, this may be a new sensation for you. So remember, be open to whatever occurs. You can always return to your bodily sensations at any time, just as you would during an actual out of body experience. Now keep your eyes open for the time being and just check with the motivation for your practice. Take a moment to recall why you would like to astral project. Now take three deep belly breaths in through your nose and slowly out through your mouth. And while you're taking these deep breaths, set an intention to relax your body fully and stay mindfully aware for the duration of this guided session. 

Now that you are nicely settled down, I'd like you to look up and find a spot to fix your gaze. Maybe a mark on the wall or ceiling, something that's not directly in front of you, but slightly above your eyeline. If you are laying down or propped up with cushions. Just be careful not to overstretch your neck in any way. You're just looking very slightly above the eye line, so you shouldn't need to tilt your head back very much at all. And from this moment on, just fix your gaze on that spot and on that spot alone. And as you do this, you'll find very quickly that your vision will get hazier and hazier as your eyes get tired and sleepy. Until soon, they will be closed. But for now, keep them open and you will be drifting into a very pleasant, relaxed condition very soon. 

But for now, I'd just like you to keep your eyes focused on that point for a little while and while you listen to the sound of my voice, keep your eyes focused on that point. And soon you'll notice your eyes blinking. Blinking is fine, blinking is good as you keep your eyes on that same spot. Now, I don't want you to close your eyes, but just keep them fixed on that spot whilst you concentrate on my voice and your eyes might water a bit or feel a little blurry, and that's okay. Remember, blinking is good, and these sensations are all just temporary. 

And while you are doing this, you'll find your vision is getting hazier and hazier. As your eyes get tired and sleepy, soon they will be closed and you'll just drift into a very pleasant relaxation. It doesn't matter if your mind wanders a little, you can always bring it back to the sound of my voice. Just be comfortable. And when you find that it would be so nice to just let those eyes close all on their own, you can stop trying to keep them open. Close your eyes now. See how comfortable they are when you let them go and relax. 

Settle yourself right down and just let yourself drift gently and easily into relaxation. As I count slowly up to seven, I will start that count for you now. One, relax and already you can feel yourself calming down, becoming much more relaxed now, beginning to drift away. Two, relax. You're feeling comfortable, beginning to feel peaceful. Two, just feel into that relaxation, working its way through your body, bringing every part of you to rest. Three, relax. And now just breathe a little slower and deeper. And each deep breath you take is making you more and more relaxed. Settling yourself right down. Four, relax. Just feel your whole body getting heavier and heavier now almost as though you are sinking, pleasantly down, singing into sheer comfort, body asleep, mind awake as each deep breath you take relaxes you more and more. Five, relax. You are feeling drowsier and drowsier, tired and sleepy body. Now mind aware and calm. Body totally relaxed. Six, relaxed. Every part of your body is coming to rest. Now settling down into sheer comfort, body feeling tired, sleepy, calm, and at peace, mind gently aware. Seven, relax. Just continue drifting now deeper and deeper into that relaxation. Resting so comfortably now you are deeply calm and relaxed focused, stand aware. 

Now, either out loud or in your head, I'd like to invite you to repeat the following affirmation after me, we will do this twice. Ready? I awaken the ability of astral projection to be in service of myself and others. I do this with courage and compassion. I awaken the ability of astral projection to be in service of myself and others. I do this with courage and compassion. Let's now call on our circle of allies, an exercise in which we invite a gathering of fearless and loving protectors to join our journey. Who might our allies be? Anyone or anything that offers us a feeling of love, safety, allegiance, and protection. Our protectors can be living or dead, real or unreal, known or unknown, such as friends, family, animals, ancestors, deities, or spirit guides. We can decide on and invite in which ones we are going to call on. Now, imagine that our allies are surrounding us. We might like to imagine four principle allies standing to the north, south, east, and west of us. Feel free to fill in the gaps with as many others as you like. So you are surrounded by love and protection. 

Knowing that our circle of allies will remain with us and that we can call upon them whenever we wish. Let's release the visualization of them now. Nothing to do now, nowhere to go. Just rest, drifting in our own time into the hypnagogic state. With each outbreath, we relax deeper and deeper into a wider awareness, leaving any bodily sensations behind. For now, remembering you can come back to the body at any time, but for now, letting it go completely relaxed, completely supported, and completely safe. Notice how relaxed you feel and how good it is to be this relaxed your mind aware your body becoming weightless as it falls. Fast asleep. Staying mindfully aware whilst your body lies in space. Maintaining that soft awareness allow your focus now to dissolve away any sensations with the body. Completely relaxed, completely supported, completely safe. Although you are deeply relaxed and maybe quite drowsy, I invite you to stay fully aware. Letting go of any remaining bodily sensations, but staying mindfully alert, remembering you can come back to the body at any point you would like to, but for now, letting it go, we might like to let it go on the outbreath breath. And with this out breath, we drop deeper and deeper into a relaxed state. And if we think we're fully relaxed, let's encourage ourselves to let go even more. Tell yourself it's time to let go. 

If your mind drifts off, just anchor it back to the black or grayness behind your eyes or anything you can see or sense in your awareness. Just noticing what's there. And if we notice nothing, that's okay too. We're like a calm observer. Being aware of where we are, paying attention to any imagery that may appear, sounds we might hear, or feelings we might have no need to judge or interpret what we notice. Just being with what is. Is there a quality to what you can see or a texture to what you can feel? Not striving to find these things. Simply seeing what's there. If your thoughts drift to the past or future, just bring your mind back to whatever is happening in the present moment. Even if it's nothing, be with the nothingness. For the next couple of minutes, allow yourself to drop deeply into the hypnogogic state. And if you fall asleep, that's fine. Maybe it's what your body and mind needs. Just gently riding the hypnogogic highway and noticing what passes you by. I'd like to invite you to bring to mind your chosen target location. Use your memory and imagination to take yourself there. Evoke a felt sense of the space by tuning into the physicality of it. 

What can you see around you? Can you feel the place? Maybe you can hear it. Is there an atmosphere, an energy to it? Fully Focus your senses on perceiving your target location as though you are truly there. Maybe you already are, but if not, that's okay too. Continue to paint a picture in your mind's eye. Where do you find yourself within this location? What do you notice? Close by or far away from you, perhaps significant objects, other people or something else. If you are moving through your location, pay attention to things you pass by. Make a note of them in your mind. Let's pause for a moment. Maybe you are here for a reason. If you came to seek something, search for it now. If you are not sure, that's totally fine. Use your intuition to guide you. Take some time now to explore environment and go on your journey with no sense of rush. It's time to come back to the body. Now, back to the physical world. That's it. Make your way. Remember, you can return any time you wish, but for now, it is time to come back to everyday reality with full recall and all senses intact. Make your way back now. 

Follow the sound of my voice and bring your awareness back to the body. Anything you can see or sense in your physical world, you might like to wriggle your fingers and toes or take a nice stretch when you are ready, gently opening the eyes. Welcome back. Take a moment to recall your experience and note it down in your diary. I'll see you again soon.

LESSON 27: Landing Safely: Embodiment & Integration
--------------------
<v ->Hello, heroes.</v> How was the group experiment for you? Did you do it? Are you on the edge of your seat right now, dying to know what the answer is? Okay, so, the special object, the one I chose specifically for you that I placed at the top of my wardrobe, is the Magician card from the arcane tarot deck. This card means inspired action, new beginnings, limitless possibilities, and manifestation. The magician takes the seed of an idea and makes it happen. It is connected to new beginnings and new worlds. This card reminds me that we are truly magical beings and we can tap into that magic anytime, should we wish to. Did you see this in your OBE? Maybe you entered my room and literally saw the card on top of my wardrobe. Maybe you tapped into the energy, the symbolism of it, and felt those qualities that I just described. Or maybe you sensed stereotypical things linked with the magician, such as top hats, white rabbits, magic wands, or a similar figure, like a wizard or a witch. If you fell asleep or were pretty far off the mark, don't worry. Getting a bullseye on your first try is actually quite rare. After all, we are still honing our astral projection skills, but it's a fun way to put them into practice, so it was definitely worth the effort. Now, today's lesson is all about grounding and integrating everything that you've experienced in the astral planes to your everyday lives. And I'd like to open with a quote from Indian philosopher, Adi Shankaracharya, "Knowing that I am different from the body, I need not neglect the body. It is a vehicle I use with, to transact with the world. It is the temple that houses the pure self within." Coming home to our bodies and living in the here and now, in the human realm of which we were born into for a reason, is why integration and embodiment is a vital part of astral projection or any self-growth or spiritual practice. To process what you discover and then live and breathe your revelations in an authentic, heartfelt way, for it to evolve your consciousness and become a part of who you are, is how we bring it back down to earth and integrate what we've learnt. Otherwise, it's like attending school and not taking onboard the teachings. We're never going to graduate. And if we don't listen in class, we're going to have to keep attending the same lesson over and over again. And let's face it, life's short. No one's got time to waste. So how can we make the best of our experiences? Integration is about assimilating new information that your mind is now aware of with your body, heart, and soul, allowing this new level of awareness and flow of energy to move through us without resistance. Granted, if we've had a hard truth that we've learnt about ourselves or experienced wonders of the universe, it could be a pretty challenging process. You might have gained an insight or had an epiphany. Sometimes the realizations can be so subtle, so nuanced, that you may not know it tangibly, but you can feel that there's been a shift within you. These new findings may have a knock-on effect of emotion, from apprehension, or I'm not really sure what to do about this? And confusion, what does this mean? To excitement, wow, that was mind blowing, and even euphoria, this is going to change my life forever. This could result in having new decisions to make, a different career path to take, a solution to a problem leading from the heart. Or you might need to have that conversation with a loved one. Whatever surfaces for you as a result of your astral travel, it's absolutely paramount to process and integrate your experience. And let me tell you a secret about integration. Firstly, only you can integrate your experience. No one can do it for you. They can't tell you what you've experienced, because it's your experience. It's your truth. Secondly, how you make sense of your experience will largely determine how it influences your life. For example, let's say three people have the exact same astral journey. They visit a place, meet someone, and receive a message. One of them fixates on the place that they visited and decides they don't like it. It's bad news; it's negative. Another focuses on the encounter that they had and begins to live their life in alignment with the message that they were given. And the other is not really bothered either way. It didn't mean a lot. They just shrug off the experience. This same astral journey had the power to be incredibly detrimental or incredibly beneficial, depending on how the person made sense of it. So how we think about and understand our experiences is almost as important as the thing itself. Now, part of that example was true. One of my case studies, Justin, had a long astral journey. During it, he was given a message. This is what he said about his own experience: "I noticed this woman sitting to my right. Her appearance was a motherly figure, so I kind of guessed that this is the person I'm supposed to talk to. So I asked her, 'Is there anything I need to know?' She looked at me really closely. As she looked closer, she was glowing. And I kind of got the hint that, okay, this person is guidance; it's a message for me. She said, 'Do your best and the system will help you along.' And those words, they guide everything I do. It's probably one of the simplest bits of advice I've ever received, but also one of the most profound; that's how I've changed how I interact with everything and everyone around me. It even influenced my relationship with my daughter." Following through, by taking action, like Justin did, and mirroring your new awareness in an integral way on all levels of physical, mental, emotional, and spiritual plains is one of the best ways to bring our newfound wisdom into our lives. Here's one way how to do that, to really ground ourselves. In her autobiography, "A House with Four Rooms," English author Rumer Godden said, "There is an Indian proverb that says everyone is a house with four rooms, a physical, a mental, an emotional, and a spiritual room. Most of us tend to live in one room most of the time, but unless we go into every room every day, even if only to keep it aired, we are not a complete person." The four rooms, which make up our being are the emotional, physical, spiritual, and mental. If we walk into these rooms each day, not only is it good for our well-being, but it helps to ground, embody, and integrate any astral experience into our life. Here are some ways we can open the doors to these rooms and integrate our astral travel experiences. The emotional room, the feelings and the heart. This room is all about connecting with creative ways to process your emotional journey; whether that's through art, music, poetry, or sharing your astral story with a friend, it's about finding the space to express yourself and your feelings, whatever it might be. The mental room. This has to do with our thoughts in our head, our intelligence, our thinking. This is about finding space to download your thoughts, whether that's writing in your journal, your projection diary, or even writing a letter. Also, cultivating gratitude by making a note of the five things you're grateful for in your daily life can help. These are one of the ways you can process your thoughts. The spiritual room. Connection to self, other, the wider world, and whatever is divine for us. People connect to spirituality in different ways. It could be about being in nature, practicing meditation, saying mantras or prayers, doing a deity practice or going to church, but also about surrendering and asking for guidance, trusting and cultivating compassion. The physical room. This is all about touch and the body, anything physical. These are more earthly and sensory things, ways to ground you through the body. Things like eating, gardening, massage, sports, dance, or body work, immersion in water, such as swimming in the sea, or even having a bath. All the physical stuff that will allow you to connect to your body helps us to enter the physical room. When choosing what activities to do, you might like to think about what type of person you are. If you're someone who's quite driven and quite ambitious, it might be that you need to adopt a gentle approach over force. If you're the type of person who might hesitate, ruminate, and possibly even stagnate, it might be that you need to take action-oriented tasks. Sometimes you can double up the rooms because they overlap such as something that is both physical and emotional. One of these techniques is tapping, also known as Emotional Freedom Technique. This is one of my favorites because it's also a great way to ground after returning from your astral travel. Tapping is based on the combined principles of ancient Chinese acupressure and modern psychology. It's like psychological acupressure, a self-treatment for settling emotions through using the body. Studies show that it decreases cortisol, the stress hormone, and it brings us back into our bodies. Effectively, it involves tapping with your fingertips on specific meridian points while repeating phrases such as affirmations. Let's rehearse it together so we know what we're doing. Coming back from an OBE, we might feel overwhelmed with excitement or anxiety, and this could make you feel vulnerable. If you have an overwhelming feeling, whatever it is, such as, let's say, being spaced out, ask yourself, on a scale from 1 to 10, how charged this feeling is right now? How strong is it? Let's say for us, it's a 7 out of 10 of feeling spaced out. Then you're going to select the part of your body you do a karate chop with, which is the side of the hand. We're going to tap the side of our hand, and you would do both, then the top of the head, between the eyebrows, side of the temples, your upper lip, underneath the chin, top of the chest, and then underneath your armpit at the side of the chest. As we tap on these places, we're going to say the affirmation, "Even though I feel..." and then you would put your emotion that you're feeling there, such as excitement or anxiety, but let's use our example of feeling a bit spaced out. You would put it there. Then afterwards you would say, "I completely and deeply love and accept myself." So it would go something like, "Even though I feel spaced out, I completely and deeply love and accept myself." So when you do this, you would do both sides when we've got double limbs, but for the sake of time and because it's just a rehearsal, we'll just do it on one of those limbs. But we are going to do it all together now so you kind of get it into your mind of what you're doing. So we're saying, "Even though I feel spaced out, I deeply and completely love and accept myself." Ready? Let's do it together, starting with the hand. "Even though I feel spaced out, I deeply and completely love and accept myself." Top of your head. "Even though I feel spaced out, I deeply and completely love and accept myself." Forehead, "Even though I feel spaced out, I deeply and completely love and accept myself." Side of the temples, "Even though I feel spaced out, I deeply and completely love and accept myself." Under the eyes, "Even though I feel spaced out, I deeply and completely love and accept myself." Top of the lip, "Even though I feel spaced out, I deeply and completely love and accept myself." Chin, "Even though I feel spaced out, I deeply and completely love and accept myself." Chest, "Even though I feel spaced out, I deeply and completely love and accept myself." Side of the chest, "Even though I feel spaced out. I deeply and completely love and accept myself." So, after we've done this, tune in and see how strongly you feel that emotion, the one that you felt when you came back from the OBE. Out of 10, has it reduced? We felt, in our example, spaced out at roundabout a 7 out of 10, 10 being the most. Maybe it could have dropped to 5 or dropped to 4. What you can do if it hasn't dropped far enough is repeat the process again. So it drops down and down and down until it reaches 0. You can also use this after waking up from a nightmare, from sleep paralysis, or even after an epic OBE, or simply after a long day at work. Your actions for today: today we learnt what integration and embodiment is and also why it's important. We learnt two ways to do it, via tapping and entering the four rooms. We unlocked the emotional and physical room using tapping, but we still have two other rooms to enter today, the mental and the spiritual. Today, I'd like you to visit these two rooms in whatever way you like. You could choose one of the activities I mentioned, or you could find one of your own. So take two actions, one for the mental room, and one for the spiritual. Also, keep up your astral projection routine. Keep practicing your favorite techniques and passing through the hypnagogic mindfulness each night. See you on the other side.

LESSON 28: Into the Horizon: Flying Together
--------------------
<v ->You've made it!</v> Congratulations on completing your Quest. And what a journey, right? What a feat. You've worked really hard, and I'm proud of you. It's not easy, and you've done absolutely brilliantly to get to the end. You now have a toolbox full of techniques you can call on as part of your very own astral projection practice. How does it feel to say, "I have my own astral projection practice?" Just let that sink in for a moment. Because regardless of whether you've had an OBE yet, the skills you've acquired will serve you for the rest of your life. So, let's take a minute to go over everything you've learnt. You've now acquired the three steps to astral projection: the mind awake body asleep state, the vibrational state, and exiting the body. You also have a number of techniques to harness and master these states at your own disposal. The next step for you is to work out which of them works best. Embrace trial and error, and create a bespoke practice that's personal to you. You do this by choosing the techniques that resonate with you the most. Practice your Hypnagogic Mindfulness every night. Remember, we sleep for a third of our lives. That's almost 30 years. So let's use that time for self-growth. Also, we learnt the Wake Back to Bed method. And moving forward, I invite you to try and do a whole practice session where you do the Wake Back to Bed with all your favorite techniques at least once a week or whenever you can build it into your life. But remember, the more you practice, the more experiences you're going to have. But what else have we done? Well, of course, we've covered the various types of astral planes and the lots of amazing things you can do, when you get to them, through creating your own projection plan. We've learnt how to alchemize sleep paralysis and lucid dreaming into astral projection, not to mention planning your own experiments to verify your experiences. Then we touched on the advanced stuff, for when your practice really gets going. Things like soul retrieval, integrating your shadow, conscious dying, exploring the nature of reality, and connecting to loved ones who've passed over. But it doesn't stop there. What's wonderful about having your own practice is that it can positively affect your everyday life, regardless of the amount of OBEs you're going to have. You're creating habits and new behaviors that help you to have better sleep hygiene, improved stress levels, connection to purpose, and elevated states of consciousness. Also, a deeper understanding of your own needs. Let's talk about that last point for a second. Let's face it, once we begin to narrow down what's truly important to us, we start going for what we really need. You learn to shape how to respond to life's challenges and how you understand your own world. Imagine using this newfound wisdom to then heal yourself and others, to create a new reality through the prism of your authentic self, and lead a multidimensional soul-led life. This special skill can and should be used in service to others. Do good and you will do well. What better motivation. As the poet William Blake said, "In the universe, there are things that are known and things that are unknown. And in-between, there are doors." It's time to fling open the doors of perception. You can do it. Think big, but start small with the exercises that I've given you. If you haven't already, you will be experiencing the extraordinary beauty of worlds beyond anything you can ever imagine. And I cannot tell you genuinely how much that idea excites me. Astral projection can completely change your world and the way you see yourself within it. That's one reason it's considered an advanced practice, a super power, in most spiritual traditions. When talking about astral planes, former NASA physicist and OBE teacher Tom Campbell said, "You will find yourself out there." So buckle up for an interstellar experience of cosmic proportion. It's one hell of a ride to worlds beyond your wildest beliefs. These are places to connect with the deepest parts of your own soul. Parts you didn't even know existed. Experience yourself away from your body, as a soul, a spirit, or consciousness. Ultimately, this is a path to self-enlightenment. And you're on it. There is within you a hero. This is your journey. It's time to soar beyond the furthest reaches of reality to find the most important thing of all: you. Your actions for today are to share with the tribe how you plan to build astral projection into your everyday life. It's all good and well learning a practice, but if we can't fit it into our day, then we won't be able to do it or reap the benefits. This is called Real-world application. Got kids or pets? Great, use their wake-ups as a chance to practice. Travel on public transport? Fantastic, do some of your exercises then. You get a lie-in at the weekend? Brilliant, do your Wake Back to Bed routine then. Share your tips and tools for training, including when you're going to do it such as once or twice a week or maybe a month. Share this in the tribe. In this way, we give handy tricks to each other because you're a community now, astral allies. You have each other for support and to share your wildest stories with. Well done heroes. I'll see you on the other side.

LESSON 28: The Art of Astral Projection Live Experience Bonus Call #3: Celebration Call

Hello everyone and welcome to your celebration call for the Art of Astral Projection with Jade Shaw. Congratulations to all you students that have completed the program so far. If not, don't worry. We're going to give you some more fuel for your journey ahead and practicing astral projection. We've got Jade live from London on the call to help celebrate and we've got a little party for you planned today. I want to welcome warmly your author for the Art of Astral Projection, Jade Shaw. Welcome Jade. Hi, everybody. It's nice to see some of your faces again. I'm kind of getting to know some of your names. There's such a big group and it's really nice to connect with you throughout the course, which I don't normally get to do. So it's really nice to see your faces. I don't know where to look. I'm trying to connect with you either energetically or through your eyes. I'm trying to read messages as well. So I'm glad to be here. And at the end of the course, I was looking through the content. of what you've done over the past 28 days um and i was thinking oh my gosh i don't know if there is another course like this in fact i know there's not another course like this um Because you've learned so much, so much. In the last week alone, you looked at meeting other people in out -of -body experiences, potentially connecting with dead loved ones, shadow work, soul retrieval from shamanism, conscious dying, verifying your experiences, creating your own altered state, Gansfeld experiment. These are like... things you would normally spend maybe six weeks to longer just on one of these topics so I feel like you've been given this huge mountain of content so I am hoping that's a positive thing and I'm not feeling too overwhelmed but yeah you've got such a lot to go forward with so I'm very excited because actually now your journey is about to begin now you're about to go forward into a full astral projection practice with your bag of tools so it's a very exciting time i'm just looking through the messages at the side sorry getting distracted from where you are coming from okay so Because, sorry, I'm getting distracted reading your messages because you have covered such a lot. I was saying to Ezra, I was going to give some teaching points, but because we've covered some really big subjects, some very quite philosophical subjects as well. I wanted to give you the opportunity for some extra time for questions so that we have a little bit more time than normal so that if there's anything in that last week. particular for this next 10 minutes or so if there's any questions related to the shadow work soul retriever connecting with loved ones the target technique creating your own Gansfeld anything particularly with that last week, now would be a good time to ask that question. And we can either go a little bit deeper or I can solve some problems that you might have. And then there'll be another question period a little bit later on, which can be a bit more general, a bit more related to your practice, anything to do with that. So do any of you have any questions on some of those topics from that last week that I could help you with? Yes, if you guys have any questions, you can raise your little virtual hand. It's at the bottom of your screen under reactions, and I'll bring you on. We'll do a little bit Q &A here on the last week of West. Chintia, you can unmute yourself. Welcome to the call. Hi, thank you. Hello, everybody. So I do have a question from last week about encountering other travelers so you mentioned that um i also think jade that you mentioned the last call about this uh teacher of oves that was helping someone have an ob so get out of their body but the other person was afraid of what they saw when that other person came to help them and actually what i was wondering is do do you know of people that actually that have actually traveled together like that they've actually said okay let's just meet at this place let's have an ob at the same time and meet in this place and travel together. Is that possible? Because if this other person, when they had the OB, only saw that this cloud, but they didn't know what it was, could that be possible to travel with someone at the same time? Yes, a great question to kick off with in terms of... related to the shared out body experiences so short answer is yes you can so the example that i gave that week was of um somebody not being in in the right mind space to recognize um that that was someone trying to help them out of body and they that was because of their own level of awareness and their inability to perceive at that time they might have been drowsy and not perceived very clearly but you can actually decide to go somewhere in fact um they do this at the monroe institute um they decide to meet at the crystal there's a huge crystal in the gardens and they have a plan that with one of their friends we're going to meet at the crystal at around midnight and we're going to go out of body and see if we can get there they do this at the end of their course and everyone sees who was there and and did you meet up some people do some people don't some people get halfway and snap back to their body um so yes it's possible you can do it um it's it's relatively hard for complete beginners, I would say. So as I said before, it depends on your, can you have an out -of -body experience at will? Can you definitely make your intention happen? Sometimes we come out of our body and we are pulled to somewhere related to something we need to go and see. So we might not do our plan as we'd like to. We might be pulled somewhere else. We might come out of our body and be in a different time period, not the one that we want to be in. to verify and go and meet that person so it depends on a lot of variables whether we can successfully make it happen so it depends on consistent practice level of awareness willpower ability to target and then do it at the same time as the other person so then you've got to bring those two skill sets together to see if you can do it however saying that remember that time and space doesn't operate in the same way right so you could have one person come out of their body go meet someone else come back but that person hasn't had the experience yet but then they do have the experience five days seven days down the line and then you can verify and corroborate what has happened Did you get there? Were you wearing this? Did you see that eagle on that treetop at the same time? But it might not happen at the same time, but you can have a shared experience because of the difference in quantum, the quantum ideas and notions of time. So it does get a bit weird as well. Short answer is yes, which is why it's very exciting to do. Okay, thank you. I hope that was somewhat helpful. yes yes yes uh i was wondering if it was possible and also um i guess not only to meet at one place but is it possible to go together in the astral plane to other places? Yeah I've not heard of many people doing that because by going together there's an assumption there that again, that you're either in the same place to go together and not just in the same physical place. Are you going to be in the same, are you going to be aligned in your vibration and frequency to move someplace together? And let's just say you do go to travel together. Will one person manually travel there in a linear fashion, like go out the door, down the street? up to the sky so this is what is traveling in a linear fashion as if we were going out for the day walking or will one of the people teleport there instantly so one person could teleport the other person might have to get there in their own way but the fact of the matter is once you're together together then generally yes you can travel together but usually people end up meeting there and then go on a journey rather than going from the same starting point if that makes sense but just because I haven't heard of that going together in the first initial instance doesn't mean that it can't happen maybe I've just not come across it yet so maybe you'll be the first person to do it and then you can come back and be like well Jade actually me and my partner or me and my friend we went together so you can test that one out for me okay yeah it'll be an interesting experiment for sure it's a fun one that no worries Great. Thanks so much, Cynthia. Up next, I'd love to bring on Cesar. Welcome to the call, Cesar. You can unmute yourself. Thank you. Finally, I get the chance to talk. I want to congratulate you guys for this program. It has been amazing for me. However, I haven't been able to experience the out -of -body experience, but I had before a near -death experience. And I know that, you know, I was out there and I was talking with this energy and I have that sense. And when I was very little, also, I was able by meditation to levitate around the room. I was able to do that. Also, in another occasion, when I was doing a meditation with Metatron, I was involved with these beautiful shapes. And, you know, it was outside of this world, shapes, colors, purple. It was beautiful. And I learned also how to access the Akashic records. So I can read my own records. I can read other people's records. Very accurate. And I have helped a lot of people doing this. But through this course, I haven't been able to have that emotion, that sense that I know that I have had in the past. I haven't reached that point. But yes, I got in a very deep meditation. uh and i you know i don't fall asleep i concentrate i'm learning as a matter of fact when i wake when i get out of the of the of the doing the exercises i start writing things a lot of things and and things have revealed to me about what is going on in the world what is going to happen you know very high knowledge that I, you know, otherwise I will not have access. But I haven't had the chance to experience that out -of -body experience yet. So I'm going to keep trying and see what happens, but just want to see if I need to do something else different or my expectations are so high. Probably a couple of those things. So the fact that you've had the near -death experience and the one when you were a child and the one with Metatron as well. the ability is there you have the ability we all have the ability just if we have these experience before it's often easier to connect back with it to get in touch with it now It's interesting, the near -death experience and when you as a child and perhaps the one with Metatron, often we have what's called evolutionary out -of -body experiences. So these ones happening at a particular time in our life. Maybe we're at a crossroads. Maybe we need some specific help and insight, a realization at that particular time. So these can... be spontaneous or they can be self -induced so i'm i'm guessing maybe at those points particularly the near -death one you had that specific outer body experience because of that time in your life to be able to get that information so it could be one of the reasons could be and there's not there's not a huge particular need or want or for at this point in your life in terms of the evolutionary So that could be one reason. The other one is it has only been 28 days. So in order to cultivate some of these habits, some of these behaviors, it is often it does take a lot longer than 28 days, unless we've had similar practices before deep meditation, altered state work, or we have a certain personality type that allows us to align with these experiences more, for example, a high absorption mindset. So it could be that as well. I often say to people, it is the case of consistency, reminding ourselves of our intention and motivation, why we're doing this. And then at the end of that, letting it go. And we do find, I think I said this last time, that sometimes we give up. We go, I've been trying for... 28 days to three months, I'm just going to give up now. And then the person gives up and then they have a spontaneous out -of -body experience. So that also could happen. But I would say stick with it, stick with the practice. And is there a particular, a guide or a deity or an aspect of yourself that you feel you could call upon in support of making the experience happen? Yeah, Michael, son Michael. Archangel Michael. Yeah, I know he's my spiritual guide out there. Metatron too. Very, very concentrate on those. Now, I know that I'm connected. That's the thing. I know that the connection is there and I know it. I feel it and I feel the knowledge and I feel all the connection. But it's that sense of being there, like visualize things. You know, I think that is more, I visualizing the things through other senses, not the visual as I would like to see. Going in a room and sitting, my knowledge is in kind of in my head and I write it down and I'm able to help a lot of people because of that. I'm helping people all around me, my family, friends. Everybody comes to me for help. everybody uh but i would like to feel it i would like you know like but but i haven't been able to have that feeling i guess i haven't done it and i realized that i'm doing it i guess that that's that's my conclusion right now yeah well that might be the case that might be the case then for now because you obviously have some sort of gift or connection because you're helping so many people with that um but i would say keep keep sticking at it for sure and keep going back through. And this is for everyone else as well. You know, we've done the quest once now, but you have that. So you can go through the quest and even do the quest again and go through all the materials. So I would say keep sticking to it, consistency and help calling on Michael, Metatron or for other people, whatever it is for you to have that experience and maybe asking them also why, because we come with an idea of what we want and why. want it um and sometimes that can be quite limiting so if we can let that go and then ask our higher self our guide our angel whoever it might be why we should have this experience then maybe the experience might happen quicker um in one way otherwise it is it is a case of practice I know um it is it's one of the like in the Tibetan Buddhist tradition they practice for four they have to practice other mind training for four years before they get taught this so they have the right conditions of their mind to be able to do it at will and we're learning it in 28 days so it is a pretty a pretty a pretty challenging thing. So yeah, I would just say keep sticking at it. For sure. And one last thing is just I want to congratulate everybody because through you, we are connected and we are changing the world. I know that. I know that we're changing the world and you are a light in everybody's lives today. And I'm connected to all of you today because of you. And this year is going to be so special for everybody. And you guys are so special. And really, we are going to be doing fantastic things. And so I need to be here to tell you. that today and and we are connected and i really i have i have a very deep love for all of you i i i don't know you but i i know i am part of you and and i just want to thank mind valley for doing this and you guys you have no idea about the value that you are adding to my life and everybody's lives so thank you very much for everything oh thank you caesar that was a wonderful note to end on i really appreciate you sharing that thank you thanks so much caesar and um Let's bring on Abby. Abby, welcome to the call. Hi. I'm so grateful to be here. And that was so beautiful. Amazing quest. Thank you. Thank you. I had four OBEs early on in the quest. I haven't as much in the last couple of weeks, but I had an interesting experience with the verification. So I took a deck of cards that I never, I hadn't been looked at in years and I pulled one out and I put it on top of my bed. And that night I wasn't able to get out of body because I know what that full experience feels like. Right. I knew that the card was blue and I knew that it was like outlined in this blue and I didn't even know what these cards look like. And the next day I check and it was blue, but I wasn't fully out of body. And so, but I could kind of see it. And so I have this theory I wanted to ask you about that. Is there a matter of degree to which you can leave the body that, you know, if you get to. a certain level it's like full out of body experience but i have this sensation that i can get part of my consciousness out of my body and experience some things without having full out of body experience could you maybe comment on that yeah so we can yeah so phenomenologically so that means the way in which we experience different experiences um we can retrieve information so for example you could have a lucid dream and end up psychically tapping into what is on the top of my wardrobe in in my room what card you could do a meditation and get to a deep level and and and find out information again from that card you could do the same thing with um if we were taking some sort of plant medicine so we can access external knowledge through varying different mediums, you know, channeling, remote viewing as well. So you can tap into that. What makes an out -of -body experience an out -of -body experience is that sense of leaving the body and going to a place. And having that, oh my God, it's real, I'm there, I'm out, I'm moving around. And that's when you can tell when you've had a full one, like you can and like Cesar can. And you can tell the difference when you're having a vision or you are channeling something or you are tapping into something. but you aren't actually leaving. So some of these experiences where we can find the information aren't necessarily a full blown out of body experience, but it could be you're psychically having some sort of clairvoyance through the hypnagogic, which is a thing as well. So that's that in terms of the differences between different experiences and out of body experience. The reason why I mentioned this is because often people think that they are visiting an astral plane through closing their eyes and imagining. You can tap into information in under the plane through active imagination from Carl Jung, but it's not the same experience as an out -of -body experience, but neither is better or worse. So that's the first thing. Second thing, which relates probably a bit more directly to your question, can you have a degree of consciousness? Can you leave your body to certain depths as you come out? Yes. So, for example, you can come out of your body. not see anything and it'd be completely black and dark but you can move around so you know that you're out and you're there but you can't see another one is you can momentarily be in your body and be psychically aware of everything in the room that you cannot see through your normal eyes but you know something is there but you haven't quite got let's say full consciousness so there can be an extension of awareness or sort of a psychic ability let's say but it isn't the full -blown thing and this is when you have these weird little experiences happen when you begin practicing For example, you might, there's some things I haven't mentioned, you might start to hear voices in your hypnagogic, which means you're tuning in, but you aren't quite there yet. And that can be through varying different ways as well. So the short answer is yes, but it depends on a number of variables. There isn't a clear -cut answer. And also, is it astral projection or is it a separate? equally amazing experience that we're retrieving the information from as well. I do want to point out something in relation to your experience of the blue. So there's a theory that is put forward by Graham Nichols who wrote the book Navigating the Outerbody Experience and he's had quite a few people give case studies to him. And he's experienced that when they look at something in the future. So they're having a future or prophetic outer body experience. The tinge of the reality is often blue. So either the whole reality or part of the reality has this kind of blue, cold residue. So it's interesting how you were trying to do the verification, which is something. And then it was blue and it hadn't yet because it is in the future, really. in terms of me then telling you what that is you don't know it yet so that that shows to me that you were you really onto something that you are you are having a some kind of out of body experience um so yes that's kind of the feedback i have for that there's quite a lot there i hope it was useful in some way useful later on even though I knew more I've been thinking some of the things that I'm seeing in the chat like in addition to motivation and practice is there like something that I've changed with the food I'm eating or the time of my cycle or like are there any other factors that weigh into our ability to to do it yeah I mean there's some I'll just read off a couple of um basic things that need more uh more research on your on your part so firstly I do find this is my experience it might not be everybody's but in my menstrual cycle I find that when I am ovulating and when I am about to bleed that I have more transpersonal experiences. psychic awareness or ability let's say that may may or may not be the same for you interesting to look at again some people report the moon phases so practicing at a time of the full moon this is very well known in wicca as well a lot of people say this so if you bleed around the full moon that might make sense um for these experiences um so that's in regards to the menstrual cycle very briefly um but also food a lot of people and particularly the yogic tradition, do say about a vegetarian diet, not having such dense foods, like the energetic density that there is in meat, because it makes the astral body lighter and more easy to connect to. So having a vegetarian diet, this isn't... I am a vegetarian, but this isn't necessarily my view because I do know a lot of meat eaters who are astral projectors like William Buhlman from the Monroe Institute. But this is the yogic perspective and also intermittent fasting as well. So if you haven't heard of intermittent fasting, it's just good for your health. And there's a lot of science around that. But if you don't eat after. What is it? I've done this before. I think not eating, I have a late, I do it different to normal intermittent fasting. So I usually don't eat after three. So I have a very, very long period of not eating until lunchtime the next day. But what it means is you haven't got all your energy of the body going to digesting food before you go to bed, which can also make you feel very sleepy. So your awareness when you haven't got anything in your tummy is more on the surface, more awake, more focused. um more sensitive to tap into these um to be able to stay awake and to tap into these realms rather than being heavy and it all going to the gut effectively so potentially vegan vegetarian diet intermittent fasting um and menstrual cycle moon cycle being aware of that You can write about that in your diary as well. If you notice you have spontaneous experiences, just note the moon cycle, your menstrual cycle. And the moon cycle is also for men or people who identify as men. You don't feel like, oh, the moon cycle doesn't relate to me because I don't. I don't have a uterus. There is studies, scientific studies that show when the moon is full, there is more likely to be more crime committed in different cities in the world. So it does have some sort of pull on the psyche, on the body, for everybody, apparently. So yes, you can give that a go as well and monitor the moon phases. But I will, I'll think of some more practical kind of... of things apart from the mind training. Thank you for that question. That was probably useful for quite a lot of people. Well, helpful. Thank you so much. Thanks. Thanks a lot, Abby. I'm just going to clear everybody's hands. I'd love to bring on a couple of you that have had an out -of -body experience in the last couple of weeks, maybe since the last call. So go ahead and raise your hand. We'd love to hear some of you that are already having some of these experiences. Ana, we'll bring you on. Welcome to the call, Ana. And don't worry, we're going to have more questions at the end as well. Hello. I'm not sure if you can hear me. Yeah, we can hear you. Great. Hi. Thank you so much, first of all, for the amazing quest. It's been like an amazing, crazy, wild trip. So first of all, thank you. And the second, yes, I did. It was wild. It's my first time. So yeah. it's it's I think more exciting because it's the first time that has ever happened to me and I actually wrote to Jade and she replied that oh wow like this is mind -blowing but I just traveled around my house you know I felt the vibration I felt my body coming out and then I just traveled around my house and I moved somewhere open a door and moved somewhere else like someone else's house I think it's not it was no longer my house I opened the door and got in someone someone else's house And then that was the first time and I was doing the rolling technique. You know, the technique where you roll, that's actually a technique that works really well for me. I tried it another time and I felt the vibration, but then I think I fell asleep because it wasn't the same. I was dreaming. I'm not sure that was an out -of -body experience. But yeah, it was my first time and it was with the rolling technique and it was mind -blowing because I never experienced that before. and actually i think i found this way easier to to to do than lucid dreaming lucid dreaming was like it's it's complicated like yeah but this is easier actually with the rolling technique i just felt my body suddenly plume out it helped that i did a very deep when i do a deep meditation before doing the technique that actually helps because when i try to do it without the meditation Before it's not that easy, but yeah. So yeah, it's amazing. It's wild. Thank you for sharing that. That's a really good point you had at the end with the deep, doing the deep meditation beforehand. So important. And that's why we have these relaxation techniques, the breathing techniques, some of the visualization. I think it really bumps up the chances of having an experience very heavily. So thank you for sharing that. And I'm so glad you had that body experience. yeah you must i must admit though like you must have some sort of maybe um i don't maybe some sort of i don't want to say natural ability because we we all have this ability but most people find lucid dreaming easier so you find astral projection easier exactly so this is like maybe astral projection is your thing because often lucid dreaming is considered or people find it easier so if you can roll out and you've had an experience already that's that's really good that's really fantastic so well done yeah it's amazing one more thing I also try to like when I try it at night it doesn't work as well as when I do it during daytime so I try to spare a little bit of time once a week to at least try to do it because when I'm when I try at night whether my boyfriend touches me or you know like I'm not I don't fully relax when I'm alone at home I know no one's gonna bother me I just you know just fully relaxed. So I do my meditation and then I try to do it. And well, one time I did fell asleep. I know I felt the vibration. I felt my body coming out, but then I know I was sleeping. I wasn't astral projecting. So yeah, if the problem is falling asleep, just try to do it during daytime. So thank you so much. Awesome. Thank you, Anna. Very cool. Brad, welcome to the call. You can unmute yourself. Hi, thank you very much. Question following up on what someone said earlier, I've had an out -of -body experience and also it was one where the light shot out of the top of my head and came back in me and then I was in the void and it seems like, well, I've been having, let's say my third eye has been somewhat active since then and how often does that happen? How often, just to be specific, how often does what happens specifically? Your third eye become active on your first out -of -body experience. like very active wow okay yes yes um yeah actually it is quite common especially if you've had quite a powerful out -of -body experience You may have heard, and this is to the whole group, of people having a near -death experience and then when they come back, they feel like they've got higher psychic awareness or they come back with an ability that they didn't have before. They are able to perceive things they couldn't. They can tune into people, other realities. So in a near -death experience, you have an out -of -body experience. The only difference is your body and you're not dying, right? So when we have an out -of -body experience and... particularly that are filled with something that we feel is really powerful so you said the white light coming out and feeling like it was opening it certainly can it does happen and this is why they talk about in the yogic and the buddhist traditions you have to do quite a lot of mind training beforehand because if that third eye opens you need to be able to hold the power of that and to be able to use that power in a good way and not let it Not let it take you into a place where you're really struggling with it. So what I'm thinking of here is if some people's third eye are opened before they are ready or before they have the... this psychic and psychological maturity to be able to hold that power then they might sense things and perceive things and and interpret that in ways which aren't necessarily true so some people could maybe go into a psychosis or have a spiritual crisis and really struggle with that they might even have a dark night of the soul dealing with this huge realization or this this huge different this huge transformation effect that they have and this is why in kundalini yoga they talk about something similar you know being able to hold that kundalini energy when you've opened that center and you hear about people that that do this and they can go off the rails for a little bit now what what i align with is a person called stanislav groff he was one of the founders of transpersonal psychology and even though what i'm talking about might seem a little bit scary you know unlocking part of our ultimate potential and having this ability to connect with other places. But he says that period of transformation after we open our third eye or have a big experience. Yes, we might struggle to find our way with it at first. Not everyone struggles. Some people are like, OK, let's go straight away. Some people do. He sees it as a like we are shedding a skin like these new wings are opening and we didn't even know we had the wings. We didn't even know the wings were there. And suddenly we've got these huge wings and we're like, holy crap, how I can fly to. wherever um and he says the knowing of that can be quite district can be quite a lot to take in, but that it is a positive part of our moving into a higher dimension of consciousness, shifting into this new reality and new sense of self. So yes, it is common. Sorry, yes, it does happen to many people, but particularly those with powerful ones. And it sounds like you had one because you spoke about the light coming out. You didn't give me much more, but the way that you're talking about it seems like it was one of those. How have you been, when did this happen? June 13th, last summer. Not that I'm counting, just had my seven month anniversary with it. Yeah. So that's quite soon. That's quite, you know, that's not many, that's not long ago last June's quite soon. How have you been coping or dealing with it or how has it been impacting you? To give an idea of when we open these psychic areas, maybe to some of the others in the group. Well, after my feet touched the ground two weeks later, it's like you said, the things kept getting stronger. month after month I would notice like the skin shedding and you know as soon as I would think it's closing up something else would happen and I would you know be real happy and but it seems like everything's working well. yeah thank you for thank you for sharing that it's nice to hear someone who's who's who has recently happened to and he's going through it to you know be supportive of others that might not be speaking up and going through something similar but also um you've just reminded me there of the the integration and the embodiment techniques so this is a little tip if uh if this happens to you or if or if uh it's happening to you right now the embodiment and the integration class that we had at the end the more that we go out here the more important it is to ground back down so I'm going to use the example of a shaman. The reason why shamans can hold space for others and they have these powers is because they really root back down into this reality, this earth. They use nature to do that quite a lot of the time. So the more we go out, the more grounded we have to become. So it's almost like... higher for us to grow the deeper our roots have to dig down in order so there's this kind of action like this going and if we don't do the grounding or the the digging down and the rooting we can just kind of float off into the heavens into the ether so this is really important if you have had a center open uh for anybody to do a lot of grounding practices to be able to hold that power that that potential of yourself So I would say a lot more grounding stuff for everybody. Actually, that's important generally, as well as this. Thank you. I'm going to stop talking. Thank you. Thank you. Thanks so much, Brad, for your share. Jade, so can you tell us what are our next steps as we progress through the program and ask your projections and what are the next steps for students that want to learn more? Yes, I've actually mentioned a couple. So first is. do repeat the quest again. Now, you don't have to do it every single day as you have done, but if there's any key lessons or any areas you feel are your weaker points, repeat those classes and repeat those days. You have access to that now, so really use that and utilize it to your advantage. The other thing is now the practice begins. It's like learning how to run a marathon. You found the right shoes. You've learned how to run. Now you're about to set off. So it might feel like, oh, I've already set off. But actually, you've been learning the techniques, the exercises, the trainings, the mindset. Now it's bringing it all together and putting it into a consistent. Action. I mean, a lot of you are regular Mindvalley members. So, you know, in most of the quests, we talk about dedication and consistency, discipline. We can be the talented, most talented astral projector, but the most talented astral projector isn't going to have as many regular. or deep experiences as that person who is disciplined every day and made certain ones a habit because over time those neural pathways build through that consistency that discipline that dedication so our brain literally changes to be able to cultivate and for us to have more experiences so making sure we now practice and keep it consistent, but that it's realistic for you. So make sure if you're not a person who can do two or three wake back to beds a week, you can only do one. Just do one and then start to build from there. So try not to compare your practice or your journey to somebody else who might have a completely different personality and psychospiritual journey to what you're on. It has to work for you and where you're currently at, which could be different to somewhere else. So remember, you've got the hero's journey to track your transformation, to track your progress. So do revert back to that to see where you're at on your journey. The second thing is there are two quests which can help you. So the ultra silver mind quest can help and Charlie Morley's lucid dreaming one. So the techniques from both of those, all of the techniques and the exercises can be utilized for astral projection. Not every single one, but a heavy bulk of them, particularly if you remember your dreams quite a lot, you have very vivid dreams. It could be that astral projection through the lucid dream state might work better for you. It could be that you can get yourself into a hypnosis state or very deep relaxation very quick, but you're not very good at weight back to bed, in which case some of the ultra mind techniques could work better for you if you applied them to astral projection. So I would say to do those two quests or one of them that resonates with you. And then I had one more tip. Where are we for this? Yes. Oh, I. So for people that have gone through the beginning, the beginning journey, which you guys have all of these different sorts of techniques, I do kind of bespoke astral projection themes. So, for example, I do a. a plant medicine one with teas. I'm actually going to give you a little tea ritual to take away now because one of the days I wanted to do was one way we look at different teas and we didn't put it in at the end. We edited it out for numerous reasons, but I'm going to show you a little ritual thing you can do now. So I'm going to say four different types of teas now and maybe I'll write them in the chat box and you can use one of these or you can try them all. And maybe people who are struggling a little bit might like this. I'm just trying to get access to the button. Here we go. So these four Ts you can use as part of the wake back to bed. I'm just trying to accent right. So I'm going to write them down next. The first one you may have heard of is Mugwat. And then the next one is Klayazaka Deshishi, which is very satisfying to say. I know I may be spelling this wrong, but you get the gist. You can put it into Google. Gayusa and Blue Lotus. Blue Lotus is used by the ancient Egyptians for astral projection and lucid dreaming. So I've wrote them in the chat. It's just come up. Mugwa, Klayazaka Desishi, Gayusa and Blue Lotus. Three steps to your own tea ritual that can really help cultivate and support your practice. The first step is I'm going to talk about this as though you're doing a wake back to bed, but you don't have to do it as part of wake back to bed. You could do it in the afternoon, in the morning. So if we woke up at four or five. Go to make your tea. When you make your tea, do the dharana practice. So effectively, you pour the tea and you're focusing on the tea, the smells, how it feels. You're doing mindfulness effectively with making tea and the dharana practice. You're focusing on what's happening. So you make the tea and you do dharana. The second step is to sit down with your tea, have a got a cup. Yes. Sit down with your tea and you might like to do this if you have a meditation altar or in your favorite spot in your house. Sit down with your tea and you speak your intention, your projection plan into the tea. so you say into it what you want to do and why you want to do it and you might like to call on that plant to support your journey so there's this idea of plants having an awareness different plants have different properties that can help us with different things some make us less stressful some make us more active so you can actually call on the plant or the plant consciousness, as some people believe plants are conscious, to support your astral projection. So you speak into it, your intention, your motivation, and then you can call on the plant itself if you wish to, to support that. And then you drink the tea, and then you can meditate on your intention when you've drunk the tea. Then you get into bed, or wherever you're doing your practice, and... do those exercises you've chosen to do for your practice, which could be a visualization, breathing, whatever it is for you. You would do your normal wake back to bed practices as you go into sleep. There's something else here. So you were also drawing on the placebo. So when you drink the tea, there's a placebo at work and placebos work. Even if you know it's a placebo, we have the scientific evidence on that, which is nuts. But also there's the placebo. and the genuine connection to the plant and the plant consciousness at action. So you kind of got double the power whammy there. So yes, someone's wrote a plant medic's quest would be amazing. So these are just four teas that I wrote here. It's very basic. I've been giving you a lot of advice and then three tips to do a tea ritual as part of your wake back to bed. The teas work in the same way that the binaural beats do. The binaural beats put us into a space which allow the journey to take place more easily than if we were doing it on our own. It's the same thing when we drink tea, the plants do the same. So, and someone Lillian's put here plant spirit medicine as a book. So if you're into plants and herbalism, there are other teas as well than these. Blue Lotus has a slightly psychoactive, um tinge to it so if you're very sensitive just start off with a little bit of blue lotus otherwise go for it put loads of that tea in there get it really really strong and be like tea come on i haven't had an experience yet i'm calling on you plant consciousness blue lotus help me out let's have a natural projection experience here we go then drink your tea but don't forget to say your intention as well um so you might like to do your tea ritual Otherwise, do keep sharing your experiences in the community. Sharing and speaking about them helps to connect us to astral projection in a way that can give us an experience. I've had people say to me, you know, I shared an astral projection with my friend and then that night I had one. But also in sharing your experience with others, sometimes you can trigger an experience for them. So other case studies and students of mine and said, I've shared my experience with my friend and then she had an out of body experience. And it's even the same when you just read about them in the. community group where people share so do keep connected to community and there's i don't know the statistics on this as you can guess like i've not got a great memory for these but if you practice with a group and a community you are more likely to succeed at whatever it is you are trying to trying to do and it's something ridiculous like 50 more you're likely to succeed at it so keep that community connection going Hey, Vanessa said the same thing. I've triggered more experiences for other people than myself. You're obviously very inspiring, Vanessa, and have this capacity to connect with others in a way that makes them have experiences. That's a wonderful gift to have. But yeah, maybe you could find someone to do the same thing for you as well. So do make sure you connect in the community going forward. Oh, if you are interested in these. Day workshops, that's what I was talking about. I do an intensive plant medicine for astral projection workshop where we go into depth and we actually do the practice and drink the tea together and then we all lie down and do it. Or if you're interested in specifically hypnosis techniques for astral projection. I would advise you just to sign up to my email list because I'm actually going to release a special discount on a workshop tomorrow. But I let my own audience know first, my own community. So I'm going to put the link in the chat. You click that and then you just fill out the form. You actually get a free handout on Astral Projection, which is some basic tips. And then you'll be on my newsletter for me to then send you that information about these special other workshops. I'm just going to find that now. So I've got that for you. OK, so I've put in the chat box the link to sign up for my newsletter and you should get one. by tomorrow morning on a special one, a special discount on a Valentine's one that's going out. So, but do keep in touch. Do keep in touch with me as well. If you have an out -of -body experience, feel free to email me and tell me about it. In fact, I'm looking for experiences for my book that I'm writing. If you feel like it would be useful or you would like to share it with others to inspire others, I'd be happy to have a read through it. It's always wonderful to see people having experiences after trying for either quite a while or straight away. It's amazing. a valentine's out of body experience yes there is an event that i might be doing as well which is to do with love finding love and sex in the astral so that is a workshop that may be coming in the future and you'll find out about that on the newsletter so do fill in that email link yes nice to see you dory as well i'm going to hand back over to ezra um but it's really nice to see that you're excited about going forward Yes. Thank you so much, Jade. What a great call. We don't have any more time for questions, but you can always message her on her Instagram. And we do have a few minutes left. Jade didn't want to have a little bit of a dance party to close out our celebration call. So I've got a special song from Jade. You want to guide us, Jade? Well, so actually, can we do one? Oh, we've got, have we got time? Yeah, we got time. So yeah, I picked this song because it's positive and also I kind of feel like the lyrics are talking about us lot. So the lyrics are like, yeah, we've all gone out in the astral and we're all there having a good time. We're all meeting up together and we're going to have an astral party. So this is kind of like the lyrics are talking about when we're all out of body and we're all going to meet up. So I felt like this would be a fun song. So everybody get ready. Create some space where you can get moving. We're going to have a little dance party to close out this call and celebrate your astral projection journey.
