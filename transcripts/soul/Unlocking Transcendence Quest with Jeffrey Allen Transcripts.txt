Intro 1: How To Succeed With Unlocking Transcendence
--------------------

Hi everyone, I’m Jeffrey Allen and welcome to the program. Welcome to 60 Days to Spiritual Fitness. I’m really excited to bring this program to you and I know that you’re already committed because you’re here, you’re watching this video, you’re already in. And this is fantastic because I know that this particular program has the potential to have more impact than any program that I’ve made so far. And I really know that this is going to get you on your fast track to your spiritual growth. And you might be wondering too, like, which level is this program looking at? Is it for beginners or intermediates or for advanced students? And the answer is yes. The answer is yes, it’s for a beginner, intermediate, and advanced students. Because what happens in this training is that you’re going to be working on your level of fitness in several different areas. And wherever you’re needing to level up a little bit and come up, you’ll get more training there. Now, I always… make my training sound like they’re super easy. Anybody can do it. Just step right in. And that’s because I want you to have that feeling of ease as you go to the program. That doesn’t mean the program is superficial or it isn’t going to get deep. We will get deep in every single level. And I’ll give you specific exercises you can do on your own as well for getting deeper and deeper. So whatever level you’re at, just don’t worry. There’s something really valuable in the program for you. Now, because you’re really committed to the program, I want to be just that committed to you. And so I want to give you today just a few things to help you get through the program in the most easiest and most powerful way. So first I’m going to tell you a little background on kind of how we learn, how we get information in. Then I’m going to tell you why I structured the program the way I did and how it’s going to help you, you know, get through the program that way. Then we’re going to look at the 10 top things that get in the way of spiritual growth. Just the kind of obstacles that you might bump into and i’ll tell you how to address each of those and the goal to all these is the same it’s to get you to the end of the program right because if you can get to the end of the program i know you’re going to have amazing amazing results all right so let’s start out with that that you know how do we learn you know what is the in information the style and in general how do we learn now i’ve been teaching for many years and i’ve been watching the abstract process i’m also a software engineer so I like to look at systems and designs and how things work beneath the covers so we can optimize it, make it better and faster. Now, what I’ve noticed is that there’s three main components to learning in a workshop and a training. There’s the information, which is really, in some ways, just mental entertainment. It’s very exciting. It’s interesting. It’s kind of what makes you feel like you learn something, but it’s not very applied oftentimes, and information really is easy to forget. You know this. You’ve forgotten things. I forget lots of things. And so the information by itself is actually not a very powerful way to learn. Now the second piece is activation. Now activation is a way that we assist somebody in practicing. So an example in here, I’ll be guiding you through exercises with my voice. And so because I’m guiding you through, it’s easier for you to do the exercise than if you’re trying to… to imagine it on your own. So that’s the activation part. And what’s really powerful about activation is that unlike information, activation never goes away. Like once you get it, it’s inside you and you keep it. It may go dormant, but it’s very easy to bring it back out. And I’ll give you a funny example. So I’ve got this little puppy, Lucas, and he was… Trying to get up on the daybed. So we would sit on the daybed because he couldn’t get up there. It was kind of nice to take a break sometimes while he’s, you know, tearing around doing puppy things. Then one day I decided that I wanted to help him because he was running up and sort of smashing into the side of the daybed. So I just kind of guided his body through the motions. I kind of showed him how he could do it and just sort of like helped him get up there one time, right? So this is the activation process. Next time he ran up, you know, he didn’t make it. Second time he made it up perfect. And then he never forgot. Once he knew that he could do it and he’d got to that place, game over. He was, you know, always on the couch from then on, which I don’t know if that was a good thing, but it’s a good example of how activation works. Same thing is going to happen for you in this program. You’re going to activate these different levels of awareness and then you won’t lose that activation. You will keep that. Even if it goes dormant, you’ll be able to bring it back very easily. Now, the third type of learning that we typically see in programs is just practice. The more you practice something, the better you get. This is actually the only required element to learning. So if you didn’t get any information, you didn’t get any activation, but you just practice something like crazy and you want to do it, you’re going to learn it. It’s actually the only one that you really have to do. And so in the program, I’m going to give you lots of ways that you can continue to continue to practice on your own and build that up. So those are the three big ones. Now, if you think about it in terms of physical fitness, Now, which of these would you use? If you want to really get in shape, are you going to buy a book or maybe watch a video? Are you going to hire a personal trainer or are you going to get a home gym? So which of those is going to help you the most? Okay, so the book, it’s not going to help you much if you just get the book. That’s just information. You’re not going to get in shape reading a book. Hiring a personal trainer, that’s a really good investment because that’s activation. They’re going to assist you. in learning how to use your body and how to do whatever workout you want to do to get in shape. So that’s kind of the fast track is the activation. But also the home gym, good idea, because you need to practice, right? If you don’t practice, you won’t continue moving past that activation step. So that’s kind of how I’ve organized this same program here in that same order of steps. Now, keep in mind that there’s also an activation part that has to do with energy too, right? As we’re going through the program, I’m assisting you with the energy and helping lift up your level of awareness or fitness so that you can do the exercises that you might not be able to do on your own. Just like I help my dog up under the couch. I’m not saying you’re a puppy, but it’s a fun analogy. And because I’m assisting you in kind of temporarily raising your fitness level, you can do it, you get that sense of success, and then you can do it again and again. Now, there’s also activation that comes with like the time and the place. So these are recorded, and I’m recording it all here in Sedona, Arizona, because Sedona has a beautiful, really powerful activation energy. Also, I’m recording it on my own. There’s no crew here. It’s just me and you with the camera here, and I’m directly talking to you, and this is the closest we can get to having a private conversation around this. Now, there are some drawbacks to this. Being in Sedona means that there’s helicopters and airplanes flying around. In fact, I can hear one right now. And so you’ll have a little bit of background noise. Me shooting without a crew means that there’s going to be some non -perfect video, non -perfect audio. I’ll be looking at my notes at times. So it’s not intended to impress you. It’s intended to help you. So I want to give you the most authentic experience I can. Also, the really interesting thing about having this recorded ahead of time is that when you’re going through the program and listening, I will be going through it with you as a student and teacher with you. So I’ll be listening to my meditations, I’ll be watching the videos, and then I’ll be assisting with the energy behind the scenes. And this is what gives the program that extra like oomph, really gives you the power to make it through. And then, of course, we’ll be talking to each other on the online system and sharing and communicating. this way as well. So it’s really, I’m super excited. It’s so powerful to do it this way. You’re going to have amazing, amazing results. Now, let me get into a little bit of details, how the program is structured, just to kind of help you understand it better. And then we’ll get into those 10 different things that might get in the way. And I’ll give you a quick way to get through each of them. So the way I’ve structured it, it’s 60 days long. It’s just 10 to 15 minutes a day. It’s about 10 % information, 90 % activation. So I’m not teaching that much. Mostly you’re doing stuff. And then there’ll be lots of practice that you can do throughout the day, but that should happen naturally. It’s just practice in your life. It’s not something that’s hard or effortful. There’s no checklist or anything. You just do it. The program is broken down into six sections, six 10 -day challenges. And I call it a challenge because I want you to really do your best to show up each day of the challenge. For 10 days, we’ll be going through a sequence of activating a particular type of awareness. So the first day will be a little video where I tell you about it, then a little meditation, then we’ll do three days of audio where it’s just meditation, no information. Then I’ll come back on, we’ll review a little bit, give you some applications on day five, and then we’ll go into the second part of that teaching. We’ll do three days of audio where you’re just meditating, and then we’ll come back out on day nine, again, do a little review, give you some applications. And then day 10 is actually an integration day where you can rest if you want to. There’s a do -it -yourself practice meditation you can use that’ll guide you through, or you can just get caught up. And so it’s six 10 -day classes put together. And what’s great about this, like I said, my goal is to get you all the way to the end of the program. And with this style, if you miss a day somewhere in the program, just don’t worry about it. Just keep going. I’ll talk about that more in a minute. Because that day 10 is built and every 10 days, there’s sort of one day of gap. Like if you missed, it’s okay. You can get caught up. Even day nine, if you missed two days out of every 10, not such a big deal. Day nine is not as important. It’s great. It’s going to help you integrate. But if you missed it, not so bad. So what I’m going to want you to do is start every 10 days, start fresh, right? So when we come upon day 11, it’ll be day one of each challenge. When you get to that day, even if you’re not caught up, start fresh. You’re 100 % caught up day one of every 10 -day section. This will help you keep going because it’s easy to fall behind at times, and I don’t want you to give up. I want you to, like, you know, get back on track. These are little on -ramps to get you back onto the program. Okay, let’s see, what else? There’s also, like, a forgetting curve that happens with learning. And so you’ll notice that I’ll repeat things. So we’ll practice the same thing several times. I’ll kind of space it at different intervals. so that you won’t forget. You’ll remember the awareness. You’ll remember it as you go. Also, if you have duality tools, if you take my other training with Mindvalley, feel free to use those tools. They’re not required for this training, but if you have them, just sprinkle them in. You’ll know where to use them and enjoy. That’ll just make it even more fun and powerful for you. Okay, so again, what I want you to do is I want you to listen to the days in order. The first 10 days, you’re going to listen to day one, day two, day three, day four. If you miss a day, keep going. Listen to day five on that sixth day, right? So that’s something by in order. Do them sequentially and miss the last two, one or two, if you happen to miss something. And then every 10 days, start on time with us. So we’re day one of whatever section of the challenge, the spiritual challenge or the physical awareness challenge. Start with us on day one. Okay, now as you go, There’s a lot of things I’ve seen over the years where, you know, we’re going through programs, there’s many hurdles that can get in the way of you succeeding. So let’s just address those now so you know what to do. You can always come back to this page and read them and you know what to do if you hit one of these. So the first one is that you can’t find the time, right? That’s the number one thing that people hit right away. So this is 10 to 15 minutes a day. This is going to save you time. Everybody… that meditates know that if you focus for 10 to 15 minutes in the morning, your day is way more productive. So I encourage you to do this in the morning right away. Just make it your first thing, get it out of the way, and then all day you’ll have this awareness percolating. It’ll save you time. Second one is a low motivation. If you feel like you’re getting bored or you’re not motivated, you’re probably focused on the information. You’re probably wanting to have entertainment for your brain rather than actual learning. And this is common. A lot of times we want to just pretend we’re learning. We don’t actually want to learn. I’m a little guilty at times. And so if you notice that, just say, okay, how can I apply this to my life? Like focus on the applications. These techniques I learned, how can I use them today in my life to do something? Then all of a sudden, boom, your motivation is there because it’s applied to you. Now the opposite can happen to this is number three, is that you can get kind of this hyper motivation, which can cause stress. I see this with students where, you know, I’m telling you, just listen to one time, make it really easy to get through the program. But they can’t do that. They have to listen to like three times or four times or five times and repeat everything over and over and over. You can do that, but it’s not necessary. I recommend not doing that. Just listen to one time a day. It’s kind of like overtraining. You don’t want to overtrain. You want to take it easy. Okay, number four is that it’s likely throughout the program at some point you’ll hit some resistance. right? I call this a growth period where you’re really growing and some of the stuff that’s, you know, you’re a little afraid to let go of a little afraid to grow is getting loose and rattling and it’s coming, you know, coming out. You’re actually getting the biggest benefit of the program, which is why you hit the resistance. And at that point, you’ll notice your mind is making up all kinds of excuses. It’s too easy. It’s too hard. It’s too fast. It’s too slow. Your mind will be throwing out all kinds of reasons why you shouldn’t attend. When that happens, just remember, this is the strongest time for me. This is when I need to be in the program. I’m going to get the biggest benefit if I show up in that time of resistance. And just remember that and then show up that day. Wait until the end of the program when 60 days are done. Then you can decide, was it too fast, too slow, and so on. By the time you make it there, you’re going to be feeling really, really good. Okay, now a couple of things along the way with the exercises. This is number five, is people often hit what I call… visualization insecurity syndrome, which is just a funny way of saying you think you can’t see things and you think you can’t meditate. Now, I was just in a fun class with Emily Fletcher in Greece at A -Fest and she was talking about this. It was actually pretty funny because she said, just right now, everybody try to not think about a pink elephant. Okay, just don’t think about pink elephants. And then, of course, as she says that, and as I’m saying it now, you think about a pink elephant. You can’t help it. So you can visualize, right? You just did. But if you’re making it too hard, sometimes that’ll get in the way. So if that comes up, just kind of laugh it off and keep going. You just need to relax a little bit. Number six, sleepitation is really big in my seminars too. This means you’re meditating and you just fall asleep, right? This is okay. What’s happening there is we’re working on your awareness. intentionally pushing your awareness into places where you’re unconscious so that unconscious energy can move and you can level up your awareness as that happens sometimes you’ll fall asleep and the unconsciousness will overwhelm you it’s okay it’s just moving out so don’t judge yourself if that happens just when you wake up just kind of like rejoin with whatever i’m saying it’s totally okay now a second part of that this is actually um number seven is that sometimes you’ll find yourself in a meditation taking a little joy ride And what I mean by that is… I started you on this journey, and then you kind of went somewhere else and did your own thing in the meditation. And then at some point you notice, oh, Jeffrey’s talking, and then you kind of come back to the meditation. And what I want to say about that is that’s totally okay too. So what’s happening with the joyride is that I brought your awareness into a particular area, then you found some of your information you got excited about, and you dove into that information and explored it. And then when you had it, you just came back. That’s perfect. I want you to go explore your information. It’s probably more powerful than my information for you, right? So if you take a little joyride, don’t feel bad. Just come back. When you’re focused on me again, then listen to me. No problem. Okay, number eight is perfect pictures. Sometimes we want to do it just perfect, and if we don’t, we think, oh, I’m not succeeding, I’m not getting a value, or like, I’m a loser, you know, whatever your story is. Don’t worry about that because for this program, to do it perfectly means that you show it up, right? So did you show up for 10 to 15 minutes a day and listen to the thing or watch the thing on the video? And then did you try to practice through the day? That’s it. That’s perfect. So just attendance, right? Just show up and do it. And even there, I gave you a little wiggle room, right? You know, if you miss a day here and there, it’s okay. So number nine is the getting behind excuse. And so this is, you know, for me, If I get behind in a program, if I miss a day or I miss a week, it’s very hard to continue because I feel like I’m behind. I don’t want to be behind. So I just never show up again. You know, you might be guilty of this too, right? So that’s why I built on -ramps into this program so that every 10 days you’ve got that built -in on -ramp. And you’ll hear it. I’ll be saying, we’re on day one of your spiritual awareness training. We’re on day one of your emotional awareness training. And when you hit that day one again, no matter where you are, you are instantly caught up. boom, show up on day one with everybody and listen, and you’re caught up. So there’s no way to fail here. You know, there’s on -ramps built in to get back into the program. So use those. All right, number 10, the last one, the last hurdle that often hits you in a program like this is just your own assumptions. So the idea that you already know about X, Y, and Z, and because you know about it, it’s hard to learn or it’s hard to do something a little different. the way I might be doing it. If this happens, one, validate yourself. You do know a lot of information, and it’s fantastic. And I’m so excited to work with people that have information and are pretty far along on their spiritual journey. But in this program, don’t let your mind try to get everything confused right away. Don’t try to reconcile what you know before and what you’re learning now. Just temporarily put that aside and learn the new stuff, and then you can start to integrate it. right? But if you’re listening to the old information, if you think you really know it, it’ll be hard to get the new information in. So I just want you to have that open mind at the beginning and then integrate later. So that’s the 10, the 10 big things that are in the way. And we’ll, we’ll list them here on this page. So you can come back and read it if you get stuck on one of those. All right. So let’s go ahead and do just a little bit more to help you really honor your commitment to be in the program and to make it through. And to do this, I want you to first think about why do you want to be in this program? What are you wanting to get? In the next 60 days, what would you like to happen? At the end of 60 days, where are you? What’s different? And what did you accomplish through the program? And just… hold on to that because this is important. This is your motivation. You’ve got to have a reason to do it. It’s not just entertainment. This is a training program. You’re getting fit. You’re working out. It’s not necessarily the most natural thing to do. Okay, good. Now just close your eyes. I’m going to do just a one -minute meditation to help anchor that in. And with your eyes closed, really validate your commitment. You already started the journey. You are here right now. You got in the program. So congratulate yourself and honor that commitment. And now say to yourself, I’m willing to invest 10 to 15 minutes each day for the next 60 days to make an incredible impact on my spiritual fitness. It doesn’t have to be word for word. Just, I’m willing to invest 10 to 15 minutes every day to help my spiritual awareness. Okay, just say that to yourself. Okay, good. Now, I’m committed to do my best to show up. I’m committed to do my best to show up every day. And finally, if I fall behind, I will start again on day 11, day 21, day 31. If I fall behind, I’m committed to start again. All right. And then just one more. I’m committed right now. I’m 100 % in for me. Okay, great. Now open your eyes. So very simple, just anchoring that in and thank you for your commitment. I’m a hundred percent in too. I’m just so excited about taking you all the way to the end of this journey. You’re going to have amazing results if we do this together. So you’re not in it alone. I’m in it with you. The group is in it with you. And if you want to share, What is that one thing that you want to get out of the program? What do you want to accomplish in the next 60 days? Share that with the group. It’s a really fun way to get to know each other. So thanks so much for today. I will see you on day one. I’m so excited about the program and I’m ready to take you there. Thank you.

Intro 2: How is Unlocking Transcendence different from Duality?
--------------------

Hi everybody, it’s Jeffrey and thank you so much for joining me for Unlocking Transcendence. I know you’re going to have such a great time learning about yourself and developing your higher awareness. Now, if you’re coming from the Duality program, you’ll notice there’s quite a few differences. In Duality, I really spend time going through all the descriptions and diagrams and background and models and information that you need to really get grounded in your mind so that you can experience the energy work that we’re doing in duality. And this is kind of fun because when you first start on your personal growth path or when you get into something new like energy work, your mind needs to have a lot of information so that it can relax and know that, okay, the things I’m learning make sense to me and I’m not just going off into the weeds, you know, into la -la land. And That’s why in duality, I spend a lot of time giving you that foundation for your mind. Now, by the time you’ve come to unlocking transcendence, you’re probably in a different space. And that’s why the program looks very different. So it’s natural in your personal growth to get to a space where you’re no longer really looking for information from the outside. So you’re not dependent on a teacher to tell you what to learn or you’re not dependent on books to tell you what to think. You’re actually starting to base your belief system on your own personal experiences, right? And so in Unlocking Transcendence, I lean into that part of your personal growth. So I’m not giving you a lot of background information. I’m not giving you diagrams. Basically what I’m giving you is 60 days of new experiences so that you can find your own answers. And this is really fun. The format is different as well. You’ll notice in Duality, there’s a video every day. In Unlocking Transcendence, I wanted to break this habit of depending on me, of looking for the information that you need from your teacher and getting it in the video. So you only have videos on the days where I’m giving you information, kind of at the beginning and in the integration parts of the program. The other parts, we skip that. We go directly to an audio meditation. So right away, you can go within and start to find your own answers. So that’s why we do video some days and audio the others is to break this habit of external dependency. Now, the other thing that’s really fun in Unlocking Transcendence is at the end of each day, there is a question of the day that I recommend you answer. Now, you can answer it privately for yourself if you want. And of course, it’s great if you can share it with a group. That’s fun too. But the purpose of this question is not to seek validation from the outside. What are people going to think about it? Or I got a lot of likes or comments or so on, right? So in this program, we’re turning within. The purpose of sharing is to consolidate the experience that you just had in your inner world and bring it into words. As you bring it into words, your mind will start to organize it and plug it into your belief system better. So that’s the purpose of of sharing, of answering that question of the day. Now, it’s kind of fun. The first time that we brought students through Unlocking Transcendence, I set aside my teaching hat, put on the student hat again, and I took the entire course with you for the first round. And this was really fun for me because I got to shift gears and go through as a student, do the exercises, and answer the question of the day. And so I recommend after you answer it for yourself, check out my answers for each question of the day. What you’ll find is my insights that I had each day going through, which goes a little bit deeper into each day’s teaching or each day’s investigation within. And you’ll also find out how somebody that has a fairly mature energy experience addresses questions and doubts and difficulties because things come up for me throughout the program too. So it’s kind of a nice little peek behind the scenes or, you know, kind of looking behind the curtain to see what’s really happening or the director’s cut, if you will. And I encourage you to check out that information too. You’ll find it at the bottom of the lesson. There’ll be information on how to get to each of those. So I’m really excited about this new journey for you as you start to turn within. And also when you’re posting information, you might notice that the Unlocking Transcendence group isn’t quite as interactive as the Duality group was. And that’s okay, right? Because the purpose is not the interaction with others. The purpose is self -discovery for Unlocking Transcendence. So just keep that in mind. Let’s see. The last thing I would say is the organization for Unlocking Transcendence makes it really easy. So you can’t get lost. You can’t get behind. There’s really no way to fail at this program because it’s all about your experience, your authentic experience. And I’ve organized it into six… Short quests. So there’s six 10 -day mini quests. They follow the progression that you normally go through as your awareness opens. So there’s self -awareness first, then physical awareness, mental awareness, spiritual awareness, emotional awareness, and finally impact awareness. So we go through each of those as a 10 -day quest. If you want to just do a 10 -day section at a time, that’s fantastic. But I encourage you to get to that 10 -day point before you take a break because then you’ll have that sort of completed the loop of information and experience. with that particular section. And if you want to take a few days off, check something else out, come back to it later, that’s totally fine. Again, it’s really six independent quests, although they do follow an arc or a flow throughout the whole program. Before I go, I also want to mention that the video quality is quite different between these two programs. Duality was actually shot first before unlocking Transcendence. However, it was originally shot as a live webinar series. So it was shot on web cameras and the quality was really low. So we’ve recently updated Duality with all new video and updated the content so it looks fantastic and bright and shiny and new. Unlocking Transcendence now looks a little dated by comparison because when I shot that, I filmed it myself in the place that I had rented in Sedona where I was kind of secluding myself for six weeks to really set the energy and get things just right energetically for the program. So please forgive me if the video is not quite as high quality as what you’ll see in Duality. I know you’re going to love the program anyway and really enjoy that feeling and that energy of Sedona that comes through so well in the videos. Thanks again. See you in the program.

Part 1: Self-Awareness (Location & Time)

========================================

LESSON 1: Finding Your Awareness
--------------------
Hi everybody; I'm Jeffrey Allen, and welcome to the program. I'm so glad you're here because I've got a really powerful and exciting program designed for you. And, I know that if you're here you're a spiritual seeker like me which means that you are looking for new experiences and new awareness and wanting to, you know, integrate this into your life, and really live a more fun and more spiritual life. Now, I've been teaching intuition and energy work and spiritual studies for a little over 10 years, and during that time I've taught small groups and big classes and online training. And I've taught small workshops like hour-workshops, and I've taught multiyear training programs, and it's been really fun. What's happened over that time is that, because I've been teaching and practicing, my awareness has gotten very good. It's easy for me to pick up a new awareness skill and integrate it into my daily life, and that's exactly what I want to give you in the 60 days. I want to give you that same sense that you can pick up new information easily and apply it right away in your life because I know that it's not always like that. For me, although I can do it now, it used to be very difficult. I remember when I was learning to talk to spirit guides, and I really wanted to talk to them, and I was trying everything I knew how, but for some reason it just wasn't coming; it was just out of reach. I experienced the same thing with intuition where I was trying to use my intuition to see what was happening in my environment, or, you know, apply it to my relationships, and so on. But, it just seemed just out of reach. Sometimes it worked great, sometimes it didn't work, and it was very frustrating. I'm sure you've had that same experience. And, I've seen that with my students too where some people can get the information right away, some people are excited and want it, but somehow they're not able to get the information and get the same experience. So, what I've done is looked at how can I change that. So, I listened to my students, and I watched their energy over the years, and what I noticed is that there's a base level of awareness that you need to have in several different areas for you to pick up spiritual training easily. And, I call this spiritual fitness because I think of it like, just like with physical fitness, if you wanted to run a marathon but you didn't have a certain level of fitness, you might buy some new shoes, get really excited about it, and show up on race day. Then, the gun goes off, and you start running your heart out, but you know, you're not going to make it 'cause you don't have that base level of fitness. Now, somebody else that's never run a marathon before but has a level of physical fitness, maybe they're a dancer or maybe they're a football player, but they've got this really good base level of physical fitness, they can run that marathon even the first time. It may be hard, it may be a challenge, but they can do it. And, the same thing is true in other areas of your life. If you've got your business fitness up, you can do well in business more easily. If you've got your love or relationship fitness up, you can do well in love and relationships. And, if you have your spiritual fitness up, you can do well easily in spiritual studies and spiritual growth. Now, when I talk about spiritual fitness, you actually need to be pretty flexible with your awareness to get this level of fitness up. So, there's four main types of awareness that we usually talk about. There's the body awareness, there is a mind awareness, there's emotional awareness, and then there's spiritual awareness. Those are kind of the main four categories, and each of has a different feeling to it. It has a different need and different experiences that you have in each of those. There's also, you know, before all of those, there's a basic level of just self-awareness. When you think, who am I? What happens to you? What do you, what answer do you get? And so, we're going to work on that first, self-awareness. Then, we're going to do each of these four big ones. We're going to do body awareness and spirit awareness and mind awareness and emotional awareness, not in that order. And then, we're going to do the final one which is impact awareness, which is how are you influencing other people in the world? Because it's not just about us, it's about what we're doing in the world too. Now, today we're going to start with this self-awareness, and this is really important because if you don't have a good sense of self-awareness, it can feel a little bit like you're kind of, life is happening to you, rather than feeling like you're consciously living your life and creating the things that you want. So, if you have that feeling sometimes, that life's happening to you, and I've had this too, it doesn't feel very good. Then this is what we'll start to shift in this first 10 days where we're studying self-awareness. Now, when you think about self-awareness, there's some basic questions that usually come to mind. You can ask yourself, who am I? Who, what, where, why, when, and how; those are the basic questions. And, I'm curious, for you, what do you think of those questions would be the most powerful one for developing your self-awareness? Just think about it for a minute to get it. Who, like, who am I? What am I? Where am I? When am I? How am I? Why am I here? So, what I've found over the years is that, it might kind of surprise you, but the two most powerful questions to answer to develop your self-awareness are actually, where am I? And, when am I? And, over the next 10 days, you'll understand more deeply why I say that's true. So, today we're starting with this first awareness. I just want to give you kind of a baseline understanding of, you know, who you are from the context of where. So, right now I want you to just ask yourself that question. "Where am I right now?" So, "Where am I right now?" Good, now close your eyes, and ask yourself that again. "Where am I right now?" And open your eyes again. And notice if it changed when you closed your eyes; did your awareness shift in some way? So, just right now, close your eyes, and then open your eyes. Now, sometimes people will blink a little bit as they open their eyes. What's happening there is we're kind of trained to close our eyes and then leave our body and go somewhere else. So, if your awareness got kind of weird or spaced out when you closed your eyes, that's why. Now, I want to give you a little trick that can help you get through that. So, what I want you to do now is just find a place, somewhere where your eyes rest naturally, not on the video, but somewhere in your room, and just put your eyes there, and notice your breath. And, as you're breathing, you're going to imagine you're pulling back all your awareness into this space right behind your eyes. So, just breathe, focus on that point across the room. And then, very gently on your next breath, you're going to breathe your eyes closed very slowly and see if you can maintain that same awareness right behind your eyes. Okay, good. Now, just breathe your eyes back open, and try it again. Be very focused right behind your eyes. Focus on that point. And, just breathe your eyes closed. Very good. Now, from this awareness, I want you to ask, "Where am I?" And, I want you to say out loud, "I am here." "I am here." "I am here." And, where is that here for you? Every answer's okay; just notice. Once again, just say, "I am here." And, notice any other qualities of your awareness. Is there a size that you have? Are you fuzzy? Are you clear? Are you spacey? Or, do you have a crisp awareness? Just notice; we're just having fun. Okay, so be focused behind your eyes again. And, when you're ready, just breathe your eyes open. Great, so welcome back. Now, this was a really simple exercise designed to give you that self-awareness, that kind of self-assessment of where are you naturally? We also worked on breaking one of your habits which may have been to kind of go somewhere when you close your eyes and, you know, change your focus. We're going to continue throughout the program helping you develop the habit of having that meditation awareness with your eyes open or with your eyes closed. Now, I'll share with you kind of my secret strategy here. So, there are six different steps that I take to bring your awareness from the beginning up until this base level of fitness. The first step you just did which is self assessment and breaking any old habits or establishing new habits. The second thing we'll do tomorrow which is getting an easy success. So tomorrow, you're going to actually work with your awareness inside your body, and you're going to stretch your awareness around to different places in the body. And, this will give you just an easy feeling of success, like you're doing it. The next step is to challenge you to do something a little bit more difficult, that maybe you're uncomfortable with, or you're not sure you can do, and we're going to do that the next day. So, you're going to actually move your awareness to different places inside your body, kind of like traveling around inside the body. Now, the fourth step in this strategy to do something you didn't know you could do, or something you thought wasn't even possible. So, on day four, what we're going to do is you're going to actually travel with your awareness out of your body to different places, and get an interesting experience, and then come back into your body, and this is totally safe. You know, I've done this many times; there's no problem at all. You actually leave your body every night when you sleep, so this is quite normal. And then, the fifth step, again so we did your awareness, self-assessment, and then we do you know, habits, that's step one, then we do easy success, we do a little challenge, we do kind of a wow thing where you're doing something you didn't know was possible, and then that's all the activation part. That's all what I can help you with; your base level of fitness is actually up at that point. To carry it forward, you have to practice. It's just up to you to continue your practice. Now, today, what you can do is just notice throughout the day, where are you? So, try it in different situations. Just ask yourself that question, "Where am I?" Sometime when you're feeling really happy, "Where am I?" Sometime when you're kind of frustrated and angry, "Where am I?" Or, maybe you're just feeling stuck or stressed; just ask, "Where am I?" And, notice that there's a different answer each time. This, again, is just getting your base awareness up. It's the first step in that journey to spiritual fitness. Now, the sixth step is actually sharing. So, when you share the information that you have, you share your experience, whether this is through teaching or just sharing it with other people, you integrate that information in a way that you can utilize it more easily later. And so, throughout this training, every day, there'll be an opportunity to share your experience. So, I'd like you to do that right now; just share your experience. Where are you? How did that feel for you? And, I look forward to seeing you tomorrow, and thank you so much.

LESSON 2: Stretching Your Awareness
--------------------
--------------------
Meditation: Day 2 - Stretching Your Awareness
--------------------

Hello everyone, I’m Jeffrey Allen, and welcome back to Day 2. Today you’ll be practicing focusing your awareness and stretching your awareness into different places in your body. This is important because your awareness of self is the foundation for all the exercises in this program. We’ll be starting out easy today so you can feel the results right away, and we’ll get into more advanced practice over the next few days. So let’s dive in. To begin today, I’d like you to find a place across the room where your eyes rest naturally, and focus on that point. Let your awareness be right behind your eyes, and focus on that point. Give yourself a deep breath, inhale, and exhale, maintaining your focus on this point. On your next inhale, gently close your eyes, keeping that same awareness, that same presence, behind your eyes. And ask yourself right now, where are you? Are you right behind your eyes, like in your eyelids? Are you back between your ears? Are you in the back of your head? Find your way right now to the center of your head, straight behind your eyes and right between your ears. Let your awareness be nice and focused in the center of your head. And then, without moving, I want you to notice your left ear and stretch your awareness from the center of your head. over to this ear and let your awareness return and relax to the center of your head. Again, without moving, notice your right ear and stretch your awareness from the center of your head to your right ear and relax and let it return to the center of your head. Now stretch your awareness up to the top of your head. Again, you’re stretching rather than moving and relax your awareness. into the center of your head. Now stretch your awareness down toward the top of your throat, relax to the center of your head, and stretch your awareness forward right into your eyes, and then relax to the center of your head. Stretch your awareness back to the back of your head, and then relax into the center of your head. As you did this exercise, were you able to maintain your location in the center of your head? Or did you move your awareness into the places that you were going to? For today, I want you to practice staying in the center of your head and just stretching your energy from the center of your head down to these other places. Good. Now, staying in the center of your head, stretch your awareness down toward your left shoulder and let it relax back to the center of your head. And stretch your awareness down to your right shoulder and let it relax to the center of your head. Now stretch your awareness past the left shoulder, down to the left elbow, all the way out to your left hand. Maintaining your awareness in the center of your head, stretching all the way to that left hand. And just relax. Be in the center of your head and stretch your awareness down the right shoulder. down the right arm, past the elbow, all the way into that right hand. Notice how that feels. And let your awareness come all the way back, relaxed to the center of the head. And now try both sides at once, stretching down to the shoulders, into both elbows, into both hands, and then relaxing to the center of your head. Now let’s try the next part with your eyes open. Be in the center of your head. And stretch your awareness down to your left hip, to your left knee, and into your left foot. Stretch your awareness outward to fill your entire leg, your calf and your thigh in the back. And then relax your awareness to the center of your head. Now stretch your awareness down to your right hip, your right knee, and your right foot. Remembering to stay in the center of your head. And stretch your awareness outward to fill your entire leg, your calf, your thighs, back of your leg. Notice how that feels. And then relax to the center of your head. And notice which was easier for you, working with your eyes open or with your eyes closed. And remember, it’s always okay to do whichever is more comfortable for you. So with your eyes open or closed, stretch your awareness. into your heart. Stay in the center of your head, but continue stretching your awareness into your chest, into your stomach, into your low back and your mid -back. Your upper back. Stay in the center of your head, but stretch your awareness to all points in your body at once. Notice how that feels. Notice if you’re missing any places. And then relax your awareness back to the center of your head. Have your eyes closed. Give yourself a deep breath. Let go of any effort, any bogginess or sleepiness. Smile and be amused. And when you’re ready, open your eyes. Welcome back. I hope you enjoyed your first awareness stretch. How was it for you? How did it feel? Did you like it better with your eyes open or your eyes closed? Did you find you could stretch into multiple places at once? And were you able to maintain that awareness behind your eyes in the center of your head? Or did you tend to move to the places that you were stretching to? So I’m excited to hear your answers to all those questions. So great job today. I’d like you to practice stretching your awareness today, and I’ve got three ideas that you can try on your own. First, anytime you’re stretching physically, follow up by stretching your awareness into the same areas, and just notice how much deeper your stretch feels. You can also try stretching your awareness into your hand before you’re touching somebody today, and notice how different that feels. I’d also invite you to stretch your awareness into your feet and your legs while you’re walking, and notice how much more present you are. Again, today we’re practicing staying in the center of your head, but stretching your awareness to other places in the body. So I hope that was fun, and before you go, please take one minute to share your experience in today’s exercise. This will really help you integrate the experience and get more value from the training. I look forward to reading your responses. Have fun today, and I’ll see you tomorrow.

LESSON 3: Moving Your Awareness

--------------------
Meditation: Day 3 - Moving your Awareness
--------------------

Hello everyone, I’m Jeffrey Allen and welcome to day three. We’re just getting going and you might be wondering what are these crazy exercises or how can this help me? You might even find yourself in doubt or getting lost or even falling asleep during the exercises. And I want to reassure you that this is perfectly okay. It’s actually quite normal when you’re stretching your awareness to fall asleep, get lost, or even have unexpected emotions arise. If this happens, just stay amused and keep going. It honestly doesn’t matter if you do each day’s exercises perfectly. It only matters that you try because that trying is where you’re doing the work. Remember that marathon training. It’s not important to have perfect running form right away. It will develop naturally if you practice. The same thing is happening here. You’ll get many chances to try each exercise, so don’t worry about doing it perfectly right away. Just stay amused, have fun, and don’t get stuck in effort or perfection. You’re doing great. Today, you’ll be deepening your experience of spatial awareness. You’ll learn the difference between stretching your awareness and moving your awareness. These are the beginning steps of sensing yourself independently from your physical body. You’ll need this awareness for everything we do moving forward. So let’s dive in. So relax, give yourself a deep breath, and find a point across the room with your eyes. Be right behind your eyes and focus on that point. On your next breath, gently breathe your eyes closed, maintaining that same awareness behind your eyes. Now move your awareness to the center of your head, behind your eyes and between your ears. Feel yourself firmly centered in your head. And without moving, briefly stretch your awareness to the points around you. Stretch to your left ear and your right ear, the top of your head, the bottom of your head. Stretch to the front. Stretch to the back. And come back to the center. From the center of your head, say hello to your left ear. Hello. Now imagine you are walking your awareness to the left. Move your awareness away from the center of your head toward your left ear. Feel yourself in your left ear. And look back toward the center of your head. Then walk your awareness. from that left ear back into the center of your head. Say hello to your right ear. Hello. And this time, simply slide your awareness to the right from the center of your head, sliding over into that right ear. Pause for a moment and look back toward the center of your head. Then slide your awareness back to the center of your head. Breathe. This may feel strange, but you’re doing great. As you move, notice the difference between stretching your awareness and moving your awareness. Depending on your perspective, it might feel like your awareness is moving around in your body, or it may feel like your body is moving around your awareness. Just do whichever one works for you. Say hello to the top of your head. Hello. Now walk or slide your awareness. from the center of your head to the top of your head. Pause for a moment, then walk or slide your awareness back to the center. Say hello to the bottom of your head, where it rests on your neck. Hello. Now walk or slide your awareness from the center of your head to the bottom of your head. Pause, then walk or slide your awareness back to the center of your head. Say hello to the front of your head. Hello. Walk or slide your awareness into the front of your head, into your face. And now gently walk or slide your awareness to the center of your head. Say hello to the back of your head. Hello. And slide or walk your awareness back to the back of your head. Move your awareness back to the center of your head. And take a deep breath and let yourself be firmly centered in your head again. Very good. Let’s see if you can get a little further. Say hello to your left hand. Hello. Move your awareness down your neck, over to your left shoulder, down your left arm, all the way down and into your hand. Feel your awareness inside your hand. Notice that your head is quite far away. Then say hello to the center of your head. Move your awareness up your arm, into your shoulder, to your neck, and into the center of your head. Say hello to your right hand. Hello. Move your awareness down to your neck. Slide or walk over to that right shoulder. Down your right arm. All the way down to that right hand. Feel yourself inside your hand. Again, notice distance from your head. And then let yourself move back up the arm. Back into the shoulder. Into the neck. And into the center of your head. Okay. good. So you’re getting good at moving your awareness. Let’s try something a little different. Breathe and be really present in the center of your head. Say hello again to your right hand. Without walking or sliding there, simply remember being in your right hand and instantly be in your right hand again. Now remember being in your left hand and instantly Be in your left hand again. Remember being in the center of your head and instantly be in the center of your head once again. Great. Now breathe. And notice that your awareness does not have to travel linearly through the body. Your awareness can move instantly from one place to another. Let’s try it a little faster. I’ll name a place and you move your awareness there. Try to keep up, but don’t get frustrated. I’m pushing you a little bit on purpose, so just stay amused and have fun. Are you ready? Okay. Be in the center of your head. In your left ear. Your right ear. Your left hand. Your right hand. Center of your head. Your left foot. Ooh, that’s hard. I haven’t been there before. Your right foot. And center of your head. Be in the front of your head, back of your head, base of your skull, and the top of your head. Be above your body, looking down at your head. Hold it there just a moment. Be in the top of your head and be in the center of your head. Great job. Even if you got a little lost, you’re doing great. Relax and take a deep breath. Be very present behind your eyes. And when you’re ready, open your eyes. Welcome back. I hope you had fun. You’ve graduated from awareness stretching to awareness calisthenics. Remember, if it was easy, that’s great. If it was difficult or scary, that’s great. You don’t have to master each step. Just keep following the path and we’ll get there. Feel free to practice this during the day with your eyes closed or your eyes open. I used to do this when I was sitting in meetings at work and I was bored and this always cheered me up. Also, Please take a minute to share your experience. Putting it into words helps you process your experience and integrate it more deeply. If something was scary or uncomfortable, please mention that too. Have fun today, and I’ll see you tomorrow.

========================================

LESSON 4: Travelling With Your Awareness

--------------------
Meditation: Day 4 - Traveling with your Awarenes
--------------------

Hello everyone, I’m Jeffrey Allen and welcome to day four. By now you’re noticing that although we’re doing serious spiritual work, I don’t want you to take it too seriously. When we get serious, worried, or afraid, our energy tends to slow down and get more rigid. And when we’re having fun, our energy tends to speed up and get more flexible. So having fun and being amused is the perfect state for upgrading your awareness. Today is no exception. We’re going to take a journey with your awareness today, a journey outside your body and into the stars. This is not serious business, and I definitely want you to have fun with it. If you get confused or lost or afraid, it’s always okay to open your eyes and come instantly back into your body. Or just focus on your breath with your eyes closed until you’re ready and then resume the journey with us. There is absolutely no danger of you getting stuck out of your body. In fact, you leave your body every night when you sleep, and you come back automatically when you wake up. This is quite normal, but we rarely practice it intentionally. So smile and be amused and enjoy today’s journey. As you breathe, find your awareness behind your eyes. Be relaxed, focused, and present. And gently breathe your eyes closed. Move your awareness into the center of your head and say hello to your body. Let your body know that you’ll be back in a few minutes. Just smile and be amused. From the center of your head, take a quick stretch to your left ear, to your right ear, to the front and the back of your head. Stretch down and stretch up. And now move your awareness to each of those places. Slide to your left ear. Slide to your right ear. Slide to the front and to the back. And slide down. And then return to the center of your head. From the center of your head, say hello to the top of your head, and instantly be on top of your head. Be above your head, looking down at your own head, and then be in the center of your head. Say hello to one corner of the room, up above and in front and to your right. Be in that corner of the room. Now be outside, up above your body in any buildings, and be high in the sky where you can see the curvature of the earth. Breathe in this amazing beauty of the planet. Now be on the moon, looking back at the earth, and notice how peaceful the earth looks from here. Pause a moment, enjoy that view, and notice a light on the earth where your body is right now. Now let your awareness move to the edge of our solar system. Looking back toward the sun, let yourself hear the solar wind. Notice the earth, your home, far away. And notice how you feel right here. Move one step further to the edge of the universe. And what do you notice here? Just pause and enjoy this vast perspective. As you peer into the universe, notice our own sun. Say hello to the sun and be at the edge of the solar system. Again, let yourself hear that solar wind. Say hello to the moon and then be on the moon. Enjoy this peaceful space looking down at the earth and imagine your favorite place to be on the planet. Say hello to that place. And let yourself be in that place right now. Notice the sights, the sounds, smells. Breathe in this energy of your favorite place. Now be in the sky up above your body. Be in the corner of the room looking… at yourself. Say hello to the center of your head. Be in the center of your head. Give yourself a deep breath and remember all the places we visited and know that these places are just a moment away. Stretch your arms and your legs and then stretch your awareness into your hands and your feet. Stretch your awareness into your entire body. Breathe and open your eyes. Great job, everyone. Did you make it back? I knew you would. Hopefully that felt very real to you, at least in one of those places that we went to. If you fell asleep or you went unconscious some point during the journey, don’t worry about it. Again, that’s completely normal. If you’re feeling spacey right now, just take a moment to stretch and flex your hands and your feet. Pat your tummy or pat your chest. And just say out loud, I am here. I am here. I am here. Feel free to practice this again anytime on your own, with or without me as your guide. It’s a fantastic way to get away from stress and return feeling refreshed and at ease. The more you practice, you’ll notice it gets easier and easier and more real to be in these places out of your body. I’m really excited to hear about your journey. Please take a minute to share what you felt at the edge of the universe, or where you went when you returned to the Earth, or whatever your experience was for you. Have a great day, everyone, and I will see you tomorrow.

LESSON 5: Location Applications & Time Awareness Intro

--------------------
Hi, everyone; welcome back. I'm Jeffrey Allen, and you've made it to day five. And this is really exciting because this means that you've already activated that base level of spiritual fitness with your spatial awareness. Remember I said there were six steps that we go through. So first day, you did this self-assessment, and we started to change your habit of closing your eyes and opening your eyes and staying present. Second day, we went through a easy success where you were able to stretch your awareness to different places in your body. And the third day, we did the Challenge Day where you're able to move your awareness around to different places in your body. Now, day four, yesterday, we did the Wow Day which was to travel out of the body with your awareness and find out what that's like for you. Now, these first four steps are what it takes to activate your awareness. Now, the interesting thing about this is that you don't have to do it perfectly. So listening to it, going through the process, is enough to activate it even if you were falling asleep, even if you feel like you couldn't do it, even if you felt like a total failure for these first four days, you already activated that base level awareness. Now to get to the next step, of course, what you have have to do is practice, and we're going to continue to practice in here, but I've also made some notes on what are easy ways that you can practice and start applying this in your daily life because practice shouldn't be difficult. It shouldn't be something you have to sit down and schedule 20 minutes to do twice a day or three times a day. It should just be something that you can do all the time in your daily life because you're excited about it and you're having fun. And so I want to give you a couple of tips on how to practice your awareness in that way. Okay, so for the easy applications are just if you're not feeling present or you're feeling kind of spacey, then try that exercise where you breathe your eyes closed and stay present in the body. This is really good for getting your attention and awareness back to where it feels good. You can also work with that center of head space that we did on day two where if you're needing to be productive and focused, let your awareness be right in the center of your head. You'll notice that your productivity and your focus go way up. Now, you can use this awareness stretching that we did to really get into your body when you're waking up. I teach this to kids. I say that when you wake up, just kind of imagine you're stretching down into your body, almost like you were stretching into a sleeping bag and getting your feet all the way in and your hands all the way in. So if you're the kind of person that has a hard time waking up, try this stretching exercise with your awareness to really get into the body there. You can also use the stretching if there's some place where you have weakness or pain in the body. You can stretch your awareness into that area. And oftentimes, that's enough to kind of pop out of that stress that you're in. Now, you can also move your awareness to that place in the body and listen or have a conversation. And sometimes, this is a great way to self-diagnose or get more information about what's happening in the body. We'll actually do that in the next section when we're going into your body awareness, but you can practice it now on your own if you like. Now, if you're feeling stressed, you can also use this traveling out-of-body experience to have a little mini kind of spiritual vacation. You can go to the moon or up to the solar system or up to the edge of the universe. You can also just go to a place in your awareness that feels really peaceful and relaxing for you. You'll be surprised how much difference you can make just to get out and take a little spiritual vacation. Now, you can also use this traveling out of body if you're needing to get some more perspective. If you're feeling stuck on a particular issue, just think of the question that you're trying to solve, and then go inside, get a little bit out of your body like the corner of the room, and ask yourself the question, and then go up to the the moon and ask yourself the same question. Then, go out to the edge of the solar system and ask yourself that same question. Out to the edge of the universe; ask yourself that question. And you'll notice that you have different perspective at each of those levels. And oftentimes, this is enough to help you get through feeling like you're stuck on a particular issue. So even though these seem like really kind of funny or abstract tools, there's very specific uses that you can use in your daily life and apply these right away. Okay, so if you're wanting to do a little more advanced practice, you can start to imagine that you're stretching your awareness outside of your body, so out into your aura and so on. You can also work with your awareness to visit places you haven't been before. Maybe take a vacation to place that you want to go but you haven't been before. So that's another little stretch and you can also try out different sizes with your awareness. When you're traveling to the moon, let yourself be as big as the earth to the moon. Let yourself be as big as the whole solar system or as big as the entire universe. This is really fun to play with your awareness in this level, again, a little bit more advanced. Now, if you want to go into, you know, very advanced practice, what I'd recommend is that you play with multi-awareness. So having your awareness in more than one place at a time, and this is possible. You're doing it already. You probably just don't know you're doing it. My favorite example of this is one time when I was out four-wheeling. I had this four-wheel-drive truck. I'm coming down this trail that I probably shouldn't have been on. And at one point, I had to drive down over this big drop off, and I didn't quite have enough room. So when I did it, my truck was kind of teetering back and forth. I actually hit my front bumper on the ground rather than my tires, and I kind of panicked. I was sitting there; I felt like we were about to roll over because, you know, we were just teetering on this two tires, and I felt this little awareness, and I heard this voice over in the trees that said, "Let off the brake." And I'm used to listening to my guide, so I just let off my brake, the truck righted itself, everything was fine. And later in the day, I thought, I wonder who that was, who was helping me out. So I went into meditation, and I positioned myself on the other side of the road, of the trail, so I could see who it was. I could see myself in the truck all stressed out, panicking. Now I can see somebody appear over here and tell me, "Let off the break." Now the strange part was is that the person that appeared over there was me. It was actually me watching out for myself. And when I got that little surprise and that realization, that more aware me turned and looked directly at me and gave me a little wink. And I was really surprised. It's like, okay, I'm here watching myself, watching myself. And then, of course, I'm also meditating and watching this whole thing. So I'm in at least four different places that I'm aware of and at least two different timeframes, and this was really fun. You'll notice that as you start to play with your awareness, you'll start to have strange and amazing experiences like this too. In fact, they're happening all the time for you, but you're just not aware of it yet. And that's why this program is so important and why I want you to stick through for the whole 60 days, is that if you get your base level of fitness up in these 12 different areas, you'll start to have these experiences automatically, and it's just so fun. The next awareness that I want to help activate for you is your time awareness. And this is really important because if you're out of balance with your time awareness, it can feel pretty difficult. So for example, if you're mostly focused in the past, you can find that you'll feel very depressed, like there's no hope for the future. And sometimes, people even have a very low will to live when the energy is primarily focused in the past. If you're really focused in the future, the opposite can happen. You can feel anxious, like really nervous all the time. You can feel like you're never able to get enough or achieve enough. And if you're focused on the future, sometimes you're also not productive. You have a lot of ideas, but you're not able to make them happen. Now of course, if you're focused in the present, everything's pretty good. You're usually pretty calm. You're pretty happy. You're pretty productive. But I encourage you to develop all three of these. You want to be happy and love being with your present time awareness, with your past awareness, and with your future awareness. There's not a bad one. You just want to have balance and primarily want to be in the present moment because that's where the really powerful stuff happens. So to start developing this, we're going to do the same six steps that I recommend for developing your awareness. And the first step is a little self-assessment and changing your habits. So let's do that right now. Now, go ahead and find that point across the room, and start to breathe, and focus your energy right behind your eyes. And on your next inhale, go ahead and breathe your eyes closed. Good, now move your awareness to the center of your head, and take a little stretch. Just stretch your awareness to the left, stretch it to the right, stretch it to the front, stretch it to the back, and stretch it above and below. And imagine right now that there's a line beneath you that stretches out all the way to infinity on the left and all the way to infinity on the right. And one direction on this line represents the past for you and one represents your future. And your body, of course, is right in the middle in present time. From this place in present, I want you to notice how does the past line and the future line feel to you? Does one feel brighter than the other or darker than the other? Does one feel lighter or heavier than the other? Just notice. Now, focus on present time. Does present time feel light? Does present time feel bright? How does it compare to the past and the future? Now, whichever one of these is brightest for you is usually where your attention is most of the time. That's your primary focus. So just notice, are you primarily a past energy focus, present time energy focus, or future energy focus? And if you want to, I want you to imagine right now that you can balance these out. So all three of them look nice and bright, feel nice and light. Great, now forget about this timeline. Just let it fade away. And with your eyes closed still, I want you to imagine that you're going to get up, and you're just going to turn and start walking. Now, which direction would you go? Would you go to the left, or would you go to the right? Now for you, whichever direction you wanted to go naturally is likely your natural future direction. So if that's the same direction that you saw on your timeline, then your mental timeline and your experience or awareness timeline match. But if they don't, for example, if you wanted to go to the left but your mental timeline says the future is to the right, then I recommend that you flip your timeline over. So you can do, if you need to, just do that now, so that your future timeline points the direction that you wanted to walk. If it was already pointing that way, just relax and congratulate yourself. Your mental timeline and your awareness timeline were in sync. Now, feel that timeline again, stretching out to the left and to the right, and notice which one feels more comfortable for you. Which one feels more familiar to you, the past side, the future side, the middle and the present moment? And give yourself permission to let them all be familiar and all be equally comfortable. Great, now when you're ready, just breathe your eyes open. All right, welcome back. So I don't want you to think too much about this exercise. We're just self-assessing, and we're just changing a habit there. So with every experience, just go with that. This is just step one in this awareness. Now step two, tomorrow, will be your Easy Success Day. You're going to use your awareness to sort of slide around and look at the past and look at the future. This is really fun, and it's your Easy Success Day. The Challenge Day, you're going to move your awareness to different places. So you're going to kind of project yourself into the past and into the future and get a little bit more kind of 3D version of that. It's really fun. The Wow Day, we're going to actually start to modify your timeline. So you're going to look at what timeline you're on, where's your momentum carrying you, and you'll learn how to adjust that and change that. Now, of course, after that, I'll teach you some ways to practice, but I'd like you to practice right away. And what you can do today is start to notice how many future and past thoughts that you're having for today and notice how does this affect your personality? So for example, if you are thinking a lot about how could I have done that better or you're reminiscing a lot about the past, then you're probably focused on the past. If you're the type of personality that forgets things really easily or is always dreaming about the future, then you're probably thinking about the future. If you're one of those lucky people that's just kind of happy and calm and in the present moment, then that's great. Then, you're focused in present time. So just notice today what's happening so you can try to balance those out. And of course, I'd love if you share; that's step six in this recipe for success in your awareness is to share your experience to help that integrate more deeply into your awareness, and also it's just a lot of fun. So thanks so much for today, and I look forward to seeing you tomorrow.

LESSON 6: Time Viewing

--------------------
Meditation: Day 6 - Time Viewing
--------------------

Hello everyone, I’m Jeffrey Allen and welcome to day six. I hope you’re feeling a little more aware of your past and present and future already. And today we’re going to be using that temporal awareness by looking at different times in your life, both past times and future times. And this is your first step in consciously using your time awareness. We’re going to start out easy today and then we’ll build up that awareness over the next few days. So a couple of tips with this meditation and all the meditations that we’re doing. The first is to Just see things visually and remember things and imagine things and know things all at the same time. You don’t want to think. And if you’re impatient, your brain tends to fill in the blanks when you’re working with your intuition or working with your inner screen or your inner voice or your inner mind. And if you wait and just be curious, those blanks will fill themselves in. So you want to just, again, just kind of go along for the ride and let yourself notice what’s happening rather than thinking about it too much. And it’s always okay if you miss something too. Just follow along when you come back. It’s very common to occasionally sort of check out and then check back in during meditations. And that’s okay because what’s happening there is you’re actually going to get your own information about something. And that’s more interesting than what I’m saying. So just when you notice me talking again, come back and just join. Don’t feel bad. That’s actually just fine. In this meditation today, we’re going to be looking at a television and looking at things on the TV. Now, the TV itself is just a prop. It’s not important that you see the TV. If you see it, that’s great. If you don’t see it, that’s great. Don’t worry about the TV. Okay. Now, the last thing is sometimes people say that they’re not good at visualizing. And I just went to a lecture by Emily Fletcher where she addressed it in a really funny way. She said, If I told you right now, don’t think about a pink elephant, then, you know, right now you’re thinking about you’re visualizing a pink elephant. So if you can visualize that pink elephant, then you must be good at visualizing. So don’t worry about that. You’ll do just fine. Great. So let’s begin. Focus on a point across the room where your eyes rest naturally. Be right behind your eyes and notice that point. On your next breath, just breathe your eyes closed, maintaining that same awareness behind your eyes. Now move your awareness back until it’s in the center of your head. And just briefly stretch your awareness out to the left ear. Stretch it out to the right ear. Stretch it to the front of your head, to the back of your head. Stretch up to the top of your head. And stretch down to the bottom of your head. Great. Now be in the center of your head. And in your mind’s eye, imagine you can see a TV out in front of you. And this TV is sitting on a line which is stretching out to the right and the left. One direction representing the past and one representing the future. And imagine right now the TV is tuned to present time and you can see yourself on that TV listening to this meditation right now. Just smile and wave at yourself on TV. Now imagine now that you can slide the TV’s timeline back about five minutes. Just slide it over and let that TV show you yourself five minutes ago. Notice what you were doing as you’re getting ready for this lesson. And notice if you can see it with detail. Imagine you can slide that TV timeline again to one hour ago. See yourself on that TV. And notice what you were doing one hour ago. Very good. Slide that TV timeline to sometime yesterday. Notice where it stops. And see yourself yesterday. What were you doing? Slide that TV timeline again until it’s sometime last week. Let yourself see a scene from last week. What were you doing? What was happening around you? Slide that TV’s timeline again to sometime last month. And as you see yourself one month ago, notice one detail about that moment that you hadn’t noticed before. Slide that TV timeline again to last year. See your face and your hair and your clothes. What do you see yourself doing last year? Now slide that timeline to an important teenage memory. Watch it unfold and view it as if you’re a parent watching your child. What were you thinking at that time? Do you understand it differently now? Slide that timeline again to an important time between the age 7 and 10. See your face, what was happening at that time, and notice some detail that you hadn’t noticed before. Now slide that timeline again until when you were a tiny baby. What did you look like? What were you doing at that time? Smile at your cute little self. Now slide the timeline all the way back to present time. See yourself again listening to this meditation. Now let’s take a peek at the future just for fun. So slide your timeline 10 minutes into the future and see what are you doing after this lesson. Slide that timeline to sometime later today. Notice what’s happening. Slide that timeline to next week. See yourself next week. You look like you’re having fun. Slide that timeline to next year. Notice how you look. See your face and your hair and your clothes. Notice one more detail about yourself that you hadn’t noticed before. Slide that timeline out. five years. See your face again. Smile at that future you. And notice what’s happening for you in five years. Great. Now bring your awareness back to present time. See yourself listening to this meditation. Wave at yourself on TV. And just notice how easy this exercise was. Now let the TV and the timeline disappear. Be in the center of your head. And stretch your awareness to the left ear and the right ear, to the front, to the back, and above and below, and in the center of your head. Give yourself a nice deep breath and open your eyes. Welcome back. I hope that was a fun journey and that you were seeing or feeling and knowing what was happening at those different times. And don’t get stuck in the visual part. If you feel like you weren’t seeing things as clearly as you wanted to, don’t worry about that. It gets better over time. And we’ll be mixing in seeing, feeling, knowing, hearing, all of that together throughout this training. So you don’t have to just see. You can do the other ways too. Now remember, you can practice this exercise with your eyes open too. It’s actually kind of fun. If someone asks you about something at a particular time, or if you’re thinking about something from the past, Just while you’re talking, slide that timeline to that time and see if you can get a different perspective right in the context while you’re talking to that person. And again, remember to share your experience today. Did you see something that you don’t remember or different from how you remembered it? And I look forward to seeing your answers. Have fun today, and I will see you tomorrow.

========================================

LESSON 7: Time Travelling

--------------------
Meditation: Day 7 - Time Traveling
--------------------

Hello everyone, I’m Jeffrey Allen and welcome to day seven. Today we’re going to be expanding on yesterday’s exercise, but instead of seeing yourself moving through time and kind of watching it on TV, you’re going to actually move your awareness in these different places in time. You’re going to imagine that you’re there, so you’re going to see and hear and feel and know what’s happening around you, and I know you’re going to have a great time. This is great practice for gaining perspective into how your past influences you, and also for understanding your present time future, which I’ll explain in a little bit. Now, a few tips before we get started. I want you to let it be really easy. Just be relaxed and patient and curious, and don’t get stuck on how you’re experiencing it. Some people experience very visually. Some people experience it very emotionally. Whatever is strong for you, just be happy about that and let it be the way it is. Also remember that your awareness doesn’t follow the rules of the physical body because your awareness is not a physical object. So time travel with your body is very difficult, but time travel with your awareness is very easy. So just let it be okay. Great. So let’s begin. Focus on a point across the room where your eyes rest naturally. Be present right behind your eyes and breathe your eyes closed. Move your awareness back to the center of your head, right between your ears and behind your eyes. Let’s warm up briefly by moving your awareness in your head. First, walk or slide your awareness over to your left ear. Really feel yourself being in that left ear and then walk or slide your awareness over to the right ear and come back to center and walk or slide your awareness to the front. Go back to center. Go toward the back and the center. Move your awareness up so you’re at the top of your head. And then down to the bottom of your head. Move your awareness back to the center of your head. Breathe and relax. Notice your timeline beneath you right now. Stretching out to the left and to the right. And you’re in the middle of this timeline in present time. Now imagine that you’re able to easily slide along this timeline, kind of like a train traveling on a track. Walk or slide along that timeline to five minutes ago and feel and remember yourself getting ready for today’s lesson. Let yourself be in that moment now. Walk or slide your timeline to one hour ago. What were you doing? What were you feeling? What were you seeing one hour ago? Walk or slide along your timeline to sometime yesterday. Notice what time of day it is. What are you doing? What are you thinking and feeling? What do you see? For this next time, try moving there directly instead of walking or sliding. Just let yourself be on your timeline sometime last week. Be there now. Notice what you’re doing. What are you seeing, thinking, and feeling? Now be on your timeline sometime last year. Notice where you are. Notice what’s happening around you. And notice how you feel. Let yourself be at an important time as a teenager. Notice what you’re experiencing and how you feel about it. Notice what’s happening around you. Now let’s move a little bit faster. Be at a time between seven and ten years old, what are you noticing at this time? Be at an early childhood memory. What do you see? How do you feel? Really be there right now. Now be in the womb before you were born. How does it feel? What are you hearing? Now be at a time before you were conceived. What are you experiencing? Where is your awareness? Do you feel like you? Now let’s come back into present time. Stretch your hands. Stretch your awareness into your hands as well. Breathe and be in the center of your head. Notice your timeline again, stretching out to the past and out to the future. We’re going to travel down that future timeline. Let yourself slide or move down that timeline to 10 minutes in the future, just after this lesson. Notice what you’re doing. Notice how you’re feeling. Now let yourself move to tomorrow on the timeline. Notice what time it is. Notice how you feel. And notice what’s happening around you. Now let yourself be in next week. Notice where you are and what you’re doing. How are you feeling next week? Let yourself be in the far future now, near the end of your life. How do you feel about the life that you lived? What do you see and hear around you? Now let yourself be on your timeline after you’ve died. What are you experiencing? Where is your awareness? Who are you after you’ve died? Smile and remember the center of your head. Stretch your body and breathe. Stretch your awareness into your left ear and your right ear. From the back to the front, top and the bottom. Stretch your awareness all the way into your hands and your feet. Give yourself a deep breath, smile, and open your eyes. Welcome back. I hope you enjoyed that journey into the past and the future and even before you were born and after you died. I hope you saw some really interesting things. And remember that you did a great job no matter how you experienced that. I was moving pretty fast because I didn’t want your mind to get in the way. So if you felt like you couldn’t keep up or I was a little ahead of you, that’s okay. That was actually on purpose. So don’t worry about it. You did a great job. If you want to practice this again, I recommend that you do it before you go to sleep. You just pick a particular time that you want to explore when you dream and then go there on your timeline and let yourself fall asleep and explore that time. So remember to share your experiences today. I’m really curious what you noticed before you were conceived and what you noticed about yourself after you had died. And I’m curious too, did the past, present, and future feel different to you? And how do they feel different? Thanks again. Have a great day. And I look forward to seeing you tomorrow.

========================================

LESSON 8: Choosing Your Future

--------------------
Meditation: Day 8 - Choosing Your Future
--------------------

Hi everybody, I’m Jeffrey Allen and welcome to day eight. Today we’re going to be choosing your future by changing timelines. Now this is a really fun exercise and it’s great for consciously creating your future. So you don’t have to just wait around and see how things work out. You can actually adjust your future with your awareness. It’s really fun. So let’s get started. Focus on a point across the room where your eyes rest naturally. Be present right behind your eyes. and breathe your eyes closed, maintaining that same awareness behind your eyes. Move your awareness now into the center of your head. Let yourself move to the left ear, move over to the right ear, and move to the front, move to the back of your head. Move up to the top of your head, move down by your neck, and be in the center of your head. Think about a current situation in your life that you might want to change. First thing that comes to mind is good. Be aware that your past has brought you to this situation. Notice your timeline stretching out to both sides. And say hello to this situation in your mind right now. Send that hello down the timeline into the past. And notice a time and a place in your past returning that hello to you. Move your awareness into that time and place right now. And notice what happened. How were you feeling? What are you experiencing? At that time, what did you decide about yourself or the world? And feel the momentum that you created at that time. Now remember the center of your head. Be in present time. Let your timeline turn so the past is behind you and the future is in front of you. Feel that moment from the past back behind you and feel the momentum of that past moment pushing on you now, like waves of energy pushing you forward. How are those waves influencing you now? Are they clouding your judgment? Are they hiding something from you? Are they making you feel a certain way? Now look ahead at where this momentum is carrying you. Let yourself be at one moment in the future that results from this push. What’s happening in that future moment? How are you feeling? Are you happy? Remember the center of your head and be in present time. Notice that momentum from this past again. Feel the timeline from the past into the present and on to that future. Breathe. Begin to notice the other timelines available to you, each one stretching into a different future for you. Remember the situation that you might want to change. Which new timeline holds that change for you? Just let it light up for you. Turn your awareness in the direction of that new timeline right now. Feel this new timeline’s momentum pushing on you. Notice one past event in your life which lies in this new timeline and is pushing you in this new future direction. Say hello to that past time and place. Move your awareness to that time and place now. Notice what happened in that time in your past. How did you feel? What did you decide about yourself or the world? Feel the momentum you created with that decision and let that momentum carry you forward through this present moment and into a new future. Notice what’s happening in that new future right now. How are you feeling? Are you happy? Is your situation better on this new future timeline? Remember the center of your head. Be here in present time. Notice the two timelines you traveled today. Will you keep this new timeline? Or do you prefer the old one? Turn toward your choice now. Breathe. Feel happy about your choice. Stretch your body. Stretch your awareness all through your body. When you’re ready, smile and open your eyes. Welcome back. Great job, everybody. I hope you had fun. Changing your future with your awareness. Now, I’d like you to practice this today. You can do it with your eyes closed or with your eyes open. Just notice several times today when your past is pushing on you and then feel that timeline that you’re on and look for a new timeline and allow yourself to turn in that new direction. And remember that you can iterate too. If you turn in a new direction, you move your awareness to the future and you don’t like that future, you can come back, pick up a third timeline, turn to that timeline, and check that one again. So I encourage you to use this at least once throughout the day today. Of course, I’d like you to share. I’d love to hear how you changed your future today. Thanks again, and I look forward to seeing you tomorrow.

========================================

LESSON 9: Time Applications & Project Timelines

--------------------

Hi everybody; I'm Jeffrey Allen, and welcome to day nine. Congratulations as you've made it through the activation portion for your temporal awareness which means that you've gone through four of the six steps that it takes to really raise your level of awareness. First day, we did a self-assessment of where are you in past, present, and future. And we looked at your habit of orientation in time. Is your mental awareness and time and your awareness timeline, do they point the same direction? Second day, we went for an easy success. So you looked at viewing different things in time, both in the past, present, and the future. The third day, we looked at a Challenge Day where you were able to actually move yourself, move your awareness, to a place in time either in the past, in the future, and I hope you really enjoyed that. And the fourth day, yesterday, we worked on changing your timeline, so if there's a place that you want to go in the future, you can see if you're pointed that direction, and then adjust your timeline if needed. So this is really powerful. So those are the first four steps. You've already got your activation now, and what you need to do to continue moving it forward is just to practice. So of course I've given you some practice tips here on how to do that. First I would say that you want to notice if you are balanced in time. So again, if you're feeling anxious or depressed or not feeling very good, check your temporal awareness. Because if you're focused in present time and you've got a balance here, you're going to feel pretty calm, you're going to feel relaxed, and you're going to feel happy. So another application is if you're wanting to remember something, and it's not coming up very clearly, you can either do the viewing where you sort of look at that particular memory on the TV in front of you and look for something that you didn't notice before. You can also do it where you go to that memory, and the same thing, feel it and look for something you didn't notice before. This is really good for reviewing things and remembering, because oftentimes your brain has made up something a little bit different than what was really happening. So this helps you to go back and get that original information. The next thing you can do to practice is you can do the same thing going into the future. So if you're wanting to look at a particular trend or do a little prediction of where things are going, this is a perfect place to do it. You can either look with the TV and look at future things or you can move your awareness to the future and see what's happening. Now when you're playing with the future, you want to keep in mind that the future is a big probability space. What I mean by that is that you have momentum right now that's carrying you forward. If you don't change that momentum, it'll take you in a particular direction, but there's still a lot of probabilities out there other than that primary one that your momentum is carrying you toward. So if you start to adjust your momentum and adjust your direction, it'll take you into new directions. So I always like to say when I'm giving people intuitive readings that I don't want to always be right when I'm looking at your future, because what that means is that I'm just good at programming you to do what I said or experience what I said, and I don't want to do that. I would much rather empower you to change. If I tell you something about your future, and you don't like it, I want you to change it. I want you to change that and move into a different potential. That's the whole purpose of looking at the future is that if you don't like it, you can change it. So don't get stuck on whether you're right or wrong. Use this as an understanding of your present time future. Where am I pointed right now with my awareness? And if I don't like it, I'm going to adjust so I can point a different direction with my awareness. Okay, great. Now another place that you can use this time awareness is when you're teaching classes or you're doing some marketing. This is very handy to connect with all the people that are going to either be watching a class like you're watching right now, and I'm connecting with you. Or you can connect with people that are going to buy a particular product or get a service from you. If you let your awareness travel out into time in this way, you'll feel that you have a really strong and tangible connection with these people before you've even met them, and so it's a really a great way to practice. Another one that you can do is you can work with healing the body in this way. So if you, something's happening in your body, some condition that you don't like that's bothering you and you want to change, you can travel with your awareness back in time to a place where you didn't have that problem. And then you're going to travel forward into the future, into a place where you didn't have that problem. And once you have those two end points, you kind of come back toward the middle into present time. So you're kind of working both ends of the time and bringing it back to you. And you'll find that this is a great way to do healing work for the body, 'cause your body will tend to adjust pretty quickly if you know where you've been and you know where you're going. If you want a little bit more advanced practice, I recommend working with that dual awareness in time. So a good way to do this if you're talking to a friend is just notice that you're very present and very connecting with them in present time, and at the same time, think about and let yourself experience, the first time that you met or some other really important time for the two of you. And hold both awarenesses of being very present right now and reliving and re-experiencing that time in the past. All right, and there's one more technique that I want to teach you. Just kind of a little bonus here, a different way to use a timeline, and this is if you want to find out the natural timing on something. So it's just a very applied way of using your timeline. And what you're going to do is you're going to take your timeline, and you're just going to visualize it out here in front of you. And you're going to see it from one to 10, and the units are going to be something that make sense for you. So say you have a question. You want to know when's a good time to change my job, for example. And then you might decide that I want to do it in the next year, so I'm going to look at one month, two months, three months, four months, all the way up to 10 months or more in the future. So your timeline is going to be in months. If you've got something bigger, your timeline might be in years. It might be in days, weeks, whatever is perfect for this question that you have. And then you're going to just watch this timeline and kind of feel it, and do this with your eyes closed in meditation. And you're going to just count, one, two, three, four and so on. And then feel like, does it go up? Does it feel like the timeline, there's kind of a wave that goes up like a graph? Do I feel more excited, enthusiastic? Do I feel down? Do I hear a tone going up or down? You may experience it in many different ways because all of us tap into our intuition differently. But whatever you're feeling, just notice the change from one to two to three, four, five and so on. Notice that change in your experience, and you'll notice when is it more likely for this event to happen or when is the natural timeframe for this to happen in. And again, keep in mind that things can change, so you might have to check back a little bit later. So let's go ahead and practice it right now. So think of one thing that you'd like to understand the natural timing for right now. Okay? And then think about what's the timeframe for this? Is this going to be days, weeks or months, or even years? Okay, good. All right, now go ahead and close your eyes. And let yourself be present right behind your eyes in the center of your head. And visualize a line out in front of you, this timeline that goes from zero to 10. And ask yourself first, what's the answer that you want to get? Just kind of smile, because you have a bias, and then try to put that aside. And then just notice the energy. How does it look at one? One day, one week, one month, one year, whatever one is for you. And two. And three. And four. Just noticing the change. Five. Six. Seven. Eight. Nine. 10. Okay, good. Now just keep your eyes closed, and notice how you feel about the answer. Usually I'll see either like just one big spike. Maybe it'll look like, oh, four, five, and six were brighter. Sometimes I'll see little windows like there's it kind of spikes up at two and maybe again at seven or nine. So you'll notice different patterns if you play with this enough. And just notice how did you feel about those answers? Were you disappointed by the natural timeline? Or were you excited? And again, just kind of put those emotions aside. Let any answer be okay, and let's try it again. This time we're just going to go faster through the numbers. So you're going to look at how does it feel? What does it look like? Is there a sound? Just any indication of whether it's going up and being more likely or down and being less likely. All right, here we go. One. Two. Three. Four. Five. Six. Seven. Eight. Nine. All right, now just smile and enjoy that information. Just let that go. And again, remember that any timing's okay and that timing can change. All right, now go ahead and open your eyes. Now I hope you had fun with this. If you're playing with this to raise your awareness, don't get stressed about the results. Don't get stuck on was it right or wrong or what you wanted. You're just checking. You're being curious and using your awareness of time to scan and see what's happening right now. And keep in mind again, this is your present time, future potentials, so it could change. If you're talking about relationships in particular, there's another person in that relationship, and so that can shift the potentials pretty quickly. If you feel like things changed, look at the timing again. Now if you're trying to adjust it yourself, I recommend that you be gentle . You can adjust the timing on things, but oftentimes you'll actually make a difficult road. So say you saw that it'll happen in six months. You want it to happen in two months. You can change that. You can make it happen in two months, but because it's not the natural timing, you may have a really difficult two months to get there. You may actually get to two months and wish you had waited until it was six months. So I recommend just play with this; have fun with it. Don't get stuck on it. All right, great. So that's it for today. I want you to think about one way that you would like to use this new awareness, either your temporal awareness or your spatial awareness. What's a unique way that you can use it in your life? And I want you to share that today. And then tomorrow in our Integration Day, you'll be practicing that for yourself. Thanks again, and I will see you tomorrow.

LESSON 10: Self-Awareness Integration

--------------------
Meditation: Day 10 - Self-Awareness Integration
--------------------

Hi everybody, I’m Jeffrey Allen and welcome to Day 10. Today is your integration day, which means that you can rest if you want to, you can catch up if you missed a day, or you can practice on your own. So if you want to rest, that’s great. You can just stop now and I will see you tomorrow. If you missed a day, you can catch up now. Just go back to that day now and listen to that day. Now, if you want to practice on your own today, I’m going to do a meditation to get you started. And once you get into trance, you’ll have eight minutes to explore on your own. There’s just silence. And then I’ll catch you again at the end and wake you back up and bring you out of trance. This do -it -yourself practice is actually very important because it helps you explore on your own and learn that you don’t really need me to guide you through the exercises. This is also a great meditation that you can reuse anytime in the future because there’s a lot of space in the middle that you can fill in with your own ideas and your own cues. Great, so let’s begin. For this meditation, I’ll get you started, then I’ll give you eight minutes of silence to explore on your own, and then I’ll help you come back at the end. Focus on a point across the room where your eyes rest naturally. Have your awareness right behind your eyes, and focus on that point. On your next inhale, breathe your eyes closed, maintaining that same awareness. Right behind your eyes. Move your awareness into the center of your head. Warm up by moving your awareness to your left ear. Moving it to your right ear. Moving it to the front. Moving it to the back of your head. Move your awareness to the top of your head. And to the bottom of your head. And back to the center of your head. Smile and think of something you want to explore right now by moving your awareness in time and space. And notice where and when is the information that you want to explore. Feel your timeline stretching out to your sides. When I count down from three, you’ll be there exploring on your own. Are you ready? Three. Remember where and when you’ll be going to. Two. Say hello to that time and place. 1. Let your awareness move. 0. Be in your desired time and place. What’s the first thing you notice in this time and place? Be patient and let your awareness adjust. Be relaxed and curious about what you’ll notice next. Enjoy! Notice your breath. Notice one more insight before you come back. Be grateful for all the information you received. Remember the center of your head. Be in present time. Stretch your body and breathe. Stretch your awareness from the center of your head to your left ear. Stretch to the right, the front, and the back. Stretch above. Stretch below. Stretch your awareness all the way into your hands and your feet. Give yourself another deep breath. Smile and open your eyes. Welcome back. I hope you enjoyed that journey and it was great for you. Your awareness is growing faster than you even know, so really validate yourself for doing a great job. And of course, you can share your experience today. What was the most surprising thing that you noticed when you were exploring by yourself today? Thanks again. I’ll see you tomorrow for the start of Phase 2.

Part 2: Body-Awareness (Physical & Energy)

========================================

LESSON 11: Welcome to Body Awareness

--------------------

Hi, everybody; welcome back. I'm Jeffrey Allen, and this is day 11, or it's actually day one of the Body Awareness training section of the program. Now the Body Awareness is kind of an interesting section because we were already talking about your self-awareness and your presence in time and space. And you hear that a lot where people say, be here now, and what are they talking about, be here now? Well, we're actually talking about being in your body because your body is the own only part of you that has a time and has a space. So be here now, or be present, is all about being in your body. Now it's actually kind of funny for me to be teaching about being in the body because although I'm pretty in my body these days, it really wasn't the case early on. And I'll tell you a funny story. I went to a class one time. I was trying to learn to get out of the body and do astral travel, much like we did in the last few classes. And I found this intuition center, and I went there and they had a class on out-of-body travel or astral projection. I was really excited and I signed up; I tried to sign up and take it. And they said, oh, I'm sorry, this a graduate class; you can't come to this class, but we have this clairvoyant training that you can start instead. This is actually how I got started on my clairvoyant training. Now, years later, I'd taken all the different trainings. I've been there for years. And I was on the board of directors, and the director was telling me kind of a funny story. And she said that when I came in initially and was asking to be in this astral travel class and to get out of my body, she said the the real reason they couldn't teach me that is that I wasn't in my body in the first place. She said, it's very hard to teach you to get out of something that you're not in. It's like, if you're standing outside your car saying, I want to learn how to get out of the car. It actually was about a year into that training, that clairvoyant training, before I got in my body the first time. And before that, I didn't even know what it felt like. I was 28 and the first time I got in my body, I was like, whoa, oh, I get it now; this is what being present in the body feels like. And I had wondered why I was not very coordinated before and why I had this sense of kind of being watched sometimes or the sense that like, nobody could see me, almost like just kind of a weird sense of not being physical. And that was really the big part of it. There was just, I wasn't physically present in my body. If you've had some of those symptoms I mentioned, where you, maybe you didn't feel very coordinated, like you're kind of using a remote control to run your body. Or maybe you've felt like you're not really there, like nobody sees you, or even opposite, like everybody's seeing you or everybody's watching you; now you're probably not in your body. If you had that sense of like, why am I here? Or like, it's a mistake, I shouldn't be here on this planet. You're probably not very much in your body. And if you have a sense that you are kind of detaching, sometimes, or floating away, those are also examples of not being in the body. So when you're in your body, the main thing you feel is that you are present, and you're really alive, and you're excited to be here on planet earth. And it feels so good to be here and to be in the body. It's like a celebration all the time. You'll also notice that you tend to be more coordinated and to be more athletic when you're in your body. It's also easier to focus; if you're trying to get things done, being in the body is great for being focused. Also, if you're in your body, you tend to be less worried about what other people think about you, because you are present in your body and you feel good. Now there's two main reasons that I see, and that we're going to address this training, as to why people are out of your body. And the main one actually has to do with a little bit of competition between your body and your spirit. Now, your body and your spirit operate very differently. Your body moves rather slow and it's fairly dense in its energy field. Your spirit, on the other hand, moves very fast and is very light; it's not dense at all in energy. So sometimes when you come here and you're in a body, you get a little bit frustrated with the speed that things move at or the heaviness in the body. And so there's this competition between your spirit and your body, instead of a cooperation or collaboration between the spirit and the body, which is what we're going to go for in this training. Now, this also shows up in a very physical way. So if you feel like you are too small or maybe you're too big, or you're too short or you're too tall, or your nose is too big or too small, or your hair is too long or too curly or too straight, you get the idea, right? If you have any of the normal judgments that people have, that's another form of sort of competition between your spirit, or how you think things should be, and your body, which is more based on how things actually are. And if you can eliminate that, you'll find it's much easier to be in the body, and it's so much more fun to be in the body. Now, the second reason that I see that people are out of body is there's this misunderstanding that we have that we're just physical. It's very common; it's just part of our culture, actually, at this time on the planet, to believe that we're primarily physical beings. Now, if you're in this class and taking the training, you're already probably not thinking that completely, but we're going to work on it a little bit anyway because it's really important to get this deeper awareness that you have two parts of you, you've got your, or that your body, rather, has two components to it. Your body has a physical component, and your body has an energy component to it. And if you can use both of these together, you'll find that it's really powerful and that you tend to be in your body and excited to be here because you're actually using your full set of capabilities while you're in the body. So that's really great. Now, today, we're going to start with just the first steps. Now, remember, I've got your kind of six steps to awareness success. So the first step is always a self-awareness step and a habit check. And we're going to do that today with this, how present are you in the body? And I said before, it's a little bit hard to gauge because if you've never been in your body, you're not in your body very much, you probably don't know what it feels like. If I ask if you're in your body, you'll just say, yeah of course I am, 'cause you don't know the difference. That's, that's how I was until was 28. Like I said, never been in the body. Now what we're going to do is I'm going to just have you work with a little tool, just a little gauge, that goes from zero to 100%. So you can imagine that kind of like a little speedometer, you have the zero on one side, it goes up to 100, and you're just going to use this as a simple testing tool to let you know how you're doing. Is it 0% in your body or, you know, 10% in your body or 100% in your body. And so we're going to use that tool. Now before we get into that, anytime we're using a tool like this, we want to address some of the common issues that people have around their awareness. And the most common one is this sense that you don't know what you're doing or that you can't see things. We could call this kind of like, you know, like Visual Insecurity Syndrome or something like that. Where you think that you can't visualize or you're worried that you're not going to be able to do the exercise. So if you have this, just forget about that; you can easily imagine a little gauge out in front of you, and if you can't see it, just pretend you can see it; maybe you can hear it; you can just hear a number or have a feeling. You can do it. So don't worry about that one, if you're getting stressed about the seeing part, that's a whole nother piece to just kind of let go of, be amused, and laugh. Because when you get stressed, if I'm watching people in class and they're trying hard, they start to look like this, like I'm really trying to look, I'm trying to visualize, right? And it turns out that you're, the part that you visualize with energetically is here, this is your, they call it the third eye. And you know, if it's scrunched up like this, it's kind of like having your eyes closed, right? So you need to relax a little bit, open your eyes, relax the forehead, laugh a little bit, and don't worry, you'll be able to see just fine. Now there's a couple other things that people get into that I want to address. Sometimes people are falling asleep. I call it sleepitation instead of meditation. Now, if this is happening to you, this is totally okay. All that's happening is that you're hitting a little unconscious energy as you're growing spiritually. And this is actually normal; it's a good thing. Remember, I'm trying to challenge you and push your beliefs and push your experiences into a new domain. Now, as I do that, there's always going to be some layer of unconscious energy that's kind of at the edge or your limit. And when you get up to that edge, and you start to move your awareness through that unconscious energy, you'll go a little unconscious too. So your head may dip or you may fall asleep. This is totally okay because when you're in that space, just listen to my voice, wait until you can kind of come back and continue along because what's happening is you're clearing that unconscious energy by hanging out in it. You're putting your awareness there where it wasn't able to go before. So if you're falling asleep, don't worry, it's totally okay, it's actually a sign that you're in the right space. Okay, also sometimes people do kind of a little joyride during the meditation. And what I mean by this is that I'm guiding you to do some meditation, but you're off doing some other meditation on your own. Now, this is totally okay too, this little joyride, because what's happening there is, again, you're moving your awareness, you're following my cues. And then some of your own information comes up, and you kind of steer off and go look at your own information instead of the information I'm giving you. Now that's totally okay because your information is better for you than my information or anybody else's. So I'm just here to get you started. If you find yourself in a joyride, you're doing something else, don't feel bad; just feel great. And when you come back and you tune back into where I'm at, just pick up again with wherever we are. So that's just a normal part of the process. So when we're activating your awareness, strange things like this might happen, spacing out, thinking of other things, falling asleep; these are all totally okay; don't worry about this at all. So today I want to get into this first step or kind of this using this gauge and assessing where you are. So let's go ahead and dive in and do this. We're going to work with this little gauge. So go ahead and close your eyes and be present right behind your eyes, and move your awareness back into the center of your head. And I want you to visualize this gauge that goes from 0% up to 100%. And ask yourself, "How present am I in my body right now?" And just let a number come up, somewhere between zero and 100%. Okay, now go ahead and open your eyes, and try this exercise again. It might be easier for you with your eyes open. Sometimes if we feel we can't visualize, it's just a program that we have that when we close our eyes, we can't see. And when our eyes are open, we can see. So go ahead and just imagine that gauge out in front of you right now, kind of abstractly. And again, just ask that question. "How present am I in my body from zero to 100%?" Okay, good. Now you can proceed with your eyes open or your eyes closed through the rest of the exercise, whichever one is easier for you. Okay, good. So now I want you to look at that gauge, and I'm going to give you a list of things to think about. And you're going to ask yourself how present am I during these different situations? So first I want you to think about some food that you really love, and just imagine yourself right now: you're smelling the food, and you're tasting the food, and your mouth is watering, and you're totally enjoying this food. And on your gauge, just ask how present are you in your body when you're really enjoying your favorite food? Is it 90%? 50%? Just notice; great. Now think about something that you don't like, maybe some smell that's really bad for you, something that's just, you don't like it, it feels terrible, and look at that gauge. From zero to 100%, how present in your body are you when you're smelling that smell that you don't like? Okay, good. Now imagine right now that you're with one of your best friends, somebody that you just love to be with, and that you totally enjoy. And see that gauge, how present are you in your body when you're with somebody that you really love, that you really enjoy? Okay, now look at the opposite. Think about somebody that you don't really like to see, you don't enjoy spending time with, and notice how present are you in your body when you're around that person. Great; now take a look at your gauge. If you're in your favorite place in nature, just imagine that right now; maybe there's a beautiful waterfall and it's this peaceful and calm setting and it feels great. How present would you be in your body then? Okay, now think about being in like a really crowded city where there's a lot of noise and maybe a little smell that's not good, and you're bumping into people. Now, how present would you be in your body? Just check your gauge. Okay, great. Now think about something about your body that you actually don't like that much. Just think about that, whatever it is, and one, notice how you feel. And two, notice that gauge, how present are you in your body from zero to 100% when you're thinking about this thing that you don't like about your body. Okay, now think of something that you really admire about your body; there's got to be something that you just love about you, that makes you smile when you think about yourself. And tune into that thing right now, that part of you. And just notice how present are you in your body right now? Okay, very good. Now, I want you to just imagine right now, I want you to go ahead and close your eyes if they're are open, and imagine that you are pouring energy in through the top of your head, or rather that you're pouring you into the top of the head. So kind of like your body's this container, and you are water that you're just pouring in, and you're feeling your self, your spirit, go down into the legs, all the way down into the feet; feel more and more of you pouring in, down the shoulders, down into the arms and your hands. Feel your energy pouring all the way down into the abdomen, down into your lower back. And feel yourself totally filling the body up. And just pour a little bit more of you in. So you're overflowing. And just feel that, and you can also check that gauge and just see how much are you in the body right now; good. Good, and finally, I want you to think about something really funny, maybe your favorite joke, a comedian that you love, a funny movie that you saw. And just check when you're in amusement, how much are you in your body? Okay, so we're probably getting up close to that 100% at this point. Okay, great, so just take a deep breath, and when you're ready, you can open your eyes. All right, very good. So I just wanted to give you an experience of that self-assessment, like how much are you in your body in different circumstances? Because it changes throughout the day; it changes depending on your circumstance. Sometimes if something startling happens, like if you hear a balloon pop, people that startle easily will kind of go, ah, and just pop out of their body. If the same balloon pops, and you don't really do anything or move, you're probably really present in your body. Okay, and I also wanted to give you just a little habit check there. The idea of pouring the energy in or pouring the water down in your body is to help you shift out of that habit of being part here and part not here. And so I want you to practice that a little bit throughout today and just see how that makes you feel. So that's the first step. This self-awareness and habit. Second step, tomorrow, we're going to do an easy meditation or an easy success. And you're just going to work with your physical body and listening to this rhythm of your body and listening to your body in a really powerful way. So it's really fun. The next day, we're going to work with communicating with your body, and specifically with forgiving your body and loving your body. So we're going to address, this is the Challenge Day, right? So we're going to address some of those judgments that you might have about your body, and see if we can get those out of the way so that you can be more present in your body. Okay, then the fourth, we're going to do the Challenge Day. And in the Challenge Day, we're actually going to have you work with your physical body and your awareness and do some healing for yourself. And maybe look at an old pattern, something in the body you don't think you can change, and see if you can get in there, find what it is, and make a change. Now, the fifth part of course is practice. So today, when you are out in the world, I want you to just kind of notice in different situations, you can keep that little gauge from the zero to 100%, and just keep asking yourself, "How present am I in my body right now?" Do it when you're happy: "How present am I?" Or angry or sleepy, you know, or if you go out and have a beer, you know, how present are you in your body? And then of course the last part in that success formula for your awareness is sharing. So before you go, please go down and share some of your experience today. I'd love to know how present you are in your body. Thanks so much, and I will see you tomorrow.

LESSON 12: Listening To Your Body Rhythm

--------------------
Meditation: Day 12 - Listening To Your Body Rhythm
--------------------

Hello everyone, I’m Jeffrey Allen. Welcome to day two of your Body Awareness Challenge. This is your easy success day for your physical body awareness. And what I want you to get today is this sense of connection with your body or of being in tune with your body. And this is really important if you want to have an easy, relaxed, and healthy journey in your body. Because when we’re not in tune with our bodies, that’s when things feel a little bit frustrating or it can be a difficult ride. And that’s no fun. So let’s dive in today and we’ll work on getting you that feeling of connection, that feeling of being in tune with your body. So first just notice your breath. Have your awareness right behind your eyes. And on your next inhale, breathe your eyes closed. Notice your breath continuing in and out of your body. How does your breathing feel right now? Is it relaxed and easy? Is it forced or stressed? On your next breath, let go of any ideas about how you’re supposed to breathe. Just smile and breathe easily. And let your body breathe however it wants to right now. Let your body show you its natural rhythm. And notice each breath coming more easily. Feel yourself smiling bigger with each inhale. And let your body move or sway a little with your breathing and notice your posture. Do you feel relaxed and open? Do you feel tense and closed? Is your head forward or back? Let your head move right now into perfect relaxed balance on top of your neck. Let your shoulders relax into perfect balance and let your body move slightly, swaying a little bit and finding its own rhythm. Give your body permission to wiggle or shake or unwind in any way it wants during this meditation, because stillness is for the mind, not for the body. Begin to notice your heart. Feel it pulsing and beating in your chest. Notice its strong, regular rhythm. See if you can feel the individual beats of your heart. Feel your natural heart rhythm in your chest. Feel your blood pulsing through your head. Feel it in your neck. Feel your blood pulsing in your shoulders. And feel it in your arms and your hands and your fingers. Feel your blood bringing life for us all throughout your arms and your hands. And feel that natural rhythm in your body. Now feel your blood as it pulses into your stomach and your abdomen. Feel that pulse moving along your back. And notice how your body moves as you’re more aware of your body’s rhythm. Feel your heart again. Feel your blood naturally moving through your body. Feel the blood in your legs, pulsing around your hips and your thighs. Feel that rhythm in your knees as they get all the nourishment that they need. And feel that pulse all the way down in your feet and your toes. And now feel that rhythm in your whole body. Feel your blood as it moves all the way through you. Feel that strong and beautiful beat of your heart. And notice that relaxed and easy breath and your posture in that natural sway or motion. Now notice all the smaller rhythms as well. A whole chorus of organs and glands and smaller systems in your body. Notice them all tuned and working together beautifully. And feel your energy along your skin. Feel your breath. Smile. And open your eyes. Welcome back. I hope you got a much deeper feeling of connection in your body. Because life is so much more fun when we’re in tune with our bodies. If you want to deepen this awareness today, you can just notice your body rhythms throughout the day. And try to match your activities with your body. Eat when you’re hungry, not when the clock hits a certain time. Sleep when you’re tired, not when you think you should sleep. And so on. We so often ignore our bodies. And I want you to really start listening today. Just listen to your breath, listen to your pulse, listen to your body. And of course, I’d love it if you could share your experience. I’d like to know, what did you like about your body rhythm? How did it feel to you? And was there anything surprising about that rhythm or about that experience to you? So thanks so much for today. This was your easy day for your body awareness. And I look forward to seeing you tomorrow.

========================================

LESSON 13: Loving Your Body

--------------------
Meditation: Day 13 - Loving Your Body
--------------------

Hello everyone, I’m Jeffrey Allen and welcome to day three of your body awareness challenge. Today is your challenge day for your physical body awareness and we’re going to be working on releasing any judgments you have and on loving your body. Now I used to listen to Sheryl Crow a lot with my daughter Mariah and there was this one part in the songs that I really loved. It just said, it’s not about getting what you want, it’s about wanting what you’ve got. And it’s such a nice view on life, but it’s also very applicable to your body. And so we’re going to work with that today. What I’m hoping that you get out of today is just an awareness of how much pressure that you’ve been putting on your body to be a certain way. And I want to help relieve that pressure so that you can just be you. And also find a sense of appreciation and perhaps even love for your body. And this is really great because when you can find this and feel this, you’ll notice it feels like a great burden has been released. And that’s what we’re looking for today. All right, so let’s go ahead and dive in. And notice your breath. Let your awareness be right behind your eyes. And when you’re ready, go ahead and breathe your eyes closed. Feel that natural rhythm in your body. You can notice your breath and your pulse and that subtle motion of your body. Stretch your awareness into your whole body. Smile and feel your natural rhythm. Think about one thing that you don’t like about your body right now. What part of your body are you unhappy with? Just be honest. And notice right away how your body rhythm changes. Notice your change in breath and posture and motion. And just smile. Let it be okay that you don’t like something about your body. You’re still a good person. And begin to stretch or move your awareness to the part of your body that you dislike. And notice what is the story specifically. What don’t you like about your body here? Remember the first time you felt this way about your body. Who told you that your body was wrong? Was it an inner voice? Maybe some other kids or your siblings? Could have been a parent or other adults? Just hear their voice in your mind right now. What did that voice say about your body? And notice… How or where did this judgment get stuck on your body? And decide right now, is this really important to you? Can you live without this judgment? Because you don’t have to keep it. And breathe. And feel this judgment beginning to lift off and float away from your body. Just let it go. Notice how good that feels. Now notice every other judgment that you’re carrying in your body. Feel it all at once and feel the weight and restriction that it creates. Feel all those ideas of what you should or should not have or be in your body and feel how much pressure is on your body right now. And breathe. Decide right now if you want to keep carrying this in your body. If you’re ready, take a big breath and push it all away from you as you exhale. Most of this wasn’t even yours to begin with, but you’ve been holding on to it. And once more, breathe in, then exhale and let all those judgments release. Good. Now think of one thing that you’re grateful about in your body. This can be something specific or just being grateful to be alive. And let that gratitude grow inside you and notice your body rhythm getting strong again. Let this gratitude spread into all areas of your body. Notice how hard your body has been working for you. It’s breathing. Your heart is beating. All systems are go. And marvel at how amazingly complex and wonderful your body is. And notice how much your body loves you. Just smile and let that sink in. Your body loves you. Your body loves you. And feel grateful for that love, for your body’s undying support. And let yourself love your body in return. Let yourself appreciate its unique rhythms, its unique motion and form, and feel that love spreading through your body. into your fingers and your toes, into your stomach and your chest, your back and your head. Really love your face. Love your smile. Love your hair. Love that place that you judged before. Feel how nice that feels, that loving energy, loving your body, knowing that it’s loving you. And notice your breath again. And when you’re ready, open your eyes. So welcome back. Try to keep this feeling of love for your body as long as you can today. When a judgment pops up, just notice where it came from and decide if you can live without it. And notice your body loving you in return, even when you’re not loving it. Isn’t that great? please share your experience today. Was it easy to let go of your body judgments? How did it feel to let them go? And how do you think this will change your experience and change your behavior? So thanks so much for today. Have a great day and I will see you tomorrow.

LESSON 14: Healing Your Body

--------------------
Meditation: Day 14 - Healing Your Body
--------------------

Hi everyone, I’m Jeffrey Allen. Welcome to day 14 of your body awareness challenge. This is your wow day. We’re going to try to give you an experience that you didn’t know was possible. And I also want to give you an understanding that you can deeply change your physical body. And so today what we’ll be doing is we’re looking at… prototype cell or like a blueprint cell that all your new cells in your body are generated from. So your body’s making new cells all the time and we’re going to work on that prototype where they get their programs from and we’re going to make a few changes to that prototype cell. And this is really fun. This is actually pretty advanced practice. It’s great if you want to follow your own path with your body. and kind of get out of that default path or the default program that everybody else is on. So this is really fun. So notice your breath. Have your awareness right behind your eyes. And when you’re ready, breathe your eyes closed. Let yourself be aware of your body. Notice a place on the back of your head around where there’s usually a little… on the back lower part of your head and let your awareness be right in that area right now. And you’re going to imagine that there’s a little drawer that you can open right in the back of your head. And as you open that drawer, you’re going to find that amazing prototype cell. This master cell holds the energetic blueprint from which all cells are created. And just let yourself see that cell in front of you right now. As you look at this cell, notice its timeline. Timeline begins when you’re conceived and continues until your last breath in this body. Along this timeline, you’ll notice a few programs or a few points of light along the way where certain things will happen in the body almost like a clock. When you get to this age, certain things will start to shut down or change in the body. So just for fun, look at what happens in this cell when the timeline hits 40. Maybe your eyes get old, it’s harder to see. Notice what it is for you. And with amusement, just reach out and erase that program. from the timeline. You don’t need to follow this default program with your body. Very good. Notice the point around 50. What does the program say your body should do at 50? Maybe it’s gray hair or some wrinkles. Just be amused at whatever you see. And again, just imagine you can erase that information, that program from the timeline. Clearing off anything around age 50 where your body needs to get older. Just erase that from the cell’s timeline. Good. Now look further at around 60. Does your default program say your body’s getting weak or tired? Maybe something else? And with total amusement, just erase that program off the timeline of your master cell. And just for fun, you can look ahead at 70 or 80 or 90 or 100. Notice any programs about aging or death in the body. And just erase those very easily, very cleanly from that timeline. Good. And now let yourself zoom out a little bit so you can see your whole timeline again. And this is the timeline for that master cell or that prototype cell in the body. Does this cell have a disease program that’s waiting at a certain age for you? Could be something genetic. Could be something environmental. Notice if there’s a program on that timeline for disease. And just breathe and stay amused. Begin to take that program out of this master cell. And you can just think, if it’s in my highest good, I’d prefer not to have that disease experience. Just see that change in that master cell. And then notice how long does this timeline for your master cell go? How long are you allowed to live in this body? Could it be 80 or 100 or 120? And very simply, take out that program. So you erase it from that cell because you can live as long as you want to live if you don’t shut down or destroy your body. Good. Now decide what age your body is right now. This could be your biological age. Could be younger or older. You’re just putting in the command for your body to be a certain age. And very easily rewind this prototype cell’s clock to the age of your choice. So for me, I’m 46 right now, but I like my cell to be programmed at about 36 instead. And whatever you set, your body will… and try to follow your program. And now decide your energy levels and your vitality that you want in your body. Visualize how that feels, how that looks for you, and send those images and those feelings right into that master cell. You’re communicating and sending in what you would like for your body. And decide what physical fitness level you want in your body. Feel it. Visualize it. And with some fun and amusement, just let that information go into that master cell. And finally, decide what weight and muscle tone you would like your body to have. And without effort, send that message, send that request into the master cell. Good. Now breathe and go ahead and close that drawer. with that master cell inside. And thank your physical body for using this new program with every new cell that it creates. And smile and get excited that over the next year, as your body creates new cells, that those new cells will have this new program, free from those default aging programs, and with those enhanced physical decisions that you would like. Have your awareness right behind your eyes. Stretch and open your eyes. Great. Welcome back. I hope you had a good time and that you really noticed how powerful your physical body awareness can be. Because with practice and certainty, you can do amazing things with your body. If you want to deepen this awareness today, I suggest that you notice throughout the day, where else are you following the default program? So where else with your body are you just doing what everybody else is doing or aging in the way that everybody else is aging? And let yourself change it. And don’t be afraid of making changes in your body like this because your body is super intelligent. You’re not going to be able to do something that’s going to harm or hurt your body. You’re just adding your preferences and helping to clear the body and give it a brand new program for you. So thanks so much for today. I hope you share down below just what did you see in your prototype cell and what did you change there and how did you feel that affecting your life? Thanks again and I will see you tomorrow.

LESSON 15: Body Applications + Energy Body Intro

--------------------

Hi, everybody. I'm Jeffrey Allen. Welcome back to Day 15. Now, congratulations are in order because you have now completed your activation for your Physical Body Awareness. And remember, we've got six steps that we go through to build your awareness. And the activation includes the first four steps. So activation, first we had you do an assessment where you tuned in with your gauge to see how present you are in your body at different times and different situations and also gave you some information on how to fill into your body more easily. Second, we did the easy success. Easy success is working on listening to your body in a a really deep way and listening to that rhythm that you naturally have in the body. So very fun. The third step, which is your challenge, is where we worked on your judgments of your body and healing that and really loving yourself. So I hope that was a little challenging for you, and you got some really big breakthroughs there because we normally have a lot of self-judgment, and moving through it is just so powerful. So wonderful. Now of course the fourth step was yesterday where we did the the healing where you're working with your body and really getting in and doing powerful healing work. And that was really great too. Now that that activation part is done and you've got that base level of awareness, to continue moving up with your awareness, all you need to do is practice. So I made a list here of some of the favorite ways that I like to apply this physical body awareness and really get that practice. So let's take a look. Okay, so of course, the first one is what we did yesterday. You can use this technique of tuning into the body and healing your body. So if you have something wrong in the body, definitely start using your awareness of going to that place and sending it healing energy and using the tools that you now have. A second application for this type of physical awareness is that if you really want to excel in the sport that you're in, practice being really present in your body before you go out and practice that particular sport. You'll notice that makes a big difference in how you perform. Also, if you're feeling that you are kind of inadequate or you're worried what people think about you, this is a good time to get more in the body because if you're not present in the body you're in some ways not adequate, right? Because you're not adequately in the body, you're not fully present being the best you that you can be. And so if you're having that feeling, just think of that not as a judgment, but rather just think, "Oh, it's not an absolute truth. I'm feeling inadequate, 'cause I'm not fully here. And I'm going to get fully here; I'm going to feel adequate; I'm going to feel good." Now if you're worried about what other people are thinking about you, then you want to check your own judgements because people generally only think negative things about you if you're thinking negative things about yourself. We pick that up and we kind of share that that awareness with what we're thinking with each other. We're going to talk about that a little bit in a later part of the program too. Now another two interesting places are, this is really helpful for dating confidence. So if you want to go out and date and meet people and feel really good and have them think good things about you and be successful in your dating life, then being present in your body is really good for that. Clearing your judgments of yourself is really good for that because people love being around you when you're fully present. And people love being around you when you're not judging yourself and you're happy and present in your body. Now, of course being productive is another place. If you want to be more productive at work, be very focused and be present in your body. So those are all kind of basic practice steps you can use. Now let's take a look at a little more advanced. If you are doing some public speaking, I recommend really practicing being in your body. It's very common as you walk up on the stage for people to get a little nervous and especially to feel all that energy coming their way and to pop out of their body. And if you do that, you'll notice that you really can't speak effectively. You're just kind of like, blah, blah, blah, blah. And you're not doing very well. Eventually you'll sink back in, hopefully, but just practice, really, having some amusement and being present in the body when you start, and you'll notice that you can skip over that whole awkward phase at the beginning of your presentation. Another advanced practice that you can do is you can start learning a sport just with your awareness. And what I mean by this is that you can think of something you're wanting to do, and without even going and practicing, just imagine that you're in your body and that you're going through and you're doing that sport. So maybe it's tennis. You just practice in your mind; practice I'm in my body; I'm playing tennis. It feels good. Here's what I'm doing. And do that before you go try it for the first time. And you'll be surprised because you'll be quite a bit better at it than you should be given that you haven't actually practiced in your physical body. So just a little trick. And of course, as you're getting each piece of your awareness, you're getting that base-level fitness up, you're going to notice more and more benefits. So definitely stick with the program and keep going until you've got all 12 of these in those six basic areas, and you're going to notice that you just feel so much better, and you're going to be able to really utilize everything that you learned here. But, even more importantly, you're going to be able to utilize all that new information that you're learning, and your spiritual growth will just advance so much more quickly. Now we're also going to... We're going to shift today into the second part of this phase. So the second part of this phase has to do with your energy body awareness. So remember I said that oftentimes we just think we're physical, but actually there's a physical part of your body; there's an energy part of your body. And if you don't know this, you tend to limit your abilities. You tend to not shoot for quite as high as you could go if you understood your own energy abilities. Now you'll also notice that if you are good at energy work things start to happen really easily. So you'll just notice that you've got synchronicities happening. Things are lining up for you. The people you need are coming to you; the situations are opening up. This has to do with that you're using your energy body and your physical body together in a collaborative way. So that there's no magic to this; there's no luck to this. It's just a matter of understanding you've got a physical and an energy body and learning how to use them together. So let's take the first step today in doing that. Let's take that first step of self-assessment with energy, and let's just try it out. So what I want you to do right now is we're going to just work with feeling energy. So if you've done this before, great; just do it again with me. If it's brand new to you, you're going to really love it; it's exciting. And just, you're going to put your hands together like this and let yourself begin to feel energy between your hands. And I tend to move my hands a little closer, a little further away. You're just imagining that there's a ball of energy that's building up between your hands. And I want you to just notice what does that feel like for you? And you can try to just close your eyes and see how that changes your awareness. Did it get stronger? Did it get weaker with the eyes closed? And again, just notice what you feel, and then go ahead and open your eyes again, and notice if it's stronger with your eyes open. A lot of times it's actually stronger with eyes open. Now I want you to set that energy to 20% of the capacity that you can feel and notice how that changes things. And start to notice what is it that you're feeling there? Are you feeling pressure? Are you feeling like a little heat or tingling? I'm feeling pressure. A lot of people feel heat, or you might just feel kind of a knowingness. Like I know there's something there. Now turn this up to 50% of your capacity. And just notice if that ball gets bigger. Very good, and you can continue to move your hands, or maybe they're just resting on that ball. And then bring it up to 80% of your capacity. And then bring that ball up to a 100% of the capacity for you to create that energy ball between your hands, at a 100% capacity. So right here, right at this limit, right at the edge of where you're able to reach with your energy, just notice how that feels. When you're at your limit, does it feel good? Does it feel like overflowing? Or maybe it feels stressful or even scary. And now I want you to go to 200% of your capacity. So just double the amount of energy you're able to feel between your hands. Very good. And now try try 10X, 10 times as much energy as you're usually allowed to feel between your hands. How about 100 times as much energy? Whoa, so that's really starting to build. Very good. And then just smile and think about how you are limiting yourself, your understanding of how much energy you have, when actually there's an infinite amount of energy that you're capable of feeling and interacting with. So now just think of something you want to do with this ball of energy. I recommend just put it right into your solar plexus, right in the middle of your body. Might as well use it since you built it up. And just notice, as you do that, can you feel that change in your body? Can you feel that dissipating out of your hands, maybe moving around the body a little bit? Just notice what you notice there. All right, great. So I hope you could really feel that; like I said most people feel pressure, tingling, or heat. Those are the big ones, but you might have felt something else too. It's a very easy way to feel energy. So I wanted you to get that assessment. Can you feel energy? And I wanted you to look at that habit of setting limits energetically as if it was a physical thing. So that 100% limit doesn't apply to nonphysical objects. May apply in the physical world, but when you're dealing with energy, there's really no limits. Okay, great. So we're going to continue into that, the next few phases here. So we just did phase one; I'm sorry, we just did step one. And that success formula for your awareness. And step one is looking at your habits and building that kind of self-assessment. Step two, which is tomorrow, we're going to do an easy success. And for the easy success I'm going to have you go in and feel energy as it's moving through your body. So this is something that feels really good. And then on the next day, on the Challenge Day, we're going to work on how do you actually use that energy that you're feeling in your body to make little changes in your body. Okay, that's the Challenge Day. Now on the Wow Day, the fourth day, this one's really fun. What we're going to do is we're going to actually take your energy body that's normally directly inside the physical body and you're going to kind of slide it out of your physical body. And again, this is totally safe. We're just working on your relationship. And when you're apart, you can get a really clear sense of your relationship and that sense of your energy body and physical body and heal that relationship and make it better. And we're going to bring you back in in a nice clean and powerful way. And that's how we're going to wrap up. That'll be that final Wow Day for this. So thank you so much. And go ahead and practice today. That's the fifth step is practice. And what I want you to do is think about either is there somebody you could teach this energy ball to? Because if you can teach this, it'll be much more powerful for you. And if you do teach it somebody, start to share a little bit; maybe try your hands around each other; experiment with feeling energy. Now, if you're not comfortable with that, you're just working on your own, see if you can feel energy around different objects or maybe around a plant or maybe around one of your... An animal that's nearby. So try something like that. Now the sixth step is always sharing. So go ahead and share your information below. What was your experience? How did it feel? What does energy feel like for you? And if you have a big story about how you felt energy in the past, feel free to share that too. So thanks so much and I will see you tomorrow.

LESSON 16: Feeling Energy In Your Body

--------------------
Meditation: Day 16 - Feeling Energy In Your Body
--------------------

Hello everyone, I’m Jeffrey Allen. Welcome to day 16 of your body awareness challenge. This is your easy success day of your energy body awareness, and today I want you to feel energy flowing throughout your body. So we can start the same place we started yesterday. Right now just feel some energy starting to build between the palms of your hands. Just let that energy build as I talk a little bit more. Today, we’re going to take this energy ball and I’m going to have you moving it through different places in your body and really energizing your body. And this is fantastic for any time you want to have a little extra shine, whether it’s work or relationships or just your play day. Any day you want to be a little extra shiny, a little more energetic. So you might actually want to do this every day. Right now, just keep feeling that energy ball building up and go ahead and have your awareness right behind your eyes, and breathe your eyes closed. And with that nice bright energy ball, I want you to draw that ball up one of your arms, just letting it travel easily and naturally up the arm, and feel it going across your shoulders and down the other arm and in between your hands again. And notice how do your arms And shoulders feel different just from that simple exercise. And again, let that energy ball build between your hands. And let it move up one of your arms to your elbow. And feel that elbow starting to charge up with that energy from that ball. Feel it getting brighter, more relaxed and easier. And feel that ball moving up into the shoulder. and feel your shoulder absorbing some of that light. You can keep working with your hands and know that this energy ball actually never runs out of energy. Just feel it infusing energy into your shoulder, your shoulders light and mobile, and feel it move across to your other shoulder and let that energy move right inside the shoulder, filling that whole joint, that bright buoyant energy. Feel it moving down that arm into the elbow, charging up that elbow with energy, and then let that ball move back between your hands again. And notice again, how does your body feel different? Now take that energy ball and go ahead and push it right into your stomach area and feel each of your organs beginning to light up with this energy. and give them each permission to absorb as much of this energy as they need. So feel your liver and your gallbladder, all the organs in your abdomen, drawing that light directly into the organs. Feel that ball of light as it moves up into your chest. Notice how your chest feels as it’s filling full of light. And feel your lungs getting easier to move. as that light infiltrates all the way into the lungs. Feel that light in your heart. Feel it in your throat. And really feel the energy charging up, becoming brighter and easier in your body. Breathe. Let that energy ball move down between your hands again. Feel the pressure, the tingling, or the heat. And now take that ball. and move it right in through your forehead. And really feel this energy as it’s washing your brain, clearing out your ears and your eyes. Feel it bringing more light and motion into your nose and your mouth. And feel your whole head relaxing with this bright energy. Now feel that energy ball as it moves slowly down your spine. Notice each vertebrae absorbing that light, subtly aligning, recharging, rejuvenating your spine. Feel each vertebrae as that ball moves all the way down your spine, charging you up. Let that energy ball divide into two parts, one energy ball in each hip, charging up, energizing those joints. And feel those energy balls moving down your legs, charging up your knees and your feet. And feel that energy radiating out of your feet all the way along your skin and your whole body. Feel your skin and your hair getting all that bright new light. And feel that energy continuing to radiate out from you into that space around your body, into your aura. Feel your whole body being inside a bright, beautiful ball of light. And feel that light reflecting right back into your heart. Feel that pulse of your heart, those waves of light pulsing out from you, out from your heart, into the world. Let your whole body feel bright and light and full of energy. Have your awareness right behind your eyes. Notice your breath. And when you’re ready, open your eyes. Great job. Welcome back. I hope you’re feeling really energized. It’s a very simple but very powerful exercise to move energy through your body. You’ll notice you get a lot of extra mobility along with that energy too. Now, if you want to deepen this awareness today, see how long you can maintain this energized feeling. And during the day, if there’s any place that feels a little tired or that needs a lift, just send that energy ball into that area and let it absorb. And let this be really fun. This is not serious work. We’re just playing with energy. Let it be fun. Let it be easy today. And I would love to hear your experience. Just how did your body feel when it was all energized? And did you have any surprises today during this exercise? So please share that. And I look forward to seeing you tomorrow.

========================================

LESSON 17: Releasing Stuck Energy

--------------------
Meditation: Day 17 - Releasing Stuck Energy
--------------------

Hello everyone, I’m Jeffrey Allen. Welcome to day 17 of your body awareness challenge. This is your challenge day for your energy body awareness. And where yesterday we started to work with that energy ball to put energy into your body, today we’re going to work with how do you get energy out of the body. So where there’s something that’s stuck or where there’s an issue, how do you get that energy out? So right now go ahead and start to build that energy ball between your hands. We’re going to work with that energy ball today. And this exercise we’re doing today is really great if you’re wanting to get rid of stubborn issues in the body. And it’s also great for shifting stuck energy before it becomes a problem. And this is really ideal, is to work with your energy body to move the energy before it becomes a problem in the physical body. Okay, great. So hopefully you’re feeling that energy ball building up between your hands. Should be getting very easy now. We’ve done this a few days. Have your awareness right behind your eyes and notice your breath. As that energy builds between your hands, pick a point on the breath and breathe your eyes closed. Now think of one area in your body that you’ve been feeling stuck or you’ve been feeling a little low energy. And let that energy ball move into that area in your body right now. As this area begins to fill with light, notice the places where the light doesn’t go. If you’re visual, you might see a little darker area, or you might just feel an area that’s not as bright, may even be a little unconscious. Whatever it is for you, notice where the light doesn’t go. And congratulations, you found an energy block. And just be curious about this. How does this energy block feel? Does it have a message? Where did it come from? Is it yours or someone else’s? Are there any judgments or frustrations held in that block? Be amused and keep breathing. Let yourself gently pull that energy block out of the body. Imagine you’re reaching in with your hand. You’re grabbing that energy block. and just gently pulling it out of the body and setting it free. See and feel light from that energy ball moving in all around that block. Feel it getting loose and just easily releasing and letting go. Let that energy block completely release from your body. Feel that area continuing to fill in with light. until any shadows are completely gone in that area. Great. And feel that energy ball between your hands again. And this time, ask your body to tell you one area that needs your attention. Maybe something you don’t know about yet. And let that energy ball move into this area where your body wants attention. And feel it filling up that area with light. Again, let your awareness notice where the light doesn’t go. Any area that’s darker or stuck or unconscious. And just be curious. What is this energy block about? Why did your body want you to look right here? And also notice, is this energy block your information or somebody else’s information? How can you benefit? from clearing this energy right now. Be amused and breathe. Let yourself gently pull this energy block away from the body. Just reach in, pick it up, see light all around it. As you gently pull, feel it getting loose, feel it releasing, and letting go. Let that energy release completely from your body. Feel that area filling in with light until there’s no dark areas, no shadows, no unconscious energy. Great. Feel that energy ball again between your hands and think of one healing challenge that you have with your body that you’ve actually given up on, something you’ve decided that it’s just not going to get better. send that energy ball into that area or areas of your body. Feel those areas filling up with this bright light. And notice where the light doesn’t go. Any areas that are a little darker or stuck or unconscious. And just be curious, where did this energy block come from originally? Why is this block in your body? Be amused. And just notice and begin to release any judgments or frustrations that are held in this area in the body. Notice the energy where you gave up on this issue as unsolvable. Breathe. And just gently reach into the body with your hand. Just imagine you’re pulling away that energy block. Any judgments, any despair. Just pulling all those energies out of your body. Move that energy ball all around it. See the light penetrating all the way around. As you gently pull, feel it getting loose. Feel it releasing. And finally, feel it letting go. Let all that stuck energy completely release from your body. And continue filling in with light. So there’s no dark or unconscious areas. And notice your breath. Smile. Be right behind your eyes. Stretch. And open your eyes. Welcome back. Great job. I hope you noticed how powerfully… You can heal your body with energy and how easy it is to do that. You just have to look with amusement and clarity and let the energy move. Now keep in mind that energy moves really easily in both directions. So it’s easy to clear energy and it’s also easy to congest your energy if you’re not aware. So sometimes people get discouraged if they move something out like today and then a week later, a year later, there’s something similar back. And your energy body is much like your physical body in that way. You know, I wish I could take a shower that was so good that I would never need to take a shower again. But that’s unrealistic. So the same goes for your energy body. It requires maintenance and regular cleaning. So if you ignore your energy body long enough, you may attract some of those same energies back into your body. If this happens, it’s actually no problem or no failure on your part. You just clear them again, just like every day you take another shower because you’re wanting to keep your body clean. So it’s the same thing with your energy body. If you want to deepen this awareness today, just notice any time when you’re feeling stuck or low energy and look for the energy block behind it. And just imagine you’re reaching in, releasing that energy block, and then filling that area full of light. And you give yourself maybe a minute or so to adjust after that. And just notice how easy it is and how much it improves your day. And remember, you can do this with your eyes open too. So you can do this anytime. You can be doing something else and do this energy work quickly and easily with your eyes open. All right, so I’d love to hear from you. What energy was stuck or blocked in your energy? And how did it feel different when you cleared it and energized that area? So thanks so much for today, and I look forward to seeing you tomorrow.

========================================

LESSON 18: Synchronizing Your Energy Body

--------------------
Meditation: Day 18 - Synchronizing Your Energy Body
--------------------

Hello everyone, I’m Jeffrey Allen and welcome to day 18 of your body awareness challenge. This is your wow day, so my goal today is give you some experience that you didn’t know was possible to really shift your awareness. And today I want to do that by giving you this deep sense that your body is perfect for you. So building up on what we’ve been doing so far. And I want you to feel that your physical body and energy body are completely synchronized with each other. Now, how we’re going to do that is we’re going to actually move your energy body independently from your physical body. And this might feel a little bit funny at first, but just go with it. It’s really fun. And once you get used to it, you’ll find that it helps you bring your body a little bit more deeply in sync with your energy body. And this exercise is really great for anytime you want to get more efficient, if you feel like you’re kind of using or wasting your energy, it helps you have higher energy levels in your body when things are really in sync. It also helps you know what your body needs before it actually needs it, which is great. So let’s begin. Relax and notice your breath. Have your attention right behind your eyes. And on your next inhale, breathe your eyes closed. Feel your presence strongly in your body. Feel that rhythm of your breath and your heartbeat. And in your mind’s eye, Look down at your hands right now. Just notice your physical hands. And notice your energy body hands too. Looks like your physical hands with a little light in the center of your palms. And stretch your physical hands open wide. And relax. And without moving your physical hands, stretch your energy hands open wide. And relax. And very gently move your physical arms and let them come to rest. And then without moving your physical arms, move your energy body arms. And lift up your left arm and your energy body. Lift up your right arm of your energy body. And then relax. And now imagine you’re moving one of your legs without actually moving your leg. Just move that energy body leg independently from the physical. And move your other leg as well without moving your physical leg. Now bend your physical body to the side. Just lean over to one side and come back to straight. And now without moving your body, lean your energy body over to the side and bring your energy body back up straight. Have your awareness firmly anchored in your energy body and go ahead and stand up with your energy body and let yourself move around until you’re facing your physical body and looking back at your body and smile and let go of any resistance or judgment that you might have and acknowledge that you don’t always agree with your physical and energy bodies. See your physical body there like an old friend and have a nice laugh about it and apologize if needed. And from this perspective, looking back at your physical body, take a few moments to have any other conversation you want from your energy body to your physical body. Now look across directly into your own eyes. Feel yourself right behind the eyes and your energy body and very easily let your awareness switch. Be behind your physical body eyes looking out at your energy body. Notice where your energy body is different from your physical. It’s usually an idealized version of you. And admire your energy body and give your physical body permission to look just like that energy body. Look into your eyes again so you’re right behind your physical body eyes, looking out at your energy body, and very easily let your awareness switch so you’re behind your energy body eyes, looking back at your physical body. From this perspective, admire your physical body. Notice that it’s the perfect vehicle for you and a great reflection of you in the physical world and feel the rhythm of your energy body as its own pulse and vibration may be faster than your physical body. Look in your own eyes again and then have your awareness right behind your physical body eyes. And now with your right hand, I want you to reach out as if you’re shaking hands with your energy body and gently grab your hand and then swing your energy body back into your physical body. Kind of like bringing a dancer in close to your body. Feel your energy body and your physical body together. Feel that rhythm of your physical body, your blood and your breath. And feel that rhythm of your energy body as well. Notice if your physical body and energy body are in harmony or if they’re out of tune. And let them adjust until they’re perfectly tuned to each other. As you feel them coming into alignment. Be grateful that you have an energy body. Be grateful that you have a physical body. Smile with your physical body. Smile with your energy body. And when you’re ready, open your eyes. Great. Welcome back. I hope you got a new perspective and a new awareness of your energy body and physical body today. If you want to deepen this awareness today, just be aware of moving your energy body as you move your physical body. So it’s fun to move them independently as well, where you move one limb without actually moving it. But if you practice moving them in perfect sync, it’s really powerful. So as you walk, feel yourself moving your energy body first and then moving your physical body with it. So they’re in perfect sync as you move your body. Great. So it’s always really powerful to share. I hope you’ve been sharing every day. What did your energy body look like when you looked out at it? And what was your rhythm? Was it faster than your physical body or slower or different in some way? And always, I love to hear if there are any surprises or any wow moments that you had. And so please share that. And I look forward to seeing you tomorrow. Thanks a lot.

LESSON 19: Energy Body Applications & Balancing Body Advice

--------------------

Hi, everybody; I'm Jeffrey Allen, and welcome to Day 9 of your Body Awareness Challenge. So, congratulations; you've finished the Energy Body Activation portion. First, we did a little self-assessment, so you could feel that energy is real for you, and then we worked with an easy exercise of putting more energy into your body, so you can really feel that vitality and strength that you have when you have lots of energy. Then we did something a little more challenging where we worked on how do you pull energies out of the body that are things that are causing problems or just energies that you don't need anymore. Finally, we worked with your Wow Day where you took your energy body awareness and separated out from the physical body, kind of held hands with yourself there and healed that relationship between the energy body and the physical body. And this is really important because that separation or that competition we see sometimes between the energy body and the physical body can cause a lot of problems. So, now you've already got your activation for your energy body; even if you slept through the exercises or didn't get everything, you've got the activation. All you need to do now to continue moving forward with that awareness is practice and sharing. So, first, you can use your new awareness to just notice when you need a break before you really need that break. So, instead of overworking yourself and getting to the point of exhaustion, you can notice your energy body and feel like, oh, I need to take a break now instead of when I'm totally worn out. You can also use this energy body awareness for self-diagnosis, so going into the body, finding out what's wrong in the body, and then doing a little healing work to clear things for yourself. It's also fun to do this exercise where you're moving your energy arms sort of independently from your physical arms; this is a good exercise for relaxing and getting out of any stress that you're in. But ideally, you want to keep those in sync; you want to keep your energy body and physical body in sync. So, the energy healing can be very powerful at times. I had a client that came in, got a series of energy healings, and had a fist-sized tumor, a fibroid tumor, that passed out of her without any pain. So, things like this are possible although I would say, it's not the norm. You don't want to give up your physical Western medicine and just adopt energy medicine. You want to actually use those together, and I'll talk about that in just a moment. Of course, you can use this energy healing with other people as well. And having your energy in sync with your physical body is great for your relationships, it's great for your love life, it's great for giving hugs. You can hug people with your energy arms and your physical arms. I had a really powerful example of this when I met Mel Gill, who's just a wonderful man, and after we got done talking, we had this great conversation, he gave me this big hug, and I could just feel his energy in the hug. And it wasn't until the next day when somebody mentioned to me that he had one arm removed when he was younger, due to an accident. And I didn't even know because I could swear I felt both arms hugging me because he was so present with his energy body that I didn't even notice the physical body; so kind of fun. Today, I want to do one final balancing between your energy body and physical body. And this has to do with what I mentioned before; this has to do with your own healing. So, it's really important to use energy healing when it's needed and physical healing when it's needed. These are not competing things, and you know this from other things in your life, that oftentimes very different things complement each other very well. Maybe you really like pizza and beer, or pasta and wine, or a great salad and some great salad dressing to go with it; different things, but you combine 'em together and it feels better, it works better, for you. And healing is like this too. So, with energy healing, basically what you're doing is you're adjusting your momentum of where you're headed with your body, and so this is really good for preventative things and kind of long term trends. With physical or Western medicine, with surgeries, and doctors, and drugs and so on, what you're doing is you're adjusting your position where you're at right now, and this is super important sometimes; it's very effective if you have trauma or you have something that's important to change or shift that position right now. Now, of course, you can use these both together to get even more powerful results. And you want to keep in mind when you're listening to the experts that you know, and from each of these areas, that they probably don't know that much about the other one. It's like, if I'm building my house, I'm going to need an electrician for doing the electricity and a plumber for doing the plumbing. They're experts in their field. If I ask the plumber about electricity, he's probably going to tell me, stay away from it, it's dangerous. And if I ask the electrician about water, he'll probably say the same thing; stay away from that water, it's dangerous. But that's why you ask the expert that has the information you need. Same thing goes for healing energy. So, if you talk to an energy healer and they tell you, never take any medicine, all medicine is poison, surgery is bad, don't listen to that person. If you hear a doctor giving you advice and saying, oh, all energy medicine is crazy and it doesn't work, or it's harmful, don't listen to that person. So, listen to their advice they have in their expertise 'cause that's what they're really good at. And keep in mind that they're just trying to help you, but if they don't know about something, they'll probably steer you away from it. All right, so let's do a little exercise to help you kind of balance that in yourself and know how to how to handle that different advice. All right, so, go ahead and get relaxed and when you're ready, close your eyes. Now, imagine one situation, past, present, or future, where you need advice about your body. You have an important decision that you want to make about your health. Imagine you have experts from two different teams giving you advice. The physical body medical team and the energy body healing team. Notice the advice that you're getting from the physical body team about medicine, surgery. Now, notice the advice that you're getting from the energy body team. It could be about healing or an alternative healing method. And notice any conflicting advice: you have to do this, or you can't do this. These look like opposing teams and you're supposed to choose sides; which expert do you listen to? Now, let's look at it a little differently. Just notice there's one team of people, the team of people that want to help you get better. Notice all the positive advice coming from their experience and their knowledge where they're saying, here's what I understand, here's how I can help you. And let all this positive advice in. Now, notice all the negative advice coming from fear or lack of knowledge where they're saying, don't do anything except what I tell you, or everything else is stupid, crazy, foolish, or dangerous. And let all this negative advice float right by. Adjust your filter so that all positive advice comes in with is accepted into your space with gratitude and consideration and all negative advice is dismissed with love and compassion. Someone is just expressing their frustration, and it's not helpful to you. Give yourself permission to take all that works for you, and leave the rest behind, and really thank everyone on your team for helping you, for doing the best that they can do. Fill up with gratitude for all this assistance, and be grateful that you know how to filter the positive advice from the negative advice. And know that that decision belongs to you. Give yourself a deep breath, smile, and open your eyes. So, welcome back. I hope that you enjoyed that simple technique of changing from two teams with conflicting advice to just one team with positive and negative advice. And it's really helpful if you just listen to the positive and dismiss the negative; you'll find it's very easy to let everybody help you. To deepen this awareness also notice today, where you're giving positive advice and where you're giving negative advice. Are you speaking from your experience in helping people, or are you speaking from maybe ignorance or some fear? And just notice that and be amused, and try to turn up the positive and turn down the negative a little bit. As you're sharing your experience today, think about one unique way that you would like to use your body awareness to improve something in your life right now. So, please share that, and then you can try it out tomorrow in the Do It Yourself Integration Day. Thanks so much for today, and again, congratulations on completing your Energy Body Activation, and I look forward to seeing you tomorrow.

LESSON 20: Body Awareness Integration

--------------------
Meditation: Day 20 - Body Awareness Integration
--------------------

Hi everybody, I’m Jeffrey Allen and welcome to day 20. Congratulations, it’s the final day of your body awareness challenge. And this is your integration day, so today you can rest or catch up or do the do -it -yourself practice meditation that we’re going to do in a moment. So if you really need to rest, that’s great. You can just stop now and I will see you tomorrow. If you need to catch up and missed a day, just go back right now and review that right now. And if you’re ready for the do -it -yourself practice today, I’ll get you started in the meditation, and then you’ll have eight minutes of silence to explore on your own, and then I’ll bring you out of the meditation at the end. So just let yourself explore and go wherever you want with your awareness. And this is a really great practice because personalizing the practice and letting yourself innovate and do what you want during that eight minutes helps it to really stick with you and stick in your brain much better. It kind of becomes part of you instead of just being something that you learned about. And of course, you can reuse this meditation anytime you want. It’s a great one for getting into your meditation space and working with your body awareness. Remember, for this meditation, I’ll get you started, and I’ll give you eight minutes of silence to explore on your own, and then I’ll help you come out at the end. So go ahead and notice your breath. Be present right behind your eyes. And breathe your eyes closed. Smile. And smile with your energy body, too. And think of something that you want to explore or change with your body awareness. Is there a place in your body that you want to focus? Or is there a question that you’d like to explore? When I count down from three, you’ll be there exploring on your own. Are you ready? Three. Feel your breath and your pulse and your posture. Feel your physical body’s rhythm and flow. Two, feel your energy flowing to your energy body’s rhythm as well. Feel that perfect synchronization between your physical body and your energy body. One, say hello to the area of your body that you want to explore. If you have a question, ask it now. Zero. Be in full awareness of your body’s answer now. Relax and let it in. Enjoy. Notice your breath, and notice one more insight before you come back. Notice your posture, stretch with your physical body and your energy body. Feel positive healing energy vibrating through your whole body right now. Be present right behind your eyes. Give yourself a deep breath, smile, and open your eyes. Welcome back. I hope you had a really beautiful and insightful meditation with your body. And I would love to hear what you did today. So please share something fun or surprising that you noticed and let me know what you did in your meditation today. And again, congratulations on completing phase two with your body awareness. Tomorrow we’ll be starting phase three, which is your mental awareness and enjoy your day. And I look forward to seeing you tomorrow.

Part 3: Mind-Awareness (Inner & Outer)

========================================

LESSON 21: Welcome to Mind Awareness
--------------------
<v ->Hi everyone; I'm Jeffrey Allen,</v> and welcome to day one of your Mind Awareness Challenge. And I know this would be really comfortable territory for you, and developing the mind awareness is really one of my favorite things to develop. And I feel lucky because I was always very good with a sharp mind. I excelled in academics, and I was great at mathematics and science, and I was recruited right out of high school to work with the US Department of Energy. So my mind always felt like it was very fast and very sharp, and I feel very lucky for that. But I have to say that having a fast mind but an unaware mind actually got me in a lot of trouble early on, and let me explain why. So when you have a fast mind but you're not aware of your own mind, you tend to feel like you're always right, and I definitely had that early on. I had that arrogance of thinking that because I can think fast, it means that my conclusions are right and that I know what I'm talking about. And over the years as I became more aware and developed my awareness, I realized that that's not true at all. Being fast with the mind is great, but being aware with the mind is much, much better because some other problems I noticed is I was also a fairly poor listener. I tended to be thinking about what I wanted to say next or thinking about the opinion or what was wrong with what they said instead of really just listening to the person. I also had a bit of a stubborn streak in me where once I got my mind set on something, it was hard for me to change and hard for me to let new information in. And I also noticed later on that as my awareness grew that there are times where having a fast mind but an unaware mind means it's very easy to delude yourself, and I've done this many times where I believed something was true. I tried to sell it and talk about it to all my friends, and in the end, it turns out it just wasn't true. It was just my mind, not my awareness, that was wanting it to be true. And I'm sharing this with you because, you know, you may have some of these same difficulties with your mind, and you might even wonder sometimes like, "Why do smart people do such dumb things?" You know, I'm a good example. I've done a lot of dumb things, but I'm a smart person, and the answer is really simple. The answer is about awareness. So you want to have a great mind, and you want to have a very aware mind, so you stop doing all those silly things. Now, an aware mind by comparison is usually very organized and very clear and really able to function in the present moment. So when you're aware, you're great at listening and you're not trying to filter or change everything that's coming in. You just sort of let the information come into your mind. And this means that you tend to be really good at learning and getting new information in. And oftentimes, you'll take the shorter route because you're able to listen a little bit better, and these are all benefits from having an aware mind. So how do we get there? Well, today we're going to start with the internal mind, and then we're going to follow up in the second part with the external mind. Now for the internal mind, we're going to start by, today, with doing a little self-assessment, and then we'll move into an easy exercise tomorrow where we're just learning how to turn down the mental noise. And this is so powerful because the noise is really what gets us in so much trouble. And then on the Challenge Day, we're going to go further, and I'm going to give you some exercises for getting in and getting rid of the mental fog, so that fogginess that makes it difficult to access all the potential in our mind, and this is really powerful. Now on the Wow Day, you're going to learn how to really focus your mind very easily. So these are the steps we're going to go through. Now, after finishing that with the internal mind, we're going to go into that external mind awareness, and you're going to learn how to listen really deeply with your mind to the world around you. So it's really fun. So for today, let's get started with that initial exercise, just that self-assessment of your internal mind. So just find a place where your eyes rest naturally, and just notice your breath. And when you're ready, just breathe your eyes closed, and be right behind your eyes. And right now, just begin to notice your mind. What are you thinking about right now? And have an intentional thought. So intentionally think about something with your work right now. And notice did the first thought that came to you feel happy or unhappy? And notice if there's a background story about work in general. And also notice when you think about work, is there any commentary in your mind, might be telling you about how it is or how it should be? Might be a little criticism or doubt, and just start to be aware of that background thoughts and that commentary in addition to your conscious thought. Good; now think about a good friend of yours. What are your first thoughts about this friend? Think about things you've done together and why you enjoy their company. And then, start to notice if there's any background thoughts as well. Is there a story you have about this friend? Are there any criticisms or doubts? And if there is a commentary, whose voice is that commentary in? And now, think about your opinion of your own mind. Do you feel like you have a fast mind or a slow mind? Do you feel like you have an aware mind or an unaware mind? When you think about your mind, what's the first thought that comes to mind? And then, notice any background story that you have about yourself. And again, notice if you have a commentary about your mind. And if you do, what does the voice sound like in that commentary? Is it you? Is it someone you know? Or is it just a voice? And now, just relax a little bit, and notice what else is happening in your mind right now. Is part of you thinking about this meditation and analyzing it? Are you thinking about something else, something in your day? And notice any other commentary or opinions or stories that are in your mind right now. And then, tune in and notice is there anything else happening in your mind that you're not aware of yet? Good; now just notice your presence right behind your eyes, and when you're ready, breathe, and open your eyes. Welcome back; good job. I hope you enjoyed exploring your background thoughts and you learned a little bit more about what's happening in your mind. Tomorrow, we're going to work on turning down the noise in the mind. And if you want to get some more practice today, just notice throughout your day, what are the background thoughts that are happening kind of unconsciously in the back of your mind? And I'd love it if you'd share any surprises that you had today, so something that was happening that was a surprise for you that was happening in your mind. Thanks so much for today, and I will see you tomorrow.

========================================

LESSON 22: Turning Down Mental Noise

--------------------
Meditation: Day 22 - Turning Down Mental Noise
--------------------

Hello everyone, I’m Jeffrey Allen. Welcome to day 22 of your Mind Awareness Challenge. This is your easy success day for your inner mind awareness. And what I want you to get today is that sense of having a peaceful and quiet mind. This is really great for everything because we’re happiest when our mind is quiet. And when we’re rested, we’re also ready for action. So if you’ve got a quiet mind, you’re ready to engage it anytime you need. We’ll be using visualization again in this meditation. And remember, it’s not important that you actually see what we’re doing. You can just as easily feel or hear or know what we’re doing. So I tend to say see, but any awareness is good. Just be happy with however it comes to you. So let’s begin. Focus on a point across the room where your eyes rest naturally. Have your attention right behind your eyes. And breathe your eyes closed. Have that same relaxed awareness with your eyes closed. And gently move your awareness back until it’s in the center of your head. Today, we’re going to imagine this space in the center of your head as a room where you go to think. Just feel this room around you and start to notice the lights coming up. And begin to see and feel what’s happening in this room in the center of your head. Take a look around this room right now and notice what’s there. Have you been living here? Or does it look abandoned? Is it clean and organized? Or is it difficult to see? Give yourself permission to see all the information that’s here in this room in the center of your head. Notice the boxes that are full of all your old thoughts and ideas. Everything that you’re keeping in case you need it again. And just notice if you really need these now. And notice all the piles of recordings that you have of what other people have told you. And right now, just let yourself listen to all the advice that you’ve ever received. And then decide, do you really need all this advice in the center of your head. And notice any worn-out records. Those old thoughts or worries that you’ve played over and over again. How many of these do you have? And do you want to keep playing them forever? Now see all the albums of your memories in this room, full of all the pictures from your past. And as you look through these, just notice how many of these are important and how many of them are even real? And just feel all this information that’s in the center of your head. And just notice, is there room left for any new thoughts or ideas? Give yourself permission now to take away anything that you don’t really need. You can always get it back, but do you really need it right now? So notice your piles of old thoughts again. And just take the ones that you don’t need and put them outside this room. Just pick them up and put them outside the door. Your mind will put them somewhere safe. So you can always access them again later, but you don’t need them right now. Notice all your broken records again. Those old thoughts and worries which keep replaying in your mind. And if it feels right, put them all outside of this room. And let your mind put them somewhere else. And notice everyone’s opinions again. Everything somebody said about you or said about something else. And if you’re ready, put everyone else’s opinions outside this room. Just notice how much quieter it’s getting already. And now let go of any unneeded memories. Any photos of old moments, whether they’re real or imagined. And know you can always access them later, but consider moving them all out for now. And let this room be all clear, leaving you room to think. Just breathe. And notice if there are any people who are with you in the center of your head. And look around in the corners, hiding behind any furniture. And bring all those people out where you can see them right now. And if you have people in the center of your head, just notice, do you know these people? What do they want from you? Do they want some information or communication? Maybe some safety? Did you invite them or did they invite themselves? And look around again. Just notice anyone else hiding and bring them out in front of you to be seen. And smile and tell everyone there that you’re changing the rules for this room. Only you are allowed in the center of your head. Just open the door and usher everyone out of your head. Breathe and notice how good that feels. And when everyone has left, close the door and admire your new space. Give yourself permission to enjoy a clean, quiet, and peaceful room just for you in the center of your head. As you look around, make any changes that you like to this room. You can make it bigger or warmer or brighter. Feel free to decorate it any way that you please. Really own this space 100 percent for you. Quiet place for your mind. Smile. Notice your breath. Notice how peaceful it is right here. Take one more deep breath and open your eyes. Welcome back. You did a great job. I hope you found that peaceful, quiet place in your mind and got it all cleaned up. And if you want to deepen this awareness today and do some home practice, I recommend that you notice today how different your mind feels. So you’re going to notice what’s not happening that was happening before, whether it’s those broken records or the old thoughts or judgments. Don’t think about it. Just relax and notice throughout the day. And of course, I’d love it if you shared because it really helps you integrate this information into your daily awareness. And I’d love to hear what was the biggest relief that you felt when you were clearing your mind? And what did the center of your headroom look like and feel like to you? Thanks so much for today, and I will see you tomorrow.

========================================

LESSON 23: Clearing Mental Fog

--------------------
Meditation: Day 23 - Clearing Mental Fog
--------------------

Hello everyone, I’m Jeffrey Allen. Welcome to day 23 of your mind awareness challenge. This is your challenge day for your inner mind awareness, and I’m going to stretch you a little bit today. I’m going to have you notice those thoughts that are just beyond your reach, and we’re going to find, you know, what’s lurking in your mind that you’re unaware of. Now this is really important because your unconscious thoughts create a mental fog, and they really limit your flexibility. Clearing them improves your mental freedom and your mental capacity. So let’s begin. Find a point across the room where your eyes rest naturally. Be right behind your eyes and focus on that point. On your next breath, breathe your eyes closed, maintaining that same awareness behind your eyes. Move your awareness into the center of your head and remember that room, that peaceful place for you in the center of your head begin to look around that room and notice how clean it is and admire your work that you did yesterday in clearing this room if you notice anything that doesn’t belong in this room right now simply clear it away good and in the center of your head create a ball of light blue energy between your hands this light will show you where something is invisible to you Begin to shine this light around the room and see or feel the blue light reflecting back to you off the walls and the floor and the ceiling. And notice where it doesn’t reflect back. Any areas that are white or gray or even black. These areas are hidden from your casual awareness. They’re areas of your mind where you’re not usually allowed to explore. So of course today we’re going to explore those areas and have fun. So focus on one hidden area right now. One area where the blue light doesn’t reflect back to you. Decide to explore this area without falling asleep. Just smile. Be curious and amused. And walk slowly and gently into that area now. Notice that foggy, sleepy, unconscious energy that’s here, focus on your blue light and keep walking forward deeper and deeper into this hidden area. If you find yourself going unconscious, just be amused and follow my voice. You’re headed for the very center of this unconscious fog. Just keep going, keep going deeper. You’re almost there. Let’s keep going and step into the clear area at the center of this fog. Notice the blue light reflecting all around you. You can see or feel clearly again. And notice what was hiding in this fog. Is it a person or a scene from your past? What is it that you didn’t want to see? Just breathe and be aware. Whatever it is, let that blue light shine, illuminating this area fully right now. It’s okay. You’re completely safe right here. With this blue light, reclaim this area of your mind. See the light shining through and releasing all the foggy energy around this area. And let it shine until you can see all the way back into the center of the room. As that fogginess clears completely, make your way back to the center of the room and notice how your blue light shines easily into this area right now. See it reflecting back to you and know that you’ve reclaimed this area of your mind. Very good. Now let’s try an easy one. Feel that blue energy ball again and think of one decision that you need to make soon. Something small, something large, it doesn’t matter. And with that decision in mind, shine the blue light around this room and notice where it doesn’t reflect back. Any white or gray or dark spots where you don’t see that blue light. And without moving into these areas, just turn up the blue light of this energy ball and shine it into these areas. Let it shine through the fog. Easily clearing it away. And notice what is it that you aren’t seeing about this decision. Let that awareness come easily now and later today. Keep shining the blue light until this room is completely clear for this decision. Great. Focus on your breath again. Be right behind your eyes. Stretch and open your eyes. Welcome back. I hope you’re still awake. And if you are, that’s great because you made it. You survived your challenge day and you move some unconscious energy and have a little more freedom right now in your mind. And if you want to deepen this awareness today, I recommend that you use this blue energy ball one more time today to see something that’s invisible to you. It doesn’t have to be a mental block. You can use this for finding lost objects, seeing missed perspectives, or understanding situations that are confusing for you. It’s a really fun and versatile tool. And a few tips. If it’s a deep thing that you’re trying to get through that’s very unconscious, you want to go into it to the center and then clear the light from the center out. If it’s something casual or kind of shallow, just shine the blue light into it and through it. Now, I tend to move my physical arms and my hands when I’m in meditation, and you can do that, or you can just move your energy arms instead. It’s just a personal preference. Both work great. And I recommend repeating this exercise anytime you’re facing a big decision. These hidden areas are almost always where we get ourselves into trouble or repeat our old and frustrating patterns. Now, I’d love to hear what the experience was like for you, so please share how did the blue energy ball work for you today? And what did you see that was previously invisible to you? Thanks so much for today, and I will see you tomorrow.

LESSON 24: Organizing Your Mind

--------------------
Meditation: Day 24 - Organizing Your Mind
--------------------

Hello, everyone. I’m Jeffrey Allen. Welcome to day 24 of your mind awareness challenge. This is your wow day for your inner mind awareness. So I want to give you an experience that you didn’t know was possible. And to do that today, we’re going to start to organize your mind so that you can consciously decide what you’re thinking about and what you’re not thinking about. And this is a really fantastic tool for either turning everything off so you can have a little mental vacation, a little peace of mind. or for just focusing on which topics are really important for you in the current moment. So this is a fantastic tool. All right, let’s go ahead and dive in. Notice a point across the room where your eyes rest naturally. Have your awareness right behind your eyes. And breathe your eyes closed. And remember that room in the center of your head and be present there now. And as you look around, just notice if there’s anything that you need to clear out. Today, we’re going to create three additional rooms connected to this room. We’re going to make a work room, a relationship room, and a planning room. And this main room is just for your personal thoughts and relaxation. It’s possible your rooms already exist, or you might need to create them. But first, let’s see how you’re thinking right now. In that room, in the center of your head, let yourself think about work and money and creativity and your career. And notice, where do you go when you think about work? Is there a location, a desk, or somewhere in the center of your head? Or do you go to a different place or a different direction? And now think about your relationships, either personal relationships or your friendships. And notice, Where do you go when you think about relationships? Is there a direction or a place in the center of your head? Or perhaps you think about them everywhere. And now, let yourself think about plans for the future. What are you doing next? Where do you want to go? And as you engage in planning, where does your mind go? Is there a direction or a place in the center of your head? How do you organize this right now? Now let’s make a clear place for each one of these so you can access them more easily. Starting with work, I want you to find or create a new room for your work. First notice which direction is this room for you. To the side, in front, behind. And see the doorway between this room in the center of your head. and this room for your work. Notice what that doorway looks and feels like. What is the lighting and sound like in that room? And go into that room now. Notice how it feels. Is it happy? Is it productive? Or is it oppressive? And make any renovations you need right now so it’s a perfect workroom for you. Go ahead and bring in all your work thoughts. from the main room. Move everything about work and career and money and creativity into this new room and see it perfectly organized for you. Breathe. Now notice if there’s anything that’s not work -related that’s in this room and move it out right now. And notice if there’s anything else you want in here, any smell or sound or feeling, and just add it in. right now. Go back into the main room in the center of your head and notice where your relationship room is. Notice the doorway between the main room and your relationship room. And what does that room look like? What does it feel like? Let yourself go into that relationship room right now. Does this room feel happy or busy? Does it feel crowded or very open? Rearrange this room in any way that you like, making it the perfect relationship room for you. And begin to bring in all your relationship thoughts and ideas from the main room. Move them all into this new room and see it perfectly organized for you. Notice anything that’s not relationship related that’s in this room and move it out and add in anything else, any smells or sounds or feelings that you want in your relationship room. Just add them now. Now go back into your main room in the center of the head and notice one more room, the room where you’re planning for your future. Notice the direction of this room. Notice the doorway. And the light. And let yourself go into this planning room right now. As you look around, notice how this room is different from your workroom or your relationship room. And give yourself permission to change it in any way that you like. And move all your thoughts about planning from the main room into this room right now. Let everything become perfectly organized and efficient for you. And add in any other sounds or emotions or smells to this planning room that you like. And when it feels just right, come back into the main room. And from the center of this main room, notice all the space that you’ve created here. Notice how much more room there is for your private thoughts and relaxation. And notice in this main room if there’s any renovations, any changes you want to make. Just make them right now and admire your additions. And notice all the activity that’s still happening in these other rooms. Even though you’re not in these rooms consciously, they’re still working in your mind. So let that activity continue. And gently close the door to your planning room. Notice the shift. Gently close the door to your work room. And notice the shift. Now gently close the door on your relationship room and notice the change. Just be at peace in your private room, knowing that your mind is quietly keeping everything in motion behind those doors. Anytime you want, you can open those doors and access that information or go right into that room. For now, maintain this peaceful place, the center of your head. Take a deep breath. Smile and open your eyes. Welcome back. I hope you noticed the difference as you made those clear spaces in your mind. To deepen this awareness, you just want to practice it. Today, remember to open the door and enter the room that’s needed for your current activities. So don’t just take your body to work, but take your mind to work too. And don’t just take your body home or to your relationships. Take your mind there too. You’ll be surprised at how effective this technique is. A few more tips for you. This works equally well with your eyes open or your eyes closed. And you can create more rooms as needed. You can make it as simple or complex as you want. I recommend that you don’t let other people take over your rooms. So let yourself be the boss in your mind. And for that main room in the center, I don’t recommend having any people in there at all. Just have that place just for you. And if things start to feel a little unconscious in any of those rooms, remember you can always go in with that blue light and clear out that unconscious energy. I’d love to hear what your experiences were like today, so please share. What did your workroom and your relationship room and your planning rooms look like? And how did it feel to be able to open and close those doors consciously? Thanks so much for today, and I will see you tomorrow.

LESSON 25: Inner Mind Applications & Outer Mind Intro

--------------------

Hi everyone; I'm Jeffrey Allen, and welcome to day five of your Mind Awareness Challenge. You've just completed your activation for your inner mind awareness. And I have to say, I'm having so much fun making these meditations for you. Every time I make the meditation and record the meditation, I can see how much benefit you're getting out of it and how much fun you're having as you go through the exercises. So I just want to say that I'm really enjoying it. Thank you so much for being on this journey with me. And we're going through these six steps for awareness success with each of these different awarenesses. First step is that self-assessment that you did with your mind. Second step is that easy success where we went in and created that room in the center of your head and started to clear out those extra thoughts. Step two, is that Challenge Day where we went in and looked at where are you unconscious; where are the things that you're not able to see? And how do you move through that unconsciousness, that mental fog, and clear it out. So you have more room and more access to the kind of deeper, darker recesses of your mind. I don't mean that in a negative way. I just mean that in a hidden way 'cause we often hide things from ourselves. And then, of course, on day three, we did that Wow Day, where yesterday we were looking at how do you organize your thoughts? Can you put your different thoughts in different rooms and then consciously close and open those doors? And this is such a fantastic exercise. And I want to remind you too that as you go through these steps, you're building your activation. So, you don't have to remember everything that we did; you don't have to try to get it all perfect. You're putting all that activation in there, and by the end of 60 days, you're just going to have this enormous amount of interesting and amazing awareness that you can draw on as you need it. And you don't have to worry about it. You'll just pull out just the right tool, just the right awareness, when you need it. So, that's the goal. Now, of course, you've already done those four steps, so you have your activation with your inner mind awareness, but you do need to practice and to share to continue to build that awareness up. So I'm going to give you some good examples of ways that I like to practice with the inner mind awareness. And you can tell right away that, you know, having a fast mind and having an aware mind doesn't mean that you necessarily remember everything. So that's why I'm looking at my notes. I want to make sure that I give you all these applications, not just the ones that I can remember. So the first thing is that having an aware inner mind is really great for organizing your day. So, as you go about your day just remember to kind of open and close those doors to the information and the awareness that you need. So, if it's a relationship or work and so on. You don't have to go into meditation. You can just do this with your eyes open and just kind of notice what you're thinking and close that door or open another door. Now, this is also great for noticing what you need before you get into a crisis. So in the morning you might go into the center of headroom and just check each of those rooms and just notice is there anything that needs your attention in your relationship that you weren't aware of or maybe at work or maybe in your planning space? And if you check in in the morning with each of these you'll notice those before it becomes a problem. So this is really a good shortcut for you with time. Now, the blue energy ball is such an amazing tool because you can use this to see what's invisible to you whether it's something in your mind or even a lost object or a perspective that you're missing or something that's just kind of just beyond your thoughts. So I encourage you to play with this one. This is actually a really simple and easy tool to use. Again, you can do it with your eyes open and just imagine you're shining that blue light and revealing what's usually invisible to you. Now, there are some good body applications too. You can use these techniques to relax. You can use 'em to really get into the zone, if you're in physics or if you're in sports, in physical activity, and turn off everything else and let yourself just be in that silent place in the center of your head. It's very relaxing, it's very focused, and it's great for sports. Also, hanging out in the center of your head tends to give you a little bit different perspective. You tend to just kind of drift a little bit and let things in that maybe wouldn't have got your attention, wouldn't have got your awareness otherwise. Now, relationships are a great place to use your inner mind awareness because the biggest complaint I hear, when I'm listening to people talk about their relationships, is that their partner is always thinking about work. And I have this problem too sometimes. And what I've learned is that, if you learn to just close that door on the work and then open the door on relationships, that it really helps make that transition. And I also had a problem where I noticed that center of the head space, that main room, was my work room. So I was having a hard time ever leaving that room. So if you have that problem, remember, put it out in that separate room. Now, when I do this, when I'm able to do this, my wife, Hisami, is very sensitive to energy, and she notices right away and she really lights up when I actually show up and I tune into our relationship and I'm there and I'm present, instead of secretly thinking about work. So I highly recommend this in your relationships. Now, with work applications you can use this too to let your projects continue going while you're doing something else. So, just get the energy moving and just see it continuing without your conscious thoughts. This is actually a really a great way to work. Now, it's also good for work if you just want to clear any distractions. Just go directly into that workroom. All right, great, so you're doing really good so far. I just want to just say thank you for being with me again on this journey. I'm having so much fun, and I hope you are too. And now we're going to transition out of the inner mind and into your outer mind awareness. And today we're going to start with a simple exercise where you're just starting to become aware of your external mind awareness. And you're going to just notice what's happening around you. And this is really important because if you want to get along well in the world, you have to be aware of your environment. You have to be aware of what's external, not just what's internal, because when we're really unaware of the world, we tend to take the difficult road at times. And we tend to, you know, get a little surprised and a little let down by the things that happen because we're not really paying attention. So we're going to work on that in the next few days because when we're aware of the world the opposite thing happens, and we tend to be in the right place at the right time and have that extra synchronicity. So being aware of your external mind is really powerful. All right, so let's go ahead and dive in. We're going to start with a simple meditation. So, just be right behind your eyes, and notice your breath, and close your eyes. Let your awareness move into that room in the center of your head, and imagine you're having a conversation with a friend. And let yourself participate and observe yourself at the same time. And imagine your friend is telling you a story about something that's really important to them. And as they're talking, notice, are you listening intently or are you half listening as you process something that they said before? Maybe you're thinking about what you want to say next and looking for a break so you can start talking. Or maybe you're thinking about something completely different, that's more interesting to you, and just notice how much attention does your friend really have? A hundred percent of your attention, 50%, 10%? Just be amused. And now imagine it's your turn to talk, and you're telling a story to your friend. Where is your attention, as you talk? Are you focused on yourself? Are you focused on your story? Are you focused on your friend's response? If your friend gets a little bored with your story, do you notice? Are you worried about your friend's impression? Just notice how much attention is on you and how much of your attention is on your environment. Now imagine that your friend interrupts or disagrees, and just notice how you respond. Are you defensive or frustrated or are you interested in hearing their opinion? Are you the kind of person that gives up your opinion easily and adopts other people's opinions? Or is it hard for you to change your mind? Just notice, when you're confronted, do you listen more or do you listen less to the people around you? So thank your friend for this imaginary conversation, and give yourself a deep breath, and open your eyes. Okay. Welcome back. Good job. I hope you got a little insight about how you usually respond and listen to people around you. And I encourage you today, as you go about your day, notice how you're listening to others. So, are you giving them your full attention or are you processing something else in your own mind? Either one is okay. Sometimes one is better than the other. I just want you to notice. So it's not about judging yourself or feeling bad, it's just about becoming aware, so you can consciously choose which one you're doing. You can choose to focus on the other person, or choose to focus on yourself. So, over the next few days we're going to really start working with that outer mind. So you're going to start learning how to really sense your environment. You're going to notice how to feel your own filter and how to change it. And you're going to notice how to listen into the big, big picture of what's going on on the planet. And this one's really fun. So thanks so much for joining me today, and I hope that you enjoyed the exercise, and I look forward to seeing you tomorrow. If you'd like to share something, please just share have you had any missed opportunities because you were not listening to your environment? So just share that story. Thanks again for today, and I'll see you tomorrow.

LESSON 26: Listening To Your Environment

--------------------
Meditation: Day 26 - Listening to Your Environment
--------------------

Hello, everyone. I’m Jeffrey Allen. Welcome to day 26 of your mind awareness challenge. This is your easy success day for your outer mind awareness. And today I want you to get a enhanced awareness of your environment. So you’ll be listening with your mind to your environment. And this is really great for feeling more present and adapting to situations easily and kind of reducing the surprises that you have in life. You’ll notice that if you’re aware of your environment, you can flow much more gracefully in your life. So let’s begin. Focus on a point. Cross the room where your eyes rest naturally. Have your awareness right behind your eyes. And notice your breath. When you’re ready, you can breathe your eyes closed, maintaining that same focus right behind your eyes. Let’s start by listening to your body. Notice your breath. Notice your heart and your pulse. And notice that gentle movement or rhythm in your body. And be completely present in your body. Let your awareness begin to stretch out from your body, feeling what’s all around you on all sides. Don’t think. Just let your awareness reach out and feel. Feel the area in front of you. Feel the area to your right and to your left. What do you feel around you right now? Notice the area behind you. Again, try to feel instead of think. Be aware of any objects that are behind you, in front of you, or beside you. And also notice, what does the energy feel like to you? Does it feel peaceful or crowded? What’s happening in your environment? Now feel one thing that you’re unsure of. Something just beyond your reach. Try to feel what it is. Without opening your eyes, just imagine that you’re opening your eyes and looking around you right now. What was it that you were unsure of? Can you see it now? What else do you notice? What else can you see? Now open your eyes and look around you. Notice how you did. Any objects or anything that you didn’t notice with your eyes closed? And begin with focusing with your eyes open on everything that’s in front of you. Let yourself see it with your eyes. Let yourself feel it deeply with your mind. Just be aware of the character and the texture and the feeling of the objects around you. Good. Now feel what’s to your left. Now look to your left with your eyes open. And see what’s to your left. And really feel it as well with your mind. Notice the character and the depth and the emotions of the objects around you. And turn your head to the right. And as you look to the right, feel it with your mind. What do these objects feel like to you? What’s their deeper character? Very good. Now face forward again. Imagine that you’re looking behind you. Without turning your head. And reach back with your awareness. You know what’s there. And feel it with your mind. Feel the texture and the character. Very good. Now close your eyes again. And with your eyes closed, notice if it’s easier now to sense what’s around you. Reach forward with your awareness. Notice any objects. your character or texture and feel to your left and to your right what’s there what does it feel like really sense it with your mind and feel behind you as well notice what’s there How does it feel? And let yourself have that same awareness behind you, that same clarity that you have in front. Just notice how much easier it is this time. And notice one more thing that you didn’t notice before. Just feel it with your mind. What is that thing that you’re feeling? Now smile and be very present behind your eyes. Let’s practice listening with your ears as well. What are you hearing? Right now. Besides my voice, are there any other sounds? What background sounds are you hearing but you’ve been ignoring or filtering out? Stay present in your head. Don’t go to the sounds. Just listen. Now let your awareness and your listening extend further away. Can you hear or feel what’s happening in the next room? What’s the furthest sound that you can hear? Be right behind your eyes again. Notice one more sound that you didn’t notice before. And smile. Breathe. And open your eyes. Welcome back. Great job. I hope you had fun and that you noticed how easy it can be to extend your awareness around you. Even with your eyes closed, you can sense all around you and even in the next room. Now, to deepen this awareness today, I want you to have this deeper perception as you go about your day. So even when your eyes are open and you’re looking, let yourself feel as you’re looking as well. And just notice, how does this affect your experience with your environment and also the people around you? And I’d love to hear about your experience today, so please share how was it feeling around you with your mind, and was there any part that was especially surprising or easy for you? Thanks so much for today, and I will see you tomorrow!

========================================

LESSON 27: Hearing Your Personal Filter

--------------------
Meditation: Day 27 - Hearing Your Personal Filter
--------------------

Hello everyone, I’m Jeffrey Allen. Welcome to day 27 of your mind awareness challenge. This is your challenge day for your outer mind awareness. And what I want you to get today is a sense of your own filters, your opinions and your perceptions, and I want you to begin to see through them. This is really great for breaking through any mental ceiling that you have because it’s going to help you see things in a new way. It’s also great for communicating with other people and developing more compassion in your mind. So let’s dive in. Focus on a point across the room where your eyes rest naturally, and have your awareness right behind your eyes. Notice your breath, and when you’re ready, breathe your eyes closed, maintaining that same awareness behind your eyes. And take a moment to get really present in your body. Stretch your awareness into your hands and your feet and all through your body. Think of something that you have a strong opinion about right now. Might be politics or sports, personal health or something else. And just notice your opinion about that issue. And in your mind’s eye, see yourself telling your story about this issue right now. Listen to your story as you tell all the details. And what’s your favorite part? What do you really like to say about this topic? Hear yourself saying those words, the same ones you’ve said before, and notice how fun it is to share your opinion with others. Notice all the people who agree with you, and all those people that you might convince, and notice how absolutely compelling and true your story feels right now. Good. Now, begin to notice Who else have you heard tell this story? Is this your original story? Or did it start with somebody else? And notice any similar stories that you’ve told in the past. Is this story new? Or is it a rerun or remake of an older story? And notice any pain or frustration that you’re holding around this issue. And start to let that go right now. You don’t need to carry this pain or frustration anymore. Just breathe and let it go. Now ask yourself, is this really a true story? Have you enhanced it or embellished it to make your case? Are you leaving out some information that doesn’t help your case? Just be amused and enjoy your creativity. Now let that story go and think about the opposite story. Somebody that has the opposing opinion, a completely different story that you tend to disagree with or maybe ignore. And let yourself be an amusement and temporarily adopt this story as your own. And try to do it authentically without sarcasm or judgment. And hear yourself telling the story with the same enthusiasm as before. Now this is your stretch, so really let yourself get into character. As you tell those details of this opposing opinion, just imagine that you’re completely convinced that they’re true. Think about all the people who agree with you. Think of all the people you might convince. And notice how it feels to tell this story with enthusiasm and commitment. Does it feel the same or different than before? Be amused. Now take a neutral position. Be an observer watching both sides of these stories. Be aware, but completely detached from the outcome. Now remember your honest opinion and see yourself expressing that side of the story right now with passion and commitment. And really admire your enthusiasm and your dedication. And notice how bright you shine. And from this neutral position, see someone else telling the opposing side of the story, with that same passion and commitment, and really admire their enthusiasm and their dedication. Notice how they shine. And from this place of neutrality, notice the similarities between the characters and the stories. While the details differ, the themes are likely the same. There might be a good guy and a bad guy. Maybe a scary outcome or a miraculous outcome. Notice where they’re the same. Now let the details of these stories fade away and focus on the people. Notice their passion, their desire to make the right choice, and their desire to help others. have compassion for their pain and their frustration, and admire these very similar people with very different stories. Send love and appreciation to both people and both sides of the story. And notice it doesn’t matter which story you hear. They’re both stories. Notice your body again. Be in that room in the center of your head. And begin to notice all the stories here. that you’re holding onto as truth. Shine that blue light around and clear any mental fog that’s hiding pain or frustration around those stories. And let any pain or frustration fade away into that light. As it clears, let go of any stories or opinions that you no longer need. Everything that’s not serving you. Everything that’s just noise. Move it out of this room right now. Breathe. Admire how much more freedom you have right now. Smile. And open your eyes. Welcome back. Great job. Today was a challenge day, so it’s okay if this exercise was difficult or even frustrating. That’s by design. That’s how we grow. So I hope you were able to find that neutral position and see the people behind the stories. Because when you can do this in life, Even the deepest arguments can be really graceful or beautiful to perceive. To gain a little more practice at this today, I want you to listen to one conversation, one person that you disagree with, as if everything they were saying is true. And just notice how much fun that they’re having, even if you don’t agree. Don’t interrupt them or rewrite or edit. Just enjoy the show. Try responding to the person instead of responding to their story. Maybe you say, wow, I can really feel your enthusiasm and commitment to that opinion. That’s great. And if you’re telling your own opinion, your own stories, try starting them with something like, in my opinion, or I heard someone say, and let them be stories instead of needing to pretend that they’re absolutely true. One more quick tip. The goal here is not to get rid of your opinions, but just to be aware of them and aware that they’re stories and that they may change over time. So I’d love to hear how this experience was for you today, just what surprised you about today’s challenge, and could you see the beauty of the people beneath those opposing stories? Thanks so much for today, and I will see you tomorrow.


========================================

LESSON 28: Listening To The World

--------------------
Meditation: Day 28 - Listening To The World
--------------------

Hello everyone, I’m Jeffrey Allen. Welcome to day 28 of your Mind Awareness Challenge. This is your wow day of your outer mind awareness. So today I want you to have a new experience or do something that you didn’t know was possible. And how we’re going to do that today is we’re going to listen with your mind to a wider and wider scope until eventually you’re listening to the pulse of the entire world. This is really great for understanding the big picture and choosing how you fit in. Great, so let’s begin. Focus on a point across the room where your eyes rest naturally. Have your awareness right behind your eyes as you focus on that point. Notice your breath and breathe your eyes closed, maintaining that same awareness behind your eyes. And be aware of your body and hear your breath, feel your heart and your pulse. And notice your posture. Let yourself find that subtle rhythm. of your body. And let your awareness expand and be aware of the room around you. Feel what’s in front of you, to the right, to the left, and behind. And notice what sounds you’re hearing right now. As you listen, let your awareness extend beyond the room. Keep expanding beyond the building, noticing more and more information around you. and let your awareness expand into your community or your town. Notice the buzz, all the information there, and notice the trends as well. Hear everything but soften your focus. Start to notice the patterns in all that noise. Now expand your awareness again and listen to your entire country. Hear the loud stories. The fears or complaints. And then let those fade away. And focus your attention on the people. Feel the people instead of the stories. What’s really happening in your country? Are people happy? Afraid? Are they clear? Or confused? Don’t think, just notice. Let the deeper truth speak to your mind. Now as you listen to your country, let yourself be surprised. Notice one thing that you didn’t expect to find. Now expand your awareness again, listening to your whole continent, and expand further until you’re listening to the entire world. First notice what you expect to find, and let that go. And notice what you’ve seen on the news or in the media. And let that go, too. As you listen, try not to think. Feel the people, but not the stories. What’s happening in the world right now? Let yourself feel all the happy moments on the planet right now. And feel all the unhappy moments as well. And notice which are more plentiful. The happy or the unhappy. Let yourself feel all the hopeful people in the world, and then feel all the people who have lost hope or are in despair. Which are more common? Let your awareness expand again to include 10 years in the past and 10 years in the future for the whole planet. And notice the trend. Are we getting more or less happy? Are we getting more or less abundant? What’s the most positive trend you can feel on the planet right now? Just listen and be grateful for that positive trend. Bring your awareness back into your country. Can you feel that positive trend still? And bring your awareness back to your community. Can you feel that positive trend here? Bring your awareness back to your own life. How is that positive trend affecting you? Are you happy in your life? Are you happy in this moment? Give yourself a deep breath, smile, and open your eyes. Welcome back. Great job. I hope you could see the progress through all the chaos. There is a lot of noise in the world right now, but we’re actually trending in a very positive direction. So if you can see through those smaller negative trends and tune into the larger positive trends, it really helps your awareness and helps you align with those big trends. So today, to deepen your practice, I’d like you to see if you can be aware of that big picture a few times today. Just let your mind expand beyond the details and absorb that broader perspective. Now, a little tip with this, if you tune into the world and you see exactly what you expect, you may be fooling yourself. You might just be thinking rather than listening. And if that happens, just be amused. Of course, I’d love it if you shared. It’s a great way to integrate the information in and deepen your awareness. And I’d love to hear… What did you feel happening in the world, and did it match your expectations? Thanks so much for today, and I will see you tomorrow!

LESSON 29: Outer Mind Applications & Gracefully Achieving A Goal

--------------------
<v ->Hi everyone; I'm Jeffrey Allen.</v> And thank you for joining me on day nine of your Mind Awareness Challenge. Now you've already made it through the activation for your outer mind awareness. And by this, I mean you've taken those first four steps. You did a self-assessment where you noticed kind of what's happening in your background thoughts. And then you did a easy exercise where you're listening to your environment more deeply. And then we went into the deeper exercise, the challenge where you're looking at your filter and trying to disable and take out that filter. And finally we did that powerful exercise yesterday where you're really tuning in and listening to the world. So you have that activation inside you, and it's going to continue to grow, and you just want to keep practicing and keep sharing that awareness to let it continue to foster and grow inside you. So I'm going to give you a couple examples, as I always do to give you ways to continue this practice very easily. Now, probably the most obvious practice is to actually listen to people in your relationships. Now, this seems funny, but actually listening to people in your relationships really helps them feel like you listen to them, and it in improves not only their impression of you but also your impression of them because when you're listening to them, you like them more. You get a deeper sense of who they are, and it's just more fun to be around them. Now, of course, the more aware you are of your environment in general and the people around you, the less that you're going to make mistakes and kind of go down paths that you don't need to go on. So it's a great way to be more efficient. And also, if you're listening, you'll pick up some of those opportunities that you may have missed otherwise. You can also use your mind awareness to help you just get along a little bit better in the world. And we're going to practice that a little bit today, just helping to make a decision based on what you're feeling is going on in the world. And this is a really powerful exercise. So some of the advanced applications of your mind awareness is to really focus on people rather than their stories. So, especially if somebody's telling you a story that you just don't like or you totally don't agree with, just notice them instead of the story. Listen to the things that you love about them. Listen to the way that they're enthusiastic about that story. And just tune into the person instead of the story. And you'll notice that you actually start to feel good instead of feeling bad. And so it's a really great way to shift your experience. You can also try telling a story that you disagree with. So just tell the other side of your normal opinion. We practiced this a little bit in the exercise, and this is really powerful because it can be very fun. And sometimes you'll notice that you actually start to change your mind, which is great. You can also explore several different contradictory positions. And if you do this, you'll notice oftentimes there'll actually be a third opinion or a third position that kind of pops up out of that. You'll find that instead of being kind of black or white, maybe there's a little middle ground or something that includes both. So it's actually a great way to enhance your awareness and to find just a more positive way to fit everybody in. Now, when you're turning off your filter, this is really powerful for thinking outside the box because you're getting away from just your opinions and you're starting to hear what else is out there. And the more you understand yourself, you'll notice that you're actually a little bit less argumentative, a little bit less reactionary, and you start to have more empathy with other people. And it's kind of funny 'cause this comes from knowing yourself, but it's great for your communication and your relationships. So really let yourself tune in, and understand your own filter with the world. You'll notice that you'll also start to notice that filter on other people. So you'll start noticing like, ah, that's just their filter. It's not about them. So the more you do that for yourself, the more you'll notice it for other people too. This is also great if you want to have less arguments. So if you're having an argument, and you can just notice what is it really that I'm upset about and kind of go deeper and deeper into that awareness. It's a great way to shift out of it so that you can kind of disable that and not have to have that argument the next time. So really powerful tool. So a little advanced relationship practice would include using a multiple awareness. You want to listen to a conversation with your ears, and then also listen with your mind, and then also listen with your heart and with your spirit. And we're going to practice this a little later in the program, but this is really powerful because if you connect with people in this way, they will notice, they will feel like, wow, you were really there, you're really talking to them, instead of just being kind of blah, blah, blah, nice to meet you. They'll notice that there was something different about you. So very powerful practice. Now, one more thing that you can do that's kind of advanced practice is to let yourself really be in the flow. So listen to what's happening and the trends. And instead of having a plan just kind of flow with what's happening. Now, of course, this won't always work. Sometimes you want to have a plan, but experience both, and then you'll know which times you want to flow and which times you want to plan. And I have a funny example. When I lived in Colorado I had this hundred-year-old house and I had renovated it and made it just the way I wanted. And the landscaping was in. Everything was just perfect, and I had no plans to move. I was planning on staying there and working in my job. And then one day I got this really strong intuition. I woke up with a sense that I needed to sell my home and to put it on the market. And I resisted at first because I didn't want to sell the home. I didn't know where I would go next. I didn't have any plans to move. I needed to live somewhere. And this awareness just kept coming to me. So I just thought, okay, I'm just going to go for it. So I put the house on the market at kind of a high price thinking it probably wouldn't sell, and what happened was, very quickly within a week and a half, it actually sold at that high price. And I discovered in the meantime that there was somewhere else that I wanted to live. So it worked out really well. And even more what happened was that, if I hadn't sold that house within the next few months, I probably would've been in trouble because about two months after I sold, the US housing market started to crash, and it just went down, down, down, and I probably would've lost that house and the money that I had into it. So in that case, listening to the flow and going with the flow was much better than what I had planned. So kind of a fun story. Another way to practice this awareness is if you're in a meeting or a conversation and people are having a difficult time getting along, if you notice two really distinct opinions that seem that they're opposing, if you listen a little bit deeper with your awareness, oftentimes you'll notice that beneath that there is a common goal and there is common ground. And this listening, this awareness, helps you bring that out and helps other people begin to get along and get productive and move together again. I used this all the time when I worked in corporate America; it's a really great technique. Now, today, I just want to share one more exercise with you where you're going to take a plan that you have and help to let it merge a little bit or adjust a little bit with the environment around you. So you can have a more graceful path on your way toward that goal. So right now, just think of a goal that you would like to get to. You can do this with your eyes open and then visualize the path that you're planning to take from today to get you to that goal. Good. Now just hold that in your mind, and gently close your eyes. And again, hold that in your mind, and move your awareness into the center of your head, and begin to hear all the filters and ideas that you have already in your mind. And just gently start to turn those down. And as you hold this goal in mind, let your awareness begin to expand. Notice the room around you. Notice the building. Really feel the community that you're in; feel all the people that are involved in or that will be touched by your goal. And with your awareness just get a sense of where is this group going. What direction are all these people headed? And as you tune into that community, everybody touched by your goal, Just notice, how is your goal aligned? Can it be easily received? Are you trying to shake things up? Ask yourself if your goal needs further refinement, and let that goal adjust right now. Now notice that path from present time out to your goal, and notice does this fit gracefully with your community? How can your path adjust to accomplish your goal to get to it more gracefully. Maybe more time or less time, more people or less people, or anything else. As that path adjusts, be present in the center of your head, and notice how does that goal feel right now? Is it easier? Is it a little lighter? Feel your alignment with that bigger trend and community, and be grateful that you're taking the easier, more graceful road, and smile, and when you're ready, open your eyes. So great job; thanks for that meditation. And I hope that you got some nice refinements, and just saw that even a little adjustment in your goal or your path can make things easier and more graceful for you. If all of us did this in our daily life, just adjusted a little bit to our environment around us, Just imagine how much easier and more graceful the entire world would be. So I encourage you to do that today as you go about your day. Just notice that if there's anywhere you can adjust a little bit with your plan or adjust a little bit with your path. So you can get along more gracefully and more easily with others. Now I encourage you to share today any unique idea that you have on how you can use your mind awareness to change your life. So please share that, and then you can try it tomorrow on the Integration Day. And again, congratulations on completing your Mind Awareness Challenge. Thank you so much. And I will see you tomorrow.

LESSON 30: Mind Awareness Integration

--------------------
Meditation: Day 30 - Mind Awareness Integration
--------------------

Hi, everybody. I’m Jeffrey Allen and congratulations. It’s the final day in your mental awareness challenge. And today is your integration day, which means that you get to rest or catch up or ideally have a little do -it -yourself practice day. So if you need to rest, I understand. That’s great. Just take a break and I will see you tomorrow. If you’d like to catch up on a day you missed, you can go back and catch that day right now. If you want to practice with this do -it -yourself practice, I’m going to get you started today. I’m going to give you about eight minutes of silence to explore on your own, and then I’ll wake you up at the end and bring you back out of trance. Today’s meditation is really great for exploring on your own and integrating any new awareness, this mental awareness, into your daily routines. You can reuse this meditation anytime you want to get clarity in your mind awareness. Okay, let’s begin. And remember, there’ll be an eight -minute quiet place in the middle where you’ll be following your own guidance rather than following my voice. Find a point across the room where your eyes rest naturally. Focus on that point and be right behind your eyes. Notice your breath. And when you’re ready, breathe your eyes closed and maintain that same focus right behind your eyes. Let yourself be in that room. in the center of your head, and notice how clear and peaceful it is here. If anyone is in this room with you, in the center of your head, just politely escort them out right now. Begin to feel that blue ball of light in between your palms. As it gets brighter, let it shine around this room, clearing out any unconscious energy or fogginess in this room. Smile and think of Something you want to explore with your mind awareness? And notice which room is best for this exercise today. This main room or one of the others? When I count down from three, you’re going to begin exploring this topic on your own. Are you ready? Three. Hold that question or topic in your mind. Two. Be in the room that’s best for you today. Let the room be bright and clear. 1. Let your awareness expand to the perfect size for the information you need. Just this room, your community, your country, or the world. 0. Start receiving your answers right now. What’s the first thing that you notice? Enjoy! Notice your breath. Notice one more insight before you finish. Let yourself be in the main room in the center of your head. Smile and remember all that you received today. Stretch your body and breathe. When you’re ready, open your eyes. Welcome back. I hope you found the clarity and the answers that you desired. And recognize how much easier this is getting for you. Notice how much more aware you’ve already become. And if you’d like, please share the insights that you received today. And let me know, is it getting easier for you to work with your mind? Congratulations again on completing your mental awareness challenge. We’re already halfway through the program and you’re doing great. I know you’re going to make it all the way to the end. Tomorrow, we’re going to start phase four where we explore your spirit awareness. Thanks so much for today. I will see you tomorrow.

Part 4: Spirit-Awareness (Intuition & Connection)

========================================

LESSON 31: Welcome to Spirit Awareness

--------------------
Hi, everyone; I'm Jeffrey Allen, and welcome to Day 1 of your Spirit Awareness Challenge. Now, I know a lot of you have experience already working with spirituality and different spiritual tools, and that's fantastic. I want to put you at ease right away and just say that we're not going to be going into any religious debates or any philosophical conversations during this practice. What we are going to do is just give you a deeper experience of what it's like to be a spirit, and we're going to work on activating my two favorite aspects of spirit awareness which is spirit perception, or intuition, and spirit connection. Now, intuition is a favorite topic of mine. I've been studying intuition for over 20 years, and I've been practicing as a professional reader and healer and teacher for over a decade. And I use intuition in every aspect of my life. My wife, Hisami, and I speak different languages, and so our energy connection and our intuition is a big part of us being able to communicate and enjoy our relationship. At work, I use my intuition to help me decide which projects to do or which direction to go, and it's just fantastic; it helps things move so much more easily. Even in my financial life at times, I'll use my intuition. One time I got this hit that I needed to buy gold, and I'd never bought gold before; I was kind of curious, and I went online; I did some research and realized that gold was at a 15-year record high at the moment, and I couldn't believe it. I thought, oh, my intuition must be wrong. I had a really hard time following it, but it was very persistent. So, eventually I did, I went ahead and bought the gold at that 15-year record high. And in the next year, the price actually doubled, and then it almost tripled in value. I was so surprised. But when you use your intuition, you'll notice this, that life goes a little bit easier because you are tuned in and you're getting in that higher flow, that easier flow of life. Now, I make this sound really easy for me right now, but it wasn't always that way. There was definitely a time when I was struggling to access my intuition. I would try to visualize an apple in front of me, and I just didn't feel like I could do it, or I tried to tune into something, and it felt like I just can't quite access that information. So, I know what it's like to feel like that, and it kind of feels like you don't have a guidance system, like I know I'm supposed to go somewhere but I don't have a map, I don't have a GPS, I don't even have a compass, so I end up just kind of trying things. Like, I'll go in this direction in a relationship or in business, and then maybe have to backtrack and then try a different direction and maybe backtrack again. So, it can be very frustrating and inefficient, and it felt like I really wasn't living up to my full potential because I was kind of wasting a lot of time and energy by not going the right way. Now, in contrast, as I started using my intuition, I noticed that that went away; instead, the opposite happened. I started noticing opportunities that I wouldn't have noticed before and taking those opportunities that turned out to be a fast track to where I wanted to go, or maybe even take me to a place better than what I thought I wanted to do in the first place. The same thing in relationships and health and everything. So, intuition is a fantastic tool for really helping you gain your awareness. Now, to get you into your intuition in this series, we're going to do the same six steps for activation. So today, you're going to start with a little self-assessment; just, how is your intuition working for you right now? And how do you believe your intuition is working for you? And then we're going to go into an easy exercise, easy success, where you're going to visualize some things and explore some information in a way that maybe you hadn't really thought of as your intuition before. So, this is just to give you that easy success. The next day, we're really going to step it up. On the Challenge Day, I'm going to give you four techniques for looking at information with your intuition. And this is really powerful; I know you're going to love that day. And we're also going to do the Challenge Day or the Wow Day where you're going to visit the Akashic records, where you can access all the information that's available to you about your spirit in this lifetime. So really fun, really powerful activation. And then, of course, you'll be practicing and sharing and building on that as well. Now, when the intuition section's finished, we're going to move into Part 2 of your spirit awareness which is your spirit connection. And this is really exciting too because your connection with spirit is kind of what people think of as spirituality. That sense that you're connected to the planet and other people and the Divine. And so, I really want to explore that more deeply, so you can have that experience for you. So, let's go ahead and dive in. Today, I want to do a little exercise that's going to help you assess where your intuition is and how much you're using it. And keep in mind that intuition is not an action that you're taking; it's more like a state of mind. So when I'm happy, I'm not actively doing anything to be happy, I'm not focusing on being happy, right? Intuition is the same way. When you're tuned in, it's just a state of being; you just are intuitive; you are tuned in. You're not consciously having to tune in and use it all the time. So, keep that in mind. Here, we're going to look at kind of how much are you using your intuition and how much are you using your mind in your daily life. All right, so go ahead and close your eyes. And let your awareness be right behind your eyes, and create a gauge out in front of you that goes from 0 to 100%, and let this gauge show you how strong do you believe your intuition is right now. How strong do you believe your intuition is right now? And now, let that gauge show you how strong your intuition really is, from 0 to 100%. And now, remember a time when you were 100% certain about something, but it was actually incorrect. And use that gauge to show you what percent of that certainty was your intuition and how much of that certainty was just your mind. Good, now, remember a time when you suspected something but you really didn't want it to be true, and it turns out, it was. Let that gauge show you, from 0 to 100, what percentage of that certainty was your intuition. And then from 0 to 100, what percentage of your certainty was your mind? Now, remember a time where you were leaving the house and you got this idea that you needed to bring something with you. Maybe it was an umbrella or a book or your computer, and you let your mind override because you knew that you didn't need that object today. And then, of course, later in the day something happened, and it turns out you needed that object and you were kind of kicking yourself, thinking, I knew I should have brought it; why didn't I follow my intuition? Now, I want you to reframe that experience so that instead of feeling bad about it or kicking yourself I want you to celebrate instead. Right now, just think, wow, I'm so happy I have these experiences that give me tangible proof that my intuition is correct. And when that happens, in the future, just have that same feeling; just smile and laugh and enjoy that your intuition is working even if you're not listening to it. Now, remember a time where you were absolutely convinced about something, and you were right, and let this gauge show you, from 0 to 100%, how much of that certainty was your intuition? And, from 0 to 100%, how much of that certainty was your mind? Good. Now, look at that gauge one more time, and just notice how strong, 0 to 100%, do you believe your intuition is right now? All right, and then just take a deep breath, smile, and open your eyes. Welcome back. Good job; I hope you enjoyed that really simple exercise. Just giving you an idea of that balance between your certainty with your intuition and your certainty with your mind because you want to learn to balance those out and find that intuition certainty because that's the one that's more often going to be right. Your mind is fantastic too, but it's easy to fool yourself, especially if you're in new territory. So, I hope you enjoyed that exercise. Tomorrow, we're going to do an Easy Success Exercise where you're going to tune into some things and get information and realize how easy it can really be to use your intuition. The next day, we're going to go into the challenge where you're really going to learn some powerful techniques, four techniques, for learning about how to tune into information, how to bring it to you, and I know you're going to love it. Then, the fourth day, we're going to go into your access to the Akashic records which is just really fantastic, and you're going to get that powerful wow experience. So, thanks so much for today, and I would love it if you shared your favorite story about intuition; what's happened to you before that's validated your intuition. Thanks again, and I will see you tomorrow.

LESSON 32: Making Intuition Easy

--------------------
Meditation: Day 32 - Making Intuition Easy
--------------------

Hello everyone, I’m Jeffrey Allen. Welcome to day 2 of your Spirit Awareness Challenge. This is your easy success day for your intuition awareness. So what I’d like you to get today is a sense that you can already and are already using your intuition and a clear understanding of what using your intuition really feels like. And this is great for getting over that feeling that you’re not intuitive enough or that you’re not receiving it well enough. I’ve taught thousands of people to use their intuition. And the biggest thing I see getting in the way is that people often expect intuition to be something different than it is. That’s what I want to help you solve today. Remember when I talked about the body being your personal here and now? We’re so used to using our physical senses, our vision, our hearing, our smell, touch, taste, and our gut feeling to observe things that are close to our body and time and space. And then our mind processes these this information into an understanding of our situation. Intuition is essentially the same, but for things not necessarily close to our body in time and space. So we observe sights, sounds, smells, touch, taste, or gut feeling, and our mind organizes that into an understanding. So let’s try it out. Find a point across the room where your eyes rest naturally. Be right behind your eyes. and focus on that point. Notice your breath, and when you’re ready, breathe your eyes closed, maintaining that same awareness right behind your eyes. Let your awareness be in that room in the center of your head. Close the doors on your thoughts about work and relationship and planning. Be alone in this quiet, peaceful room. Think of a cafe or a restaurant that you like to go to and imagine that you’re there right now. What does this place look like? Is it quiet or is it loud? Do you feel hot or cold or just right? Remember some food or drink that you’ve had in this place. What does it look like? What does it smell like or taste like? How does it feel in your mouth? Is it hot or cold? Maybe smooth or crunchy? Really enjoy this food or drink right now. Notice one more thing about this place that you haven’t noticed before. Good. Now imagine a favorite place that you’ve lived in in your life. What color was this place? Can you picture it in your mind? What did the floors feel like? Were they carpet or tile or wood? Imagine you can feel yourself standing in this place now. What was your favorite part of this place? What does it feel like to be there? Can you remember what music you listened to there? Can you remember something fun that happened there? Notice one thing about this place that you haven’t noticed before. Good. Now imagine a future vacation to a beautiful place in nature. Imagine you’re on that vacation right now. What do you see around you? What nature sounds do you hear? Can you feel the sun or wind or water on your skin? What does it smell like in this place? How do you feel right here? Are you relaxed? Are you happy? Where is this place? Now imagine a good friend is there with you. What does it feel like when you’re with this friend? See them looking at you and smiling? What do you imagine they’re thinking? If they talked to you, what would they say? Just enjoy this moment. And notice one more thing you haven’t noticed here before. Bring your attention back to the room you’re in right now. With your eyes closed, sense the room around you. Where are the walls of the room? Can you feel or sense any objects nearby? Does this feel more or less real than the other places you imagined? Be in the room in the center of your head again. Notice how peaceful it is here. And notice, did you go anywhere at all? Or were you always here? Be present behind your eyes. Notice your breath. Smile, be grateful, and open your eyes. Welcome back. Great job. I hope you had a nice journey. If it went well, you were able to see, hear, smell, touch, taste, and feel an environment that your body isn’t in right now. And you also easily moved around in the present, in the past, and the future too. You even noticed some things that you hadn’t noticed before. If using your intuition is harder than this exercise, then you’re either trying too hard, you’re expecting something different from your intuition, or you’re just distracted by the physical world. It really is this easy when you get out of effort. Of course, it also helps to practice a lot and to have good technique, and we’re going to cover that more in the next couple of days. If you want to deepen your awareness of what you learned today, just let yourself have a similar experience with your eyes open. So notice what else you can sense throughout your day and begin mixing your physical and intuition awareness together. Of course, I’d love it if you’d share. That’s the best way that you can integrate this information further. And I’d love to know what place was easiest for you to experience and what did you notice that you hadn’t noticed before? Thanks so much for today and I will see you tomorrow.

========================================

LESSON 33: Four Intuition Techniques

--------------------
Meditation: Day 33 - Four Intuition Techniques
--------------------

Hello everyone, I’m Jeffrey Allen. Welcome to day 3 of your Spirit Awareness Challenge. This is your challenge day for your intuition awareness, and while we are covering some advanced material, I’m secretly hoping that you’ll find it easy instead of really challenging. If you’re not visual, remember to supplement with your other senses as you’re experiencing today. Today you’ll be trying four different techniques of using your intuition, viewing information from afar, going to information with your awareness, bringing information to you, and knowing your information. You’re familiar with two of these already, and the other two will be new. These techniques are really great for improving your confidence and success with intuition. If you discover which technique is most natural for you, you can use your strength and feel more confident about your results. It’s also great for practicing the techniques that are not your strength and helping to build those up and broaden your awareness. Before we start, remember yesterday’s exercise. You tuned into a favorite restaurant or cafe, a favorite place you’ve lived, and a beautiful nature vacation. Pick one of these places right now that you want to explore with your intuition today. So which one did you like the most or which one was easiest for you? All right, let’s begin. Focus on a point across the room where your eyes rest naturally. Be right behind your eyes and notice your breath. When you’re ready, breathe your eyes closed, keeping that same awareness right behind your eyes. Be in the room in the center of your head and close the doors on your thoughts about work. relationship, or planning. Be relaxed in this quiet and peaceful room. In your mind’s eye, imagine a TV or movie screen in front of you. Don’t focus on the device itself, just the scene it will show you. Let this screen begin to show a scene from the place you want to explore. Favorite restaurant or cafe, favorite place you’ve lived, or a beautiful nature vacation. Stay in the center of your head and watch this place from a distance. What colors do you see there? Is it inside or outside? Are there people there? What activities are taking place in that space? Take a few moments and notice what else is happening in this scene. Now imagine you are leaving the center of your head and going to that scene right now. Instead of watching, you are actually there. Notice what’s happening in front of you, to the sides, and behind you. Let yourself turn around in this space and get a different perspective. Let yourself walk around this space and explore. Are there other people here? Can they see you? Take a few moments to notice what else is happening in this place. Give yourself a deep breath and return to the room in the center of your head. Be in that quiet, peaceful place, very present in your body. Remember that place you just visited, but instead of going there, stay in the center of your head and bring the information to you. Just pull that information in so it’s in front of you, in that room in the center of your head. Notice the same details as before. but without leaving the center of your head. Now zoom out a bit so you can see a wider scene and rotate this place around so you’re looking at it from the other side. Try seeing it from up above. Now zoom in again and notice more details. Take a few moments to explore on your own. Let go of that information for now and just be… in that peaceful room in the center of your head. Breathe. Now engage your knowingness about the place you’ve been exploring. Without needing any sight or sounds or vision, just let information come directly to your awareness. How old is the place you were visiting? Why was it created and by whom? What’s the most common feeling people have in this place? Are there plans to change this place in the future? What else can you know about this place? Give yourself another deep breath and let that information go. Be relaxed and calm in the center of your head. Smile and be grateful and open your eyes. Welcome back. Great job. I hope you got a good sense of how different these intuition techniques are and which one is easiest for you. Maybe it’s viewing information from afar or going to the information, bringing the information to you, or just knowing it. And keep in mind, you might use different intuition techniques for different things. I always use this remote viewing for looking at past lives. But if I’m going to scout out a location, I actually go there with my awareness. Nearly everything else, I just bring the information to me. And with all of these, I also mix in the knowingness. So just play with which one is the most fun and the most useful for you. If you want to deepen your awareness today, I recommend try using one of these techniques to enhance your thinking or creativity today. So use it to get more information about something tangible. that you’re already working on. Of course, I’d love it if you share. This is a great way to integrate the information. Which technique was your favorite? The remote viewing, the going to the information, bringing it to you, or simply knowing it? And what was your experience like? Thank you so much for today, and I look forward to seeing you tomorrow.

LESSON 34: Visiting The Akashic Records

--------------------
Meditation: Day 34 - Visiting The Akashic Records 
--------------------

Hello everyone, I’m Jeffrey Allen. Welcome to day 4 of your Spirit Awareness Challenge. This is your wow day for your intuition experience, so I want to give you a new experience or do something that you didn’t know was possible. So today I’m going to show you one technique for tuning into the Akashic Records. Like the center of your head, the Akashic Records is a way of organizing information. With the center of your head, you are doing the organizing of your information for this life right now, but with the Akashic Records, All information about your spirit is already organized for you across your full spectrum of previous and potential experiences. Tuning into the Akashic Records is great for getting a deeper understanding of your personality and your journey as a spirit. If you have a recurring pattern or you can’t seem to get unstuck in some way, you can often find clues in the Akashic Records to help remedy the situation. It’s also great for looking at past lives if that’s interesting for you. And if past lives aren’t part of your beliefs, that’s okay. Just imagine these other lives are a metaphor or an unrealized potential for you. Either belief will do just fine. For today, don’t worry about any philosophical implications. Just let yourself have fun and enjoy the experience and activation. Before we begin, think about one pattern in your life that you’re curious about. Maybe something that keeps happening or not happening. in your relationship or your work or your health. And ask yourself, are you ready to find out more about this pattern? If not, pick something else to investigate. But if yes, we’re ready to go. So let’s begin. Notice a point across the room where your eyes rest naturally. Be right behind your eyes and focus on that point. Gently breathe your eyes closed. maintaining that same awareness, and then move into the room in the center of your head. Notice if anyone else is in the center of your head with you, and if they are, just ask them to leave. Take a moment to do any cleanup and remove any unnecessary thoughts or energy from this room in the center of your head. Close the doors on your thoughts about work, relationship, and planning rooms, and any other rooms you may have. Just be in that silent, private room in the center of your head. Let yourself be light and curious about what you’ll experience today. Say to yourself, I give myself permission to receive with clarity. I give myself permission to receive with clarity. Notice the walls. in the ceiling of this room in the center of your head. Begin to zoom out and notice the space outside this room as well. Notice the bright pillar of light which surrounds your center of head. Feel that bright light radiating, full of life force and information about you. This pillar holds all the information about your life right now. Everything that’s happened in your past, your present, and your futures in this life. Feel all that information around you right now. Now zoom out further and notice all the pillars of light for your spirit. Multiple pillars of light holding information from all your various lifetimes. From the past and the present and the futures. Notice how beautiful this is and just breathe it in. Now remember the pattern in your life that you want to learn more about. Notice which pillar of light holds information that’ll help you understand this pattern more deeply. Begin to zoom in to that pillar of light right now. Let it surround you. Hear it whispering to you. As you’re suspended in that pillar of light, begin receiving the awareness that you seek. Let it come as a thought or a vision, a deep knowing or a feeling. So let yourself receive. Take a few moments to enjoy your experience here. Smile and be grateful for this information. And keep receiving. Set your intention to remember this information deeply. Let the information come to a close for now. With gratitude, zoom out again and notice all of your pillars of light and feel yourself being pulled into the pillar for this life. Let yourself gently return to the room in the center of your head. Let the light of your new understanding fill this room. Breathe. Feel that information integrating subtly into your awareness. Smile and be grateful. And open your eyes. Welcome back. Great job. I hope you had a really wonderful journey. The Akashic Records speak to everyone in different ways. Know that whatever you received, even if it was deep, deep silence, that this was just perfect for you. To deepen this awareness today, Don’t think too much about your experience. Don’t add any meaning to it with your mind. Just let it roll around in your awareness today. You’ll notice additional insights will come as this information integrates into your normal awareness. So I’d love to hear what you experienced today. Please share what did you experience in your visit to the Akashic Records. Thanks so much for today. I will see you tomorrow.

LESSON 35: Intuition Applications & Intro To Spirit Connection
--------------------

Hi everybody; I'm Jeffrey Allen, and welcome to Day 5 of your Spirit Awareness Challenge. Congratulations; you've already activated your intuition over the past few days. We started out with that very simple assessment where you're checking how much are you using your mind, how much are you using your intuition. And then we moved into an easy exercise for you where you're noticing how you're using your intuition in your everyday life, even if you weren't calling it intuition. And then we stepped up to the Challenge Day, and I gave you these four powerful ways to tune in and use your intuition to get information about your life. And then we went to the Wow Day yesterday where you went and checked out the Akashic Records and got some really fun information about you. Now, you already have this activation, so it doesn't matter if you did those exercises perfectly. You have that information inside you; you have that experience and that activation. To let this build from here on out, all you need to do is practice and share. So let me give you some good places to practice with your intuition and give you some ideas of how to keep taking this forward and applying it for you. So the first place that I love to practice my intuition is in my workspace. I noticed that before I have a project, before I dig in and spend a lot of time and energy on it, I like to tune in using one of those four techniques and just look at the project from an energetic perspective or an intuitive perspective. And what this does is it gives me information to start with, but it also helps me move more efficiently when I start to move down the action steps that I'm taking for that particular project. And, you know, intuition moves very fast; it's very easy. You can also let it be kind of always on during your creative project. So this sort of background tuned-in intuition, and you'll notice that your creativity and your productivity will really soar when you do that. Another great place to use your awareness with your intuition is in your relationship space. And this is a fun one to me because when you meet somebody or you're drawn to somebody, I recommend that you tune in to the Akashic Records and ask about that person. And oftentimes what you'll find will help you either connect more deeply with that person, understand them better, or realize that perhaps you just had some unfinished business that you can move through more quickly rather than kind of a long drawn-out relationship. So this also is kind of an efficiency thing that you can use in your relationship space. Now, of course, if you want to understand your partner better, it really helps to listen with your intuition and your heart, and not just your ears and your mind, because we're not always great with words. Sometimes we say things we don't mean, or we can't quite put it into words. If you're listening with your intuition, you'll notice that you can really understand your partner more deeply, even when they can't find the perfect words. Another relationship thing you can try is if you're wanting to take a vacation together somewhere, tune in and imagine yourself on that vacation with your intuition, and find out what is it going to be like, Are you going to enjoy it, before you've actually spent any money and committed any time to the vacation. It's kind of another little shortcut there. Now, of course, with intuition there are endless personal applications as well. If you find yourself stuck in a particular pattern in your life, tune into the Akashic Records and just ask what's the origin of this problem, and notice what you find. If you have some unexplained body issues where, you know, the doctors can't figure out what exactly is wrong with you, also tune in the Akashic Records and see what is it that started that, or see if you can find a little more information. Oftentimes you'll get that clue that helps you take the next step and really solve that problem in your body. Now, of course, if you're wondering about just anything in general, you can tune in and use these four intuition techniques for either getting the information and, you know, bringing it to you or watching it or traveling to it or just knowing the information. For a little more advanced practice, I recommend that you use your intuition to explore some places that you can't go with your body. So for example, I spent about a year and a half every morning doing an exercise where I tuned in and then I traveled to somewhere with my awareness. And I went into places in the body, got really small and went down into the cells and the atoms, and I traveled to really big places like the entire universe and had that expanded awareness. I went into outer space and down into the oceans, and it's really fun. It's not necessarily something that you're going to, you know, maybe do in a practical way, but it really helps you expand your awareness of who you are and what you're capable of as a spirit. So I recommend that type of journey. Now, I would say that it does tend to be a little more real if you have a purpose to your exploration. So if there's something you wanting to discover or learn, you're wanting to help people in some way, you'll find that you can get information much more easily. Now, visiting the Akashic Records is also a great way to know yourself better; maybe once a week or once a month, just tune in and go to the Akashic Records, and just learn a little bit more about who you are as a spirit. Now, if you want to do something really advanced, you can play with this exercise where I said you're bringing the information to you and you're kind of rotating it around and you're zooming in and out. Notice that you can also put a timeline on there, and you can slide it back and forth in time. So all that information's available and, with practice, you can move around very easily and read information very easily this way. Another advanced practice is to bring two sets of information up. You might do this, for example, if you're looking at a compatibility for yourself and somebody else in relationship; look at your information, and look at their information, and then see how they fit together. So a couple of advanced techniques for you. Now, this is exactly what I do actually, when I'm doing energy readings myself; it kind of looks like this, you know, new computer display out in space where I'm moving things around, zooming, turning, and it's really fascinating. It's a great way to get information. So I hope you really enjoy your awareness with your intuition, and today we're going to start with your spirit connection. And this is a really important part of spirit awareness too because when you don't feel connected, you tend to first feel a little bit isolated and lonely. But we also tend to get go into a little bit of competition. This can even lead to greed and hoarding and can even lead to competition in a sense of violence or lashing out. Now, when you feel a connection with other people and with the planet and with the divine, that doesn't happen because it just doesn't make sense to harm somebody when you know that you're connected to them and you're essentially harming yourself too. So the sense of connection is really powerful, and it's actually a big part of where we're shifting to on the planet right now. You'll also notice that this connection with the divine and with everybody else also just feels really good. It kind of feels like, you know, that the universe always has your back, and it's just so comforting to know and to feel that connection. So I want to start today and dive into this a little deeper. We're going to do a self-assessment exercise just to feel how your connection is, and I was playing with different words to try to make this easy for everybody because it's easy to get stuck on the words. So I like to use higher intelligence or divine or source. But, you know, feel free to add in your favorite word. You can use God; you can use Goddess. You can use love; you can use science or physics or the source, you know, whatever word really speaks to you. It's okay, because this is not about your religion or your belief system. This is simply about your experience of being a spirit. So let's go ahead and dive in and do that self-assessment meditation right now. Just go ahead and take a deep breath, and then close your eyes. And have your awareness right behind your eyes. And then gently move it back into the center of your head. Ask yourself the simple question who do you feel connected to? And who do you not feel connected to you? Are there groups of people that you can't relate to at all? And are there people that you don't really want to relate to and just use that gauge from zero to 100%. What percentage of people do you feel connected to? Now ask yourself where do you belong? This might be a hometown or a state or a country. And feel that connection you have with that place. And notice what other places do you feel comfortable or connected to? And also what places do you feel like you don't belong? Are there places that you don't want to connect with? And see that gauge, and just ask from zero to 100% what percentage of the planet do you feel connected to. And now ask how is your connection with greater intelligence or the source? Does it feel like there's no one or nothing out there? Does it feel like a one-way conversation that you have? Or maybe it's a occasional dialogue or even a full time two-way connection. Or you might just not be sure, or you haven't really tried to connect. And put up a gauge and just notice from zero to 100% how connected do you feel to the greater intelligence? Now tune in to your total potential for experiencing connection as a spirit, and just notice how much more experience of connection can you have than you have right now. And imagine yourself feeling fully supported and fully abundant and fully connected. What would this feel like for you? How would this change your life? Great, and just give yourself a deep breath, and open your eyes. So welcome back; I hope you enjoyed that simple journey. Just getting an idea of those numbers. How connected are you to the planet? How connected do you feel to other people, and how connected do you feel to the source? And over the next few days, you're going to notice that those numbers go way up as we activate that connection that you have with each of those. Tomorrow we're going to start with nature 'cause that's really easy, and we're going to activate that connection with nature and with the planet. Now the Challenge Day is where we're going to connect with other people because it can be a little challenging because some people we don't like or we don't agree with or we don't want to connect with them, but you are connected with everybody. So that's your Challenge Day. We're going to work on that connection with all humans. On the Wow Day, we're going to do your connection with the divine, and this is really powerful, really great to get that different sense of yourself and that deep connection with all that is. So today, I'd like you to practice a little bit in your daily life. Just start to notice the connection with the planet. Notice your connection with other people; notice your connection with the divine, and just enjoy that sense of enhanced connection. So I look forward to seeing you tomorrow. Thank you for today, and if you'd like to share, why don't you share your biggest question that you have about spirit connection. Thanks again; I will see you tomorrow.

LESSON 36: Connecting With Nature

--------------------
Meditation: Day 36 - Connecting With Nature
--------------------

Hello everyone, I’m Jeffrey Allen. Welcome to day six of your Spirit Awareness Challenge. This is your easy success day for your connection awareness. So what I want you to get today is I want you to feel your connection with nature and the planet and really feel grateful for being alive right now. And this is so great for stress relief when you really appreciate the beauty all around you. You feel so much better. It’s also great for perspective. So taking a little breather from the details that might have your attention or stress to just enjoy the bigger picture. All right, so let’s dive in. Notice a point across the room where your eyes rest naturally. Focus on this point and be present right behind your eyes. Notice your breath and breathe your eyes closed, maintaining that same awareness right behind your eyes. As you breathe, Feel your energy extending into your body. Feel it reaching into your shoulders and your arms. And breathe into your torso and your abdomen. And all the way into your legs and your feet. As you inhale, bring energy into your body and oxygen into your body. And exhale out fatigue and carbon dioxide. And as you feel that oxygen coming in, notice where it came from. Feel the air all around you as you breathe. And notice the air being connected to the outdoors. Feel the air around your building. Feel the air all around the planet. And notice where has your breath been. Begin to notice the trees and the plants. They’re taking in your carbon dioxide. and giving out the oxygen that you breathe. Feel gratitude for all of these plants right now. Without them, you could not live. And really breathe in this gift from the plants to you. Now notice the water that’s feeding these plants. From the earth up through their roots, all the way through the plants. And notice where the water came from. And feel the springs and the rivers and the waterfalls. Feel all the lakes and the oceans full of beautiful water. And notice the clouds and the rain bringing that water to you. Smile and admire the beauty of it all. Imagine you’re taking a sip of pure water right now. Be grateful for this gift from the earth and the sky. And feel that water as it comes into your body, making it all the way into your blood, into your veins. Feel that water in your heart. And just notice, where has your water been? Now feel your muscles and your organs nice and moist in your body. And feel your bones and your eyes. Feel your teeth. Feel all the minerals. that make up your body and your skin and your hair. Remember your favorite food that bright all these nutrients to you. And notice, where did this food come from? What plants or animals gave you this meal? And reach out with gratitude to them right now, because without them, you would not be alive. Extend that gratitude to all plants. and all animals on the planet. Feel your connection with them right now. Let your awareness extend all around the entire planet. Feel your connection with all the air. Feel your connection with all the water. Feel your connection with all of the earth and the minerals. Feel your connection with the plants. Feel your connection with the animals as well. Imagine your body is a small piece of earth, just some water. some earth and some air, because there’s nothing in your body that’s not of the earth. Just ask yourself right now, how connected are you to nature and the planet? Breathe in air, breathe out gratitude. Again, breathe in the air and breathe out gratitude. Smile and open your eyes. Welcome back. Great job. I hope you’re feeling that deep, yummy connection that you have with the planet. And if you want to deepen this awareness today, look up from your daily tasks and appreciate the beauty that’s around you. And practice this last part. Just breathe in the air and breathe out gratitude. And when you’re eating or drinking, notice where it came from and be grateful. And before you go, remember to share your experience. This helps you integrate it into your habit and your daily life. So I’d love to know, what does being connected to nature mean to you? Thanks so much for today. I will see you tomorrow.

========================================

LESSON 37: Connecting With People

--------------------
Meditation: Day 37 - Connecting With People
--------------------

Hello everybody, I’m Jeffrey Allen. Welcome to day seven of your Spirit Awareness Challenge. This is your challenge day for your connection awareness. What I want you to get today is the sense of your inherent connection with people, and not just the people you like, but all people. And this is really great for developing compassion and for seeing the world in a hopeful and positive way. Now this can be a challenge, seeing everyone as a human. regardless of whether you agree with them or like them or maybe fear them or despise them. So sometimes this is a tall order, but today’s your challenge day, so that’s okay. Just do your best and have some amusement and have fun. All right, so let’s begin. Notice a place across the room where your eyes rest naturally. Focus on that point and be right behind your eyes. Pick a place on your breath to breathe your eyes closed. maintaining that same awareness behind your eyes. Let your awareness move into that room in the center of your head and close the doors on your thoughts about work and relationship and planning. Just be alone in this quiet and peaceful room. Imagine the person you connect with most easily right now. You can completely be yourself around this person. And notice how good and easy it feels. And ask yourself, was it always that way with this person? What was your relationship like before you got this close? Have you had any fights or been hurt by them? What was it that brought you back together? Was it your connection or a new understanding of this person? Or perhaps just love? Feel that… that brought you together right now. And notice your circle of friends that have similar interests and beliefs, where you have that deep sense of belonging. Pick anyone in that group and notice one difference that you have. Something you don’t agree on, but you choose to overlook. Notice that you like this friend anyway, even though you disagree. Smile and notice how that feels. And feel the other perspective. What traits or opinions do you have that a close friend disagrees with? Notice how they still love you and value you, even though you’re different. And notice how that feels. Think of someone you know well now that you really couldn’t relate to before. Remember how strange… annoying or intimidating they felt originally. And notice, how did that relationship change? What did you learn about them that changed your mind? Maybe you were misinterpreting their actions, or their words, or their thoughts. Be grateful that you can change your mind. Now imagine one person you know personally that you’ve had a falling out with. Someone you liked before. but you don’t like in the present moment? Maybe they said or did something offensive to hurt you? And remember what happened. How long ago was that? Does it feel good to dislike this person now? Remember a time when you said or did something you regretted? Something foolish or hurtful in the heat of the moment? Did it make you a bad person? No. Do you feel the same way now? Think about this person again that you dislike now. And notice what was it you enjoyed about this person before. Can you feel it now? Would you like to? Focus on this person’s positive traits right now. Find one thing to admire or remember to feel grateful for. See them as a person. instead of as the words or actions that hurt you. Let that feeling grow. Feel that admiration, gratitude, energy getting bigger and bigger. Smile. Feel your positive connection with this person again. How does that feel? Remember how good it feels to be connected with this person or with another close friend. Feel how easily you breathe. Let this feeling of easy connection begin radiating from you. Feel it connecting you with all your friends. Feel that connection with all the people you’ve met before. Feel your connection with all the people you identify with in your culture. Let this feeling get stronger and spread further away. Notice how contagious a positive connection is. Smile. Feel your connection with everyone in your country, even those you disagree with or haven’t met. Feel connected with them as people. regardless of their opinions. Let that connection spread around the world. And notice the different cultures and colors and dress. Imagine a positive conversation and connection with all of these people. See their smiles. Feel their hearts. Even feel your connection with the people in greatest pain or confusion. Those who are causing harm to others. If they felt connected, they wouldn’t do such things. Find some compassion for how much pain they must be feeling, and be grateful that you are feeling connection instead. Feel all the people as humans on the planet, regardless of look or deeds, and bring your awareness back to yourself. Feel your heart being more open and more compassionate. Give yourself a deep breath, smile, and open your eyes. Welcome back. Great job. I tossed in some big challenges. So if today was difficult, I promise that tomorrow will be more fun. And it can be hard to see past the pain that people cause and see them as people in pain rather than people causing pain, both of which are true. Yet… shift is the only way that we can get past this era of violence and separation and wars. Because we’re truly all in it together. And when you can feel this, the world is a less scary and more connected and compassionate place. If you want to deepen this awareness today, let yourself feel connected with someone new today that you haven’t connected deeply with before. You might want to try this every day. And of course, before you go, please share to help it integrate into your awareness. What were you able to change with your connection with others today? Thanks so much for today, and I will see you tomorrow.

========================================

LESSON 38: Connecting With Nature

--------------------
Meditation: Day 38 - Connecting With Source
--------------------

Hello everyone, I’m Jeffrey Allen. Welcome to day 8 of your Spirit Awareness Challenge. This is your wow day for your spirit connection awareness, where you get a new experience or do something that you didn’t know was possible. Today, I want to do that by having you feel your connection with the source. Now, I was searching for a word that I thought would work for everyone, but I couldn’t really find one. I like words like higher intelligence or infinite or divine or source, but you might need to substitute in your favorite word. So you could try like god or goddess or higher power or universe or science or love or whatever word works for you. All belief systems are welcome here. So this practice today is great for knowing that there is more to you and your life than meets the eye and for feeling deeply and unconditionally loved by something larger than you. Now many of you have felt this connection already, maybe in meditation or yoga or even tantra. or at church or in communion or in prayer. And your divine connection is not tied to any religion or set of beliefs. You could be atheist and still enjoy your connection to the universe. So be relaxed, set your intention to enjoy this connection, have a good time, and let’s begin. Find that point across the room where your eyes rest naturally. Focus on that point and be right behind your eyes. When you’re ready, breathe your eyes closed, maintaining that same awareness right behind your eyes. Let yourself be in that room in the center of your head and begin to close the doors on any thoughts about work and relationship and planning. Just be by yourself in this quiet and peaceful room. Stretch your awareness out in front of you. all the way to the front of your space, to the back, stretch your awareness to the left and the right, and stretch your awareness up and down as well. Notice these points around you, the front, the right, the back, the left, and above and below. Connect these points with straight lines from the front to the right, right to the back, Back to the left. And left to the front. Now connect all four of those points to the point above you. See four lines angling up. Until you’re sitting in a pyramid pointed up. Now feel the four points around you. And connect them all to that point right below you. Four lines angling down. So you have a pyramid pointed down as well. And see yourself from a small distance away where you can see this geometry around your body. Pyramid pointed up and a pyramid pointed down. Suzanne octahedron. And very easily make a copy of that geometry in the same place around your body. And give that new one a little spin to the right, like a toy top. Very easily make one more copy. of that geometry in the same place around your body and give this one a little spin to the left along that same axis. Let your awareness be inside this geometry again. You can feel it spinning around you. Let yourself increase that spin. Imagine you can turn a knob and make it spin faster and feel yourself getting lighter and brighter and expanding as this geometry accelerates. And let it keep getting faster and faster until everything feels a little blurry. Let it go faster still until you’re feeling like you’re starting to lift off. It’s floating up and up and up as this geometry spins faster and faster around you. As you’re traveling up, notice that extremely bright light up ahead. the source of all light. As you move into and merge with that light, feel a deep presence, a deep breath, and intelligence all around you. Feel welcome, feel gratitude and acceptance, and feel love. Let go of your smaller self and merge with this greater awareness now. Be aware of all that is. Feel yourself ever expanding, ever shining. Feel that unlimited potential of all that is. Notice that potential spinning into a galaxy. Feel the planets forming around a star. And see the planet Earth as it’s cooling down and becoming its present form. Feel all the animals and plants, the water and the air. Notice your body and admire it from this perspective. Be in your body now. Feel your full infinity in the center of your head. Feel your atoms resonating with it. infinite spin. Notice your breath and your body, smooth and deep. Notice how expanded you feel, how connected you are to all that is. Without changing your awareness or your breath, gently open your eyes. Welcome back. Great job, you infinite being you. I hope you’re feeling really incredible. Take this awareness with you into your day today. If you have time, spend a few more minutes right now on your own and really absorb this feeling. If you start to feel small again, give your geometry a little spin. And of course, please share with me how this experience was for you. Thank you so much for being you. I’ll see you tomorrow.

========================================

LESSON 39: Connection Applications & Seeing Future Friendships
--------------------

Hi, everybody; I'm Jeffrey Allen, and welcome to Day 9 of your Spirit Awareness Challenge. Congratulations; you have activated your connection awareness. And this is so important because when we don't feel connected, it's easy to be lonely and in competition and greed and even harm other people. But when we feel connected, all those things go away. We feel like the universe has our back, and we feel like we don't want to hurt people, we don't need to compete with people. And this is great because the planet right now is shifting from this old separation awareness into this new connected awareness. And this is what is going to happen where we're going to see the change of less violence, less terrorism. And eventually, all that competition will go away. It's a really exciting time. I'm totally looking forward to it. Now, you have already activated that awareness inside you. So even if you were sleeping in some of the exercises or you didn't get everything perfectly, the activation is inside. So now, to continue to grow this awareness, you just need to practice and share with other people. So let me give you a few examples of ways that I like to practice this connection awareness. The first one is a technique that I learned from a good friend, John Dumas. He's an amazing shamanic astrologer and musician. And he taught me that you start the day with a glass of water. You just go outside, and you just start to feel connected to everything, to the sky and the trees and the whole planet. And you just feel gratitude for being alive and being here in a body. And you take some of that water and pour it out and give to the land and then drink the rest of that gratitude into your body. And I love this practice because throughout the day, I feel so much more connected if I really start with that basic connection in the morning. Now, another thing you can do is to, just start to not take things quite so personal. So when you go into the world, you'll notice that if somebody cuts you off in line or somebody honks at you or does something in their car, you have a tendency to want to separate yourself from that person and think that they're a bad person. Now, instead of thinking that, I want you to shift your mind and start to think of that person as someone who, perhaps, who's in pain or is in a hurry or they're having a bad day and just have compassion for that person. It's very simple to do, and it makes you feel a lot better too. Now my wife, Hisami, has kind of a fun way that she does this. If something happens that's unexpected or inconvenient or difficult, she always says the same thing; she just says, "Ah, today is this day." And I love the simplicity of that because there's no judgment of it. There's no resistance to it. It's just an acknowledgement of, "Oh, this happened, and today is like this." So that's another technique that you can use that's really easy for you. So other techniques you can use is in your relationships, when you meet somebody new, you want to really connect with that person and have that thought in your mind that they're on the same team. That team of being humans, that team; it's all connected. And you'll notice that it makes this so much more easy to communicate and so much more fun to be around new people. Work is also a great place to experience this connection. And I'll tell you a good story. When I moved to Sedona, I heard that there's just too many people here that are healers. There's too much competition. And so there's a workplace competition that's so common was present even here. And I thought, "I don't want to match that. I just want to go right into a cooperation space." And so what I did was I gave away a hundred free healings to healers here in Sedona. And then I put a little picture of them and a little bio of them up on a webpage I had. We just did a little free marketing for them too. And what happened was, not only did I make a bunch of good friends and have a lot of beautiful connections and experiences, but Google actually really liked that page and brought me a lot of business through my website. So not only was it good personally, but it was great businesswise too, to just start out by thinking of us all on the same team and that we're all in it together instead of thinking of it as a competition for some scarce resources. Now, you can also do a little more advanced steps with this awareness. And the first one we studied a little bit in the last couple of days. So the first day we started with that connection of, connecting with nature and just feeling that connection that's very easy all around you. The second day we did the Challenge Day where you're connecting with other people. And sometimes that's a little bit hard because we don't always like people or we don't always agree with people. And those people we tend to want to disconnect and get away from. And I would encourage you to look for those places where you have a long-standing grievance and to practice letting it go, just like we did in that exercise because you don't want to carry that heavy energy with you to your grave. You want to let that go and set yourself free and perhaps have some great times with that other person after you let that go. Now, of course we also did, yesterday, that big connection where we're connecting with the Divine. And that's a fantastic way to just feel yourself from a whole different perspective and really get a just a deep felt sense that we are all in it together. So just another beautiful exercise. So one of the most challenging applications that I find with this connection awareness is when you're noticing somebody that's causing pain in the world. So you see somebody doing some violence or some kind of terrorism, and immediately we want to separate from those people and think that they're bad people. And what we want to do instead, is think that "Yes, that person is causing pain. There's nothing right about what they're doing. But they're doing it because they're a person in pain." Right, so when you think about, instead of people causing pain, think of them as people in pain, suddenly you have some compassion. Because to have an act like that to harm a lot of people, you have to feel very separate, very competitive. You can't be feeling connected with other people. You just can't do that. And so imagine how much pain that person must be in to be in that situation. And don't make it worse. Don't make it worse by separating yourself from them. Don't excuse what they did; it's certainly not okay. But see them as people in pain, and just hope that they will get out of that pain; hope that they will feel less separate and more connected to everybody in the world because that's the only thing that's going to bring us out of this era of violence and harming people. And I believe we really are coming out of that era which is is a good thing. I'm excited to see the results. So that's kind of the most challenging way to do it. Some other easy things is if you have an opportunity just to connect with people that are different from you, so, different from your normal groups, different from your normal beliefs, maybe they're part of a different political party, just make friends with that person. Because you'll notice that if you make friends with somebody, it's really easy to feel connected. And the beliefs and stories don't really matter so much. If you have a chance, it's also great to live in a foreign country. I live in Japan, and I notice that I'm so different from Japanese people and culture and everything. But the longer I'm there, I notice that I'm also extremely similar because we're all people inside. Regardless of our culture and our upbringing, we're all people. So it's a nice way to feel that connection. I had a really great experience with working with this connection around an event with terrorism. This was actually on 9/11. At the time I was connected to many different healers, and I got a group together as it was still happening, as it was still... the attack was underway. And we started doing energy work and sending healing to people. Of course, first we started with the victims that were in harm or had died or were scared. And we also worked with the rescue workers to help them. And then we noticed that there were more people that needed help too. We started doing healing work for the government and for the people that had difficult decisions to make and who were wondering what to do next. And then we noticed that the terrorists needed some help too, and we started doing healing work for the terrorists. and just helping them to feel like they're connected and they don't need to do these acts of terror. And just sending them love and sending them healing. And it sounds really strange, but this is what we felt in the energy that really needed to happen. Now, a couple years later, I was getting a healing from this wonderful healer, Rafael, in Mount Shasta. And I fell asleep during the healing, and she didn't know about my experience on 9/11, but she told me afterward, she said as soon as I fell asleep, an Islamic woman came as a spirit and thanked me for helping her when she died. And then she said a long line of people, about 200 spirits came, one after another, throughout the entire healing, just saying "Thank you" for helping them with their death process on that day on 9/11. And it was really fantastic because you don't usually get validation when you're doing energy work like this. There's many times when you're sending love or sending healing or good intentions out into the world where you don't know for sure if it really made a big difference. But occasionally like this, you'll get that feedback and realize that, "Wow, it really is working. and it really makes a difference." And I'm telling you this because I want you to know that the work that you're doing when you're sanding your positives thoughts out, when you're visualizing connections, that you are making a big difference in the world. And it's really important because that's what's going to change the world. Now, I want to do a really fun exercise today, just to kind of wrap up this spirit awareness. And go ahead and relax, and just close your eyes and find that comfortable place right behind your eyes. And let your awareness move into that room in the center of your head. And begin feeling that connection that you have to nature and to people and to the Divine. And get that feeling of being connected with a very best friend, either in the present or in the past. And notice how it feels with this person. Notice how much you appreciate them and love them. And notice how free you feel around this best friend. Now, assume that you have three new best friends that you haven't met yet. Feel that connection with these new people, these kindred spirits. And imagine yourself laughing with them and enjoying yourself. And know that these people are really there. And with your intuition, start to notice what are these three new best friends like? What is their personality like? Maybe what they look like. Or if they have a little accent. Just notice anything you can about each of these three new best friends. And really feel that connection. Feel a line of energy from your heart to each of these three other people. Let yourself connect even though you haven't met them in person yet. And now, let your awareness zoom out a little bit. So you're looking down at the earth. And follow that connection, that line from your heart, to each of these three people. And notice where are these new best friends on the planet right now? And go a little deeper and see if you can notice where will you meet? What will it look like or feel like? And just feel how nice your life will improve, how nice it will be to meet these new people. And now, imagine that the same is true for every person on the planet. Everybody on the planet has three new best friends that they have yet to meet. See those energy connections from each of their hearts, those three new best friends. See everybody's smiles as they're meeting these friends, and hear their laughter. And imagine how much nicer the world will be. Bring your awareness back to that room in the center of your head and feel that whole room vibrating, that connection and friendship and joy feeling, and shine this energy out into your day. Give yourself a deep breath. And when you're ready, open your eyes. Oh, welcome back. Good job. I hope you enjoyed that fun exercise and you could see the planet in a new and more connected and more happy way. Now, I encourage you to try this out in your daily life. So when you meet somebody new, just ask yourself, "Could this be my new best friend?" Now, it sounds funny, but I have a good friend, Annie, who's a fantastic astrologer. And she does this when she meets people: she'll connect with them deeply; she'll really listen to them. And then many times she'll say, "Wow, you are amazing. You're my new best friend." And it's kind of funny because she does it a lot. But I have to say, it feels really good when she says it to you. And she's one of the most connected people; she's got so many friends. And she's really authentically an incredibly happy person. And I think that a good part of that is because she loves that connection with other people. So I encourage you to try that in your day. Notice the new friends that you're meeting around you. And today, think about one thing that you would like to do with your new awareness, either your intuition or your connection awareness. Think of one application that you can do with it to improve your life in some way. And then share that application with everybody else. And then you can try it out tomorrow on our Integration Day. So thanks so much for today. And again, congratulations on completing your connection activation. And I look forward to seeing you tomorrow.

Part 5: Emotion-Awareness (Feeling & Empathy)

========================================


========================================

LESSON 41: Welcome to Emotion Awareness
--------------------

Hi everybody; I'm Jeffrey Allen, and welcome to day one of your Emotion Awareness Challenge. Now emotional awareness is one of my favorite awarenesses to look at, and I saved it till the end here because it tends to be a little bit more unconscious than the other types of awareness because we we like to hide our emotions. But I know that now you've got your awareness up pretty good. You've been practicing your tools, and you can handle it now and really get in and see the emotions in a really good way. Now, I've been practicing helping people with their emotions and kind of understanding them and unwinding them and finding out what's happening there for about 10 years in private sessions. And this is super fun because it's kind of like being a little sleuth, where you're looking inside and finding out what is this emotion? And where did it come from? How do you let it go? It's actually very fun to work with emotions; it's kind of a surprise. And this is what I want to share with you in this training, is get you to that same place where, for other people's emotions and your own emotions, you've just got a curiosity and enthusiasm and excitement about working with emotions instead of kind of, you know, not wanting to deal with them. Now, it's pretty easy for me to tune into emotions and work with people and express my own emotions and so on, but it wasn't always that way. So my background is really more from the mental side of the game. I was very mental in college, and the mind was kind of the important thing, and emotions were just something that, like, I kind of didn't understand, didn't really value that much. And it was pretty frustrating because I actually had a very high emotional sensitivity, but I had a very low emotional awareness. And so, this led to me feeling like it was pretty hard to communicate, and I really didn't know how I was feeling most of the time. Basically, I just kind of was either happy or I was grumpy and didn't understand. And this might sound familiar to some of you, and what happened over the years, was that I started to notice that emotions are different than what I thought, that emotions are playing all the time. So, all of your emotions are playing inside you all the time and around you all the time. It's a bit like a radio station; if you think about how the radio works, all the radio stations are playing all at the same time, but you don't hear them all because you've just got the dial set to a particular station. And your emotions are like this, they're all playing all the time. You have all the emotions inside you, and your station tuner will go to one or the next, and that's when it'll kind of come up, and you'll feel the emotion. And with practice, you can learn how to tune that dial where you want it to be. And this is really fantastic because as the emotional awareness goes up, it feels like you're a lot more level and that you're kind of more in control of your emotions. And I say that because when you don't have emotional awareness, it definitely feels like things are out of control; they just kind of happen. Most of us have a default emotional state that kind of gets triggered at times. And for me, mine was anger, and people laugh when I tell them this now 'cause I'm not an angry person. But before, I had this anger inside me; I didn't even know it was there, but it was there all the time. It was just something that had happened when I was a kid, that I was angry about, and never let go. And this anger was the default emotion. So, if something was surprising, boom, I got angry. If, you know, pretty much anything that happened, if it was out of my control, anger would come up in me, whether expressed or not. Like I said, I didn't even know this was happening. And what I did to clear this over the years, and kind of get out of that space, was I learned some really important emotional tools. I learned one, that it's much better to be honest and aware of your emotions than to kind of stuff 'em and hide 'em, right? And to do that, you have to get out of judgment. You have to stop thinking of your emotions and yourself as something bad or someone bad when you're having your emotions. And then, of course, you need to clear your unconscious triggers. So, whatever's kind of popping those, making them come up, if you can clear those, you'll feel a lot better. And then starting to view your emotions as just signposts along the way. So they're helping you understand where you are, so you can make a choice, and move to somewhere different if you choose. So they're not destinations that you have to hang out at; they're just signposts along the way. Now, the way that I got myself kind of out of this stuck place, out of this low awareness, was I took a two-year training class with The ManKind Project. It's actually just a weekend training, and then I studied with a group of men. Every week, for several hours, we'd get together and just dive in really deep to emotional work. And we were together for two years, and over that time, just amazing emotional progress happened. After a year in there, these guys were... I mean, we're really close; we're talking about everything. We totally trust each other. And it took me a year before I realized that I wasn't being honest, not with them, I wasn't being honest with myself, and so I couldn't be honest with them. It was a big breakthrough. And then, about a year later, I was getting pretty good at like, "Oh, what am I actually feeling?" "How do I express it?" "How do I let go of any judgments about it?" And then of course, in the last 10 years, I've worked with a lot of people who have similar emotional things or working on getting their emotional awareness up. And it's fantastic. And I'm really excited about this particular part for you. We're going to work in two different sections for your emotions. The first awareness is going to be just in the feeling part. "So how do you feel your emotions?" And we'll start with that today. The second part is about empathy which is actually feeling other people's emotions or connecting with the energy that's around you. And I'll talk about that in more detail when we get there. So, let's go ahead and get started on the feeling part. Today we're going to do that self-assessment. Tomorrow we're going to go into an easy exercise where we can just feel all those emotions inside you. The Challenge Day, we're going to go in and look at "How do you find that default emotion for you?" Mine was anger, but how do you find yours? And then clear it and start to get rid of that, so you don't have that, you know, kind of burst of anger, sadness, or fear, whatever comes up as the default for you. And then, of course, on the Wow Day we're going to just go to build a little map where all your emotions actually lead to gratitude and joy if you know how to do that. So that'll be the Wow Day. So, let's dive in for today and do your self-assessment. Go ahead and close your eyes. Let your awareness be right behind your eyes and in the center of your head. Smile and be amused. And say hello to your emotional self. Imagine your emotional self is standing out in front of you. What do you see? Can you see your emotional self? Do you like your emotional self? Are you friends? Do you judge your emotional self? Are you enemies? Let's check the basic five emotions for you, and just notice do they feel like they're positive or negative or neutral for you? And use a little gauge; positive, negative, and neutral. So, first check happiness. Is this a positive emotion, Negative emotion, or neutral? How about sadness? Is this positive? Or negative? Or neutral? What about anger? Do you see it as positive, or negative, or neutral? And fear? Is it positive, negative, or neutral for you? What about shame? Positive, negative, or neutral? Ask yourself, "How are your emotions affecting your satisfaction with your life?" Is it positive, they're adding to it? Negative, where they're taking away from your satisfaction? Or just neutral? Ask yourself, "How are your emotions affecting your personal relationships?" Are your emotions having a positive effect on your relationships? A negative effect? Or neutral? How about your business relationships? How are your emotions affecting your business relationships? Are they having a positive effect? A negative effect? Or neutral? Now notice how do you like your emotions? Are they fun, or amusing, kind of curious? Are they the spice of life? Or do you feel frustrated or resentful or disgusted with your emotions at times? Do you wish you didn't have some of them? And now, notice what happens when you are surprised. Do you laugh? Go into happiness? Do you start swearing or fighting; go into anger? Do you go into a shock or a freeze state with fear? Do you apologize and feel some shame? Or maybe you start crying and move into sadness. Notice, for you, what is your default emotion? Which one comes up unconsciously, more often? And just notice do you want to change this? Would it feel good to you to make a change? Be amused. Smile. And really stretch into your body. Breathe. And open your eyes. All right, welcome back. Good job,; I hope you got a little more familiar with how you feel about your emotions, and if you're friends with them or if they're negative or positive. And we're going to work tomorrow on letting them all be positive emotions. Actually, for the next three days we'll do that, where all your emotions are okay. They're actually positive; they're doing something useful. And how do you use them, not get stuck in them, but kind of use them to move to the next step. So, I would love to hear today one emotional success story for you. So one time where you felt like your emotions really helped you or helped others. And if you want to practice a little more today, get a deeper awareness, just notice what is that default emotion for you during the day; what's kind of running in the background? Sadness, fear, happiness, shame, anger; whatever it is for you. Thank you so much for today, and I will see you tomorrow.

LESSON 42: Feeling Your Emotions

--------------------
Meditation: Day 42 - Feeling Your Emotions
--------------------

Hello everyone, I’m Jeffrey Allen. Welcome to day two of your emotion awareness challenge. This is your easy success day for your emotional feeling awareness. And what I want you to get today is just an acceptance that you have all your emotions inside you and a permission to feel and have all of your emotions. And this is important because you really want to be the authentic you without any… BS or guilt or feeling like you have to hide because it feels so good when you can be that authentic you emotionally. And it doesn’t just feel good for you. It feels good to everybody else too. And so this is really great for you feeling good and also other people feeling more comfortable around you. So let’s begin. Find a point across the room where your eyes rest naturally. Focus on that point and be right behind your eyes. Notice your breath. And when you’re ready, breathe your eyes closed. Be really present in your body. Stretch your awareness into your arms and your legs and all around your body. And smile a happy smile. Smile with your energy body too. And notice the immediate effects in your body. Where do you feel this smile? And put up a gauge for… How much permission you have to feel happy, from zero to 100%. How much permission do you have to feel happy? And just take that gauge, if it’s not at 100%, and move it up to 100%. Give yourself 100 % permission to feel the happiness that’s already in your body, to let that awareness come in when needed, and let that awareness go out when it’s not needed. Remember a time when you were deeply happy. What was happening? How old were you? Feel the emotion of happiness right now in your body. What does deep happiness feel like to you? Now let the event go and just feel the emotion by itself. Be aware of yourself behind your eyes, feeling happiness in your body. So you are awareness and consciousness, and you are feeling happiness. You’re not the happiness itself. Let this emotion go and be right behind your eyes. Breathe. Now make a sad frown. Sad eyes. Have a sad posture and sad feelings. And notice the effects in your body. Where do you feel the sadness? And look at that gauge. How much permission do you have to feel sadness? Between zero and 100 %? And adjust that gauge now. Give yourself 100 % permission to feel the sadness that’s already in your body. To let it come into your awareness when needed. And let it go out of your awareness when not needed. And remember a time when you were deeply sad. What was happening? How old were you? Feel the emotion of sadness right now in your body. What does deep sadness feel like to you? Now let the event go and just feel the emotion by itself. Be aware of yourself behind your eyes, feeling sadness in your body. So you are consciousness and awareness and you’re feeling sadness. You’re not the sadness itself. Now let this emotion go and be right behind your eyes. Breathe. Make an angry scowl. A rigid face. A furrowed brow. An angry posture. Notice the effects in your body. Where do you feel this anger? And look at your gauge. How much permission do you have to feel anger? Zero to 100%. And give yourself 100 % permission to feel the anger that’s already in your body. To let this awareness come in when needed and let it go out when it’s not needed. 100 % permission to feel the anger that’s already there. Now, remember a time when you were really angry? Remember what was happening, where you were, how old you were? And feel that emotion of anger. Right now in your body, what does anger feel like to you? Now let the event go and just feel the emotion by itself. Be aware of yourself behind your eyes, feeling anger in your body, and notice that you are awareness and consciousness and you are feeling your anger. You’re not the anger itself. Now let this emotion go. Be right behind your eyes. And breathe. And make a fearful face. Wide eyes. Quivering mouth. A fearful posture. And notice the effects in your body. Where do you feel this fear? Ask your gauge. How much permission do you have to feel fear? From zero. to 100%. And give yourself 100 % permission to feel the fear that’s already in your body, to let this awareness come up when it’s needed, and to let this awareness go down when it’s not needed. Now remember a time when you were really afraid. Remember what was happening, where you were. Feel that emotion of fear right now in the body. What does fear feel like to you? And let the event go and just feel the emotion by itself. Be aware of yourself behind your eyes, feeling fear in your body. So you are awareness and consciousness and you are feeling fear. You are not the fear itself. Let this emotion go. Be right behind your eyes and breathe. Now make a shameful face with your eyes looking down, your chin tucked in, your posture collapsing, and notice the effects in your body. Where do you feel this shame? And check your gauge for how much permission you have to feel shame from 0 % to 100%. And give yourself 100 % permission to feel the shame that’s already in your body. Let this awareness come up when it’s needed and let it go down when it’s not needed. Remember a time when you were feeling deeply ashamed. What happened? Feel that emotion of shame in your body right now. What does shame feel like to you? Now let the event go and just feel the emotion by itself. Be aware of yourself. behind your eyes, feeling shame in the body. And notice that you are awareness and consciousness and you are feeling shame. You are not the shame itself. Let this emotion go. Be right behind your eyes and breathe. Give yourself a few breaths to let all the emotions out. To be pure awareness right behind your eyes. Just breathe and notice how much more room you have in your body now. Give yourself 100 % permission to notice all emotions without becoming them. Notice all your emotions at once now. Happiness, sadness, anger, fear, shame. and all related emotions? Be aware of all of them. Feel them, but don’t become them. Imagine these emotions are your children, and you love each of them. Your job, as their parent, is to help them grow into balanced adults. How will you help your emotions grow up? Breathe. Smile again. And be grateful that you can feel your emotions. Notice your breath. Just be awareness behind your eyes. Stretch. And open your eyes. Welcome back. Great job. And congratulations, you have the full range of emotions. That means you are alive. And I hope you got that sense that you feel your emotions, but that you are not your emotions. You are consciousness. In fact, you felt these emotions before remembering anything just by changing your face. So isn’t that great? You know, emotions really are the flavor of life. They’re only difficult when we become them instead of just feeling them, because then it feels like we have no choice. Or if you can’t let them go, it can be difficult, and we’ll focus on that tomorrow. If you want to deepen your awareness today, just notice when you’re feeling emotions. And whatever they are, just enjoy and accept them. Even if you’re feeling anger or sadness, just enjoy it because you are alive. And I would love for you to share today and just tell me which of these emotions came the easiest for you, even if you didn’t want it to. Is it happiness, sadness, anger, fear, or shame? And tomorrow we’re going to work with transmuting your emotions. So if something deep came up today, just hang in there. Just feel it and we will get to it tomorrow. Thank you so much for today and I’ll see you tomorrow.

LESSON 43: Healing Your Default Emotions

--------------------
Meditation: Day 43 - Healing Your Default Emotions
--------------------

Hello everyone, I’m Jeffrey Allen. Welcome to day three of your emotion awareness challenge. And this is your challenge day for emotional feeling awareness. And what I want you to get today is a sense of how to find and release old stored emotions. Because emotions are great when they’re in motion, but they’re not great when they’re stuck. If you watch a child when they fall down, they will just cry really deeply. And then it’ll all come out, and they’ll get up and play again, and they’re fine because they let the emotion out. And this is more challenging for us as adults because oftentimes our emotions are carefully hidden. You know, we’re afraid to let them out and show people we’re embarrassed or whatever. So today’s exercise is really great for transformational change. In fact, it’s required for you to move those old emotions out because oftentimes this is the biggest thing that’s holding you back. Before we start, tune in real quickly and ask yourself, which is my default unconscious emotion? So when you’re surprised, how do you respond? You respond with laughter? You respond with swearing or fighting, which would be anger? If you’re surprised, do you respond with shock and kind of freeze, which would be fear? Or if you’re surprised, do you apologize? That might be shame. Or if you’re really surprised, do you cry? which would be sadness. Okay, now just notice, because this is your default unconscious emotion. Every answer is okay. If you’re not sure, just pick one to work on today. And if you picked happiness, I want you to pick your second one, your second secret default. So anger, fear, shame, or sadness. And remember, this is your challenge day, right? So just be amused. Okay, let’s begin. Notice a point across the room where your eyes rest naturally. Focus on that point and be right behind your eyes. When you’re ready, breathe your eyes closed and move your awareness into that room in the center of your head. And just admire your nicely organized rooms for relationship and work and planning, etc. Notice how happy your mind is with organization and cleanliness. Create a blue ball of light between your hands for finding things that are hidden. Shine that light around the room and find a door that may have been hidden before. A door that leads down into the room below, the room of your emotions. And notice what does this door look like? Where is it in your room? Was it visible? Was it hidden? Consider descending into that room. How does that make you feel? Are you excited or apprehensive? Maybe exhausted or just neutral? Be amused, however you felt, and begin descending into your emotional room. What does this room look like? Is it bright and clear? Foggy and dark? Organized or chaos? How big is this room? Shine your blue light around and let all the unconscious energy burn away from your emotional room. As that’s happening, give yourself 100 % permission to see what’s here with curiosity and amusement. Notice if there’s one emotional feeling that seems to dominate here, a default emotion that you aren’t quite comfortable with. And notice if it’s the emotion you expected. Turn up that blue light, get curious, and decide to investigate. Listen now to where that default emotion is coming from. Where is it in this room? Start walking toward the source of this default emotion. Let the blue light clear any unconscious energy as you go. Keep walking towards it. You’re getting closer. You’re almost there. Step through any foggy energy and notice where you are. Let yourself be a safe observer. What was the source of this uncomfortable emotion? What happened to you or someone else that caused this pain? Let the blue light change to a divine bright gold light and shine it on this scene. See that gold light beginning to clear any pain or confusion that’s here. Focus on the energy of the emotional pain that’s here. Does this energy have a color, a shape, texture, a sound? Is it just a feeling? Ask yourself, what percentage of this pain is mine? Is this your deep emotional trigger? Or did you adopt it from someone else? Find any portion that’s not yours and be grateful because this part is easy to clear. Right now, let go of responsibility for the part which isn’t yours and let that gold light lift this energy away, releasing all that isn’t yours. For the part that is yours, imagine you can pick it up. You can pick up this emotional pain right now and wrap it in that golden light. Look around for a comfortable place in your emotional room. The perfect place to heal this old emotional pain. Take it to that place now. And as you set it down, notice that it has already changed. See and feel it continuing to change from pain into awareness, from awareness into healing, and from healing to recovery. And from recovery, to forgiveness. Take a moment to feel the shift in your entire emotional room. Breathe. Feel that peace in your emotional room and smile. Return to the main room in the center of your head. See golden light still emanating from your emotional room. Give yourself another deep breath. Stretch and open your eyes. Welcome back. Great job. I hope you had a really powerful journey. Emotions are such a fun and productive space to explore because so much is unconscious, but it doesn’t need to stay that way. To deepen this awareness today, I want you to notice your background or default emotion today, and how do you respond to surprises? And just notice, has it changed? And please share with everyone. Which was your default unconscious emotion, and how has it been affecting your life? Thanks so much for today, and I will see you tomorrow.

LESSON 44: All Roads Lead To Gratitude & Joy

--------------------
Meditation: Day 44 - All Roads Lead To Gratitude & Joy
--------------------

Hello everyone, I’m Jeffrey Allen. Welcome to day four of your emotion awareness challenge. Today is your wow day for your emotional feeling awareness, where you’re going to get a new experience or do something that you didn’t know was possible. I want to do that by letting you in on a little secret about emotions. Although they start in very different places, they actually all point to the same goal. They point to gratitude and joy. You see, emotions are just road signs. They’re telling you where you are now so that you know which way to go next. And we’re going to create a map today from any emotion into gratitude and joy. And this is great for getting out of resistance to your so-called negative emotions and seeing them in a helpful and useful way. So let’s begin. Find a point across the room where your eyes rest naturally. Focus on that point and be right behind your eyes. Notice your breath. And breathe your eyes closed, maintaining that same awareness behind your eyes. Stretch your awareness around in your body right now. Be very present in your body. Move your awareness into the room in the center of your head and create that blue light ball in your hands. As you descend into your emotions room, shine that blue light around with curiosity and intrigue and amusement. And know that this room is a safe place for you to explore your emotions. Go to the place in this room where you feel happiest. Feel that genuine happiness and the gratitude that you can be happy. Feel the joy of having this emotion. And feel the joy to be alive. Find the place in this room where you feel genuine sadness. Maybe something happened that caused you to feel very sad. Let yourself feel that emotion right now and notice the blue light shining around you, illuminating your next step from sadness. Follow that blue light until you feel compassion for yourself and for others who experience sadness. Feel a little relief as you move to this place. Follow that blue light until you feel a connection with everyone else that feels this way. Feel a little relief. Follow that blue light until you feel admiration for the tenacity and the spirit of people facing sadness. Feel a little relief. Follow that blue light into gratitude that you’re not on this journey alone and that people do heal from sadness. And again, feel a sense of relief. Then follow this blue light into joy. Joy to be alive and to have emotions. And feel that relief all throughout you. From this place of joy, see that blue light shining back, connecting all the points along that path from sadness into joy. Move to the place in this room where you feel genuine anger. Maybe something happened. Somebody did something that triggered this anger. Really feel that emotion and see that blue light shining around you. Follow that blue light until you feel motivation because you know what you don’t want, which means you also know what you want. Feel a little relief. Now follow that blue light until you’re taking productive actions. Notice what that feels like. Feel some relief. Follow that blue light one step further where you’re seeing the positive results of your actions. Again, feel relief. And follow that blue light into gratitude that you have positive results. Feel relief. And follow that blue light into joy to be alive. Joy to have your emotions. And see this blue light shining back from this place of joy, connecting all the points on that path from anger into gratitude and joy. Now go to the place in this room where you feel genuine fear. Maybe something happened that scared you. Just feel that fear right now. Notice that blue light illuminating your next step. Follow it until you’re feeling vulnerable and a little relief. Follow it more until you notice that you’re feeling weak and a little relief. Follow it into determination to learn and to overcome. Follow that blue light into courage. To try something, to learn something that’ll help you overcome your fear. Feel a little relief and follow that blue light into practice, that thing that’s going to help you and feel relief. Follow the blue light until you feel progress. Only fear you have is a fear that your fear will come back. Feel relief and follow that blue light until you feel confidence with your new skill. Feel relief. Follow that light until you feel competence. You’re getting good at it. You’re feeling relieved. Follow that light until you feel accomplishment. This new skill that you have. Feel relief. Follow that blue light into gratitude for your accomplishment and your tenacity. And finally, follow that blue light into joy of being alive. Let that blue light shine back, connecting all points along that path, from fear all the way to gratitude and joy. Now move to a place where you feel genuine shame. Maybe there’s something you did, and really feel that shame right now. Notice that blue light around you, showing your next step, and follow it until you feel that self-judgment that comes with shame. Feel a little relief. Follow that blue light into that understanding that you have ethics, you have a sense of right and wrong, of being aligned or misaligned with others. And feel some relief. And follow that blue light until that desire to be aligned, that desire to connect with others. Feel relief. Follow that blue light until you feel bravery. Are you ready to take a risk? Feel some relief. Follow that blue light to where you’re sharing, developing a friendship. Feel relief. Follow that blue light one step further into gratitude. You took a risk that you’re experiencing the rewards. Follow that blue light into the joy of being alive. And see this blue light shining back along that path, illuminating all those steps from shame into gratitude and joy. Be in that feeling of gratitude and joy. Notice all emotions leading to here. Shine that blue light down all these pathways from all emotions to gratitude and joy. And know that you can see this blue light anytime you need it. Move your awareness into that main room in the center of your head. And see that blue light still emanating from that room of your emotions. Just leave that door open for today. Be right behind your eyes. Stretch and breathe. When you’re ready, open your eyes. Welcome back. Great job. I hope you had a fun journey with your emotions. It really can be this easy if you remember that all emotions are helpful road signs, not destinations themselves. To deepen this awareness, I want you to try this one time today. Just notice your emotions, find that blue light, and follow it back on whatever path you take into gratitude and joy. With practice, this will become second nature and you’ll actually learn to really enjoy your emotions. A couple little tips. You don’t want to force yourself. Just move from point to point as you’re ready and do it gracefully. Sometimes this might take a couple days to move from one point to another. That’s okay. Also, you can refine this emotional map in any way that you want. This is just one example. Thank you so much for today. Please share one part of that journey where you went from a difficult or unwanted emotion all the way into gratitude and joy. Again, thanks so much, and I will see you tomorrow.

LESSON 45: Emotion Applications + Intro To Empathy

--------------------

Hi everyone; I'm Jeffrey Allen, and welcome to day five of your Emotion Awareness Challenge. Today you're finishing your activation for your emotional feeling awareness. So congratulations. To do this, we went through those six steps to awareness success. First step was getting more awareness to self-assessing how do you feel about your emotions and which one is your default emotion? And the next day we did the Easy Day where you kind of looked at feeling all of your emotions, just giving yourself permission to really feel them and have them. And I hope it was easy; might have been challenging. And the next day we did the challenging exercise where we looked at that default emotion that kind of pops up and took you in to find that emotion and to heal that and bring it out so it can start to finally clear out of your space. Really powerful exercise; you'll notice that'll just kind of keep going and going; you'll heal more and more from that default emotion. Then yesterday on the Wow Day, we looked at building a map. So whatever emotional state you're in, you can use that blue light and kind of find your way to the next step and the next step and the next step, until eventually you can get all the way back to gratitude and joy. Now keep in mind, sometimes that'll take more than just 10 minutes; sometimes if it's really deep, it may take you a couple days. But if you follow that approach, it's a great way to build and to use your emotional awareness. Now the fifth step and sixth step are just practicing and sharing. And of course, you know, those are up to you. I wrote down some exercises, some applications that you can use to use this awareness and to practice it more, so let's take a look. Okay, first for your personal life, just noticing your emotions, making friends with them, not hiding them, you'll notice that you are going to feel so much better. And seeing them as those signposts that lead to gratitude and joy is a big part of that acceptance and kind of relief; it's okay to have them. If you do find yourself stuck in a particular emotion a lot, think about redrawing a map from that emotion for you all the way into gratitude and joy because you may need a specific map that works just for you and just for your situation. For your relationships, if you can work with just practice not becoming your emotions. And by that, I mean when an emotion comes up, you can feel it, but you don't kind of blow up and become the emotion. And this will also help you talk a little bit more about your emotions with, when you can feel 'em and not become 'em, they're more of a curiosity and you can start to say things like, "Ah, I'm feeling sadness. I wonder why." Or, "I'm starting to feel some anger; I wonder what's going on with me." Because you haven't become them, so you're able to still have a conversation, and you'll find that this is really fun in a partnership because then you get to have a dialogue about it instead of just, you know, blowing up. Much better. And if you're feeling emotionally overwhelmed in your relationship, use that same blue light exercise where you're seeing that blue light and going toward relief to where you feel step-by-step just a little bit better until you can move into gratitude and joy. In your work and money and career space, you'll notice that your high emotions are not always welcome at work. And so if you notice your emotions are getting really high, I encourage you to hold off from doing things like sending emails or making big decisions because you really want to let those emotions pass first because sometimes what feels great when you're emotionally charged isn't the best thing for your career or your friendships. So I encourage you, just be aware of your emotions before you're firing off emails and making decisions. Now, a little more advanced work you can do is go into that emotional room, use that blue light and that divine gold light to clear the unconsciousness and to heal your emotions. You could even organize and explore them a little bit more and just work on, you know, coming from curiosity and nonjudgment, and you'll realize that this is really, really fun. Now, today, we want to move into your next awareness which is your emotional empathic awareness. And your empathy is really a simple word for saying that emotions are contagious. So if people around you are feeling happy, you tend to feel happy. If people around you are feeling grumpy, you tend to feel grumpy. Now, different people have different levels of emotional sensitivity or different levels of empathy. And this doesn't mean that they're aware; this just means that they're sensitive, right? And so for me, for example, I was always very sensitive empathically, but like I mentioned before, I wasn't really that aware of my emotions, so I would tend to, you know kind of match people and not even realize that it wasn't my emotion I was feeling. So if somebody else was upset, I would just be feeling upset and grumpy. I thought it was mine. And people do this all the time, I see this so much in my private sessions, when you start getting this clarity about which of your emotions are actually yours and which emotions belong to other people and you're just feeling, you notice that, wow, all of a sudden some of the big emotional challenges you thought you had aren't even yours, and you don't have to process them or deal with them. You can just let 'em go. And we'll go into that in more detail later. Now it sounds like the empathy, 'cause it's just kind of a problem, you know, like lose yourself, feel other people's emotions, but it's actually a very good social skill too. So people that are highly empathic can fit in really well into social environment. You can also cheer up really easily if you're highly empathic. And if you get it under control so that you are broadcasting what you want, you can actually influence people very effectively with your empathy. And one more kind of fun thing with empathy is that if you're empathically sensitive you tend to enjoy movies more, right? So is there anybody that cries at a sad movie? Yeah, that's me. You know, because you can really feel the emotions, and this is fun because all the emotions are fun. That's why we go to scary movies and we go to like, you know, shoot 'em ups, and we go to sad movies, is that all the emotions are fun and we enjoy feeling them. It's just part of the spice of life. So again, if these are out of balance in you, if your empathy is out of balance, you're going to feel kind of like an emotional sponge, you might feel wishy-washy where you're changing your mind, or get overwhelmed a lot, or be kind of like volatile. And that was me, I was kind of volatile. And if they're just right, the opposite will happen, you'll feel like tuned in to other people, but more importantly, other people will think that like you really get them. When you're around somebody they'll think, "Wow, he or she really gets me and understands me and has compassion for me and has a connection to me." And so if you're a healer or a counselor or work with people in any way, having empathy awareness is fantastic because it allows you to connect, you know; it's a great social skill. Okay, one more thing that's kind of funny is I noticed when I moved to Japan, that there seems to be a big cultural bias with our empathy as well. So in Japan, there was a woman who was working with a friend of mine in the U.S. And at one point, she got really frustrated and said, "I'm just so angry at him because he always thinks about himself first." And I know a little bit about Japanese culture; you know, my wife is Japanese, and I told her, "Well, actually, I don't think you understand American culture; we don't and think about ourselves first, we just think only about ourselves. In fact, that's what we're trained to do: take care of number one." And I said, "But in Japan, they're actually trained from the time they're very young to always think about everybody else first. How will your actions influence somebody else? You always think about the other people before yourself." And I told her, "You know neither one of these is really good or bad; neither of them are actually very balanced. So what you want to do is you want to think about yourself and other people at the same time. You know, you're just kind of equals. Is it good for me? Is it good for everybody else? You don't have to put yourself first, like we learn to do in America, and you don't have to put yourself last like people learn to do in Japan." So just kind of a little fun insight on empathic awareness I wanted to share. Okay, so today we're going to get started with just a self-assessment as we always do. So just relax and get ready. And when you're ready, you can close your eyes. And be present right behind your eyes. And as you breathe, really feel your body present in your body and be relaxed. And think about how sensitive you are, how empathic, or how stable are you with your emotions? Imagine you're feeling really good. And you walk into a room full of grumpy people. Does your mood usually change or do you stay happy? Now what about if you're at work and there's a little noise or you're trying to focus; maybe people are laughing. Is it easy for you to block that out? Or is it completely distracting for you? Now think about your preferences. Do you have strong preferences or weak preferences or kind of suppressed preferences? So for example, if you're going out to dinner with a few friends, and somebody asks, "What would you like for dinner?" How do you respond? Do you tell 'em exactly what you want for dinner? Do you have a strong preference? Or do you say, "I'll just go where everybody else wants to go." You have a weak preference. Or do you go along with the flow, but then get a little angry or have some kind of suppressed resentment or anger about it? The last two are high emotional sensitivity or high empathic sensitivity. And now think about making a decision like a recent decision you had to make. Did you just make the decision quickly based on what works for you? That's a low empathic awareness. Or did you move really slowly and consider all the angles? How's it going to affect everybody? Maybe go back and forth a few times with the decision. This is more of a high empathic awareness. And just notice what are you feeling now? And see if you can notice who you are feeling right now. In fact, put up a little gauge and ask yourself, "From 0 to 100%, what percentage of my emotions that I'm feeling now are mine? And what percentage of my emotions that I'm feeling now are somebody else's?" Just be amused. And let's create a little gauge that we're going to use later on, a simple gauge for deciding is something mine or not mine? You just see that gauge in front of you and test it out by saying your name out loud. Whichever way the gauge went, that's the side that's yours. And then say somebody else's name. Gauge is showing you, ah, that's not yours. Now let's spice this gauge up a little bit. So if you like visuals, add a little color. As you say your name, what color do you get? As you say somebody else's name, what different color do you get? Now add a little bit of sound in there. As you say your name, what do you hear and your tone? And as you say somebody else's name, notice what you hear, a different tone. Add a little feeling and emotion to this gauge, so when you say your name, how does it feel? And when you say somebody else's name, how does that feel? Pick one emotion that you're feeling right now; try out this new gauge. Just ask yourself, "For this emotion, is it mine or is it not mine?" Good, and just be amused, whatever answer you got. Give yourself a deep breath. And when you're ready open your eyes. All right. Welcome back; good job. And whatever answer you got, keep in mind that high or low sensitivity with your empathy is not a good or a bad thing; you just want to know what it is for you. So if you're a person that has strong preferences and you know where you want to go, you make decisions quickly, usually you think of this as a strong person. And you actually are strong in your preference but you have a low empathic sensitivity, and this is probably perfect for you. Now, if you're the other way where you're wishy-washy or you're following the crowd or, you know, you don't have strong preferences, this is totally okay too. This just means that you have a different personality, and you have a high sensitivity with your empathy. Now, either way, we're going to work over the next couple days and help you get a little more practice working with and understanding empathy and especially this idea of what's yours and what's not yours. So if you want to practice this today, use that gauge today as you walk around and just notice a few things that you're feeling, and ask, "Is it mine or not mine?" Okay, great. So please share what that experience was like for you. I'd love to hear, like, what is that gauge like for you? And also, if you have any experiences about empathy that are positive, please share that too. Thanks so much for today, and I will see you tomorrow.

LESSON 46: Being Consciously Empathic

--------------------
Meditation: Day 46 - Being Consciously Empathic
--------------------

Hello everyone, I’m Jeffrey Allen. Welcome to day six of your Emotion Awareness Challenge. This is your easy success day for your empathy awareness. And what I want you to get today is just a sense that you can easily change the channel on your empathy and your emotions, and that you can use your empathy to tune into the emotions that you want to. And this is really great for changing your emotional state consciously and building up that emotional confidence that you really have control or that you’re not out of control with your emotions. Okay, so let’s begin. Find a point across the room where your eyes rest naturally. Focus on that point and breathe your eyes closed. Have that same awareness behind your eyes as you move into the center of your head. Admire this space, this room in the center of your head, and make your way into the room of your emotions right now. Remember, this is a safe place to explore your emotions with curiosity and clarity. Think about your favorite comedian, your funniest person you know, or some joke that you love. And notice how you feel. As you think about this person, notice how much fun they’re having and start to match their energy. As you do, notice how you become funnier too. And notice, do you have any friends who make you funnier? It’s because you’re matching their energy. Now remember a favorite scene in a movie where one of the characters is having some deep emotions. Notice what they’re feeling. It might be sadness or fear or anger or joy. Can you feel those emotions with them? Now think of a speaker that you really admire, somebody giving a really inspiring speech. Can you feel the strength of their emotions? How does this help you align behind their cause? Now imagine you’re in your life now. Imagine you’re working in an office where you interact with other people. And you’re in some public space in this office and you’re feeling really positive. Really feel that positive energy, that positive mood right now. Next, someone feeling negative walks into the space. They’re grumpy and complaining. By the time they leave, you’re feeling grumpy and negative too. Feel that energy. Congratulations, you’ve matched their energy and their mood. Be amused. Next, imagine someone feeling positive walks in. They’re bright and they’re happy, laughing and smiling. Feel yourself beginning to cheer up. And remember your positive mood. Congratulations, you’ve matched their energy and mood. Just be amused. Now rewind the scene and be aware of your empathy, your ability to match other people’s energy and emotions. Remember you’re in the space, you’re feeling really positive, and someone feeling negative walks into the room. Empathically, you feel what they feel. You notice they are feeling negative. And you’re aware, but you don’t become their emotions. Just hold on to your positive emotional state. And now say something to validate yourself and to validate them. Something like, sounds like you’re grumpy. I’m actually feeling really good today. Just acknowledge and be aware of their emotions without matching their emotions. Notice how that feels. Now imagine the positive person walks in. Notice their positive energy, but keep your own positive energy. Say something like, you look really positive today. I’m feeling great too. And notice that you can be independently happy. Notice that your emotions are your responsibility. It’s not the grumpy person’s fault that you matched their energy. That’s your responsibility. That’s your fault. If you take responsibility, this will stop happening. Say out loud now, my emotions are my responsibility. Smile and be grateful. One more time. My emotions are my responsibility. Great. Now let’s really put this to the test. Imagine now you get called into a private meeting with somebody that’s grumpy about you. Maybe they didn’t like something you did and they’re not being very nice about it. As you experience this, remember, my emotions are my responsibility. Their emotions are their responsibility. Notice their emotions, but keep your happiness. And while this person’s being grumpy to you, notice the phone rings and it’s their spouse. When they answer, they’re suddenly happy and cheerful and kind to their spouse. Just notice their emotions and be amused. And when they hang up and say, ah, where was I? And then they get grumpy again. Just watch and be amused. Their emotions have nothing to do with you. As they get wound up again, validate their positive emotions. Say something like, it sounds like you really enjoy your spouse. And smile. Notice what happens. As you leave their office, Keep your feeling of happiness. Your emotions are your responsibility. Be in the center of your head, stretch into your body, give yourself a deep breath, and open your eyes. Welcome back. Great job. I hope you got a sense that you are empathic and that you do match people, but that you can choose to change the channels. And in the next few days, we’ll be refining exactly that skill. Now, to deepen this awareness today, try matching somebody consciously today just to gain an understanding and awareness of them and also to notice that you can do this consciously. This is actually a great social skill. And if someone negative comes up today, practice this exercise. Say something like, it looks like you’re feeling grumpy or bad or down, but I’m feeling pretty good. And just see how that changes their mood. And today I’d like you to share if you are able to keep your own emotions around other people or if you’re very easily swayed. I’m just curious for you, what’s your experience with that? Thank you so much for today and I will see you tomorrow.

========================================

LESSON 47: Clearing Empathic Emotions

--------------------
Meditation: Day 47 - Clearing Empathic Emotion
--------------------

Hello everyone, I’m Jeffrey Allen. Welcome to day seven of your Emotion Awareness Challenge. This is your challenge day for your empathy awareness. And today I want you to do some emotional, empathic housecleaning. We’re going to clear out any stored emotions that you’ve matched from other people in the past. And this is really great for just finding your authentic self and for getting off any weird emotional roller coasters that you may have been riding. So you’re going to find this to be really powerful. Now, a couple tips today. There’s two main methods for processing your emotions. The first one is pretty well known, and that’s if something is really yours and your emotion, you want to own it, take responsibility for it, process it, heal it, mend it, and so on. This is pretty common. But this is only appropriate for emotions which are yours. For emotions which are not yours, the appropriate action is to disown them, to not take responsibility for these emotions, but to take responsibility for putting them in your space and responsibility for letting them go. Now, this is not a cop-out. This is actually an appropriate response to emotions that are not yours. You just want to move them out of your space. I was in a sweat with a Native American group, and they had a really nice saying for this. They were just praying to this great spirit, and they said, please take this and put it somewhere where it won’t hurt anyone anymore. And I love that because it’s a graceful way of releasing a negative energy. Okay, let’s begin. Find a point across the room where your eyes rest naturally. Focus on that point. And breathe your eyes closed. Let your awareness move into that room in the center of your head. Admire this room. Find that door to your emotional room. And make your way into this emotional room. This safe place for you to explore your emotions. And then let yourself have that blue light in one of your hands. Begin clearing any unconscious energy, any emotional fog. And in the other hand, hold that divine golden light, which is for healing. And imagine there’s a simple gauge out in front of you that can tell you if something is mine or not mine. And you can test this gauge. Just say your name. And that is your mind setting. And say somebody else’s name. Okay, now that’s not mine. Let’s have a little more fun with this gauge today. If you like visuals, add some color to it. What color means mine? What color is not mine? If you like sounds, add a tone. What sound is mine? What sound is not mine? If you like feelings, add a feeling to this gauge. What feeling is mine? What feeling is not mine? All right, great. In this emotional room, notice all the energy of happiness and ask this gauge to show you all the happiness that is yours. Begin to own all that happiness, take responsibility for it, surround it with that gold healing light, and love all that happiness that is truly yours. Now let that gauge show you all the happiness which is not mine. For this happiness, let it go. Take responsibility for bringing it in and responsibility for letting it go. Put a blue light around that happiness that’s not yours and see it loosen up and float away. And now be aware of all this sadness in this emotional room. And use your gauge to separate it into two parts. All the sadness that’s yours and the sadness that’s not yours. And for all the sadness that is yours, own it right now. Take 100 % responsibility for all the sadness that’s yours and surround it with that gold healing light and really love this sadness. And for the sadness that’s not yours, I want you to disown it. Only take responsibility for letting it go. See that blue light surrounding it and beginning to loosen it. And let that sadness that’s not yours float away to somewhere where it won’t hurt anyone anymore. Breathe. Now be aware of all the anger in this emotional room. Use your gauge again to separate it into two groups. The anger that’s truly yours and the anger that belongs to someone else. And for the anger that’s yours, really own it right now. Take 100 % responsibility for this anger that’s yours and surround it with the golden healing light and really love this anger. Good. Now, for the anger that’s not yours, I want you to disown it right now. Only take responsibility for letting this anger go. See that blue light surrounding all the anger that’s not yours. Let it loosen up and float away to somewhere where it won’t hurt anyone anymore. Good. Now, become aware of all the fear in this room of your emotions. Use your gauge to notice what fear is truly yours. And what fear belongs to someone else? For the fear that’s yours, really own it. Take total responsibility for that fear and begin to surround it with that golden healing light. Love this fear. And for the fear that’s not yours, disown it. Only take responsibility for letting it go. Surround that fear that’s not yours with a blue light. Just let it loosen. And float away to somewhere where it won’t hurt anyone anymore. Now notice all the emotion of shame in this room. And let your gauge tell you the part that’s your shame and the part that’s somebody else’s shame. And just be curious, be amused. And for the shame that’s yours, really own it. Take 100 % responsibility for that shame and surround it with gold healing light. And really love this shame. And for the shame that’s not yours, disown it now. Only take responsibility for letting it go. See that blue light surrounding it and loosening it. And let all that shame that’s not yours float away to somewhere where it won’t hurt anyone anymore. Now be aware of any other energy in the room you haven’t worked with so far. Use the gauge to notice all the energy that’s yours and any remaining energy that’s not yours in this emotional room. And for the energy that’s not yours, disown it right now. Only take responsibility for letting it go. See that blue light surrounding any other emotional energy that’s not yours? Let that energy loosen and simply float away to somewhere where it won’t hurt anyone anymore. Now take 100 % responsibility for all the energy in this room. Surround it all with gold healing light, and love all the energy in your emotional room. Take 100 % responsibility for your emotions, for keeping this room clean, and for loving your emotions. Now move your awareness up into that main room in the center of your head and take a step into your workroom. Use this gauge in here and notice all the energy in your workroom that’s yours and all the energy that’s not yours. For all the energy that’s yours, take 100 % responsibility for it. Surround it with this gold healing light. Love it. For all the energy that’s not yours in your workroom, disown it. Only take responsibility for letting it go. See that blue light surrounding it and loosening it. Let all the energy that’s not yours just float away. And take a step into your planning room where you make your plans. Again, use your gauge. Notice all the energy in your planning room that’s yours and all the energy that’s not yours. And for the energy that’s not yours, disown that energy. Only take responsibility for letting it go. Let that blue light surround it, loosen it up, and see all the energy in your planning room that’s not yours float away. And for the energy that’s yours, take 100 % responsibility for it. Surround it with that gold healing light and love your energy in your planning room. Now step into your relationship room. Use this gauge to notice all the energy that’s not yours and all the energy that’s yours. And for the energy that’s not yours in your relationship room, just let it go. Only take responsibility for letting that energy go. Surround it with that blue light. See it loosen up and float away. And then surround all your energy in your relationship room with this gold healing light. Take 100 % responsibility for it. Own it. And love it. Now step back into the main room in the center of your head. One last time, notice all the energy that’s yours and all the energy that’s not yours. Let go of all the energy that’s not yours. Take responsibility only for letting it go. Surround it with blue light. See it loosen up and float away. And all the energy that’s yours, surround it with that gold healing light. Take 100 % responsibility for all the energy, all the emotions, everything in the center of your head and all these rooms. Really love this space just for you. And now let’s promote your emotional room to this main floor. No more basement awareness for your emotions. Move your emotional room up to this floor and let your emotions be conscious instead of subconscious. As easy to access as your work or planning or relationship rooms. And envision a bright, beautiful new door on your emotional room. Give yourself a deep breath. Feel how much clarity you have right now. Really admire your work. Stretch. And when you’re ready, open your eyes. Welcome back. Great job. You did some major house cleaning today. I’m really excited for you and for the change this is going to make. Now I have a few tips. So you want to be gentle with yourself while you adjust. So give yourself a few days before making any big decisions like a breakup or changing careers. Just let your new awareness mature and settle in first. And you’re likely to start to see yourself and your life in a whole new way now. If you want to deepen this practice today, just practice a few times as you walk around what’s mine and what’s not mine. You can use this gauge for anything. It’s fantastic. And then please share. Did you find a surprise today? Something that you thought was yours, but actually wasn’t? And how did that make you feel? Thanks so much for today, and I will see you tomorrow.

Meditation: Day 48 - Anchoring Your Enthusiasm for Life
--------------------

Hello everyone, I’m Jeffrey Allen. Welcome to Day 8 of your Emotion Awareness Challenge. This is your wow day for your empathy awareness, where you get a new experience or do something that you didn’t know was possible. This is really great for relieving any frustrations you have about specific things in your life or just your life in general, and for remembering just how great it is to be alive. So let’s begin. Find a point across the room where your eyes rest naturally. Be right behind your eyes. and focus on that point and breathe your eyes closed maintaining that same awareness move your awareness into that room in the center of your head notice that bright new door for your emotional room and enter that emotional room now admire how bright and conscious this room looks and let it be even brighter remember that timeline we used in the self -awareness challenge See the timeline stretching out to your left and your right. One side is the past and one is the future. Remember the geometry we used in the Spirit Challenge. A pyramid pointed up and down. Feel that geometry spinning right now. A little faster. A little faster. And let yourself get brighter and brighter. Spin the geometry a little faster. And feel your awareness expand. Let yourself begin traveling along your timeline in the past. Last week, last month, last year. Notice the happy points along the way. A birth or a wedding or graduation or anything else. Smile and enjoy this review. See a bright light at the very beginning of your timeline. The time when you were born to this body. when you entered this timeline. Continue traveling past your birth and into this bright light. Feel your awareness expand as you become aware of all that you’re planning for this life. Feel your intelligence and your clarity. Feel your creativity and your curiosity about this life. Feel your enthusiasm for this beautiful plan that you’re creating. Notice that… aware of the challenges, and you’re excited to face them. You’re aware of the triumphs and the failures which will occur, and you’re excited. You’re aware of the love and the heartbreak as well, and you’re excited about these too. And notice you can see all the ups and downs, all the surprises too, and you’re super excited about this ride. You can’t wait to be born. and live this fabulous life that you have planned. Feel the compassion and love you have for the human you who will likely forget all of this, who will get lost in the movie and the emotions, because that’s part of the plan too. In this bright light, in the space before you’re born, while you’re planning for this life, feel all the enthusiasm, all the excitement you have for everything that’s coming in this life. Let that excitement get brighter and brighter and bring all that love and compassion and enthusiasm and excitement with you as you step directly into your emotional room in present time. Use your empathic ability to match all this positive energy. Anchor it into your emotional room. Feel your room filling with your creativity. Fill your room filling with your clarity. Fill your room filling with your excitement for life. Fill your room filling with your love for emotions. And fill your room filling with your compassion for your human self. Anchor all these… positive emotions into your emotional room. Feel how excited you are to be here in your life. Notice how easy it is to choose gratitude and joy. Feel your excitement spreading out to everyone else on the human journey. See everyone else living the lives they planned for themselves. Admire their courage and their beauty and their tenacity. and their smiles. Let your timeline disappear now and admire your emotional room. Admire the variety of experiences you’re having in this life. Feel yourself being present in your body. Stretch your body. Stretch your energy. Give yourself a deep breath. Open your eyes. Welcome back. Great job. I hope you had an amazing journey. And if you ever wonder why you’re here, go back to that place, go back to that point before you were born and feel your enthusiasm for this life. If you want to deepen this awareness today, look around you for those little signs today of what you were planning and what surprises did you leave for yourself. And please share, how did you feel in the time before you were born when you were planning this life? Thanks so much for today. I’ll see you tomorrow.

LESSON 49: Empathy Applications & Navigating A Party

--------------------

Hi everyone; I'm Jeffrey Allen, and welcome to day nine of your Emotion Awareness Challenge. And congratulations, you've completed your activation for your empathy awareness. And we did that by going through those six steps to awareness success, did a self-assessment of how sensitive you are to other people's energy and how empathic you are. And then we did an easy exercise where you were feeling and consciously matching and unmatching from energies from other people. On the Challenge Day, we went in and just did a big house cleaning with your emotions and cleared out all the emotions that aren't yours and really worked on healing and loving the emotions that are yours. So really good empathic awareness. And of course, yesterday in the Wow Day, you went to that time before you were born and just tapped into that excitement and enthusiasm that you have to be here and to be in a body, and then you brought it back and used your empathy to anchor it in to present time. So I hope you could really feel that. Now the last two steps to keep building your awareness, now that your activation has happened, are just to continue practicing and to share with other people. So I'm going to give you some exercises, some examples of how to practice. Let's take a look. Now, of course, the easiest application is just using that ability to notice what's yours and what's not yours. So one, first, what are you actually feeling? And then is it yours or is it not yours? So that's just a kind of a basic application. Now this works in your body and with your health too. So oftentimes if you start developing this awareness, you'll notice that some of the pain that you have in your body is not actually your pain. That sounds kind of strange, but it's true. If you notice that your knee is a little funny or your back is a little funny, ask yourself, "Whose pain is this?" And if it's not yours, just move it out. Disassociate from that pain. And most times it'll just go away. It's actually a really powerful tool to work with your body. Now in relationships, you'll find that if you can hold your own space, not become your partner's emotions, that you'll have a lot deeper compassion and that you'll actually be able to be present for them so they can talk about their emotions and practice and move through it and heal it and so on without becoming their emotions and kind of joining their cause and getting angry or frustrated or sad with them. It's actually much nicer to have a partner who can empathize with your emotions or sympathize with them but not empathize or become the emotions that you're having. So this is really great. Now with work this happens too because you want to be able to choose your emotions at work and be more even keel than you would maybe in a personal relationship. And you'll notice that if you can do this, if you can handle your emotions well, people will really start to trust you. And they'll, they'll listen to you more, and you'll have more credibility because they know that you're not just kind of, you know, popping from your emotions, that you're actually a stable, emotional person. So it's really great. Some advanced applications are that if you notice that you are matching somebody, say you're matching their anger or their pain, like somebody yells at you and blows up and you just start to get angry too. So try not to fight back with that person, even though the energy's coming up and your emotion's coming up just notice, "Okay, I've got a deeper awareness I'm going to practice right now." Take a few deep breaths and just think about not spreading that to the next person because, if one person gets angry and then you catch it and you get angry and the next person and so on, this is how these negative emotions and challenging emotions move all around the planet. If one person can stop it and just say, and you can be that person, and say, "All right, I'm feeling angry or feeling sad. I'm just going to take a few breaths. I'm going to work on it before I pass it on to the next person." And what happens there is you break that chain, and you'll start noticing that your relationships are much, much better, and you just feel better about yourself 'cause you're not passing that along. Okay, I want to do just one more fun exercise with you today. One kind of new application where you can use your empathy to tune in to a group of people. So say if you're going to a party or a conference or somewhere, and there's people that you don't know very well, you can actually use your empathy to tune in and find the people that you want to connect with and then have a better conversation with those people. So let's do a little meditation and let's practice that right now. Go ahead and close your eyes. Be present right behind your eyes. And really feel your body; feel yourself being in your body and aware. Now imagine that you are about to walk into a party or a conference. You're outside the door. You're by yourself, and you don't know many people inside. Notice how you're feeling right now, and use that blue light to show you a way step by step to move into gratitude and joy. Maybe it's as simple as just being grateful that you're at this event and just a joy to be alive. And with that feeling, enter the room, and just be happy and curious what you'll find. Use your empathy awareness to feel the room. Is it mostly happy or is it nervous or serious? Does it feel like fun? And don't match the energy; just notice the energy. Now begin to scan the room with your empathy, or use that blue light to guide you either way. Feel around until you find an emotion that feels good to you. Where is it in the room? And then begin walking toward that place. As you walk, notice someone with kind of a ruffled energy that's approaching you. And try to avoid them, but they accidentally bump into you. What happens with your emotions? Did you snap into a default emotion? Maybe anger or surprise; fear? If so, just be amused, and let that emotion fade. Return to feeling happy and curious, and start walking again toward that place that feels good to you. As you walk through different areas in the room, notice how people are feeling. Use your empathy notice the emotions, but don't match them. Don't become other people's feelings. Notice how easy this is. Smile and enjoy your awareness. As you approach the place that feels good, notice the people here. What are they doing? What kind of people are here? And let your empathy touch these people briefly, feeling what they're feeling, but remembering not to become their emotions. Notice a person who is matching your curiosity and looking at you. Notice how you feel. Did your emotions change when you felt their attention on you? Just be amused, and bring your awareness back to yourself. Let yourself feel happy and curious again. And smile and say, "Hello;" validate this person's emotion. Say something like, "You look like you're having fun." As you talk with them, be aware of your emotions and your empathy. This is more important than your words. Let yourself begin to match their energy for a short time. Notice how the conversation feels while you're matching. And then let yourself unmatch and remember your own emotions and notice how that feels. Say, "Thank you" and "Goodbye" to this person. And as you walk away, release yourself completely from their emotions. Move back to the door. Be outside that room. Notice your emotions right now. What percentage of your emotions are yours? And what percent are somebody else's? Be amused; be in the center of your head. Give yourself a deep breath, and open your eyes. Welcome back. Good job. I hope you enjoyed that exercise where you're navigating a crowd and a conversation using your empathy. And I encourage you to try that today, and notice a person or a place that you're drawn to empathically, and just go there and try to connect and disconnect, and notice how that feels for you. And of course, I'd love to hear about your experience. What was it like to feel that and have that control of your empathy and emotions? And if you have a unique challenge or an application that you would like to use your emotional awareness for, to help yourself or help anybody else, please share that with everybody. And you can try it out tomorrow in the do-it-yourself meditation. Thanks so much for today, and I look forward to seeing you tomorrow.

Meditation: Day 50 - Emotion Awareness Integration
--------------------

Hi, everyone. I’m Jeffrey Allen. Congratulations. It’s the final day of your emotional awareness challenge. And today is your integration day where you’re going to either rest or catch up or have a do -it -yourself practice day. Now, if you want to catch up, if you missed a day, you can go back and review that day now. If you’re doing your do -it -yourself practice, I’ll get you started and give you eight minutes to explore on your own, and then I’ll wake you up at the end. If you really need a rest today, that’s okay too. Just stop right now and I will see you tomorrow. Now the do -it -yourself meditation is really great for exploring your own awareness and integrating this new awareness into your routine. And you can reuse this meditation anytime you want to get additional clarity in your emotional awareness. So let’s begin. Remember, I’ll get you started, give you time to explore on your own, and then help you come out at the end. Find a point across the room. where your eyes rest naturally. Be behind your eyes and focus on this point. Notice your breath. And when you’re ready, breathe your eyes closed, maintaining this same awareness behind your eyes. Move your awareness into the center of your head. Stretch a little bit with your awareness to the left, the right, front and the back, above and below. Smile and think of something you want to explore with your emotional awareness. What emotions or events are you curious about? Be in the room in the center of your head. Notice that bright door leading into your emotional room. Move into that emotional room right now. Let it be very bright and clear. And when I count down from three, you’ll be exploring on your own. Are you ready? Three. Hold your blue light for clearing emotional fog in one hand and your gold light for divine healing in the other. Two, be aware of your empathy that you can match or not match others. One, focus on your question. Be curious and amused. Zero, begin receiving your insights now. What’s the first thing that you notice? Enjoy! Notice your breath. Notice one more insight before you come back. Remember that room in the center of your head. Stretch your body and breathe. Stretch your awareness to your left ear, your right ear, the front and the back of your head, and above and below. Stretch your awareness all the way into your hands and your feet. Give yourself another deep breath. Smile. And open your eyes. Welcome back. I hope you enjoyed your meditation. And really validate yourself because your awareness is growing so fast. You’re having such amazing progress. And I’d love it today if you share what’s the most surprising thing that you noticed today. Congratulations again on completing your emotional awareness challenge. You’re almost there. Tomorrow we start the final phase of the training where we explore your awareness of how you impact the world. I’m so excited for this final phase. Thank you so much for today, and I’ll see you tomorrow.

Part 6: Impact-Awareness (Personal & Global)

========================================

========================================

LESSON 51: Welcome to Impact Awareness
--------------------

Hi everyone. I'm Jeffrey Allen, and welcome to day one of your Impact Awareness Challenge. Now, congratulations; this is the final stage in the 60-day challenge, and you are still here. So I'm so excited. Thank you for being here. And I just want to admire your tenacity and your ability to stick with the program. And also just acknowledge that you really want to make a difference. You want to make a difference for yourself, and you want to make a difference, a positive difference, out in the world. And that's what we're going to get in the impact awareness here. Now I've been working on the last few years growing my awareness of how am I impacting the world and how am I changing things? And I feel very, very fortunate because I got the call about 10 years ago, maybe 12 years ago, that I was here to be of service. And so I switched my whole life around behind how do I be of service? How do I help people? And I've been very fortunate in the last 10 years. I've worked with thousands of people one-on-one making a personal impact. I've reached tens of thousands of people in training classes, making an impact that way. And then hundreds of thousands through videos and articles and so on. And it's not the numbers so much that make a difference. You know, it feels good to reach a lot of people, but what makes the difference is when I get an email from one person that says, wow, that one exercise you did, or that one meditation really helped me break through something. Or the whole program really changed my life, and I'm so much happier. That's when it makes a difference. When you connect with one person that you know that you made a change, and I want to help you get that too. I want you to see the positive impact that you're having on others. Doesn't have to be a particular scale. It can be one-on-one; it can be community or global. And we're really going to work with that over the next 10 days. So I'm excited. And the thing that's interesting about awareness like this, I mentioned that, you know, I've been able to reach a lot of people, and this is true, but it wasn't always that way. There was a time when I had very low impact awareness, and it reminds me a little bit of one of my favorite teachers, Jim Self. Jim's actually the man that I learned that little technique at the beginning of every meditation where you focus on a point and then gently breathe your eyes closed. That actually came from Jim Self. And Jim is a fantastic teacher. And I was sitting in one of his classes in Colorado Springs. There were just 12 students. And we're watching this amazing man, with this amazing information, this huge gift, and so much to share with the world, and so much impact that he could have. And I was thinking, why are there 12 people in this class? There should be a stadium of people. There should be books. There should be so much. And now there is, he's actually doing great. He's having a much bigger influence. And the funny thing is that happened to me years later in Sedona. I was teaching a small group. And one of my students said, "You know, for all this information you have, it's kind of greedy that you're holding it for yourself. That you're only sharing it with a dozen people. And you know, you should be getting this out to more people, and helping more people because you can." And I was surprised. I was like, oh wow, I'm actually being greedy. But of course there were reasons that you might have and that I had. It's not easy having an impact. There's a fear that maybe what I'm going to say is not interesting to people, or maybe we're a little bit shy. For me I was terrified of public speaking. 15 years ago, I was just like, there's no way I will ever be a teacher because I just want to work with people one-on-one. You know, obviously I had to work through that because I wanted to make a bigger impact. It can also be like really overwhelming, and you can have some uncertainty around your impact. But what I found that really shifted things for me is that the more information I had, the more that I could see that I can help people. The more pressure that built inside me. And I wish I had a better word, but it's kind of like this feeling of this like information constipation, where this inspiration constipation, where like I know I can help people, and I want to help people, but I'm not doing it, right? And you might be able to relate to this. When I felt like that, it feels terrible to know that you can help people and you're not doing it. Because there's some block, or you feel the opportunity hasn't arisen. So I want to help you get through that. We're going to work on that here. And really raise that awareness of not just, it's not about if you're impacting people; we're going to shift that awareness away to you know that you are impacting people. And the question is are you doing it consciously or unconsciously? And are you playing small? Are you playing too big? Are you really being yourself? So that's what I want to get you to in this 10 days. And once that happens, you'll know it. It gets pretty easy, or you'll notice it gets pretty easy, that you just start stepping into opportunities. So, one person says, "How'd you do that? I really like this awareness you have," and then you just share it with them. And then a little group asks you to teach, and then you teach it to them. And then, you know, you get some invitations to go teach other places. This happened to me. My clients started inviting me to Los Angeles or Texas or Paris or Africa, different places to teach. And I just said, yes. Eventually somebody invited me to go to Japan and teach big workshops. And I didn't know how I was going to do it, but I knew that I could, and I knew that I wanted to. And that was enough. And I want you to have that too. And when people offer to help, listen to them. And I was at the first Awesomeness Fest that I attended, and I got to know Vishen Lakhiani, the CEO of Mindvalley. And the last day, the last party I was getting on a boat, I was talking to him a little bit, and he said, "Hey, if you ever need any help, You know we'd love to help you out with whatever you're doing, and give us a call." And as I was riding away in my mind I was just thinking, oh, he's so kind, you know, he's being nice. He says that to everybody. I wasn't considering it. And then I caught myself and said, maybe he meant it. Maybe it's just being authentic, and he meant it. I should call him and follow through. And I'm encouraging you to do the same. You'll notice when opportunities come to you, if your awareness is up, with your impact awareness, you'll be able to step in and to follow through. So we're going to do actually three different awarenesses. Not two this time. We're going to work on your personal impact, one-to-one. We're going to work on your community, your global impact, where it's you to many people. And then we're going to finish with the many to many, where your collaborative impact. Because we're really moving into a collaborative world right now. So we're going to end with that. Now, of course, we're going to go through those six steps for awareness success. Today we're going to start with a little exercise where you can see your current impact. Then we're going to do a day where you're working to share your positive impact and improve that, kind of a one-to-one. Then we'll look at any negative impact you're having on people, the Challenge Day, and kind of clean that up. And then finally, you're going to work with using your telepathy, your ability to communicate with people energetically, to learn how to more gracefully impact each other and impact people in the world. So really fun. Okay, so let's go ahead and start today. We'll do this assessment meditation. So just find a place across the room. Thank you, Jim Self for this technique. And just focus on that point right behind your eyes, and then just breathe your eyes closed, and be very present right behind your eyes. Now we're going to look at all the people that you have already personally impacted. So just be in the center of your head, admire that peaceful room, and imagine the wall in front of you in that room starts fading away. And you're looking out at an empty theater where you're standing on the stage. And the lights are on, so you can see all those seats. And this room is going to fill with all the people that you're impacting. Notice your closest friends and family arriving; the front row is filling with the people who are most influenced by you. See them smiling at you, and notice who's here. And see how happy they are that you are being you. And notice if you can receive their appreciation. Really smile and let it in. Now notice the next rows filling up with your extended family and friends. See everybody smiling at you, and scan the faces, and notice who are you impacting? As you look at each person, see them nodding their head, smiling and acknowledging you, and notice can you receive this acknowledgement? Smile, and let it in. Now see your work and relationship connections starting to fill up the seats, any colleagues or coworkers or past relationships. Everyone else that you've had a positive impact on. You might need to make the theater a little bigger if you need to. And as you look, notice any faces that you're surprised to see here, people you didn't know you impacted. And see all these people smiling and admiring you. Can you receive their admiration? And smile and let it in right now. And now let additional people come in. All the people that you've impacted that you didn't know or that maybe you've forgotten. Maybe you did something that you didn't realize had an impact. These people might not even know your name, but they remember something positive, some impact you had on them. And all these people come in; just see them smiling at you, and feel how grateful they are for you. And notice can you receive this gratitude? And smile and let it in. Now ask yourself, if I raise my impact awareness, how big would this theater need to be? If I began impacting people consciously, how big would this theater need to be? Two times, 10 times, a big stadium? Just be amused. And thank everyone here for helping you see your impact. Let your awareness return to the center of your head. Remember all that appreciation and acknowledgement and admiration and gratitude. All the people you've impacted, and really breathe this in. Stretch, smile, and open your eyes. So welcome back. Thanks so much. You did a great job. And I hope you were able to see how many people you're really impacting and let yourself receive that appreciation and so on. Because it's really important to let that in, that gratitude, that appreciation, that acknowledgement. Now, if you'd like to share today, I'd like you to just share what's your favorite way that you like to impact people on a one-to-one basis? And throughout your day today, just notice how are you impacting people? Just notice even the little things. How does it help people? How does it change their life, and how are people impacting you? Thanks so much for today, and I will see you tomorrow.

LESSON 52: Increasing Your Positive Personal Impact

--------------------
Meditation: Day 52 - Increasing Your Positive Personal Impact
--------------------

Hello everyone, I’m Jeffrey Allen. Welcome to day two of your Impact Awareness Challenge. This is your easy success day for your personal impact awareness, and what I want you to get today is just a feeling that you can amplify your positive personal impact. And this is great for just knowing that you are making a difference, and also just for feeling really good yourself. So let’s begin. Find a point across the room where your eyes rest naturally. Focus on this point and be right behind your eyes. When you’re ready, breathe your eyes closed, maintaining that same awareness behind your eyes. Let your awareness move gently into the center of your head. Enjoy that peaceful room, that great space just for you. Let any thoughts about the day fade away. Think about… What inspires you? What makes you feel good? What music lifts you up? What places do you love to visit? Think about a favorite pet from right now or from the past. Think about your favorite delicious food. Which people really inspire your mind? Who is it that most inspires your spirit? Who do you know that inspires your body? And who inspires your emotions? Who are your positive role models? See their faces now and notice how each one makes you feel. Feel all this positive energy circling around you and moving upward? This is the positive spiral of life energy. It’s always available. It’s always turned on. Really feel it now and feel how naturally it speaks to your body. Let yourself vibrate with this positive spiral and feel your body relax. Feel your cells relax. Feel your DNA relax. Let this positive spiral be your default vibration. As you feel that positive energy getting stronger in you, notice how it feels. Notice that this positive energy has always been there through your entire life, always ready to lift you up when you need it. Be grateful now for all the people and the animals, the places and things that brought this positive energy to you. Feel that positive upward -moving spiral of energy all through you right now. Feel it radiating out from you as you become a positive beacon of light. Hold this vibration and find the door to your relationship room. Without changing your energy, enter this room now. Feel your positive energy filling your relationship room with light. Notice how quickly any dark areas disappear. And think of all the people that you’re connected to in relationships. Mediate this positive energy to them right now. Feel them receiving and matching that positive energy. Imagine that same feeling you have appearing onto their faces. Smile and be grateful for these friends. Be grateful for your ability to uplift others. Now imagine three things you can do today to spread this positive energy. It could be something very small. It could be something large. Imagine yourself doing those things right now and notice how people respond. Smile and know you’ve already made a positive impact today. Return your focus to the room in the center of your head. Let your positive light completely fill this room. See it shining out from here and lighting up the rest of your day. Give yourself a deep breath. Smile and open your eyes. Welcome back. Great job. I hope you got a taste of how easy it is to tap into that positive energy and to spread it around. It really is that simple and it’s always available. If you want to deepen your awareness of this today, just stay tuned in to that positive energy and return to it when you notice that you’ve forgotten or even fallen into negativity. You can also smile and share that positive energy with other people and notice how they respond. And today, I’d love it if you shared, how do you feel this positive spiral of life energy? What does it feel like to you? Thanks so much for today, and I will see you tomorrow.

========================================

LESSON 53: Clearing Your Negative Personal Impact

--------------------
Meditation: Day 53 - Clearing Your Negative Personal Impact
--------------------

Hello everyone, I’m Jeffrey Allen and welcome to day three of your Impact Awareness Challenge. This is your challenge day for your personal impact awareness. And today I want you to get a greater awareness of any unconscious negative impact you might have and just how negative energy affects you in general. Because if you can see it, then you can change it. This is really great for improving your relationships and your own happiness. And it’s great for building trust with others too. So let’s begin. Find that point. across the room where your eyes rest naturally. Focus on that point and be right behind your eyes. When you’re ready, breathe your eyes closed, maintaining that same awareness behind your eyes. Let your energy and awareness move into that room in the center of your head. Remember that positive spiral of energy that you tapped into yesterday. Feel it swirling around you. calling to you, inviting you to join the positive spiral of energy. Now notice the opposite spiral, the negative energy spiral, which is going down. Don’t match this energy, but don’t hide from it either. Let yourself see it and be amused. Just like the positive energy is always available, the negative energy is always available too. Sometimes it’s a narrative of negativity about your world or your day. It might sound like, that sucks. That person is in my way. Or, he looks stupid in that shirt. Or, why is traffic so slow? Just remember how often you hear noise like this in your mind and be amused. It’s just negativity. It’s not you. Now tune into your body and notice where does that negativity connect to my body? Oftentimes it’s the back of the head, but it could be anywhere. Feel that connection of negative energy and any pressure or tension or pain that it causes. Breathe. Notice any negative responses that you have to negative energy. Maybe this negative energy sucks or I hate feeling negative energy. So be amused. And notice any emotions about negative energy, any frustration or anger or sadness or even guilt. Now remember the positive spiral of energy from yesterday. Always available. Always uplifting. Remember how relaxed your body felt yesterday and how even your DNA could relax. Doesn’t that sound better than negativity? Just be amused. Give yourself permission to disconnect from this negative energy spiral and connect into the positive energy spiral right now. Remember your role models. your favorite food or your favorite place. Remember how quickly you matched the positive energy yesterday. Do the same right now. Choose to match the positive spiral of life energy. Choose to disconnect the negative energy from your body and connect the positive. Let any negative narration fade away and be replaced. by peace. Let any pain or frustration loosen and be lifted away. Feel your body relax. Feel your cells relax. Feel your DNA relax as well. Let all debris from this negative energy be carried away. Feel and be amused. Notice how permanent this negative energy feels, but how easily it moves. Really remember this. Hold on to your positive energy and begin to notice the ways this negative energy expresses through you. Do you gossip about others? Do you have secret negative thoughts? Maybe you even enjoy your negative talk. Don’t judge yourself, just be aware. When you express negative energy, it automatically flows to others, just like the positive energy does. So remember that positive energy again and decide to choose it more often. Just notice when you’re being negative, and flip the switch. Breathe. Now notice any habits you have that may be fine for you, but stir negative energy for others. Try to stay positive, but notice how these habits affect other people. Do you talk loudly on the phone or at work? What do others feel about this? Do you pretend to pay attention to people when you’re actually thinking about other things? Notice, do these people feel connected to you? Do they feel validated by you? Maybe you like to drive a little fast or a little crazy. Notice when this is shocking or even scary for other people. Or perhaps you’re always late. What do people think about you as they’re waiting for you? Do you like to smoke? How do non -smokers respond? Be amused. Don’t judge yourself or anybody else here. Just notice how easily negative energy can be triggered. If you don’t want to change your habits, that’s okay. But be aware of your impact. Right now, imagine you’re sending positive energy into all these situations to balance out any negativity they may inspire. Imagine you’re smiling at people. They’re making a joke. or saying something kind. There’s nothing wrong with what you’re doing, but take responsibility for the negative energy you might inspire and add some positive energy to balance it out. Notice any negative thoughts or defenses that crept up during that exercise? Maybe you thought, no one tells me what to do, or it’s their fault if they don’t like it. Just be amused. Let any of this go and simply remember the positive energy now. There’s no battle between good or evil here, just a choice of which energy you want to experience. To feel that positive energy really lifting you up, completely disconnect from that negative energy flow. Be grateful for your awareness. Smile and open your eyes. Welcome back. Great job. I’m glad you survived the challenge of negative energy today. It can feel so persuasive, but with practice, it’s actually very easy to switch to the positive. If you want to deepen your awareness today, just notice any negative narration about yourself and about others, and don’t feel bad, but either turn it off or counter it with positive thoughts instead. Pretty soon you’ll have a positive habit there. And if you’d like to share today, please share a success story where you overcame negativity and what were the results of you making that shift. Thank you so much for today, and I look forward to seeing you tomorrow.

LESSON 54: Telepathy For More Graceful Impact

--------------------
Meditation: Day 54 - Telepathy for More Graceful Impact
--------------------

Hello, everyone. I’m Jeffrey Allen. Welcome to day four of your impact awareness challenge. This is your wow day for your personal impact awareness. And I want to give you a new experience and have you try something that you didn’t know was possible. And how we’re going to do that today is you’re going to communicate with somebody telepathically. You’re going to use your spirit to spirit communication to communicate before you talk in person. And this is really great for refining your message and for having direct, honest communication. Because at this level, people speak very clearly and very honestly. Their normal baggage is not in their way. It’s also great for understanding any potential responses to your communication before you actually talk in person. So it’s great for rehearsing an important conversation. Now, I encourage you today to let this be really easy. I’ll give you plenty of time to listen for the responses. And if any doubts in your mind get in the way, just smile and be patient and let the information come. Occasionally, people will respond non -verbally with some gestures and etc. And this is okay. However you’re getting the information, just enjoy the connection and have fun. Let’s begin. Focus on a point across the room where your eyes rest naturally. Be right behind your eyes and focus on that point. When you’re ready, breathe your eyes closed, maintaining that same awareness right behind your eyes. And then gently move your awareness into that room in the center of your head. And be happy in this room. Feel that peaceful, quiet mind. And let’s do a little listening warm -up. Let yourself listen right now to what’s around you. What are you hearing? Reach out with that awareness. Listen to what’s happening in the next room. And now really stretch out with your listening and notice how far away can you listen. Think about someone who is very easy for you to talk to. Imagine this person in front of you right now. Say hello to them. You can see their face and feel them. And smile and really connect with this person right now. Now feel your crown chakra on top of your head. It’s like a halo or a crown. And send a hello from your crown chakra to their crown chakra. This is how spirits say hello. Notice if you get a hello back. And ask a simple question. How are you today? And ask this person, are you available to talk right now? Now if they’re not, Say hello to another person. Send that crown hello. And just ask them if they’re available to talk right now. Now ask this person, is this real? Will you remember what I’m saying? And notice their response. Tell this person how much you enjoy your connection with them. And share your perspective on how you impact each other. And ask them for their perspective as well. And just notice and feel any response. Is there anything that you’ve been afraid to tell this person in person? Just tell them now and be really honest and really clear. And notice their response. Is there anything that you want from this person? Just be really clear. Make an honest request. And again, notice how they respond. And do you have any questions for this person, something you’ve been wanting to ask? Just be really clear and honest and ask it right now. And let yourself receive their answer. Now invite this person to share anything that they’ve been afraid to tell you in person. Just listen with an open mind. Is there anything else you want to share or talk to this person about? Just take your time and have that conversation. Thank this person for talking with you. Smile and say goodbye. Let your awareness return to the room in the center of your head. Take a moment to think about or organize anything that you heard. Notice your breath, smile, and open your eyes. Welcome back. Great job. I hope you had a great conversation. And if it was easy for you, that’s fantastic. If it was a little challenging, that’s okay if this was the first time you were trying it. Just try it a few more times. It gets easier and easier. If you want to deepen your awareness of this today, you can practice this when you’re sending an email or a text. So just say hello to the person. Have a little conversation telepathically before you write them the email or text. And don’t think too much or just react. Just connect and become aware. This is great because you can notice the impact of your text, your email before you send it. And if it looks like it’s a little bit rough, maybe change it a little bit and try it again. This is great for reducing any miscommunication, misinterpretation, hard feelings, etc. Now, if you want to try a really advanced practice for this, you can also try this where you’re talking to somebody. You can have two conversations at once. one conversation coming out of your mouth, and the second conversation just right up here in your crown chakras as your spirits talk. This is really fun. I do it all the time. So a couple tips for this kind of communication. Don’t expect people to remember. You know, we’re not quite there yet with our planetary awareness, so they probably won’t remember. But don’t be surprised if they do. You know, oftentimes it’ll be as if you had the conversation already when you follow through in person. Also keep in mind, this is not a substitute for actual talking. The body personality and the spirit personality don’t always agree. So if somebody tells you something when you’re speaking this way with them, don’t take it for granted. Talk to them in person as well. If you’d like to share today, please share your most powerful experience with telepathy or spirit -to -spirit communication. Thank you so much for today, and I will see you tomorrow.

LESSON 55: Personal Impact Applications + Intro To Global Impact
--------------------

Hi everybody; I'm Jeffrey Allen, and welcome to day five of your Impact Awareness Challenge. So you've already activated your personal impact awareness which means we've gone through those six steps of activation. So first, you did a self-assessment where you were in the theater and you get to see what kind of impact you're having right now. Then we looked at your Easy Day where you were checking out your positive impact and how to amplify that. Challenge Day you looked at any negative impact you might be having on people personally and how to turn that down and become more aware of it. And your final day yesterday, we did the Wow Day where you were learning to use your telepathy to tune into people and communicate ahead of time which helps your impact be a lot smoother and more graceful. And so you already have this activation for this awareness inside you, and to help it grow you just need to practice and share it. So of course, I'm going to share a couple of exercises you can do right now for continuing to practice and grow this awareness. Let's take a look. Okay, with your personal practice, first thing you can do is just notice when you are sowing those seeds of positive impact or of negative impact. I'm a huge fan of Thich Nhat Hahn, and he talks about this, the you've all got these seeds inside you, the seeds of happiness, the seeds of despair, and which one are you watering? And that's going to determine which, what grows. And the same thing's true not just inside you but in the world. So if you're more aware of your impact, you'll be noticing that, you know, you are creating a positive wave and feeding the positive waves on the planet rather than negative ones. And that's really good because you'll notice that when you do that you feel like you're making a positive difference. And that always feels really good. You can also just practice random acts of kindness. So, when I was first practicing this, I did something funny. I just, I went into a supermarket. I noticed the teller was kind of sad as I went through the line. And so I just went back through, and I bought her a couple flowers and left 'em on the counter, and she rang me up, and I left and just, you know, something simple like that. She was just, you know, beaming with joy and happiness that some stranger had done something so simple as, you know, spent a few dollars on flowers for her. So, you know, random acts of kindness are really fantastic. And a simple one you can do is just smile at strangers. So I love to do this. You see somebody walking down the street, just give 'em a big, authentic smile. And what's kind of fun is occasionally you'll meet those people later. Maybe they were, you know, they're working, they're in town for business, and they're actually in business with your company or something. So it's kind of fun. 'cause you'll see those connections come back. All right, now another place to practice this is in your relationship space. So you'll notice that even really small positive acts can result in some big positive gains. Now specially if you have a relationship where, or even a friendship, where you've noticed there's kind of a brick wall between you. You've sort of built up this negative energy over time. What you'll notice is just step by step you can start to take away one brick after another, just by having little small acts of positive energy and positive impact. And before you know it, that wall will be gone altogether. I've done this in relationships, and it's really amazing to see the change you can make. Those little things make a really big difference. Now also in relationships. Sometimes we're in the habit of coming home at the end of the day and sort of giving our negative day review like, "Oh man, this bad thing happened. And then this person got grumpy, and then somebody cut me off in the car." And you know, sort of unload that negative day review on our partner. I would encourage you, don't do that. If you're doing that, just catch yourself and then say, you know, "Let's add in some positive things." Do the positive day review instead, and encourage your friend or your partner to do the same. This is a much more fun conversation to have. All the things you're loving about life instead of the things that are bothering you. You know, if you're going to have a happy hour, make it happy. Don't make it like, grumpy hour. Right? Another place you can really practice this impact awareness is at work. So, that exercise I mentioned where you're tuning in and working with people telepathically works fantastically. I did this one of the first times when I was working, with my boss, when I was in corporate America. And I was just a few minutes before review, and I tuned into her, and I just said, "I'd really like a different job, and I'd like that job to make more money. And here's kind of the things I'd like to be doing." And we hadn't talked about it in person. It just kind of, idea came to me, I tuned in, talked to her telepathically. And then I came into the meeting a few minutes later, and she said, "Oh, Jeff, you know, I've got this review already prepared." And then she kind of pushed it aside and said, "But I just had this new idea come in about maybe you'd like a new position, and you could do these kinds of things, and you'd have more responsibility, and so I could give you a pay raise." And basically, you know, pretty much exactly the script I had talked to her about in my mind. She picked it up and was able to, you know, get into it too. And at that point all I had to do is just say, "Wow, that's cool, you know, thank you, and that's a great idea." And so it's a way to kind of make that communication more graceful. And I will say too that if you're practicing this technique, you know it's not a way to manipulate the world. I was just catching an opportunity that was already there, that was good for me, was good for my boss, was good for the company and aligning with it and choosing it. You're not going to be able to use this technique to kind of, you know, force your way to make things happen. That's not what it's for at all. It's for creating more graceful transition into new possibilities. Okay now, you can also use this technique to notice if there's any potential impact that you're going to have or some difficulties you may cause, especially if you're working with email communication which is notoriously bad for emotions. You might want to just kind of telepathically send that email to everybody and see how they respond. If you, you might be surprised; sometimes you'll see a big, like, you know, big, like kind of negative response. And then you reread your email and realize, "Oh, okay, it's easy to misinterpret what I said. I wasn't very clear, or, you know, people have a different way of thinking about it than I do." So it's a great way to avoid conflict. All right, now, a kind of an advanced skill you can use here with this technique is if you're practicing this telepathy, you can actually use it to tune in with your spirit guides and communicate with them. You can also use it to tune in with deceased loved ones. So, if people have died recently, they're usually close enough to the earth plane that you can still communicate and talk to them a little bit. And most of you will notice if this happens, you can still feel your loved ones around for a little while, maybe a couple weeks or even a couple months. Then it feels like they left or they finished. And during that time frame you can use this technique and communicate with them. That can actually be really fun. Now, of course, that's a pretty advanced technique. So, you know, give yourself a break if it doesn't work perfectly for you. All right. Now, today we're going to transition into the second part of impact which is global impact or community impact. And this is really important because we all want to make a difference in the world. We all want to do something positive and to change the world. And you can do that, but it's, it's easier if you're more aware of kind of what impact you want to make and you are more aware of how do you do that? How do you influence more people? Now, you've already practiced this a little bit with your individuals, right? How are you influencing people? But you'll notice that it's not just those people you're influencing, but then the people that they're influencing as well. There's this kind of domino effect. You do something positive and then has this ripple of positive, you know, effect to the next, the next, the next person and so on. And we're going to play a little bit more with this today. Now when this awareness is low, you'll notice that we tend to be a little bit ruled by the ego. And by that I mean that we tend to either play small and kind of hide, 'cause we're a little afraid or we don't want to be seen in this global scale or even big community scale. Or we do the opposite and we show off, you know, and we like play a little bit too big, like, "Look at me, look how awesome I am." You know. And both of these are okay, there's nothing wrong with these, not judging them, but you notice that, "Okay, that's a sign that I could level up my awareness there and move into a place where I'm just more comfortable with myself. And I'm not feeling like I need to play too big or too small, 'cause this is essentially a sign that I'm you know, I'm just wondering, "What do people think about me?" And you know, I've been guilty of both of these and still am at times. But you'll notice when you get this more balanced awareness, it's no longer about you. You're not thinking, "What do people think about me?" You're thinking about "what impact am I having in the world? How am I helping people?" Right? And this is way more important and way more interesting and engaging than "What do people think about me?" 'cause that's just, that's kind of transient and not important right? Now you'll notice that if you have this balanced awareness of this community or global impact, you also tend to have kind of a more calm, you know, an authentic presence. And you are, you have this feeling that you're purposeful and life is satisfying 'cause you're doing something that's making a bigger difference in the world. And of course you also notice that, you know, your impact will increase. You'll just be more impactful if you're more aware. So we're going to start as we always do with a little self-assessment exercise to just find out how you're doing with your community and global impact awareness. So once again, just notice a point across the room; just let your awareness be present right here behind your eyes, and then just gently breathe your eyes closed, and hold that same awareness right behind your eyes. Now let your awareness move into the room in the center of your head. Just admire that room and how beautiful and clean and organized it is. And let one of the walls in that room in front of you, let it dissolve, until you're standing on a stage looking out at the theater again. And you're looking out at all the people that you've personally impacted. So you've got those people that are close to you and that extended friends and family, the work relationships and connections, and even the people that you'd, you know, you didn't know you'd impacted. So they're all in the room there. And first, notice. Does it feel a little more comfortable now that you've activated your awareness of your personal impact? And now consider that all the people in this room have a whole theater full of people they're influencing as well. So everyone you impact is impacting many other people. Now let's look at this a little different way. So, let your awareness start to zoom out until you're above the earth. And you're looking down at your community and see all the people that you're impacting light up like little lights. And your biggest personal impacts are the brightest lights. Start to notice who are they and where are they? And notice everyone else as well. All the smaller influence, smaller impacts you're having that are still important for all these people. Start to see all the people that they are impacting lighting up. So bright lights coming on around all these people that you've influenced, showing who they influenced and then who those people influenced. And so on and so on. Just see that light spreading, and notice how far around the country or the globe does your impact flow. How much community or global impact are you really having? And ask yourself how does this influence make you feel? Do you want to hide? And where are you hiding right now? Do you want to show off? Notice where you are showing off right now. Be amused. And beyond the people, see your thoughts and your words and your actions and your energy as it flows out into the world, and imagine yourself taking a more conscious role in your community and global impact. Just notice if you are more conscious, how much brighter will the world be? And ask yourself, "Do I want to make a global impact?" And notice the part of you that wants to say no. Maybe it doesn't like attention. Be aware of any emotions, like fear, anger, resentment, might get in the way of you wanting to make a global impact. Just be amused. And now notice the part of you that wants to say yes to make a global impact and be aware of the reasons why. Is it so you can be rich and famous? Is it so you can help people and express yourself? Just be aware; there's no right or wrong answers here. Great, now let your awareness be right back in the center of your head; stretch into your body. Be very present. And when you're ready, give yourself a deep breath, and open your eyes. Welcome back. Good job. I hope you got a little more awareness of how much impact you're really having in your community and on the globe and then of your own habits of either hiding or showing off and just kind of where you're at with that global impact. Now we're going to keep working with this over the next few days. We're going to work on helping you find how is it or what is it that you want to do to make an impact in the world? And we're going to look at what are the challenges in the way. Are there some blocks that you have to your impact in the world? And finally, I'll give you this really powerful technique for kind of broadcasting your message or your desire to help out into the world. And this is really fun, 'cause you're really going to raise this level of impact on a community and global scale. All right, so thanks so much for today, and I'd love it if you want to share today. Just share how do you feel about your personal impact on that global level or on that community level? Are you comfortable or uncomfortable, and how does it make you feel? Thanks so much for today, and I will see you tomorrow.

LESSON 56: Choosing Your Positive Path

--------------------
Meditation: Day 56 - Choosing Your Positive Path
--------------------

Hello everyone, I’m Jeffrey Allen. Welcome to day six of your Impact Awareness Challenge. This is your easy success day for community and global impact awareness. And what I want you to get today is increased clarity on how you want to impact your community and the world. And this is really great for discovering and refining your vision and also for helping you focus your efforts and make your impact bigger. So let’s begin. Find a point across the room where your eyes rest naturally. Focus on that point and be right behind your eyes. Breathe your eyes closed, maintaining that same awareness right behind your eyes. And gently move your awareness into that room in the center of your head. Very easily clear out any energy in this room which is not yours. And if there’s anyone else in the room with you, Just have them leave right now. Notice how good it feels to have a private space for you. Get a really strong sense of who you are on your own. Now open the door for your planning room. Keep that strong sense of who you are as you enter this planning room. And be aware that your plans include others too. So you want to create plans that you love. and that are well received by others. Look around this planning room now and notice what you see. Do you have a desk or some furniture? What’s the perfect place for your planning? Now think about your current activities. What are you working on now? Where do you spend most of your time and creativity? Are you having fun? Are you passionate about what you’re doing? How are your activities helping your community or the world? No judgments, just notice. Now think about your future plans. Do you have a talent that you want to use more? What have you been dreaming about working on? How would you spend your time? And how would this help your community or world? For now, put these plans aside, knowing that you can come back to them at any time. Let your mind be empty and open for something new to appear. Notice a window in your planning room. Go over to that window and notice that it looks out to an ideal future world for you. Just observe, don’t think. As you look out that window, notice what you see. What type of world are you living in? How is it different than now? What big changes have already happened in the world? Is there world peace or no more hunger? What vision are you being shown for this ideal future? Now notice your place in this ideal future world. How are you using your unique passion and skills? How are you spending your time and who are you spending your time with? Where do you live and where do you work? in this ideal world? Are you having fun? How does this future world feel to you? Let that window expand to show you an even bigger plan. What does the universe have in store for you and for the world? Let your awareness be in present time again. Remember what you’re doing right now. See an easy next step which takes you closer to that ideal future world. Notice one tangible thing that you can do in the next weeks, months, or year. Clean off anyone else’s ideas and let this next step be just for you. Does this feel good to you? Are you excited about this next step? Now consider your previous plan. How does this future world and next step fit in with your previous plan? Do you want to keep this plan or refine it or replace it? Take a moment and do that now. Be very present in your planning room again. Know that these plans will continue to evolve and grow in this room. You can come back and check on them anytime. For now, let go of any attachment and desire to know the answers right away. Step back into the room in the center of your head. Let yourself be in present time. Breathe and open your eyes. Welcome back. Great job. I hope you enjoyed the power of your planning room and that window into the ideal future. And if you want to deepen your awareness today, notice that bigger plan and see the tiny opportunities that you can align with today to get closer to that bigger plan. Because that ideal world might be closer than you think. A few tips when you’re working with this. The universe plans things without drama. So if you’re used to high drama and high excitement, you might be surprised by how calm and matter of fact that your next steps feel. That’s actually a good sign that you’re on the right track. So if you feel calm rather than super excited, you’re probably just tuning into that low drama plan of the universe. And that’s great. So we can just let go of any need for drama. Now, of course, I’d love it if you share. You could just tell me, what does your future ideal world look like? How can your unique personality and skills help that world happen? And what next steps can you take to get there? I’d love to hear all that. So thank you so much for today, and I will see you tomorrow.

========================================

LESSON 57: Removing Roadblocks To Success

--------------------
Meditation: Day 57 - Removing Roadblocks To Success
--------------------

Hello everyone, I’m Jeffrey Allen. Welcome to day seven of your Impact Awareness Challenge. This is your challenge day for your community and global impact awareness. And what I want you to get today is a clear path forward for making the impact that you desire. So we’re going to look at and clear any common roadblocks to your success. Now this is really great for facing any big challenges before they come up in the real world, and also for seeing any unconscious patterns that may be sabotaging your success. It’s also really good for getting excited about a new project instead of dreading moving into a new project. So it’s good for all those things. So let’s dive in. Find a point across the room where your eyes rest naturally. Focus on that point and breathe your eyes closed. Let your awareness move into that room in the center of your head. And imagine that ideal future world that you want to live in. Notice how it’s different from today’s world. And notice how do you want to help this world emerge. Now find that beautiful door to your emotions room and hold your plans for the future in your mind as you enter this emotions room. Remember those two balls of light that you’ve used in this room before. The light blue light is for helping you see things that are hidden or invisible. And the gold divine healing light is for clearing energy. So just feel those two balls of light with you right now. Remember your inspiration about this future world and your role. Let this blue light shine and start noticing any doubts or fears that you have about your vision or your role. Maybe your vision is unrealistic. Or your role in it is too big or too small? Is this just your ego wanting to be important? What other doubts or insecurities are lurking about your inspiration? Just let those come to you now. Smile and be amused. It’s normal to have doubt. Let that golden light shine now and see these doubts and insecurities lifting away. Feel yourself getting lighter as they move out of your space. And know that your vision and your role are perfect for you. Now imagine you’re busily working, turning your vision into an actual plan. Can you think of all the steps that are needed for this to happen? Can you plan and organize the agenda? Do you have to write a business plan? Are you considering all the angles and all the needs? Does this feel good to you or does it feel stressful? Are you really up to this task? Let the blue light shine brighter so you can see all the places you feel inadequate for this task. Maybe it’s hard for you to focus or you feel unqualified. What other inadequacies do you think are in the way? Smile and be amused. Let that golden light shine now and see these inadequacies lifting away. Breathe and feel yourself getting lighter and know that you are perfectly capable. That’s why this plan was given to you. Now imagine you’re communicating your plan with the world, telling everybody what you want to do. What will your friends or your family think? How will your work friends respond? Let the blue light shine and show you any hidden fears here. What are you afraid people will think about you? How might they judge your ideas and plans? Smile and be amused and let that golden light shine now and see the fear of judgment lifting away. Breathe and feel yourself getting lighter and know that you love your ideas and other people will too. Now think about all the hard work it will take to get to your ideal world. Imagine you’re looking up the hill at that long road in front of you. And notice, are you excited for this journey? Does it look like fun? Do you have what it takes to climb that big hill? Let that blue light shine again and show you any difficult beliefs you have about work. Do you think progress is an uphill battle? Maybe you need to wind yourself up to get motivated. Do you often imagine or create dramas along the way? What other roadblocks do you see in your way to success? Smile and be amused. Let that golden light shine now and see these difficulties, real or imagined, lifting away from you. Feel the burden go away. Feel yourself getting lighter. And notice the hill changing. So you’re standing at the top, looking down. See the fun road and journey ahead made easier because it’s downhill. See everyone who wants to help you along the way and see that clear goal in front of you. Now imagine you’re approaching that goal. Are you excited about your success? Do you really deserve to reach this goal? Are you ready to receive the rewards of your work? Let the blue light shine and see any reasons why it’s hard for you to succeed or to receive rewards. Maybe you’re not worthy. Maybe there’s another reason. Notice what it is. Smile and be amused. Let that golden light shine now and see all these reasons fading away. Breathe and feel yourself getting lighter. Receiving is a natural result of giving, and you are giving your time, your passion, and your talent to the world. So let yourself receive the rewards. Now imagine yourself living in your ideal future world. Notice how good it feels. See how the world has changed. Smile and acknowledge your role, the steps you took to create this world. Breathe in that feeling. Be grateful for your journey. Smile. And open your eyes. Welcome back. Great job. Congratulate yourself for looking at your fears and your worries and for letting them go. There’s no reason your future path can’t be fun and filled with joy. It doesn’t need to be difficult or filled with drama. If you want to deepen this awareness today, notice how your hidden fears and insecurities are influencing your life today. So whatever you see, just be amused and let them change. If you’d like to share today, I’d love to know what was your biggest obstacle and how did it feel when you cleared it? Thank you so much for today. I’ll see you tomorrow.

LESSON 58: Sending Your Invitation To The World

--------------------
Meditation: Day 58 - Sending Your Invitation To The World
--------------------

Hello everyone, I’m Jeffrey Allen. Welcome to day eight of your impact awareness challenge. This is your wow day for your community and global impact awareness. And I want to give you a new experience and do something that you didn’t know was possible. So today we’re going to do that by having you use your spirit to broadcast your message to a group. And this is really great for getting your message out into the world or inviting people to your products or business or any events that you have. It’s also great for testing and refining your message with your community. So before we start the meditation, with your eyes open right now, think of something that you want to invite people to. This could be a product or an event or a business or a website or even a blog or a Facebook page. What do you want to invite people to? What will people receive when they accept your invitation? How do you want to help people? Keep this in mind and find a point across the room where your eyes rest naturally. Focus on that point and be right behind your eyes. When you’re ready, breathe your eyes closed, maintaining that same awareness behind your eyes. Then gently move your awareness into that room in the center of your head. Notice how good it feels to have a private space for you. Imagine now you’re creating an invitation. that you’re going to send to your group. On this invitation, put your name and your face and what you’re inviting people to. Also put what they will receive if they accept. And finally, how do they follow up in the real world? Is there a website or a magazine or a place they can find you? Great. Now, put yourself in your recipient’s shoes. Imagine that you are receiving this invitation. And you respond. What happens next? What do you receive? How do you feel? What unique value is available to you? Notice one value or benefit you hadn’t thought of before. Good. Now look at your invitation again. And if needed, refine your invitation to include this unique value. And again, visualize this invitation in your hand. With your name, your face, what you’re inviting people to, what they’ll receive if they accept, and then a concrete way for them to follow through. Now imagine the group that you want to send this invitation to. Is this a local community? A country? The entire world? Imagine that you’re in the sky, looking down at your target group. halo or crown on top of your head? Smile and send a spirit hello from your crown chakra to everyone down below. See that hello shining out from your crown chakra and beaming down to every person below. See those people lighting up? Notice any hellos that you receive back. Very clearly and simply, send your message to everyone in the group. You’re going to say it to them and also see this invitation moving from your crown chakra to them. So tell them your name, show them your face, tell them what you’re inviting them to, and let them know what benefits they will receive. And don’t push… energy. Just relax and communicate. What benefits will they receive? Finally, let them know how they can follow through. See everyone who is interested lighting up. Notice the response to your invitation. Send a thank you to everybody in the group. Let your awareness return to the center of your head. And be excited about all the people that responded that lit up to your invitation. And be happy, but not attached to any outcome. Smile and stretch your awareness into your body. And when you’re ready, open your eyes. Welcome back. Great job. I hope you can feel how powerful this technique is for gracefully impacting the world. If you want to practice this today, you can try it even on a small scale at a meeting or with a group of friends at lunch. And to do this, you would just imagine that you’re up at the top of the room, because you can see everybody from there, and send a little message to everybody, and then wait before verbalizing it. What you’ll find is that oftentimes someone else will catch the thought and will bring it up in the conversation. This is a fun way to practice on a small scale. Again, a little tip. You don’t want to push your message to everybody. This isn’t for manipulating or compelling people. It’s just for gracefully creating invitation and flow. And throughout today and this week, remember to notice any results from this exercise. When you get results, you get that validation. You know that it’s really working for you. I’d love it if you shared today, how did you see people responding to your invitation? Thank you so much for today, and I will see you tomorrow.

LESSON 59: Global Impact Applications & Finding Your Team
--------------------
Hi everyone; I'm Jeffrey Allen, and welcome to day nine of your Impact Awareness Challenge. Now, you've already activated your personal impact awareness, and you've activated your community and global impact awareness. We're going to look at one more impact awareness today, but first let's take a look at what you did. So, you activated that global awareness by first doing that assessment of what impact are you really having on a global scale? And then you looked at how do you want to make an impact? What is it you want to get out to the world? And then any resistance that's kind of in the way, any impact blocks that you might be having; we helped move those out. And yesterday I gave you that really powerful wow exercise where you can broadcast your message out to a larger group and really get your information out there, so you can make an easier impact. So, it's a lot of fun. Now, of course, you already have that information inside now. You have that activation, and to grow that further, you just need to practice and to share. I'm going to give you a couple of good exercises where you can practice that right now. So, first the most obvious place is your personal application. So, if you start noticing that you are a little bit bored, or you feel like your life is lacking meaning, then this is a sign that you want to make a bigger impact. Also, if you have that sense that you are a little bit constipated with your impact, where you have a lot to give to the world and somehow it's not making it out into the world, again, you want to check those impact blocks and see what's there that may be stopping you from making the impact you want to make. Now, of course, you also want to notice on the personal level is your ego getting in the way? Are you trying to hide a little bit and play small? Are you trying to show off a bunch and play big ? And just let it shift to where you're focusing on the people that you're helping, rather than focusing on what people think about you. You know, it's actually a very simple shift and you'll notice that that kind of calms down, and you find that nice place in the middle. Now, in your relationships, you can really apply this if you find a shared passion with your partner. Doesn't have to be something in business. But if you find a way where both of you together are wanting to help the world and there's something you can do together to help the world, or support each other in helping the world, this is a really great thing for a relationship, 'cause it just feels so good. And you'll also notice that as you do that for yourself, or with your partner, that being that bigger you and having that bigger impact is more fun and you're actually more enjoyable to be around. You're more you, really, and you'll also notice you'll start to inspire the people around you to play a bigger game. As your game goes up, everybody's watching and saying, "I want to do that too." So your impact awareness is impacting them and impacting their impact awareness. Okay, complicated sentence. So, also at work you can really apply this to do energy marketing. I use this a lot, the technique where I go up and then I see who I'm going to reach and broadcast to them. I did this before my first training session in Japan and they called me and said, "We're not having a lot of signups. "We've just got..." it was maybe a dozen people had signed up for the class. And I said, "Okay, let me take a look." So I did the energy work that I showed you yesterday, contacted everybody, and amazingly, then the class filled up to capacity. And when I got there, something really strange happened. I had two students come up during the break and say "The reason I came to this class, was that you appeared to me in this vision. You told me your name. You told me where you were going to be working, what you were teaching. And then I picked up this magazine the next week, and I saw your picture and the same person I'd seen in this vision, and that's why I came to your class. I knew I needed to come." So they actually got it, not just subconsciously, but on a conscious level too, which is really exciting. Because we're on day nine, we would normally start to wind things down now and take an Integration Day where you could move into kind of a do-it-yourself exercise, or rest. And we're going to do actually the opposite today 'cause we're right at the end of the program. We're going to move into a don't-do-it-yourself awareness. Okay, so the third part of your impact awareness, of course we did the one-on-one, which was your immediate, or personal impact. We did the one to many where you're impacting many people, but the third part is many to many. So you're collaborating, right? So we're going to work on your collaborative impact awareness because this is really important right now. We're moving out of the age where everybody was doing it themselves. Competing with each other and kind of in these silos, even where we had, this country and that country, or this region, or this race. And we're really blending that together and getting much more collaborative. That's where we're moving into right now and in the future. And you'll notice that if you begin to engage your collaborative impact awareness, you'll notice that the people that you thought you might be competing with are actually your friends. And you're actually on the same team, and you can partner together and get more done. It's also a lot less stressful. So, like I'm trying to reach many many people and help shift the awareness on the planet. If I do that by myself, it feels like this huge chore, but I'm not doing it by myself. There's many people making cool programs and helping raise awareness. And they're all on the same team as me. We're collaborating to make a better world. So, I want to help you get that awareness today because it just feels so much better. It's not as overwhelming, and it's surely where we're moving to on the planet with our global awareness. All right. So go ahead and focus on a point across the room, and be present right behind your eyes, and when you're ready, just breathe your eyes closed. Maintaining that same awareness behind your eyes. And let your awareness move into that room in the center of your head, and let yourself be up above the earth. Remember when you were sending your message out about how you want to help the world. You were seeing people lighting up. See that again. See your potential global impact as you're helping the world. And now, look around you in the sky, and notice that there's other people here that are doing the same exercise, that are sending a similar message out into the world. Notice all the people that want to help the world in a similar way that you want to help. And notice how you view these people. Are you thinking, oh, they're more successful or less successful than me? Are they more impactful, or less impactful? Notice if you're collaborating or if it feels like you're competing with these people, and be amused. Now, look at these people in a different way. If your goal is to help people, this happens faster when more people are helping. This is your team. This is not your competition. And send a message to your team right now. I see you. I admire your impact and tell them, "Let's do more together. Let's play together," and send them your name and a picture of you and how to find you. Send this message right now to everyone else on the same team. Everyone that's helping the world in a similar way to you. And notice who's receiving this. See all the potential collaborators. And don't think about it. Just be aware. Who are these people? Where can you meet them? And decide right now to go to those places, go to those events where you can meet these people and begin collaborating. Great, now be in the room in the center of your head again, and just be grateful that you're not in it alone. So many people are helping change the world. Stretch your awareness into your body. Give yourself a deep breath, smile, and open your eyes. Welcome back. Good job. I hope you could see that there's so many people on the same team as you. There's so many people wanting to help you and wanting to help other people in the world, and I want you to let that happen. And today you can deepen this awareness by just noticing, as you go about your day, who's on the same team as me and how do I collaborate with those people? How do I connect with them? Now, when you share today, because we're at the end of the program, I would love to hear how has this program affected you? How are you using your awareness? And if you have a particular story, like what's the biggest thing that changed for you that came out of changing your awareness and raising your awareness and anywhere through the program? I'd love to hear that from you 'cause it's just so fun for me to see that I'm having that impact as well. All right so, thanks so much for today, and tomorrow we're moving into the last day. We're going to have a celebration and also send this energy and this awareness out to everybody else on the planet. So, we're going to take that collaborative impact awareness; we're going to use it to make big change in the world. Thanks again, and I will see you tomorrow.

LESSON 60: Sharing Your Awareness With The World
--------------------

<v ->Hi, everybody; I'm Jeffrey Allen,</v> and welcome to the final day of your Impact Awareness Challenge and the final day of the Spiritual Fitness Challenge. And I'm so glad that you made it. I want to say that you are amazing. You made it all the way through the program, and I'm really excited to share this last day with you. So when you look back at the beginning of the program, the original question why I created the program was why is it difficult or why is it slow to grow spiritually? And after looking at it, I realized that there's a certain level of spiritual fitness that we need to have in these six major areas for us to grow and evolve easily. It's a little bit like running a marathon. If you don't have the practice and you don't have a certain level of fitness, you can't just dive in and run the marathon right away. But if you have that level of fitness, you can do the marathon right away; you can take advantage of many things right away, and that's what you have now because you've achieved this level of fitness in your spiritual space. Now we looked at the way to develop this awareness in these six key areas was to go through those six steps for awareness success. And that's to do a self-assessment, to have an easy success, to challenge yourself and move out any old difficulties, and then to have a wow experience where you really get excited and you do something new. Those are the first four steps and that is the activation part. The next part is just practicing and sharing with others. Now you've completed all this activation so far, and I want you to really listen to how much you've done so far because this is really powerful. You started out in that first phase where you were working on your self-awareness, and you looked at just who are you as a consciousness? Where are you in time, where are you in space, and can you move yourself around in time and space? So very powerful. Second, we went into your body awareness. First, internally in the physical body, can you feel your body more deeply and really be connected and have that awareness? And also went into the energy body, so beyond the physical; how do you work with your energy which is also in the body, and then how do you combine those together? Now the third phase, we went into your mental awareness, first starting out in the inside, your internal mental awareness, and just creating that center of the head space, clearing out all the old stuff, and really calming the mind. Then we did the external mind awareness where you're listening to the world and with this new awareness and new clarity and using that mental awareness to really listen in an effective way. Then we went into your spiritual awareness, and we looked at two aspects there too. We looked at your intuition, your ability to perceive things as a spirit, and we refined that, and we looked at your spiritual connection, so how do you connect with the planet and with other people and with the source, and we also looked at connecting with the Akashic records and how to pull that in with your intuition, so really powerful spiritual awareness. Now we also took that next step and worked on your emotional awareness, where you looked at how much are you giving yourself permission to have all your emotions? And we built that map from any emotion into a positive gratitude or joy so that you're not resisting your emotions; you're actually using them as signposts to take you where you want to go. We also looked at your empathy awareness, so, how sensitive are you to feeling energy from other people and how much is that affecting you, and then we cleaned that up so you can just be more authentically you. Finally, this last phase, we're doing your impact awareness, looking at how are you personally impacting people and is it okay with you and how do you amp that up? And then how do you impact people in a larger way in your community or on the globe? And then yesterday, we just started looking at the collaborative effects. When you collaborate with people, what's the impact that we're all having as we're all trying to help and move things on the planet, and this is just so amazing. The result of all this awareness that you've already activated inside you is that you are now able to take that out into the world and you can expect that things will be different. New opportunities are going to come to you; you'll notice things more easily, and you'll be able to continue to progress and move up as you go. And now I have to say too, I know that it hasn't been an easy journey for you. There were probably some times where you fell asleep in the meditations or you just didn't want to do it or some resistance came up. You probably missed a day or two here and there, but it doesn't matter because you have that activation inside you. Activation is just a direction and momentum energetically. So now you have a direction to go with your awareness and you have momentum; you just need to keep practicing and sharing, and that will continue to grow. Now, today, I want to really use what you've learned. So we're going to do a meditation where we connect with everybody on the planet and we broadcast these six awarenesses out to everybody and really leverage the power of this group to influence that global change that we're looking for, that change into greater awareness. You might wonder how much impact can one group make as you're meditating, and it's actually quite remarkable. The Maharishi Institute has been doing research on this for many years, and their exercise is on stopping crime, so they'll set up a group of people who are meditating, doing this transcendental meditation, and they'll measure crime rates in a city that's nearby. So they did this in Washington, DC, for example, and they noticed that they can actually reduce the crime rate to almost zero just by having people meditating in a certain way. I mean, it's really remarkable, and this study shows, one, that it's possible, but also they looked at what's the tipping point? So how many people does it take to affect a population? How many people does it take to sort of tip the energy so that everybody else, even if they're unconscious, raise to a different level of awareness, and it's not that big. It's actually the square root of 1% of the target population. So I like to think big, you know; I think about the planet. We've got about 7.5 billion people right now but let's just round up. Let's say it's 8.1 billion. We take 1% of that. That's 81 million, and the square root of 81 million? Anybody? 9,000. Okay, actually pretty easy math problem. So if we can affect 9,000 people and get 9,000 people activated with this level of awareness, that's the tipping point. Everybody else will be activated too, and we'll start to move in that direction. So it's only 9,000 people. We can do that; we can get 9,000 people through this program and get 9,000 people activated, and who knows? Maybe we can do it right now today in this meditation. So let's give it a shot. Go ahead, we'll go into this last meditation. Just find that place across the room where your eyes rest naturally. Have your awareness right behind your eyes in the center of your head, and just gently breathe your eyes closed, maintaining that same awareness in the center of your head. Good. Now, just admire this space that you've created for yourself in the center of your head, and feel all this awareness, all this activation that you've developed over the last 60 days, and let your awareness move up into the sky where you're above the Earth and you're looking down, and notice a circle of everyone who is sharing this meditation with you. So a circle of everyone who's taken this spiritual fitness challenge. And imagine you can reach out and you can hold hands in a gigantic circle in the sky. Feel all the friends you've made along the way, and feel me in the circle as well. And now make room for any new people who will take this challenge in the future. Feel the circle; feel the power, the enthusiasm, the awareness that we have, and send a big hello to everyone on the planet right now. See all your human brothers and sisters lighting up with that hello, and notice we're all on the same team. No one is left out of this healing. And now, send everybody an invitation to wake up and to become more aware right now. In the middle of our circle, see a bright octahedron starting to spin, with that pyramid pointed up and that pyramid pointed down. And this octahedron holds the energy of awareness activation. Feel your self-awareness activation, your ability to sense yourself in time and space, and really feel that inside you; feel all that you've learned, and send this self-awareness activation into that geometry in the center of the circle now. So see your activation, all that you've learned, moving into that octahedron that's spinning in the center of the circle. Now feel your body awareness activation, that physical body and that energy body activation, everything that you learned, everything that's activated and passionate inside you. Really feel it, and send that activation into that geometry, that octahedron in the center of the circle. Notice it getting brighter and spinning faster, and now feel your mental awareness activation, that internal clarity that you have, that ability to listen to other people; take that activation, that enthusiasm, all that learning, and send it out into that geometry that's spinning in the circle. Feel that activation, charging it up, and now feel your spiritual awareness activation, your intuition, your ability to listen, your ability to connect as a spirit. Feel that power of that activation in you, and send that energy out into the geometry, into that spinning octahedron in the center. See that geometry charging up, spinning brighter and faster, and now feel your emotional awareness activation, your ability to feel your emotions, to take care of them and to transform them into gratitude and joy, and really feel your empathy, your ability to connect, to match, to unmatch with others, and to understand your emotions. And send that powerful feeling, that activation, out into that geometry into that octahedron that's spinning in the center of our circle. See it getting brighter, and now feel your impact awareness activation, your understanding of your individual impact. Feel your community, your global impact, and your collaborative impact working with others. Then feel that activation in you, that power, and send that out into the geometry in the center of our circle. See it charging up, so bright, and admire this amazing light of activation that's spinning right there in between all of us. Feel everyone in the circle. Just feel gratitude and joy, and begin sending this light, this invitation for activation to people that are close to you. See the energy beaming down from this octahedron. Invite your friends and family to be activated and aware. See them lighting up that invitation, and invite your community to this activation to raise their awareness. Now send that activation, that invitation, to your entire country; invitation for everybody to wake up, to be more aware in all these ways. See your country lighting up, and now send this invitation for activation to the entire planet. Invite everyone to wake up, to be activated now, and especially see the people that are in pain and confusion. Let that activation reach those people; invite them to share in this activation, and also include all the people that may be causing pain and confusion. Invite them to wake up as well, for them to have activation to move in a positive direction and positive momentum. See this bright light of activation and awareness shining all around the planet, and feel admiration and gratitude to everyone in this circle. Everyone collaborating with you, everyone willing to raise their awareness. Great, now, be in the center of your head again. Breathe in all that awareness, and see it shining out in front of you, lighting up your next steps, so you can easily find what's the next thing for you and to continue growing and building and raising your awareness, and see all the collaboration, all the gratitude and joy of working with others. And thank you so much for beginning this journey with me into your greater awareness. I can't wait to see what happens next. So thank you, everybody. When you're ready, take a deep breath, smile, stretch, and open your eyes. Thank you so much for being on this journey with me. Thank you for helping yourself, for helping the people around you, and for helping everybody on the planet. It's with a great gratitude and joy that I say thank you again and goodbye.

Lesson 61: Continuing Your Journey

--------------------

Text: Congratulations again on completing 60 days of Unlocking Transcendence! You are amazing!

Even if you never peek at the materials again, your activation is in place, and you will begin seeing yourself and your life differently – with eyes open to new interpretations and new possibilities!

If you want to deepen your awareness, I invite you to revisit the lessons again in the future, either as a new 60-day Quest or one 10-day section at a time. Each time, you’ll find new awareness and realize how much you’ve grown too. I recommend taking a break for a few days (or weeks) after each 10-day section to let your awareness integrate into your daily life.

Of course, if you haven’t taken my Duality energy awareness training, I recommend checking it out too. It’s a great complement to Unlocking Transcendence and will stimulate your mind and personal growth in a whole new way.

For more ideas on using your new awareness in daily life or sharing this teaching with others, please see the documents below.

Thanks again! Enjoy!
