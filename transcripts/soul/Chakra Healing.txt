COURSE: Chakra Healing

Preparation

========================================

Preparation 1: What is Chakra Healing?

We have a paradigm in which mind is separated from body. We have a paradigm of separation. People are divided within themselves. They are living in their heads and they're trying to have mental concepts to fix that, but the body is ailing. They're going to doctors to fix the body, but they don't look at the spirit and what's going on. I'm Anadeya Judith, author of Wheels of Life and a number of best -selling books on the chakras. I've been a spiritual teacher and a therapist for over 40 years, and I've traveled the world seeing people and their problems. People get lost in the spiritual smorgasbord. They're dedicated to their growth, but there's so many paths in so many ways, and they don't know quite how to put it all together. They don't have a systematic map for their personal growth. And that map is the chakra system. It's been my life's work ever since. So a chakra is an energy center. It's like an organ in the energetic body. Just like we have a heart that's an organ in the physical body, we have these organs in the energetic body. And they organize energy, they organize the life force through four functions. Through the receiving, we receive love, we receive information. Through the assimilation of that, can we absorb that? Can we store it? Can we remember it? And can we express it? So we take in, we assimilate, we store and we express and each chakra needs to be able to do all four of those functions on each and every level. Most people think of the chakras as this ladder that they climb up to higher consciousness. And that indeed is what it is. That's one of the pathways. But I discovered there is an equally powerful current that comes down through the chakras. It starts in highest consciousness with an idea. And then we visualize that idea. We imagine it. We speak about it. We give it words. We fashion our sound bites. And we find the right relationships to bring that vision into being. We empower ourselves to get done what we have to do. We move things into place. And the thought planes get denser and denser until in the first chakra, they manifest on the physical plane. That's the current of manifestation. The densifying, if you will, of thought, step by step in a practical pattern. That's beautiful. I never thought about it that way. Seven chakras to me describe the architecture of the soul. And just like a body worker or a yoga teacher might study the physiology, as a psychologist, I've studied the soul. And I found that it has this architecture that is basically the same for everyone and yet has an individual expression for each person. This chakra healing quest is a 35 -day journey. into the deepest core of yourself. We will work with all seven chakras and we'll spend three days on each chakra with one on the mind and our psyche and how we got programmed by childhood experiences, one on the body with yoga and bio energetic exercises to condition your body, and one on spirit, how we can address the larger universal experience and address what's happening in the world. It's a way of connecting heaven and earth, mind and body, spirit and matter, back into an indivisible whole, something that will bring you powerful, dynamic, permanent change.

====================

Preparation 2: Prepare for Your Quest
--------------------
<v ->Now before you take any journey,</v> you need a general direction of where you're headed and what to prepare, that's exactly what we'll cover in this video. For the entire Quest expect to take action, expect to move your body and do yoga, expect to encounter yourself. So what is the Quest? A quest is a search, a sacred journey for something valuable, something necessary for the healing. When the Knights went on a quest to find the grail it's because the grail contained the elixir of healing for a broken world. It wasn't a quest for something ordinary, it was a quest for something important, something necessary. However, it's not just the object of your search that is the goal of the quest, but what you find is there's an the evolution of the soul that occurs along the way of the journey. Some of the knights never found the grail but they learned so much in their encounters with various places in the world that they evolved their own souls. So the most valuable lesson will happen like miracles during, and even after the Quest. So how will it happen? Every day you'll get a 10 to 15 minute lesson video, 10 to 15 minutes of activity that you do every day. So that means a total of 20 to 30 minutes every day that you'll do for the next five weeks. So in your preparation guide you will find a calendar and that way you know what we're going to cover when, what's coming up. For the first four weeks, we'll work on two chakras per week, Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday first chakra, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, the next chakra. And in that each one will have a focus on the psyche, a focus on the body and a focus on spirit and how we interface with the world. Then on the seventh day of the week will be a simple day for review and integration, no lesson there but a chance to catch your breath. Then we'll go on to the next two chakras until we have reached the crown chakra in the fourth week. So you're not going to just heal your chakras by waving your hands over them, it really takes a deep dive into the historical programming that you got from your childhood to help bring these issues into light that will help you understand yourself better and know what you need to do in order to heal. That'll be the part on the chart on a particular chakra and the psychological aspects that chakra and your psyche. This material might bring things up for you, and if it does, it means it's ready to be dealt with, it's ready to be healed. You might feel resistance and that's normal 'cause you're working with years of unconscious programming that needs to be moved aside to free yourself up. So know that when the resistance happens or when things come up for you, that's the gold and it's leading to a payoff, freedom, healing and relief from some of the symptoms you've been carrying for a long time. On the second day, as we explore the body, we'll look at body practices we can do to help move energy into or out of a particular chakra. We'll learn yoga flows and we'll even learn everyday movements that take just a few seconds at various times in the day when you remember, to help you come into contact with that chakra or change some of the habits of your body. If you've never been exposed to yoga, well, here's a chance to learn some basic routines for each chakra, a couple poses at a time. If you're already a practitioner of yoga you'll begin to pair poses with the different chakras and I will occasionally give commands for more advanced practice. You'll also learn more about how energy works and moves as we do bioenergetic exercises designed to move energy through the body. And you'll learn about how the chakra system works in general in the next video. On the third day of each chakra, you'll learn about how that chakra fits into the bigger picture, what belief systems inhibit this chakra and what actions you can take to heal, not only yourself but the environment and the world in which you live so that you can align with your higher self, with others and truly become a rainbow warrior here to help the evolution of human consciousness. So the first four weeks will be on the liberating current climbing up the chakras from bottom to top, in the last week, we're going to come back down what I call the manifestation current. And in that you will go from personal healing to learning how to apply these principles, to make changes in your life and create something in the world. People think the chakra system is all about liberation and transcendence and that's certainly an important part of it, but without the downward current we can be too spiritual and not grounded. We need to be able to apply what we have in a practical way. It's not about leaving the body, it's about integrating the body with spirit and finding liberation from within the body. We're going to learn more about liberating and manifesting currents in the next video but know that in that final week you will be following practices along with me as I coach someone in the whole process of manifestation. So it's not just a chakra healing Quest, but as a bonus you get this manifesting current after you're all done, you learn how to use that and take it into the world and then you can be an example or a teacher for others. Now here's the fun part, you get to choose your level of interaction. If you know, you're going through a particularly tough month, you can go through the Quest on a medium or a light engagement. Or if you're very busy and say, "I don't have time for all that", you can take in the videos and maybe do one or two of the exercises. That's fine, you'll still get a lot out of the course. That's a light engagement and it's recommended if you just want an overview, if you don't have much time or if you're completely new to spirituality, energy bodies or personal development, you might try the simple method. If you have a little more time, you can do a medium engagement, there's weekly challenges in each chakra, there's a skill set to develop and there's exercises you can do what you can for either. Recommended if you're really ready to take yourself on. Each chakra has a challenge and that challenge is designed to specifically overcome particular blocks related to the chakra. The challenge is meant to clear and strengthen your chakra. You can find the list of activities to choose from in your weekly companion workbook. You'll have almost an entire week to complete the challenge and share your experience with the Tribe. You'll never know who you will inspire to work on their chakras as well, or who from the Tribe might inspire you to do something new. You can also create your own challenge. These are small adjustments to behaviors that you do every day, like stopping to take a breath or remembering to widen your base when you sit down, they're very simple and you don't need to do them all the time, they're just guidelines and gentle reminders to change some of the conditioned habits in your body, your mind, and your psyche. And if you're one of those people that goes in with both feet and does full engagement, well, then you'll do everything. You'll do one small chakra skill set for each chakra, two skills in a week and then there will be small adjustments to behaviors that you do every day. You'll be sharing them with the Tribe, you'll do the yoga, you'll really take it on and find a full way to transform yourself. And of course you can start out with a mild engagement and then if you find the material exciting, you can engage full-on, you'll get to keep the videos so you can go back and do it again and again. And maybe you can do it on a different level. You can change tracks any time, you can start with a full engagement or go to a lighter or start with a lighter and go to a more full, mix it up, personalize it, flow with it, have fun. It's your quest after all. This is where we set up the quest is fun. Play with the journey, miracles happen along the journey, sometimes when you least expect it. And regardless of which level you've decided to take it will be a rapid and dynamic journey into the core of your being. So it's important to keep going through the process as new moments keep coming just as they need to. Along the way you may think "I feel overwhelmed" and that's a pretty natural response, but you know it might be that you feel overwhelmed already and that's just an attitude. Not that you don't have to do it all, do what you can and take it at the pace that's right for you. But maybe this plan will help you become less overwhelmed. So how to prepare for this Quest? So it's ideal, not required, but ideal to have a yoga mat, strap, could even be a belt or a neck tie and if you're a beginner, you may need some yoga blocks for the yoga portion on the body days. Find a sacred place to practice your yoga where you can park your phone or your computer and follow along, download the weekly companion workbook and buy a journal to write down your reflections as you go through the journey. The other thing you need is a positive attitude and excitement about taking this Quest into your own growth and healing. We also invite you to join and become active in the Tribe of the Rainbow Warriors. That's going to be a safe space where you can be vulnerable, we're going to share pictures and videos and insights of what we did. We're going to learn from one another and create a powerful group. You're encouraged to find a partner in the Tribe for the journey, it's not mandatory, but it's highly recommended, somebody who can be like a buddy to guide you through. So what are the hurdles that you might face? You might be telling yourself as we are in this busy world, "I don't have enough time for this", but my suggestion is to let the information sink in, practice the everyday movement that just takes seconds and focus on the areas in which you need the most work. After all, it's only for five weeks, five weeks that could change your life commit to it, relish it, milk it for all it's worth. You'll feel powerful that you did it and actually it will go by very quickly. You know, they say it takes 21 days to change a habit, so think of all the, think of all the habits you're going to change in these 35 days. So what about keeping your motivation going? Well, quickly implement what you learned so you can feel the benefits and be active in the Tribe. Others will inspire you to keep going, they'll keep you motivated at a time you might lose motivation. You'll learn what they do and something you missed and that'll make you want to go back and make it up. Pair up with someone in the Tribe, it's a lot more fun when you learn together and resistance, that's natural. Give your resistance a few minutes to express itself, that's the little kid saying, "I don't want to" and then get on with your task. We're actually going to learn about that as a technique in the manifesting current, because we all have resistance especially as we go through any personal growth process try counting down from five and then just get on and do it. So what happens if you miss a day? We want everyone to move through together as a group, that creates a kind of group synergy and excitement, we're all in the same place at the same time. So if you feel like you're falling behind and you miss a class or two, that's kind of inevitable, just join in on the Monday with everybody else. Remember you're going to get to keep these materials and you can always go back and make up what you lost or do the exercises that you missed. You'll get a chance to repeat the Quest as many times as you want with other members of the Rainbow Warrior Tribe, other cohorts along the way. So here's your exercise for today. If you haven't already, download the preparation guide get acquainted with the journey and then decide if you're going to go through on the light track, the medium track or the full engagement. Fill in the self-assessment in the preparation guide. This will help you know what chakras you want to focus on, it'll give you something to compare yourself from the beginning to the end of the Quest and you'll know how much you've grown. If you haven't yet joined the Tribe, now's a natural time to start looking for a buddy if you want one it's recommended, it's not required. We empower you to do this on your own, but if you need help there's a Tribe facilitator who can help you and finally gather what you need to do the yoga, create the space to follow along on the body days. So prepare to play full out. You won't be graded in this course, but just imagine if you were and you wanted to get an A, how would you engage with the course? The more you engage, the more you're going to get out of it but it's entirely up to you.

====================

Preparation 3: Fundamentals: Introduction to Chakras
--------------------
<v ->So today we're going to learn the fundamentals</v> of the chakra system. We're going to have an overview and look at all the chakras together. So first of all, what are the chakras? Well, most of us know them as energy centers but what does that really mean? I'll give you my definition. Chakras are wheel-like energy centers, and the word actually means wheel, that's what it translates as, for the reception, the assimilation, the storage, and the expression of life force energy. You could think of them as chambers in the temple of the body and just like the chambers in your home, you have a kitchen and a living room and a bedroom, each chamber is designed to receive a different kind of energy. When you come home from the grocery store, you put your food in the kitchen, you don't take it to the bathroom and that kitchen is designed to handle the food, it's designed to let you prepare it, assimilate it, eat it and place to put the garbage so you can take it back out. So each of these chambers in the temple of the body is designed to handle a particular kind of energy and how we receive it, assimilate it, store it, or express it has to do with the health of that chakra, so as we're healing our chakras, we're bringing these aspects into balance. The chakras also relate to levels of consciousness, ways of looking at the world, like a lens, looking at your survival issues, your emotional issues, your power issues, your relationship issues, your communication, your imagination, your wisdom, looking at all these different aspects of your life as different levels of consciousness. They're metaphors. You may not believe that there's any kind of energy systems in your body at all, but it's a very profound philosophical system that is a metaphor for various aspects of your life and the world and really, it's a map to the architecture of your soul. So just like we study the bones and the muscles and ligaments and organs of the body in order to better understand the body and how to keep it healthy, we also have an architecture to our soul and if you really want to heal the soul, you have to understand that architecture. So everybody's talking about chakras these days, but where did it really come from? Some say it's from ancient India thousands of years ago, but there's nary a mention in the very oldest documents of India. You could maybe extrapolate a little bit here and there but the real teachings came around the tantric period of Indian philosophy. That was maybe 500 to 1200 AD, depends on what scholar you talk to. So there were texts written about the chakras, from that period of time in history. The Shatchakra Nirupana, the Padaka Pancaka and the Gorakshashatakam was written in the 10th century. Many of these texts were translated by a man named Arthur Avalon, or Sir John Woodroffe and this was one of the first books published in English called "The Serpent Power" published in 1919. And in those texts, the chakras were points of meditation, they were areas of the body or elements that we meditated upon, there weren't a lot of postures that went with it and they were just something to guide your meditation, but the chakras describe a very profound, philosophical system. They have locations in the body and through that, in the modern updating of the system, we look at the elements in each chakra, earth, water, fire, air, and in the old texts, it says ether, but I've extrapolated it to a seven-element system, sound, light and thought or consciousness. We look at these elements, we look at where they are in the body, what that part of the body is doing and from that is created a full philosophical system that looks at your life. Now as a psychologist, I also looked at this from the psychological point of view. I saw what came through my office in my clients and in my students and my teaching and the issues they had and what their history was and I started to put this together, survival issues coming from this part of your life, power issues coming from that part of your life. And as I started to put that together I could see a whole psychological schema. and as people have worked through that in my book, "Eastern Body, Western Mind," people have transformed and had amazing results. People tell me that every day. So I know that there's viability to the psychological aspects of the chakras and that's what we bring to you in your healing. Now, I've also been a yoga instructor and chakras come from the yoga tradition. And yoga means yoke, it's the way to link the mortal with the divine, like yoking a horse to the carriage. And that yoke of yoga, to me, the chakra system is the structure of the yoke of yoga. It is the architecture that shows how the mortal body is yoked to the divine through these seven steps. So these are a map for the personal journey. So the word chakra literally means wheel or disc and I'm sure it's not what the ancients meant, but think of your chakras as programs on a floppy disk. Remember those? Each chakra contains core programs that govern everything you do, feel and think. If you want to change your life, you need to change that programming. You need a systematic step-by-step plan, for both liberating yourself, from fixed forms that hold you back, and for manifesting your higher ideals. Chakras are a map that can help you connect to the organs in your physical and energetic body. For example, if you're stressed, it might be an imbalance in your third chakra, which governs energy, power and will. Anxiety can be too much energy, depression can be too little. This is ways that that chakra can get out of balance. If scarcity is an issue and you feel like there's never enough, maybe that's a core program in your root chakra that governs survival. If you want to open your heart, well, that would be the heart chakra. If you want to balance your relationships, if you want to open your communication and free up your creativity, that would be your throat chakra. By changing your inner world, you change your outer world, because really, the chakras are portals between the inner world and outer world at seven different levels. Some healing systems like Western medicine, address primarily the body. Others look at mental health and address the psyche and are devoid of the body. Some systems are spiritual, like meditation or yoga, but they don't necessarily address the psychological elements. To me, the chakra system is about the only thing that addresses all three aspects, body, mind and energy, or body, mind and spirit and puts them together in an indivisible whole. And many systems of healing are already here but they don't really address changing the culture, they're all about just working on yourself which can become narcissistic after a while. I mean, if you look at 30, 40 years, of people doing spiritual work and what a mess the world is in, it's obvious there's something else we need to do, we need to bring that learning back down. Well, chakras are not only a guide for your personal journey, they're a guide for humanity's evolution. How do chakras work? A chakra is a vortex of energy spinning at the core of the body, but chakras are also portals between the inner and outer world and they have gates that act as defenses to keep things from coming in and also to keep some things from coming back out. So they're gates that mediate between the inner and outer world and those defenses slow down what we can receive or what we can get rid of and result in blocks in the chakras. We mentioned how chakras contained programs, well, programming starts at birth, if not before, and some of our programming is conscious, like the language we speak and the things we believe and primarily most of it is unconscious programs that govern our behavior and thoughts that we don't even know were there. Our purpose here is to make the unconscious conscious so that we can have a choice about it. That's part of the liberating current. So the content of these programs is formed by our history, by the things we've been taught, the things we've gone through and experienced, how we dealt with that, what our defenses were that allowed us to survive the slings and arrows of childhood. They've taught us what we believe, and they have put those programs into our nervous system and even the structure of our body. The trouble is we have bugs in the programs and sometimes we need to upgrade those programs to get them to work in a modern system, just like we do when we upgrade systems in our computers. So what are chakras made of? Ultimately, they're made of energy. Energy that in yoga is called prana, in martial arts or Chinese medicine it's called chi or qi, Freud called it libido, Star Wars calls it the force, Wilhelm Reich called it orgone energy, the word that I use in this Quest is charge. I like to think of charge as standing for consciousness having a really genuine experience. And charge is something we can all relate to, but all of these words refer to the same thing, they're the system of energy in the body and that's what chakras are really designed to organize and handle for you. Now, these energy centers are aligned along the core of the body. In yoga that's called the sushumna, the central channel that goes from the base to the spine and it's the central integrating channel for all the chakras, but it's not the only one. There are spiral currents that go crisscrossing through the chakras called the Ida and the Pingala, which means moon and sun, respectively, and they crisscross between the chakras and meet at the sixth chakra and at the first. There are also currents through which energy travels. There's energy meridians that we know from Chinese medicine and in yoga they call them nadis, lots of subtle currents and they say there's 72,000 nadis in the body that carry and generate energy and prana and carry it to the body. Part of our job is to purify those nadis so they can carry the energy more effectively into and out of the chakras. And then finally, there's this force called Kundalini, which is said to be a goddess in serpent form that spirals and undulates up and down your spine to pierce and awaken each chakra in turn. We won't be trying to generate Kundalini in most cases, we're trying to clear the chakras so that if Kundalini should arise, your chakras can better handle it, and we'll talk more about this when we get to the crown chakra. In addition, we'll be traveling to different currents up and down the chakras. When we go from bottom to top, we're going from earth which is fixed, to water which is more fluid, to fire which is even freer, to air which is invisible, to sound which can travel through space, to light that can travel from a distant galaxy, to consciousness that's everywhere. We're moving from the finite to the infinite, we're getting freer and freer as we rise. This is the current of liberation, in the old texts, it was called moksha or freedom. So we liberate ourselves from fixed patterns and become freer and freer. This is the bulk of our Quest. At the end of the Quest, we'll be taking the downward current, the manifesting current that begins with an idea or a thought or an intention and then we visualize that and we bring it down into a little bit more concrete form. Once we've seen it in our mind's eye, then we talk about it and that's even more concrete. We bring it down into the heart, we find the right relationships, we empower it with action, we move things into place and move along and finally, we bring everything together in a fully manifested form. This is the manifesting current. Now, in the old texts, it was called, Bukti, which means enjoyment. So it is through the descending current that we enjoy the manifestation that is a condensation of consciousness, getting denser and denser at each level and coming into physical form. That's the other side of the journey. So one thing about these upward and downward currents is as they go through the core of the body, you can imagine that like roundabouts in a highway, they are creating a vortex of energy. Why do we have to heal our chakras? Well, we can't complete the liberating current or even the manifesting current if we have blocks in our chakras. So we have to clear them, give them what's necessary for them to function well, clear out the old, unuseful programs, the limiting beliefs, the things that get in our way so that the liberating current can complete its journey and take us to higher consciousness and freedom and the manifesting current can choose what it wants to create and create it and bring it into full form. How do our chakras get blocked? Well, you can think of a block as when the manifesting current that originates in consciousness is working counter to the liberating current that is coming up organically from the body. So let's take an example. Let's say you have a job and there's somebody you work with that really, maybe it's your boss that you don't like and they make you angry. So every day you come in, organically, you kind of feel this anger, this annoyance, but you say, "Oh, if I let that out, "I'm going to lose my job." So you have to be nice, so every day this comes up and every day something comes down and then they meet and they block, so you can think of it as two opposing forces. What we want to do is harmonize these two currents, let them complete their journey all the way up. Now, does that mean you get angry at your boss? Not necessarily, but if you acknowledge that anger and you can let it out in a different way and you can acknowledge why you want to be nice to your boss, then you have a harmony between the two currents. So you can think of the blocks also as knots, K-N-O-T, where in Sanskrit, it's called granthis, knots of resistance that the energy can't quite get through. But I like to think of those knots as N-O-T, it's where you are not, where you cannot, where you will not, where you do not, where your have not, and what we want to turn all that no and negative energy into something positive. We want to break through the knots and make it a yes for you in your life. Well, chakras as energetic centers, will respond to what happens in your life and when you feel a threat, your energy may increase in order to deal with the threat, or it may scare you so much you say, "I'm out of here," and you want to avoid the threat. Well, that creates an excessive coping strategy or a deficient coping strategy. You're either compensating or you're avoiding. So you may have a deficient heart chakra that just doesn't want to deal with relationship. Or you may have an excessive heart chakra that needs to be the center of attention all the time. Or you may have an excessive third chakra that has to be powerful and controlling, or you may have a deficient third chakra that's weak and passive. So when we look at the blocks, we're looking at what kind, and in this diagnosis, comes the treatment. An excessive chakra needs to get rid of energy or charge. A deficient chakra needs to take it in and charge up, it needs to expand and really receive and hold and store that energy. And so when we talk about chakra balancing, we're balancing the excess and deficiency in each chakra, we're also balancing between the chakras. You may have one that's deficient and another that's excessive, and you want those to be balanced with each other or balance your upper chakras with your lower chakras. So what does it mean to heal a chakra? Well, we're working with balance between excess and deficiency, but we're also working body, mind and energy and spirit altogether. So you may have created body armor as a result of a particular chakra. We want to clear that, we want to stretch those muscles, we want to discharge some of that. You may have programs in your psyche that influence your behavior and what you think. We want to clear the unproductive patterns of the past and replace them with new, more productive patterns. We want to mend some of the wounds of childhood that get lodged in the physical, emotional, and mental programming. So we're going to be clearing past traumas, that get lodged in the psyche, we're going to be balancing energy flow in the body, we're going to be looking at behavioral patterns and shifts that we can make to change our habits, we're going to align the chakras as a whole system, and we're going to learn how to work with energy and move energy through the body into different parts. And since chakras work with energy and energy is everywhere, we're also looking at it, not just inside ourselves, but outside ourselves, and healing the spirit. The spirit is something universal that we all share and you heal your own spirit as you heal some of the issues that occur in the world as a result of our wounded chakras. So your exercise for today is to look over the chakra charts in the workbook, some of the associations. Assimilate your understanding of the chakra system with other things you may have studied. Maybe you've studied the Kabbalah, or maybe you studied Chinese medicine, see how they go together. Look at your self-assessment and see which chakras need particular work, those are the ones you're going to want to be sure and not miss those lessons in the schedule. So download week one of the chakra companion workbook and get excited about what's to come, look at what you can do. Share any aha moments with the Tribe and ground yourself, fasten your seatbelt, we're getting ready for takeoff.

Preparation 4: Meditation for Chakra Activation & Intention Setting
--------------------
<v ->Before the start of any journey,</v> it's important to know why you decided to take this Quest. It will be helpful for you to revisit the information later when the journey gets rocky, if it does. So think about who do you want to be by the end of this journey? It starts from your intention. Think of it in the positive and think of it as already here. "I am centered and focused. "I am happy with my life. "I am living in abundance. "I am grounded. "I am peaceful. "I am awake." Set that intention, put a stake in the ground. We're going to learn more about clarifying intention in the manifestation current, but for now, start with the end in mind, that's one of the secrets to success. So next I'm going to lead you on an opening meditation in which you get to visit all your chakras. So set yourself up for a meditation position with your spine erect and prepare to go on the ride. Chakra opening meditation. Close your eyes and settle into your inner world. Open to this moment. Open to this place you are sitting. In your body, here on planet earth. Allow yourself to witness your breath coming in and out easily and effortlessly. Your presence in this moment. Alive, aware. Begin by extending your roots down into the earth below and lifting your crown up to the heavens above. Between the crown and the base of your spine is your sacred core. A column of energy between heaven and earth in which all the chakras are found. Spinning like jewels aligned along the radiant core of your deepest soul. See the red jewel at the base of the spine that connects with the element earth, with your body, with the material world in all its beauty and splendor, the mountains and hillsides, the forests and grasses, the food the earth provides, and the shelter. Allow that abundant universe to come into your own first chakra, filling you with gratitude and solidity, stability, settled and grounded on the earth plane. And above the earth plane flows the water of the second chakra. Svadhisthana one's place. In the second chakra energy wants to flow like water through your whole body. And as you make little micro-movements wherever you are sitting, feel how that's moving cerebral spinal fluid up and down, bringing sensation, awareness, pleasure, movement and flow. And above the water, rises the fire of the third chakra. That fire that burns in our solar plexus and gives us energy and vitality, our power, our strength, our purpose to stand firm in our ground, in touch with our emotions and acting in our power, a spiritual warrior. And then rising up on the lanes into the heart. Letting that warm air open the heart to expand into the field of love that is like the atmosphere itself surrounding us, embracing us with every breath filling us. The heart is the center of love. And it's charged with the breath, with gratitude, forgiveness, acceptance, compassion, and peace. And as that vibration of peace rises up to the throat chakra we come to the element sound. Vibration, resonance, harmony, words, communication. Communication comes in and we hear it in our listening and it enters and soothes our being. And we let it out as we speak our truth. A constant exchange of hearing and speaking. Your note joining the symphony of creation. And then rising up to the sixth chakra, the element light and imagining your whole body being flooded with light. Every cell glowing with light. Light that enables you to see inside your inner temple, light that can be focused on your vision. Color and form that illustrates your dreams, the light body that you are. And then finally the crown chakra, center of consciousness itself. What is it that is hearing this music? What is it that is making meaning out of these words? Who is it that is living inside your body and what is this miracle of consciousness that you possess? This miracle of intelligence that pervades the whole universe. And then our minds can connect with that divine intelligence through our crown chakra, through our eyes, through our throat, through our heart, our belly, through our skin and our bones. We are the emanation of that divine intelligence, a prison that takes that energy into all its different forms. Seven vital elements. The rainbow bridge between earth and heaven as one indivisible whole. So I hope you enjoyed the meditation. So your exercise for today is to begin with the end in mind. Write your intention down for starting this Quest. Who do you want to be at the end? What do you want to achieve? And then imagine receiving it, feel that in the cells of your body, visualize it. What would it be like? What would be different in your life? What's the shift or the miracle that you want to create? And then share that with the Tribe. So, okay roll up your sleeves. Plant your feet in the ground, lift your head in the clouds Fasten your seatbelt, put your luggage on overhead. We are going for a ride. We're going to have fun along the way. We're going to have companions to travel with. You're going to learn things that are going to blow your mind open. You're going to heal things in yourself and you're going to be a different person when you come out. So I can't wait to get started. We're going to start by getting down.

Week 1: Heal Your Root & Sacral Chakra

==================================

LESSON 1 – Root Chakra: Healing the Psyche by Embracing Fear & Learning to Trust
--------------------
<v ->So we begin at the beginning.</v> With the sacred ground, the ground you walk upon, the foundation. The name of this chakra muladhara means root support or foundation support. If you're going to build a bridge all the way to heaven its foundation needs to be really firm. Anchored in the earth, that is the element of this chakra. So it's here that we go down into our roots. The roots of where we came from, the roots of our past, the roots of our beginnings. When we're born the first challenge we have to face is to survive on our own. If you don't do that the game is over. So first challenge to survive and we are hardwired with instincts to survive. Now when you're born as a little helpless bundle of protoplasm you can't do much at all to ensure your own survival. That's dependent upon caretakers who feed you, who keep you warm, who change your diapers, who keep you safe. And if that stage went well you have a sense of trust that the world will provide what you need, that you're safe and that you can relax and go on the journey. When you're born you get delivered into your body, that's the vehicle in which you take the journey. And you only get one per lifetime. So it's really good to keep that vehicle in good repair. I always say that if you don't get one, you're a nobody, if you want to be somebody you got to have some body. So one of our tasks is not just to survive but to become embodied. To let the spirit come fully into the flesh, to be here, to be present, to look around and say, where am I? What is this lifetime going to bring? That's our first imprint of life. So the purpose of this root chakra is to get grounded, to find stability, solidity. To learn containment so you can contain energy and allow it to build up. And the ability to have things, to have security, to have trust to have prosperity. In order to have something you have to have a place to put it. Your body is the vehicle is where the whole journey takes place. It's the only thing you know you're going to have as long as you live. So the chakras have developmental stages in which the primary program of that chakra gets written into your mind-body interface or your nervous system. And the developmental stage of this chakra is largely the first year of life. What are you doing in that year? You're building your body, the body weight triples during the first year of life. You're learning how it works, how do these fingers work? How do these toes work? How do I hold my head up? How do I keep food down and digest it? How do I deal with gravity and that furniture has edges and that I can't go anywhere on my own. These are the kind of things that consciousness, the indwelling consciousness of the body is trying to figure out. It's like getting a brand-new car and going okay where's the brakes, where's the pedals, where's the buttons? That's what we're trying to figure out in our body. And all of this time we're getting messages, are we safe? So one of the first things that we establish in life is trust versus mistrust. Am I safe or am I not safe? Can I trust to take in from my environment in which I can nourish and grow or do I have to be careful? Do I have to check everything out? Now when a child is this young, they don't have any language. They don't have any preconceived notions, they just have raw experience. And if you can't trust then what happens is everything contracts into the core. And in that makes a very constricted core that doesn't have a lot of room for energy. What that does is it pushes all the energy up into the head away from the ground and out of first chakra. So you might be very smart, you might always want to figure things out, but your nervous system doesn't feel safe to drop down, to rest, to expand and to open up and really fully have. So we know that in this developmental stage we need to be safe, but what causes blockages? Well if this stage doesn't go well, if you don't feel safe, if your caretakers are busy taking care of other children and you don't get fed when you're hungry. If there's violence in your surroundings. If it's noisy, if it's moving around a lot, your nervous system doesn't get to let down. Well which direction is the ground? It's down there. We say relax let down, we say uptight. So if we want to relax we have to move down toward the earth. If you didn't bond well with your mother, if there were feeding difficulties like a colicky baby has trouble digesting and assimilating that nourishment, then that can compromise the first chakra. Another aspect is that if the child doesn't really feel like they belong here or they don't feel quite wanted. Maybe your mother wasn't sure she wanted to have a baby and she decided to and get behind it but something in her nervous system was uncomfortable with it. You would pick that up in the womb, you would have picked that up as you were born. And it might have given you a feeling of being unwanted. And you might really have been wanted but you got that feeling. Then we have to justify our existence, we have to prove that we're worthy. And we don't get to be in our natural organic state of just being, and know that it's safe and easy to survive. So when this stage doesn't go well, one of the natural results is fear. Fear is what you feel when your survival is threatened, it's a natural feeling that actually should come up if somebody jumps out of a dark alley and points a gun at you, it's natural to feel fear. Your body floods with energy in order to run away or fight off your attacker. But as a child if you get that sense of fear because things don't quite feel right or they don't feel safe, that becomes a contraction in your body at the core level. And remember you're building your body at this stage. So you build that into the structure of your body until it becomes natural. Then you find that there's tension that you can't relax even when you want to. That your body is constricted and you maybe grow very tall but very thin. Or you might compensate by putting on extra weight in order to feel safe. So the body is really a set of habits, and fear becomes a habit. Fear becomes something we feel in our nervous system and sometimes it can even feel the same to the body as excitement, but our mind frames it as fear. So sometimes I say to people just because you feel fear doesn't mean there's anything to be afraid of. But when people have a pervasive sense of fear in their body, they look outside to say, what's wrong? Maybe that person isn't safe, maybe I need to do that, maybe I need to lock that door, maybe I need to double-check that. And that hyper-vigilance, it takes a lot of energy. It's like putting roadblocks up to what you can fully have. Now of course we don't want to just be so trusting we let anything in, we need adult reasonable discernment. But the habit of fear blocks you from receiving energy that you need to nourish yourself on. So chakra health and dynamics. So we've talked about how a chakra can be excessive or deficient, too much energy or too little. So if you dealt with not feeling safe or wanted and you had survival concerns at this young age. And that's a wound into your first chakra, but you dealt with it in some way. Now you may have increased your energy to deal with it, creating an excessive chakra. If you did that that looks like being overly attached to the physical plane making a larger body than you might need. Over amping the survival instincts, it could be the instinct to eat in order to live. And then that says eat too much, and that's what your instincts are telling you and you fight with that your whole life. Or you could have gone to the deficient end of things, and the deficient end wants to withdraw, wants to move out of the body. It says I don't want a big body, I don't want a weigh much, I don't want to have a lot of physical sense. I want to be up in my mind, I want to be up in the fantasy world. And often people who do that are very intelligent and very creative but they aren't very embodied. And they have a hard time getting over that sense of fear and distrust. So those are ways the chakra can become unbalanced. But when you balance the chakra, then you have a sense of trust in the world and trust in yourself. Because we can't really control the world outside of us, we have to know that we can handle what life gives us. And that survival becomes as it should be, the base to the rest of your life but not a constant preoccupying issue. So we know that every chakra has its challenge. Something we have to solve in order to harvest the gifts. And the challenge here as we've mentioned is fear. Now fear is heightened charge, heightened energy. It's what the body naturally does, it floods with energy so that you can take care of yourself. I teach people to look at their fear as a wonderful delivery system for your energy. To befriend that charge, do not say there's something wrong with me that I'm afraid but oh here's my life force pouring into my first chakra and coming up through my body. That transforms the fear into an ally. To get your feet down, and we're going to learn exercises tomorrow for really grounding the body and doing something with that energy that allows us to feel safer and more secure. As we befriend our own charge as a result of fear and we transform it and say, yeah this is life force. We also want to change our heightened fear, fear that something bad is going to happen to reasonable faith. We want to know that instead of focusing on something bad happening, we want to picture and imagine something good happening. And when you overcome this challenge you feel more secure, more grounded, more stable, more confident and more freedom to be who you really are. Well first of all you have to understand the roots in your psyche that are causing your behavior. Quit making yourself wrong for it and approach yourself with compassion. Maybe you can do a little research into your birth or your early childhood from your family. Maybe you can put two and two together and see what that early first year might have been like. And as you do that notice what comes up for you. Notice if energy or charge comes up and if so that means there's some healing to do. You want to go back to the ground, you want to tell yourself I'm welcome here, you want to welcome yourself into your own body. You can recreate your womb with a blanket in your bedroom. You could create the ground as sacred, you can tell yourself I truly belong in this world. I am here I will survive and it's safe for me to be here and trust my body and its wisdom. Your exercise for today. So now that we've learned a little bit about this there are questions in your workbook that can help you take your inquiry deeper. Like what do you know about your birth experience, did you feel safe as a child? Were you born in a hospital? Was there problems, how were you fed? Were you bottle fed or breastfed? These are some of the things that you can look at and there's questions in your workbook. You're also looking at whether you felt safe in your body. Whether your nervous system can relax. And you can use some of the affirmations listed in your workbook to start to reprogram your mind and body and your nervous system. Such as it's safe for me to be here, I love my body and trust its wisdom. I know I can survive anything. Second you can engage in some of these techniques for healing. Use the affirmations or recreate your womb experience, tell yourself you're safe. And for those doing the medium or full engagement, develop a new chakra skill set. We talked about eating as being a survival instinct, well practice eating mindfully. Slow down, savor every bite. Choose foods that are nourishing to you so that you are nourishing your body and keeping it healthy for this chakra healing quest. And remember you're invited to share any aha insights, questions, practices things that worked. Share it with the tribe so you can inspire or encourage or support someone else. So sometimes this information brings things up for people and if it does just become the observer of your own process. Tomorrow we'll take this into the body and we'll ground it. So bring your yoga mat and have a place to practice, we'll follow along a set of movements. And we'll take our practice deeper into the cells and tissues of the body, the home of the first chakra.

====================

LESSON 2 – Root Chakra: Healing the Body by Opening Your Leg Channels
--------------------
<v ->So we talked yesterday about how the root chakra</v> really brings us into the body and one of its tasks is embodiment. Through embodiment, we connect to the earth, the sacred ground from which everything comes. So there's a kind of holding that the body does to the psyche. So think about roots. If you have a house plant. That house plant is held together by a pot that holds the dirt around the roots, and that gives it stability. So there's a certain holding that gives us stability in order to grow. Now in order to grow tall and reach the heavens, we need deep roots. You don't go out to your garden and say, I'm going to help the flowers get high faster by pulling them up by the roots. We need to put them down deep. The dirt needs to be held around the roots. Not too tight, or there's no room for the water and the nourishment, and not too lose or the plant falls over. So we want just the right amount of holding of our muscles to the bones, to hold the energies so it can build up and go to other chakras. Now when we look at embodied blockages, we talked a little yesterday about how we might make too big a body or too little a body for our excessive and deficient. But where you can especially see this is in the legs, that the excessive first chakra will make heavier legs, will really be very muscle bound and tight, and want to hang on to the earth, while the deficient chakra has very skinny legs. And those skinny legs are hard to ground through. These are the roots that connect down into the earth. They're the place where the plant receives nourishment, and where it pushes down into stability. In fact, I say that what comes up is the feminine aspect of our roots. The aspect of receiving and nourishing, and what goes down penetrating Mother Earth, that's the masculine aspect, and that gives us our stability. So we want to be able to nourish, and we want to be able to be stable. Our legs are the roots. They're like two prongs of a plug that plug into the earth, and from that we get energy. So yesterday we talked about fear being one of the challenges of this chakra, and these exercises, these bio-energetic movements in the yoga, they're ways to condition the body to run energy through the places that might have become constricted. And as you do, you'll feel safer and more secure. So let's go into some bio-energetic movements for charging and discharging the legs. First one is a standing bio-energetic grounding. So stand upright. Your feet hip width apart. Or even shoulder width apart. I find most people bring their feet too close together. Turn your heels out a little wider than your toes, and soften your knees so your bending your knee out over your second toe. Ideally you would see you big toenail right on the inside of your kneecap, that is, if there's no clothing or anything in the way. And now press down and out with your feet as if you're trying to push apart two floorboards, or you're trying to stretch a sticky mat that you're standing on. And notice how your ground really hooks on. How is really grabs hold. How your base becomes more stable. If someone were going to push you around from this place, they'd have a harder time doing it. So that's the grounding stance. Now to charge it up, inhale and bend your knees a little bit more, keeping your shoulders over your hips, and as you exhale, push down through the core of each leg. Push down and out with your feet, and very slowly begin to straighten your knees, but don't straighten them all the way. Maybe 90% of the way. Then inhale and bend again. Inhale deeply, press those knees down, and exhale. Press down and out through your legs as if you're pushing the floor away, and the result of that is your legs begin to straighten, but it's a slow movement. Come to about 90% of the straight. Don't lock your knees, then inhale again, and go back and forth, inhaling and bending, exhaling, pushing through the core of each leg. Now if you're doing this correctly, you're going to start to feel a little bit of trembling in your legs, and that's a sign of charge or energy coming up your legs. That's what you want. That's delivering some energy through the roots of your legs up into your first chakra. Now if that brings up too much charge for you, you might want to do a little discharging. That also happens through the legs and feet. So simply run in place and stamp your feet into the ground. And let that release. Do it until you feel tired, and then stand still and feel. You're going to feel calmer in your legs, maybe a little more expansive. That's what it feels like to discharge. So now that you've gotten a little energy coming in and going out, and you felt what that's like, we're going to take this into a yoga flow. We'll do a little more charging and discharging, but we're mostly going to flow into our root chakra. So get ready, be in clothes you can stretch in, get on your mat, and follow along with us. Welcome to your first chakra yoga flow. Before you step on your mat, take a deep breath , and let go of all your worries and frustrations. Let them drain down into the floor. Step on to your mat with intention, knowing you're stepping into a sacred place. This is the floor of your temple. Place your feet carefully hip width apart, making the outside of your feet parallel to each other. Ground down into your heels, lift up into your crown, and extend yourself from earth to heaven. Inhale, your hands up over head, and reach higher to the heaven while bending your knees, taking your tailbone behind you, and slowing bringing your arms forward, reaching from your tailbone out to your fingertips. Pull your shoulders back, lift the chest , and press down and out with your feet. Inhale and come back up. Inhaling, your hands up over head, straightening your legs, reaching once more , and on the exhale, take your arms down around your side, place them on your hips, and bend forward all the way, keeping your knees bent and wrapping your arms around your thighs, bringing your belly as close to you thighs as possible. Give your legs a hug. On the inhale, press your knees back until you find your edge, then release your hands. Take them into the floor. Straighten your legs and inhale halfway up, extending from the tailbone to the crown. Deep breath in and then lower back down. Hands on either side of your feet, once again, honoring your legs that carry you on the journey. And the next breath in, take your right foot back into a high lunge, straightening the right leg, hugging the muscles to the bone and pressing your left foot into the mat and drawing it toward your right foot. Feel the stability that comes from anchoring into the ground. Take a breath here and slowly lower your right knee down to the floor, flatten your right foot, and gently bend your left leg, sliding your hands back, using blocks if necessary. As you straighten your left leg and flex the left foot, make some circles with your left ankle, clockwise and counter-clockwise, to exercise the foot and the ankle. And then with toes pointing toward the ceiling and the foot flexed, gently press your left heel into the mat, drawing the left leg up into the hip socket as you press your tailbone out behind you. Inhale and lengthen through the crown, and on the exhale keep that length as you slowly bow over your left leg. Go to wherever you find your edge. If you need to use blocks, that's fine. If you only touch your knee, that's fine. Press your tailbone out behind you, and then on the next breath in, lift your head, bend your left knee back out over the left foot, tuck your toes behind you, hands on either side of your front foot, and take your left foot back next to your right for a Downward Dog. On the next breath in, lower your hips, move your shoulders over your hands, bend your knees, take your knees, chest, and chin down to the mat. Wiggle the tailbone a little bit just so you feel it, and then lower your hips and just with muscles of your back, do just a Baby Cobra, lifting your crown, hugging your legs towards each other, and on the exhalation, lower back down. Tuck your toes in behind you, press your hands into the floor, press your hips back up once again for a Downward Dog. Stretching into your Dog, wiggling each knee, pressing into the four corners of your mat, anchoring into the ground. On the next breath in, take your right foot up between your hands, bending your right knee, and slowly lower down onto your left knee, flattening the left foot. Place your hands on your block, or slide them along the floor as you slowly straighten your right leg. Flex your right foot. Make some circles with your ankle, clockwise and counterclockwise, pointing and flexing the toes. And then with your toes pointed straight up and your foot flexed, press gently into your right heel, hugging the right leg into the hip socket, and lengthen through your tailbone and your crown. Inhale , and as you exhale, keep that length as you bring the center of your torso down over your right leg to wherever you find your edge. Just pause at that edge and allow your breath to so gently move you. Maybe a quarter of an inch with each exhale, without strain, pulling the roots down out of the base of the spine. And then on the next breath, inhale. Your head up and your right knee forward. Press the left toes underneath, and bring your left foot forward next to your right. And, once again, in a Forward Fold, let gravity pull your spine down. Let your head be heavy, your neck loose, let your legs support you, and feel this hinge at your hips. Softly bend your knees as you rise up, lifting your arms up into a Chair Pose in front of you, pulling the shoulders back, lifting the chest, pressing down into both feet, down into the ground, and then press through the core of each leg as you slowly come to a stand. Lift your hands up overhead, bring your palms together, and slide them down the core of your body to your heart. Anchor down into your feet and feel your ground. So now we want to become anchored like a tree. This is good for developing the strength in your legs and your balance. So bring your weight on to your right leg, maybe just gently touching your left toes to give you balance, and anchor down through that right leg, all the way from the crown of your head to the heel of your foot. And staying in balance, slowly lift your left foot and place it either against your right ankle for a beginner pose, or you can move it higher up and place the foot against your thigh, and take the left knee out to the side, and if you're in good balance, you can take your hands up, and then bring them back down to the heart, and slowly lower your left foot. Shake your legs out. And now place your weight on your left foot. Gently lift your right foot so your toes are touching, as you establish your balance, grounding down through the root of your left leg. And when you feel that balance in your core, take your right foot against your right ankle, or higher up depending on your flexibility, and bring your hands together over your heart. Feel the trunk of your tree anchored down into the roots of your left leg as you lift your crown, tuck your tailbone. And if you're in good balance, you can lift your hands up overhead, expanding your branches. Take a breath in and bring your hands back over your heart, and bring your right foot down again. Shake your legs out and feel your ground. Now that both feet are on the ground, stand and feel your legs as roots supporting your body. Bring your hands together over your heart, press right hand into left hand, and give thanks for your first chakra. So in each chakra we're going to learn some everyday movements, simple things you can do in a matter of seconds to begin to develop new habits in your body, to open your chakras. So in the first chakra, one of them is to create a wide base, and we do that by taking the tailbone which we know curls under in the spine, and energetically pressing it toward the back of your seat. So any time you sit down, to a meal, to work at your computer, to sit in the driver's seat and drive a car, to have a conversation with someone, just simply take your tailbone back and notice how that begins to set the tone to have an upright spine. And one more thing you can do that's really fun is to just bounce up and down on your tailbone. You can do it on the floor, and move side to side. You can do it on a chair. And what that does it stimulates the base of the spine and starts the cerebral spinal fluid moving up and down. It's fun and it helps you remember your first chakra. Remember, any time you lose your first chakra, just sit down. That's where it is, you're sitting on it. So for the next 24 hours, practice either these everyday movements or the bio-energetic movements, and just whenever you think of it, just tuck your tailbone back, or bounce on your seat, or stand and firmly push down into your legs, and begin to condition your nervous system to really bring energy into that root chakra. And for those on the medium and full engagement, check your workbook, look into the challenge, see what you're doing around that challenge, and don't forget to share it with the Tribe to inspire and encourage others along the way. Tomorrow we'll take it into the spirit and soul realm, and we'll learn how to heal our souls in relation to the bigger picture and anchor ourselves into the earth.

====================

LESSON 3 – Root Chakra: Healing the Spirit by Connecting With the Earth
--------------------
<v ->Welcome to the third part of The Root Chakra,</v> Healing the Spirit. Here we look at how our own root chakra issues interface with the world around us, and what we can do to better condition our root chakra and be better stewards of the Earth. So the spirit is to the body as the body is to the home. We come and go from our homes, but we want a stable place to come to at night. Well the spirit comes and goes too and we want to spend more time living in our home, we want to spend more time really engaging with the Earth. Our nervous systems were built for nature, they haven't changed much in 150 or 200,000 years. Yet we're sitting in front of computer screens, we're under electric lights, we're with noise, we're in trains and buses and cars and planes and changing time zones and we're disconnected from the organic nature of our body. We know that horrendous birth processes that have taken place maybe more a generation ago traumatized people's nervous systems. And a generation that has a traumatized nervous system will be disconnected from the Earth. And it's interesting that on a cultural level we have environmental crisis, we have financial crisis and we have health crisis. These are all first chakra issues that are happening on a larger scale as a result of the trauma in our own first chakras. And of course when we feel fear that keeps people in scarcity, that keeps them in saying to somebody, oh you're my enemy or I have to keep as much as I can because you're going to take it. And then we have a world that makes all of us less secure and less safe. It creates a culture of greed and domination and as we come down we feel, oh we have enough, nature always supplies an abundance. You know an apple tree makes many, many apples and it doesn't say, are all of these going to be eaten or do you have an ID for that, or are you worthy? It just creates abundance and it puts it out there. If we're not living in abundance there's something wrong with our relationship to the Earth. And a culture that doesn't live in abundance is not one that's connected with the natural organic processes of the Earth. So because our nervous systems are wired for the natural world, being out in nature kind of resets your dials in the same way that a deep meditation does. You know when we meditate we clear the screen, we clear our thoughts, we come out and you know it's like we've had an internal massage. Well being out in nature resets your dials. You'll find that the body relaxes in a different way, the eyes can focus at a distance, we feel beauty, we have the sun, we take fresh air in, we're moving our bodies, it resets everything and it's just as powerful as meditation. So wherever you live see if you can at least get out to put your feet on the ground, to look at trees, to look at something natural or better yet take a vacation out to the wilderness, go backpacking, get away from civilization and reconnect with nature once again. Rainbow Warriors have to be grounded to make change and one of the changes we need to make is how we treat the Earth. But we have to be grounded in ourselves to be good warriors. So the more you do the bioenergetic exercises we've been doing, the yoga, work on your issues that might create fear and scarcity in your own life, the more you become a grounded, Earth-centered Rainbow Warrior. I believe that spirit wants us to make a bridge between Earth and heaven. But to make that bridge we have to set up a foundation for it, and that foundation is seeing the Earth as sacred. Our sacred ground is our foundation. Whatever you put into the foundation of whatever you're building, make it strong, make it solid, make it sacred. So I like this quote from Gary Snyder that says, nature is not a place to visit. It is our home. Come home to the Earth. How do we do this? Establish a refuge. Once a week if you can, more often in possible, go out, find something sacred, maybe it's a place in your backyard or a nearby park, maybe you want to do some gardening and dig into the Earth. And if that's not possible for you, you know get some dirt and plant a houseplant. Put it in the window and nourish it as it grows. Connect with the Earth in some way. You can build an altar out of natural ingredients. Another way is to ask for support. If muladara means root support or foundation support then you want to give support to others, you want to get support from others. Look at what is the support system you have in your life. How are people supporting you in your career choices? In maintaining your relationship? In maintaining your health? Ask the tribe for support. Tell them what kind of support you need and what you can offer. So the exercises for today. In your workbook reflect on any of these questions and write down a place that is a refuge for you. A place where you can drop in to your body, drop in to the Earth, drop in to a sense of sacred. Share that refuge with the Tribe. Share your aha moments. Someone could discover something new from your post. That's it for our first chakra. Tomorrow we dive into the waters at the second chakra, that juicy place that brings pleasure into life, so you don't want to miss that. See you tomorrow in the second chakra.

LESSON 4 – Sacral Chakra: Healing the Psyche by Acknowledging Your Right to Feel
--------------------
<v ->Welcome back to your quest.</v> Today we take the next step into the next chakra, the sacral chakra. Here, we move from earth to water. From a point to a line. From self to other. From one to two. Unity to duality. It's a big step with big changes. Can't wait to get started. So it's important to understand the purpose of each chakra and what I call the scheme of things, which is to be able to bridge the full spectrum from Earth to heaven. And in that scheme, we talked about first chakra getting us grounded and stable in making a foundation. But once that's established, if we're going to get all the way up to heaven, all the way up to the upper chakras, we got to get moving. So the purpose of the second chakra is to get things moving, to have a flow. Its element, water, talks about things flowing. Water follows the path of least resistance. It flows, it takes the shape of the Earth. So we want to flow, we want to be full and juicy. When things are dry, they don't have enough water and they're no fun. So if you want life to be juicy, really open up this chakra and bring the water element in. So the main point in our psyche here at this chakra is to feel. Feeling is an aspect of consciousness. It's consciousness hitting the body. And feeling is an important guide along the way. Feeling gives us the feedback from our environment. Are we on the right track? Are we on the wrong track? Does something feel good? Does it not feel good? When we feel pain, it's a message to make some kind of change, to do something different. So we wouldn't really want anybody just to take away the ability to feel pain 'cause then we wouldn't get that message. So feeling is an important part of navigating the journey. So now that we have gotten grounded in the earth in our first chakra, we've learned how to operate a body, I take that mostly through the first year of life. There's an overlap with the second chakra of about six months. What happens at six months old? Well the eyes change their ability to focus from just being right in front of the face, like looking at your mother's face when she's holding you in her arms, to being able to focus across the room. And that happens about the same time that the child has the muscular development to be able to sit up on his or her own. So we sit up, we see across the room, and what do you think that creates in the psyche? Curiosity! The desire to see what's over there, and that makes you want to move, makes you want to locomote. So right after that happens, the next thing in development is creeping and crawling and then pulling yourself up and walking, and then running. And once you can move on your own, your off exploring the world around you. And what do you explore it through? Your senses. The senses are the gateways that bring the outside to the in. It's how we take in, we see it, we hear it, we smell it, we touch it. Well that's what little infants want to do at this stage, they want to ring the bell, and they want to pet the kitty, and they want to look at something. They're learning about the world. Now as we move into the world, is everything safe or not safe? Is everything feel good or not? It's a mixed bag. So what we're learning as we move into the world, we touch the hot stove, we go, " That hurts. "I don't want to do that again," and we pull back. Or we enjoy the taste of ice cream, and we say, "Oh, that was wonderful. "Give me another bite." We're moving toward what is pleasurable and away from what is painful. So as we're learning to move our bodies, we're experiencing the positive and negative, the duality of existence. And it may be that today, your mommy's in a good mood, and tomorrow, she's in a bad mood. Or she may say good girl or bad girl, and you're starting to learn these dualities. Now all this is tied up in the language that you speak at that time, and at this age, there aren't words yet. It's an emotional language. If you're feel a pain in your backside, you can't say, "Mommy, the diaper pin is sticking me," you just go wah! And that's an emotional communication that something is wrong. Now if your caretakers respond to that emotional communication, they attend to your needs, they take you from pain into pleasure, then your nervous system goes back to its basic hum, your limbic system says everything's okay, and you feel good and that's the way it should be. So the name of this chakra's Svadhisthana. Means one's own place. So one of the challenges in this stage is to be connected with your own place inside, to be in touch with yourself. And that is a feeling state, that we feel comfortable in our own skin. We feel comfortable in our world. And when we feel comfortable, the energy flows through unencumbered. So when we're feeling an emotion and our parents or caretakers look at us and say, "Oh, she's feeling sad," or, "Oh, she's feeling happy," or, "Oh, she's feeling angry," that's how we start to identify what we're feeling. That's how we gain an emotional literacy that later on, we can identify what we're feeling and express it appropriately. We also want to establish an emotional connection with our caretakers. That's something that we feel. We feel good in our mommy's or daddy's arms. We feel good in our home, that everything is humming along as it should be. It's more than just feeling safe, it's actually feeling pleasure, the pleasure of being alive. The pleasure of the senses. So what causes blockages in this chakra? Well one is a denial of the child's feeling states. Some children are told, "You have no right "to feel that way," or, "Stop your bellyachin'," or "You're so sensitive," or, "You cry all the time." And then our feeling state is denied, and we're knocked out of our own place. Some things that cause blockages is as we're moving into our environment, is the bulk of what we experienced pleasurable or painful? If it's not a safe environment, if there's a lot of anger, or violence, then we're going to restrict our movement and we're going to have trouble moving out and moving forward in our lives. We're also speaking the emotional language of the family. If your family was very expressive and volatile, and emotions were flying around the room, that's what you learn to speak. If your family was very reserved and nonemotional, then you might not have learned to speak that emotional language very well. So that has to do with some of the programming of your second chakra. So if this stage doesn't go well, or some of these things that cause blockages happen, what happens to us as a consequence? Well we get out of touch with our own place. We get out of touch with each other. In a culture that denies the feelings, that denies pleasure, that denies sexuality, we're a culture that is getting rapidly out of touch. And we get out of touch with ourselves, we don't even know what we feel anymore. And our emotions become unbalanced, and the charge of our emotions become unbalanced, and the chakra becomes unbalanced. We may overindulge as a result of not having a pleasurable life. Well I'm going to eat that cookie, or I'm going to have that drink. We may deny ourselves pleasure, and then we're just not feelin' very good most of the time. So what does the chakra look like in and out of balance? Well we have our excessive indeficiency. So excessive would mean too much water, too much emotion, too much feeling, we're pulled off our center by being carried on waves of tumultuous emotion. Some people only feel alive when they're really feeling intense emotion. Well that's an excessive second chakra. It could also be overly indulgent. On the other hand, if we went to an avoidant response and developed a deficient second chakra, we might be very flat emotionally. We might not know what we feel or feel anything. Life is kind of dry, and dull, and boring. It's just not fun and juicy anymore. And we feel out of touch with ourselves. Now people always ask me, can I have a little bit of excess and deficient in the same chakra? And the answer is yes. And especially in this chakra, which is both emotions and also sexuality. Some people are highly sexual and not very emotional, some people are highly emotional and not very sexual. So these are like petals of the chakras. Some of them are trying to compensate, some of them are trying to avoid, and they're always that we were just trying to come into balance. So what does a balanced second chakra look like? Somebody who is fluid, who is sensuous, who is feeling their feelings appropriately, not too much, not too little, someone who's really in touch with themselves, in touch with other people, and really feels the world within them and around them. So another thing that happens when the second chakra is compromised is we develop guilt. We feel guilty about what we feel. Oh, I shouldn't feel that way about this person, or I shouldn't want this, or I shouldn't need that, or I shouldn't have this sexual fantasy. And guilt stops the flow of energy. Now if you've done something wrong that hurts somebody, it's probably appropriate to feel a little guilty about that, and to apologize and make amends. But I know with myself, the demon of guilt comes up if I do my practice in the morning and I take a nice long meditation and yoga practice, I feel guilty that I didn't get to my desk sooner. And if I skip my practice and I go straight to work, I feel guilty that I didn't do my practice. So one day, I just said to myself, what's with this? This is just the demon of guilt acting on me instead of me really choosing, what do I want? And coming from a place of choice in my own body. So the challenge of guilt can hinder the natural flow of emotions and desires that is part of this second chakra. So if we remain wrong for what we felt or we were punished, we might get caught into very binary either-or-thinking. It reflects the duality of this chakra. We might think things are black and white, good or bad, right or wrong, but the fact is, nature is much more nuance than that. It comes from fear of punishment, that we want to get it right, we want to have it absolute, but that doesn't allow us to feel our way. That comes from the head. So next time you get caught in either-or-thinking, try to just feel the nuances of the situation. Go down into your second chakra, and go, what feels right to me? And try to feel the nuances in between those polarities. So when you master or overcome this pervasive sense of guilt, you can enjoy whatever you're having more fully, whether it's a cup of tea, or a meal, or a sexuality, or a sunset, you can enjoy it with your senses more fully. And this is not to say that we can do anything we want without guilt, it's not about that overindulgence, that's an excessive second chakra. We want to have an appropriate flow of feeling in the body and with that, you harvest the gift of extreme pleasure and delight in the world. It was John Bradshaw who said, "We cannot heal "what we cannot feel." When we block the flow of feeling, what we do is we rigidify the body, we're holding. Our roots won't grow unless they're watered. So we want the roots, the first chakra to go down, but we have to water them from movement of the second chakra. When we can't feel, we restrict that movement, we restrict that fluidity, and then the nourishment of the energy doesn't flow through the body, it doesn't get to the other chakras. To get from solid to liquid, how do you get there? You melt. So as we melt our rigidity, as we melt our fixed patterns, we come into more of a flow, we have a river of energy inside us that can flow through us and nurture any part of the body in any of the chakras. So the exercise for today is to acknowledge your right to feel. To notice what you're feeling. To not have to necessarily spend it in the expression of that emotion, but not to have to stuff it and block it either. To take feeling as a kind of information coming from the body to take you into your wholeness. So stop and notice what you feel, notice where it is in your body. Notice what it makes you think about. Notice what it makes you want to do. Just be the observer, and acknowledge whatever feelings are going on. Acknowledge that you're hurt, or you're scared, or you're angry, or you're happy. Even just that starts to heal some of this disconnection from the self that puts us out of touch. And for those on the medium track and want to take this deeper, notice where your feelings may have gotten lost in the first place. What was the emotional language taught in your family? What were you taught about your feelings? Were you allowed to feel and express your emotions? Was there anybody there to meet you and support you in those emotions? Anybody there to hold? And what did you do as a result? Did you become overly emotional or excessive, or did you shut down your emotions and say I'm not going to feel, and run from them? That's deficient. So just do an inquiry. There's questions in your workbook to reflect and take this deeper. When you feel an emotion come up, pull back from the story of that emotion. The story of oh, this person hurt you, or they didn't listen to you, or they insulted you, or whatever happened and instead feel the charge of that emotion in your body. That charge is trying to move and flow. Notice where the charge is, and notice where it isn't. Notice where you might be blocking its movement. Maybe you're holding your breath, maybe you're tightening your throat, maybe you're clenching in your gut. Just notice and see where you can relax some of that holding and allow the movement to flow through into your tissues. Regard whatever created that emotion as the situation that is giving you a gift to come home to yourself and your own charge by feeling what goes on in your body. So that's quite a lot to look at in the psyche, and quite a lot to be feeling. Tomorrow, we'll take this into the body and we'll open up our hips and sacral chakra. See you there.

====================

LESSON 5 – Sacral Chakra: Healing the Body by Being in Tune with Yourself
--------------------
<v ->Welcome back.</v> Now that we've understood the emotional ramifications of the second chakra we're going to take this into the body. Because when we restrict our emotion, remember, we get very rigid and that especially shows up in the hips and pelvis and the low back. If you've got trouble in those areas, there may be something in your sacral chakra. Embodied blockages. What does this chakra look like in and out of balance? When the body is excessive, there's too much indulgence, that can make a protruding belly. It can make a lot of softness. We're very flowy, there's a lot of movement, but maybe a little too much. We're letting it all go. We're a leaky bucket. Sometimes the pelvis or the pubic bone is moved too far forward, that's a discharging position. And we may just be unformed, too watery. On the other hand, if we go deficient that makes the hips stiff, that makes the low back stiff. We may pull in, we may not indulge. Things just don't move very well. We might feel tight in our joints and there's just not a lot of lubrication. We might feel dry in our mouth or our tissues are dry. So, we want to keep that water going. And if we're balanced, then we have a healthy flow of energy, in and out. We can feel deeply without putting our emotions all over everybody else around us. We're in touch with ourselves and our body is healthy. It feels good, it feels good to be in it. It feels good to be alive. We take in through our senses, that's our birthright. So what do we do to tune into our bodies? Well, we want to tune into the sensation. I think of sensations like the words, feelings like the sentences made up of those words, and emotions are the story. So if you have trouble feeling your feelings, tune into the sensations of the body. It might be a sensation of numbness. It might be a sensation of emptiness. Or just a void. That is a sensation. Notice what that feels like. Begin to track the sensations in your body. And as you do they will gently start to move and they will become feelings. A feeling is like a subtle, a very subtle emotion, like I have a feeling this won't be good or this will be good. And then emotion is the full-blown I like this, I hate this, I'm happy, I'm sad. That's more of the story and that's the fullness of it. We want to keep a balance between containment and expression so that water can build up and flow throughout the whole body. We talked yesterday about one of the challenges being guilt. Well, guilt restricts the flow and so then we don't trust our own body. We're not in our own place. And we have trouble letting go. We get stiff, we get sore, we get achy, we get tense. And if we continually block the flow of our own energy, we don't allow it to build up the momentum it needs to become power, which is our next chakra. So the bioenergetic movements for charging and discharging the second chakra will be part of the yoga flow that will be coming up next. But know that opening and closing your knees, what we call the Butterfly Exercise, will be the charging. And the Pelvic Pulses, that is rocking your pelvis back and forth, will be the discharging. Both of these are listed in your workbook. Align with the center of your core. Pull your crown up over your base. Feel the alignment from earth to heaven. Energy wants to move along a line and second chakra is about movement. Being fluid and flowing. Bring your hands together over your heart. And press your right hand into your left hand. Feel the polarities that can push into each other and continue that pressure in your hands as you lift them up overhead. Polarities can also pull apart, so pull your fingers away from your heels lengthening the spine. Press your hips forward slightly in a mini-backbend and then come back up to a stand, opening your hands wide, bringing them to your hips and bow forward into a forward fold, Uttanasana. Imagine your legs are supporting you and now your torso is like a waterfall, flowing from the waters of your second chakra. Feel free to sway back and forth, to undulate. And then breathe and come halfway up, hand on the knees. And imagine there's a bowl of water. The rim is on your back and you're going to lift the rim and deepen the bowl as if you could collect water there. And then bow forward, let it wash down over you. Place your hands on either side of your front feet. And take your left foot back, into a low lunge, touching your left knee down. Take your right hand to the inside of your right foot, next to your left hand, and deepen this stretch in the groin. Maybe being on your wrist is enough for you, if you have the flexibility and want to go down on to your forearms or down on to blocks, you can increase the stretch. Hug the right knee in toward the shoulder and lengthen the spine between the crown and the tailbone. Inhale and come back up. Take your right hand to the outside of your right leg. Take your right leg back to meet your left. And wiggle your hips, bending each knee. Wiggling each hip up toward the ceiling. Next, inhale and bring your left foot forward, between your hands, taking your right knee down into a low lunge. Inhale your crown up and take your left hand to the inside of your left leg, placing it next to your right hand. And hugging your knee close to your shoulder. This might be enough for you. If you have the flexibility and want to go deeper, come on down to your forearms and be sure to keep your spine lengthened. Slightly pull your left hip back and extend into your crown. Inhale and come back up on to your wrists. Take your left hand to the outside, press your back toes underneath you, and take your back foot forward, next to your right for an Uttanasana, forward fold. Inhale, halfway up. Extend from the tailbone to the crown. Deepen that bowl in the second chakra and come back down into your forward fold, perhaps swaying side to side to let everything get loose and watery. Then with a slight bend to the knees, press down into the floor, tuck your tailbone underneath and slowly rise back up into a stand. Bring your hands together overhead. Press right hand into left hand and bring them down, over your heart. Wiggle your hips a little and feel your second chakra. Inhale your hands up overhead, once again. Lengthen from root to crown. And bow forward, hands on the hips into a forward fold, hands on either side of the front feet. Take your right leg back into a high lunge. Press your hands into the floor. Take your left leg back into a downward dog. Wiggle your hips once more and then come forward into table position. Take a moment to increase the curve of the sacrum. As you inhale, lift your crown and your tailbone, arching the back. As you exhale round into yourself, pushing your hands away from your knees. As you inhale lift the head and the tailbone, drawing your hands toward your knees. As you exhale, round down. And then the next time you inhale, take your hips back to your feet, bringing your feet together and opening your knees as wide as the sticky mat. Allow the front bones of your hips to drop between your thighs as you extend into your hands and lengthen your spine. And then, keeping your knees exactly where they are, inhale and lift your hips and your head, pressing your hands into the floor. And come forward into a wide-kneed cobra where your hips are dangling in the air. And then press back into open-leg child pose, once again. And go back and forth slowly a few times, feeling the various positions of the hips and finding where you need the stretch. Exhaling as you bring your hips to your heels. And inhaling as you come forward. Exhaling as you bring you hips to your heels and this time bring your knees back together, tuck your toes underneath, press back up into downward dog. Lift your right leg up into the air. Bend your knee, open the hip. And bring your right foot back down. Take your left leg up into the air. Press into your hands, push through the core of your body all the way to your left toes. Bend the left knee, open the hip. Bring the left foot back down. And slowly walk or jump your feet forward, between your hands. Bow down, remember that waterfall, washing over you. Shake your head loose. Sway in the wind. And with a soft bend to your knees, push through your legs, tuck your tailbone, curl upwards, bring your hands up overhead. Touch your hands together and bring them down the core. Wiggle your hips and say hello to your second chakra. Find your alignment from tailbone to crown. And say hello to your own place, Svadhisthana. So what are some everyday movements that you can do that just take a matter of seconds? Well, as you stand, as you inhale, take your tailbone way back. Arch the small of your back a little bit. As you exhale swing it forward. Just practice breathing in and out, swinging your pelvis backwards and forward. Once you get the hang of moving it backward and forward, you can now more it forward and let a wave form go all the way up your body. So inhale, take it back. Exhale, take your pelvis forward and let that movement make a wave motion all the way up to your crown. So for the next 24 hours, practice tuning in to your body and what it's feeling. Practice listening to your emotions, maybe take it into your journal. Maybe practice some of these exercises, whether the yoga flow or some of the quick everyday movements. And track it all in your journal. Share it with the tribe. Tell 'em what you did, tell them what you're experiencing. Help build this movement and the movement will happen in you. Tomorrow we'll go in to the spirit aspect of the second chakra. We'll look at how society taught us to numb our emotions and what result that brought and how to fix it. Join us tomorrow and I'll see you there.

====================

LESSON 6 – Sacral Chakra: Healing the Spirit Through Emotional Balance
--------------------
<v ->So yesterday we practiced healing the body,</v> and today we now go into the spirit aspect of it. Welcome back. So what does it mean to have a society that makes touch a bad thing, and puts us out of touch? What does it mean when we numb our emotions, and we no longer feel what we're doing? That's the topic we're going to delve in today. What happens when we get out of touch? We can do things that don't feel good. We do things to ourselves that don't feel good. We do things to other people that don't feel good. When we're not in touch with ourselves, we can be mislead, we can be fooled, we can be, hoodwinked into doing the wrong thing. And we don't feel the effects of what we're doing to each other. We don't feel what we're doing to the planet. And that allows us to continue doing things that are unhealthy. So we really have to reclaim our right to feel, and to feel together, to share your feelings with each other. Maybe you and a friend have common feelings about something. And there's power in sharing that. Because our feelings want to be witnessed. They want to be understood. Sometimes they're there until we can share them, and then, when someone says, "I understand, I get it, "gee, that must be hard." We can go, "Ah, I don't have to carry this anymore." So it's a way of making deeper connection, it's a way of building compassion. So when we denigrate feelings, we numb ourselves. And this even comes into the role of sexuality. Sexuality is so repressed and enhanced at the same time in our culture. It's told that it's wrong or bad, and then it's used in all the advertising and heightened, en-heightened sensationalism. We're out of balance in this chakra. And if we look at the world, we have floods and droughts, and the water element is definitely out of balance. When water is dammed, then it erodes the stream banks. So we need to free up this flow, but in an appropriate way, with these appropriate boundaries, appropriate containment. We need to find the balance between just letting it out and indulging, and containing. So that we can have sacred pleasure. And sexuality is one of the places that the second chakra plays out. All the aspects of the second chakra play out in sexuality. Feeling, desire, emotion, connection with another, pleasure, guilt, all of those things tend to play out in the realm of sexuality. So when we feel guilty about sexuality, it interferes with the enjoyment of that. You know, Dr. James Prescott did research into lots of different cultures, and he found that the cultures that embody pleasure and made sexuality okay, were sex-positive, were pleasure-positive, were cultures that had very little violence. And the reverse, he also found to be true. Cultures that were repressive sexually tended to be more violent. So if we can allow pleasure and satisfaction and fulfillment to come into the second chakra, we are happier beings, we're not going to be so violent to each other. We're going to be in touch with ourselves. We're going to be in touch with the grief and the things that were causing harm, and take power to change it. The society often makes the feeling or expression of emotions a weakness. Someone says, "Oh, you should pull yourself together." And people will start to feel something, I've even seen it in funerals, where someone's crying, and they say, "Oh, I shouldn't be doing this." Yes, you should, someone dear to you just passed. That's a natural emotion. But it's shamed, we feel guilty about it, and then, we become numb. And we become numb, we seek sensationalism to open up that numbness, and we do things to each other that we would regret. So, when emotions come up, what do we do? Some people are excessive, and they spill them all over. Those people need to learn containment. They need to learn, "I don't have to dump my anger on this person. "I don't have to cry for three days until I'm exhausted. "I can contain that emotion, I can feel the charge, and let it premiate my body." Other people, who are too emotionally contained, they need to allow themselves to feel. They need to allow themselves to move that emotion out into the world, to express it to other people, to share with their feelings. So, you probably know whether you fall on the excessive or deficient side, and what you need to do. Whether you need to contain or release. But that's all part of coming into balance. So what do we do to heal all this? Well, first of all, we have to pull back our judgment. Of ourselves, in our emotional states, and of others. We need to practice compassion, feeling with, we need to allow our emotions to surface, and bring the information that they're trying to deliver. Kahlil Gibran said that if we were all to sit in a circle and confess our sins, we would laugh at each other for lack of originality. We're all in the same boat together, floating on the same sea. Let's acknowledge that, let's feel together, and let's move those waters of compassion into power to change this world. So the practice here is to practice being vulnerable, practice sharing your emotions, remove the judgment, listen to each other, open, share emotions with each other, be in the water together. Realize there's no bad or good emotions. In fact, we don't choose what we feel. We choose what to do about what we feel. But if we chose our feelings, no one would ever choose to feel unhappy or sad, or scared. Feelings come up of their own accord. They come up from the unconscious, to give us some kind of information. So allow that information to be shared, maybe someone can listen to you and help you figure out what you're feeling, or figure out what it means. So it's all about opening to our vulnerability. And that opens to a common pool of understanding. So exercise for today is sharing emotion with someone. And pay attention to what happens in your body, and what happens between you and the other person. Reflect on the exercise. What was the experience like? What came to you? What did you feel? And what does that change in how you regard your emotional state? Share your experience with the Tribe. Tell us what happened. So that wraps up our first two chakras. I hope you enjoyed it and had some movement happen for you. Tomorrow there will be a review and integration day. And get ready for next week, 'cause we're going to fire up our third chakra into power and open our hearts.

LESSON 7 – Summary of Your First Week & Live Call Recording
--------------------
<v ->So congratulations, you made it</v> through your first and second chakras. You learned to ground and how your legs are like two prongs of a plug that plug into the earth, and hopefully, you've learned to generate energy from the earth. As you've brought that energy into your body, you've learned how to move it through your sacrum and hips and pelvis and kind of even move it up through your body. You've looked at the issues of your survival and your emotional issues. That's a lot, that's a lot to start with, and things may have been coming up for you. That's a pretty natural part of the process. You can take some that into the Tribe. You can practice these exercises again and again. And today is just a day to integrate. We're not going to do anything new on this day. It's a day to check in with the Tribe, work in your journal, and just be with yourself and notice what's coming up for you. Acknowledge whatever level of engagement you want. Do your chakra skill set or your everyday movements, if you haven't done that, and prepare yourself, because next week we are going to start into the third chakra and the fourth chakra. We're going to go into power and love. Well, who doesn't want more of those? So share your triumphs and inspirations with the Tribe and maybe you'll inspire someone else, and don't forget to download week two of the Chakra Companion Workbook. Look it over, get excited about what we're going to do and learning about power and love. Think about what you want to create out of that. Set yourself an intention and we'll see you tomorrow to start on a new week. Enjoy your day off.

LESSON 7: Week 1 - Q&A Call with Anodea Judith

Hi, Rainbow Warriors. Good morning, good afternoon, or good evening, whatever the case might be for you. I am Alex, and on behalf of the Mindvalley team, I'd like to welcome you to your chakra healing Q &A coaching call. We have a great session prepared for you today. We have very interesting topics that we'll be covering, belonging mainly to the first week of your quest, where we learn about the first two chakras, the root chakra and the sacral chakra. So this call will focus mainly on these two chakras, and I believe you'll get a lot, a lot of great insights from today's session. That being said, and without further ado, let's welcome our wonderful teacher on this journey, Anadea Judith. Hi, Anadea. Welcome, everyone. Namaste, which means the divine in me salutes the divine in all of you. I am so thrilled to be able to see your faces, to be able to talk with you live. I've been on the Facebook group and reading the posts. The shares are so rich. I'm loving the way people are showing up. for this quest. We're really doing it, guys. We're becoming rainbow warriors. So welcome, everyone. So let's close our eyes and go into a group meditation to connect. So let go for a moment and go into your inner world, that world inside your skin. Say hello to it. and take a moment to tune into your breath by taking a nice deep full breath in through the nose and all the way out even loosening your jaw a little bit letting out a little sound and we can begin by imagining the breath as it comes in goes from the root to the crown so imagine it going all the way up the middle of your spine And on the exhalation, it goes all the way back down. Letting everything settle down to the earth. Inhaling up your core. It's actually just in front of the spine. All the way up to the crown. And exhale, letting it fall all the way back down to your root. To the place where your butt's sitting on the chair. And imagine those roots, your roots, coming out of the base of your spine, going down into the earth right where you are, in all the many places that we're doing this meditation right now all over the world. Imagine your roots going down in your place and those roots branching out in front, behind. to the left, to the right, and even intermingling with other roots of people in the tribe. Roots from Germany and Denmark and Switzerland and Qatar and Kenya and Saudi Arabia and the UK and Italy and France and Australia and Norway and Spain and Finland and Netherlands and Austria and of course the U .S. and Brazil. There's so many people here registered. As rainbow warriors doing this work, connecting down into our roots, into our first chakra. And see that tap root, which is the central root that goes straight down, coming right out of the base of your spine. That is yours and yours alone. The rest of the roots intermingle. And as you send that tap root down, take the tip of your tailbone slightly to the back of your chair. Imagine widening your hips a little bit as you press your sitting bones down into the chair or cushion and feel how that tones the lower part of your body. Keep those sitting bones pushing down as you lift your crown up to the heavens and stretch out that core that runs between the base and the crown. And imagine as you pull the crown up and you pull the roots down, The chakras are all netted together on a, like a string of the soul, a cord of the soul, like a necklace. And we're pulling the two ends apart and all the jewels of the chakras move toward alignment. And as the roots connect us in the sacred mother earth, we also have the waters of the planet, water, the element of chakra two. There's really one ocean all across the planet. It has different names, but it's the same water. It's three quarters at the surface of our planet. So see us connecting through this vast ocean of emotion, connecting as one. And then to conclude, we'll just bring our hands together over our heart, bow our heads to the heart, bow to each and every person on this call. to the people that can't be on the call but are on the quest, in honor of the divine within each of you. Welcome, welcome, welcome. Let's kick off our Q &A portion. And like I mentioned in the beginning, we will start with some pre -submitted questions. Question number one from Lahim. Do we have to be good at meditation in order to be able to heal our chakras? I can see the benefits of the yoga exercises as I practice yoga on a daily basis, but I'm still struggling with meditation. What are your thoughts? Well, first of all, yoga is a meditation. Meditation isn't just sitting perfectly still. And, you know, when I read your question, I wondered. What does it mean to be good at meditation? Meditation is a state of being. Are we good at a state of being? I think we have these ideas that meditation is supposed to be perfectly still and absolutely no thoughts coming into the mind. But that's not actually the state that most of us achieve. We watch the thoughts. We can sit. So I don't know that there's any being good at meditation. You might let go of that idea. In general, when we're working with the lower chakras, especially, they're so physically oriented, they're so embodied, it's not really about meditation. We get into more meditation as we go to the upper chakras. So the idea of the lower chakras is to get us grounded and stable. and get our charge, our life force, kind of balanced out chakra by chakra. So by the time we get to the upper chakras, we are in a balanced state, and then we can go into meditation more easily. But not to worry. Yoga is a meditation. I love the stretching, yet I find I am unable to do several of the yoga poses that put stress on my knees or shoulders. Do you have any advice for those of us who cannot do all the yoga poses? How can we modify or what are our alternatives that we can do? Yes, and I've heard this kind of comment from several people on the Facebook page as well. And, you know, when I made these videos, so much of my audience has been yoga teachers and the chakra system comes from the yoga tradition that we put in yoga. And now I'm realizing there's a lot of people in the same boat as Laura who are compromised in some way in their body and yoga is not easy. This is why we also put in the everyday movements and the bioenergetic exercises. So if you can't do the yoga, you know, let go of the yoga. Or do a little bit and just go into where you can. You know, if you can't bend your knee very far, then just bend your knee a little bit. If it starts to hurt, don't go any farther. And you can begin to just breathe into that. But you don't have to do the yoga to be able to do this if that's not possible for you. The bioenergetic exercises are even more powerful. And often when I'm teaching workshops to yoga teachers and I throw in the bioenergetic workshops exercises, they say, oh, we want more of that. That actually is moving it more than the yoga. So, you know, if you just do the bioenergetic grounding. You can also lay on your back and push your foot up into a strap and just get some energy going there. You can lay in the bed in the morning, throw off the covers when you wake up and wake up your legs. Just straight leg, go one, two, three, four, one, two, three, four, and kick your heels into the bed. That's going to wake up your legs and your first chakra. No yoga needed. Great. Next question from Sona. How do I know whether to do the charging or discharging energy exercises? And if we do the wrong ones, then is that detrimental or adding to the overall problem? I'm so glad you asked that question because I'd really love to make that clear. So in your assessment back in the master class, there was looking at whether you are excessive or deficient or where you fall. And some people said, oh, I've got a little bit on the excessive side and I've got a little bit on the deficient side. That's quite normal. And in general, the excessive chakras need to discharge. That means we have too much stuck energy and we need to move it out. Discharging is moving from the inside out. The deficient chakras need to charge up. They need to take energy from the outside and bring it in and keep it. So if you have a little bit of the diagnostic of yourself, you can pick the exercise that's going to take you in the direction you need to go. However, the process of charging and discharging and even going back and forth between the two moves energy through the body. So we charge up, that pushes up against the blocks, and then we discharge and the block moves. So you won't go wrong in any way by doing, you know, like if you're excessive and you charge up, because that's just going to make you more likely to discharge, which is what you want to do. The only thing I would say as a caution is if you're a very undercharged person, in other words, you're really tired all the time and you just... have trouble keeping your body up, then you don't want to discharge very much because you want to keep that energy. You want to charge up and keep it. If you are an anxious person and you're high charge all the time and you can't relax and you can't rest, then you don't want to get overcharged. You want to work on discharging. So I think it's only of concern when you're in one extreme or the other. But otherwise, just see what feels good to your body when you do it. Like you do some of the bioenergetic grounding and say, oh, I feel more present. Great. Or I feel a little anxious. Maybe I need to kick my feet and discharge some of that. Next question is on a similar topic from Dolly. I have both excess and deficient energies and I cannot find the cause. I learned to control my feelings too much and don't know what really hurts me. How do I heal the imbalances in this case? What I would say is that if you learn to control your feelings, that is the cause. It may not be a trauma per se. It may not be some terrible thing that happened to you in childhood that you don't remember. I mean, it could be, but it doesn't have to be. Often in families, you know, there's either too many children or their parents are busy. learns I've got to control my emotions. Maybe they're told you're too sensitive or you cry all the time. Maybe nobody was there to meet you in your emotions. For whatever reason, you don't even have to know the reason. If you learn to control your feelings, that would make it hard for you to know what you feel. The key when the emotions are numbed is to begin to pay attention to the sensations in your body. sensations of coolness, the sensations of being blocked, the sensations of having some charge or energy in a particular chakra or particular part of the body. And to just breathe into those sensations, to take your mind and really put your attention there in a way of being really curious. Like you're visiting a foreign country and you're really curious. How do the people live here? What do they eat? You know, just, oh, what is going on in my right hip? What is going on in my belly? And be really curious. and non -judgmental and just experience it and breathe into it, that will allow the energy to be acknowledged so it can start to move. How to quickly focus before we start on the chakra balancing activities? Yeah, I love that question. I would say just what we did at the very beginning of this call, the simplest practice we can do every time we sit down is roots down, crown up. And that begins to set your chakras into the right alignment. Press your tailbone to the back. Take a deep breath. And set your intention for your practice. So my intention is to stay focused. Or my intention is to heal the ache in my back. is to, you know, feel my emotion or my intention is to get grounded, to just set an intention. So roots down, crown up, feel your core, take a breath, set your intention. Great. Simple and efficient. Love it. Next question comes from Alison. How to maximize the balancing effects of the exercise on our chakras? Does food play a role in all of this? So to maximize the effects is to take a little time after you do them, if that's possible for you, to just sit and feel the results. You're rewiring the neurons in your brain. They say neurons that fire together wire together. So maybe your neurons were wired together around the emotion of fear. or sadness or something and as we start to move that and we experience a different state we have to kind of train our brain the way you would train an animal to focus on the new state so if you feel a little pleasure if you feel a little lighter freer maybe your spine shifts the way it's holding itself go inside and really savor that You know, like taking a bite of something delicious and you want to take one bite and close your eyes and go, I'm really going to savor that. And what that's doing is giving your brain body interface a chance to wire up and get more wired around the positive feelings than the negative ones. Now, a lot of people wrote in since we were in second chakra and doing emotions, a lot of people wrote in that they were. you know encountering very difficult emotions a lot of things pent up from their childhood now we don't want to wire the brain in that what we want to do is release those we can release them by moving the body i suggested putting on music nice and loud if you can and just dancing out that anger or dancing out those tears moving it from the body and then in the aftermath that's what you want to savor food You know, in Wheels of Life, I put a chart of different foods. I think proteins are good for the first chakra. They're good for grounding. We want to get plenty of liquids. And second chakra is water. You know, that says keep your fluids up. Third chakra is energy. That's our starches that just give us the quick fire. Fourth chakra is green. We think lots of vegetables. Fifth chakra I think of is fruit. And then we're sort of beyond the body itself. We're not into food anymore. here. How often should we do these exercises for each chakra? Is there such a thing as too much? I think you do them as often as you can because the more often that you do them, the more you're training your nervous system to go in a new direction. So, you know, I don't think you can do them too often. The only thing I would say is what I said earlier about excess if you're highly anxious. Don't get overcharged. If you feel yourself getting even more charged or more uncomfortable, then you need to discharge but not increase the charging exercise. Or if you feel like you're doing so much discharging that you get depleted, then you need to do some charging. But I don't think I think the more you do it, you know, yoga practitioners do the same posture over and over and over again. And I've done the most advancing in my yoga when I've gone to like a five day yoga retreat where I'm doing it all day long for five days in a row instead of just, you know, a morning practice. And that really, you know, shoots you to a new level. I haven't done that in a while. I have to admit I'm so busy. But, you know, so I think the more you do it, the more you're going to get the benefit. It feels like as I clear blockages from the first and second chakras, some of these energies are becoming stuck in the higher chakras. Could this be possible? And if yes, what may help keep those in balance as we work through this process? I see this again and again when I teach my live workshops. As we're working from the ground up, that energy gets cleared or it gets pushed upward and then it hits the next place that's blocked. That might be in the heart or then we'll clear the heart and the next day I say, how is everybody? Oh, now it's up in my throat. We clear that and I say, how is everybody? Oh, it's up here. As we clear, that energy can then move and it'll go to the next block. That's really, really common that that happens. is what to do about it first just notice notice what the sensations are notice where the charge is in your body and how you can maybe move that the second thing is meditation really helps to clear that upper chakras it's like there's something coming up that consciousness wants to receive and process When you sit quietly in meditation, it allows those things to complete their journey, to be acknowledged and be put away. It's like taking the time out is the way we fold our laundry and clean up our room. It just takes care of all those things that have been accumulating all week long. Meditation is like that for what's been coming up. When we say emotions come up, well, come up to what? Come up to consciousness. We don't say they come down. So it's very typical. How do you separate emotions of fear and pain from the past that are now flooding in with fear and pain in our current life? Well, that is a really great question. And I'm also glad you asked that because that is also very common. And the thing is, in some ways, there is no difference. So if we have not healed something from the past, The unconscious will create a situation in the present that will be similar to what's in the past so that we have another opportunity to heal it. So let's say, for example, you couldn't speak up in the past because your father didn't want to listen or your mother was too busy or something. You will unconsciously create a relationship where you have the same dynamic. So that this time with more awareness, you can speak up or you can share your emotion or you can stand your ground and put up a boundary. Carl Jung said, what remains in the unconscious will return to us as fate. Now, the thing is when something is happening in present time, let's say the loss of a loved one, your cat dies or you have a partner that dies or a parent or something. That will trigger all the grief and loss you had all lifelong that hasn't been shed or processed. So the feelings we're feeling occur in the present time. I mean, you're not in the past. You're here in this moment. You're feeling what you're feeling. And it's always a mixture of past and present to the degree that we haven't cleared out the past. Once you really clear out the past, first of all, you don't need to recreate those situations. And then you can have a fresher feeling that's in reaction to what's going on at the moment without all that weight and baggage from the past. I'm seeing a comment here from Cherie that said, this is the best explanation ever. Thank you. So it's great. We are on the right track. Let's see another question here on the list from Jennifer. How do you feel about EFT tapping while doing this type of work? I decided to tap while doing these affirmations, for example. And what are your thoughts about mixing this practice with other practices that we are already doing? Are there any pros or cons to doing this? Well, first of all, just for those who might not know, EFT is emotional field therapy, and it's a process of tapping on different points in your body to move energy along the meridians. And it can be used in lots of different ways. A common way to use it is when people have the charge of emotions coming up at an uncomfortable level, they can tap and bring themselves and discharge a little bit and bring themselves down. So I think it's fine to use EFT with any of these chakra practices that we're doing. The only thing that I would caution against, and this is just my particular bias, and I know that EFT works, I've seen it demonstrated, I've used it myself, is that sometimes people say, oh, I'm feeling an emotion, I'm going to tap it away. Oh, I'm feeling an emotion, I'm going to tap it away. And what you're doing is you're calming yourself in the moment. but you may not be dealing with the cause. So it's sort of like saying, I have a headache, I'm going to take an aspirin. I have a headache, I'm going to take some ibuprofen. If you keep doing that, you might not be dealing with your brain tumor. There might be a deeper cause that wants to be looked at. I think the charge that we have is golden. Ideally, in the long run, we want to be able to keep that charge, let it permeate our tissues for more aliveness. If we're tapping it away all the time, we lose that opportunity. However, if you're really uncomfortable and you've got to go to work and you're in a crying jag, you can use tapping to calm yourself down so you can work through the day. You can also use tapping to bring your energy up. And if you want to learn more about that, check out Donna Eden's course with Mindvalley. She's a wonderful energy medicine teacher. Next question here is an upvoted question from Christina. Do you have any advice for those of us who feel other people's emotions, basically the impact? When I'm around someone who is nervous or angry or negative, it's hard for me to separate myself from their emotions. Any advice? Yeah, of course. Yeah, this comes up a lot where people even feel someone else's emotions more than they feel their own. And remember the name of this chakra, Svadhisthana, means one's own place. So we want to be in our own place. We don't want to be in our friend's depression. So how do we do that? The more you ground and the more you run energy up and down your core, the more you... who you are is the best way I can say it. The more you're running your energy, the more you become Sally or Joe or whoever you are. And the more you can sense, oh, that's not mine. So there's a practice of going me, not me. This is my energy signature. I know it as Anadea. This is somebody else's. And then to begin to make a separation and just say, you're not me. And it doesn't mean we have to be blind to other people or we can't feel compassion for them, but we just say, oh, that's not me. This is me. And it's the same way with, you know, here's a food that I don't eat. Oh, I don't eat that. I don't like that. You know, we make that. That's not for me. That's separation. And then we want to imagine making a boundary. And that boundary can be, you know, like little tiny sparkles that reflect the energy back and don't let in, you know, maybe semi permeable, like a beaded curtain or something that lets in what you want and keeps out what you don't. But I would say that the more you're in your core and the more you're in your own ground, the more you're in you and the less opportunity there is for someone else's energy to get stuck in us. This usually comes from someone who, as a child, in order to feel physically or emotionally safe, they had to check out, what's mom feeling today? What's dad feeling today? What's my brother feeling today? Is mom in a good mood or not a good mood? And by checking that out, they knew, oh, then I'm going to be okay. So they got in the habit of feeling other people's emotions before their own. As I don't remember being hugged or caressed in my childhood, Is it possible that I don't remember through the mind, I mean, not being able to visualize those moments, but somehow, how does the body remember these things? Well, you know, much of our early childhood, especially the parts programming these first two chakras, or the primary programming of it, happened pre -verbal. We don't talk yet. And when we go to our mind and think through things and remember, we're usually in that internal verbal part of the mind. You know, we're kind of mumbling to ourselves and we're processing and thinking. And so we don't access that pre -verbal part. Like very few people can remember their birth unless they're doing kind of a rebirthing session or something. They can't remember their first two years of life because it's programmed into what we call somatic. memory, which is memory in the muscles and tissues of the body. And so we have to go to a non -cognitive or non -verbal state to remember that. But the body will shape itself in a certain way. It will tighten. You can vacate parts of the body where you don't feel in touch. Those are your clues to the early memories that are more lodged in the body. That memory is there. We weren't able to give it meaning and file it away in the filing system that we currently live in, which is our adult verbal filing system. So when I have people breathe, when I have them do yoga, often somatic memories come up, memories from the body that might not even make sense to them. I'll give you an example. In 2001, I was in a car accident and I broke my two left ribs. And they healed up fine. And about six months later, I was in a yoga workshop. And I was doing a triangle, or a twisted triangle, I think. And the teacher came along and adjusted me and brought me a little more into the pose. And I burst into tears. And I just sobbed the rest of the day. I was letting out the trauma of the car accident. And I wasn't feeling sad that day. You know, it was just stored in my body. So it was a somatic memory that was then released. So how connected are physical ailments, injuries, or disabilities in relation to our body energy and our chakra alignment? Well, I think they're very connected, but I say that carefully. Because what I find as I travel around is people can kind of use that for self -blame. like oh i caused my own cancer or you know because i'm messed up in this area that's why i have this problem and i think that's not helpful in healing but what i say is that wherever the ailment is occurring and believe me i've had my share you know watched the master class you know that I struggled with Lyme disease and still do to some extent so you know pain in my body I have you know given me a lot of lessons about this that you know when someone comes to me and you know says oh I have this you know pain in my gut or my hip or my shoulder I say, that's an invitation to look there. They'll go, is that heart chakra? Is that third chakra? I say, well, I don't know, but that's the first place I'd look. In other words, if your pain is in your lower back, that tends to indicate second chakra. That would be the first place I'd look. Is there a second chakra issue that is arresting the free movement of charge or life force in that area? That blocked energy will create pain, discomfort, ailments. I also look at, I call it the language of symptomatology. I look at, let's say it's a liver function that's compromised. Well, what does the liver do? Well, one thing the liver does is it filters toxins. So maybe that person has trouble filtering toxic energy in their life and it gets right in. Maybe it's the lungs. Well, what do the lungs do? They breathe. Well, maybe you don't have enough breathing space in your life. So I take the ailments almost as a metaphor. If it's your splitting headache, what are you splitting from? If it's in your stomach, what can't you stomach? It's an expression in English. It's like, I can't stand it. I can't stomach it. I can't digest it. So I look at those things as metaphors for something that needs to be solved in our life. Rather than saying it's exactly this, it's not about pigeonholing it into a chakra. It's about using that map to say, well, this is the first rock I would look under. You know, this is the first closet I would open or the first drawer I would open. Doesn't necessarily mean it's there, but that's where you start looking. I have a post -traumatic stress challenge. What do you recommend for PTSD? In this charging and discharging, when it comes to trauma, and trauma is pretty universal, you know, so many people have it, we want to do it very gently. So what post-traumatic stress syndrome really is, is a vortex of energy created by the original trauma, where something happened or we had to put up with something or whatever the situation was, the charge got triggered. in the body when we were five years old or whatever and it didn't get to be released and so it got stuck in some part it might be you know butterflies in your stomach it might be your heart beats really fast it might be something tightens up in your throat these are different chakras and so the trauma was in the past it's not happening anymore hopefully what the ptsd post -traumatic traumatic stress syndrome is doing is it's recreating that vortex of stuck energy that actually wants to be released and wants to get out. However, when there's been trauma, the idea of releasing it can be really scary. It's like, oh my God, there's so much in here. I've had people tell me, if you get me crying, I'm never going to stop. If you get me screaming, the whole neighborhood's going to hear. And so the safe way is to let out a little bit at a time. So to feel the vortex of energy, feel the discomfort if you can and go, okay, there's energy in there that's stuck. Where is it wanting to move? Maybe it's wanting to move from my heart to my throat and be spoken. Maybe it's wanting to move down into my ground and be stomped into the ground. Boom, boom, boom. Maybe it's wanting to move out through my hands or I push somebody away to allow the energy to complete what it didn't get to do originally. Now, you might not know that in your head. You might not even know what the trauma was. So how do you know what is to complete? Well, as it comes up, to feel what the impulse is. What is the urge? Oh, that's coming up into my shoulders and my hands are getting really activated. Maybe my hands want to hit. You know, little kids, that's a very primitive way that they express their anger. Maybe my hands wanted to reach out and bring someone close to me. So to even ask your body, okay, what do you want to do with this? Where's this energy you want to go? And how can I allow that? to complete. When it completes, then the trauma settles down. I studied a lot with Peter Levine, a trauma expert, and he said, trauma is the arousal of an instinctual response that doesn't get to complete. And so it's stuck in there. And PTSD is the repeated attempt to get it to complete, but the attempt is blocked. So that's, you know, several years of training in a five -minute nutshell about trauma. So much and so little time. Beautiful. Our next question here is from Joy. What do you do if you feel like you need more healing with the sacral chakra? Specifically, if you've experienced abuse as a child and you numb your feelings or sensations, how does one move beyond that? You know, depending on what happened to us and what chakras get blocked. And as we do this... quest you'll find some you'll just get a breeze through and summer's like oh my i've got a lot going on in here to move and that's normal we're all different um then you spend more time in that and doesn't mean you can't go on doesn't mean you can't go on to third chakra or fourth chakra my goodness if we had to have everything all settled in our ground or sacral chakras we'd never get the higher consciousness because we all have so much stuff there but i would just say take those exercises and do them a lot There's lots more where they came from. You can check out my books. Chakra Yoga has a lot of the yoga poses. You can do one at a time. Charge in the energy body. Oh, I don't have a copy of that right here. We'll let you understand your charge more. So in Eastern Body, Western Mind, I'm not trying to do a plug here, but just give people resources. This goes into the psychology of the chakras a lot more. So maybe you want to delve into it. In a quest where we're spending three days on each chakra, I can't promise to solve every problem that everybody has. This can be a really good adjunct to therapy. If there's a particular issue... I think therapy is great. Of course, I'm speaking as a therapist. But I think that none of us gets through this life unscathed. And therapy is a way of cleaning yourself the way taking a shower is cleaning yourself. We all take a shower every day. Or get a friend to talk to. And be patient. It takes a while to clear out years and years of deep trauma. Be patient. Be loving and compassionate with yourself. And find support. And know that it's going to take some time. Very true. Wonderful advice. Our next upvoted question comes from Vicky. It says, I seriously injured my tailbone years ago. Would this affect my root chakra? The tailbone, the base of the spine, if we look sideways at a person, we see that the tailbone curves under just a little bit. And those vertebrae are fused. the coccyx. I believe that when you start to push that back out, you open up your root chakra. If someone broke or injured their tailbone, that doesn't keep you from opening your first chakra. It actually makes you spend more time and attention in that place. Wherever we have pain, it's calling for your attention. Sometimes, you know, falling on your tailbone can trigger your Kundalini. And I fell off a horse once on my tailbone and then, woo, you know, my Kundalini really woke up. But I think that what you have to do is move really slowly and really feel what... a way that I move, is it like this or like that, that actually makes it feel a little better. Ah, okay, if I sit like that, then I can feel the energy move through. It takes more time and attention when we have an injury. And the question about the mismatch in the pelvis or the asymmetry. That doesn't keep you from opening your second chakra. Listen, folks, you don't have to be perfect in any way to have energy in your chakras. We all do, and we all have it in whatever way we do, just like we all have eyes, regardless of whether our eyesight is good or not. We have a mouth, we have a nose, we have chakras and energy in it. So if you have an asymmetry, again, that's something to listen to. Is the right hip forward of the left? Is the left hip forward at the right? Or one hip higher than the other? That will affect your whole spine, any chiropractor would tell you. And in general, you could see the right side of your body as the masculine or what you got from your father or didn't get, as the case may be. The left side is what you got or didn't get from your mother and the feminine. So let's say your right hip is forward. Well, in that you might have emotionally connected more with your father than your mother. Maybe your mother was absent or your left hip is forward or higher. So, you know, again, these are not hard and fast rules, but if you begin looking and following the clues, those are some of the places I would start to look. And it was someone, it was back a ways, but had a three -year -old that had maybe some birth trauma and they wanted to know how to let their three -year -old become more grounded. And so I would say a lot of touch and physical activities. Make it playful, you know, not serious. Remember that kundalini butt bounce, boom, boom, boom, just bouncing up and down on your tailbone. Have your three -year -old do that. That's fun. Have them stamp their feet into the ground and then hug them and touch them a lot because that calms the nervous system and settles the brain -body interface into the cells and tissues of the body. So while that little boy or girl is building their body and building their neural infrastructure, you want to give it... You want to give your child what they need with lots of physical touch, playing with clay, with blocks, with things that are physical, going for walks, kicking with the legs, any of the exercises we're learning here. I'm finding it hard to rate myself on the balance assessment. I seem to fluctuate daily. How should I approach this situation during this question? Well, again, diagnostic is not meant to be a hard and fast rule, like somebody saying, oh, you've got hepatitis, or you've got an excessive third chakra, and that's a sentence. It's supposed to be a guideline of the things that we might do as strategies in our life to either compensate, which falls on the excessive side, or to avoid, which falls on the deficient side. So rather than try and get yourself in a fixed place of I'm this or I'm that, go, oh, well, I avoid feeling my emotions and I compensate by indulging in food, example. Or I avoid dealing with the earth plane and I compensate by being up in my head. Or I... Never felt safe in life, so I compensate by making a large body so I have more protection around me. So these are the keys to finding out what you do too much of or too little of. And then, of course, the healing in that is, well, if you do too much of it, try to do less. If you do too little of something, try to do it more. If you've been avoiding your feelings all your life, then maybe it's time to pay attention to them. If you've been drowning in your feelings and being overly emotional, maybe it's time to do a little less of that, practice containment and sending the energy to some other chakras. So don't look at that as a sentence. Look at it as a guideline. Once you feel you have balanced your chakras, as we did this week, how can we more easily recognize any type of misalignment later on? For instance, after this quest, how do we keep the good stuff going and continuing? So the more imbalance you get, the quicker you notice when something is out of balance. And what you're getting in this quest is a set of tools, tools to use for each chakra. So, you know, you fix something in your house. It doesn't mean nothing is ever going to break in your house again. You need to keep your hammer. You need to keep your saw. You need to keep, you know, the tools and keep using them. Because we do them once in a 15 -minute video doesn't mean doing it once is going to fix that chakra forever and ever. So when you get more balanced, then you can feel like, oh, I'm out today. I'm out of balance, out of sorts in my heart. And you can go back to your workbook or you can go back to the videos and you go, well, what were some of the practices to charge or discharge the heart or to make access with my heart? And use that. So you know where to go. And you're going to get a full set of tools all the way up to crown chakra. So you'll know which one is out. And then they'd say, oh, I'm really in my head today. That's too much. But maybe that's because I'm not in my ground. And so I need to go back down and do the grounding. I would say grounding is something you can do each and every day. You can't do too much of it. It's going to help no matter what. And it just should be part of your daily practice. And the nice thing about like that bioenergetic grounding, anytime you're standing, you can do it. You can do it while you're brushing your teeth. You can do it while you're waiting for your coffee to percolate. You can do it when you're standing in line at the bank. you know, pumping gas into your car, going for walks. You can do it in two or three minutes. Just say, oh, I'm going to ground. And you're training your nervous system to stay more grounded. In day six exercise was for us to be vulnerable and share an emotion. What advice do you have for someone who attempts to be vulnerable and share with someone close, but they are not giving the support or the space to do so? How do you move forward towards balance without reverting to withdrawal? That's a challenge, yeah. Well, I mean, a few things. One, try another person. If that's a partner that isn't there to hear you, try a friend. Another thing is to look at, was that the case in your past? Are you recreating a parent that wasn't able to be there for you with your emotions? If so, allow the adult that you are to be there for that child's emotions. So the inner, you know, we have lots of parts in ourselves. So that inner part can say, oh, I see you little three -year -old. I know that you're really scared and lonely and sad, and I'm going to hold you. Tell me all about it. And that we create that relationship inside. to give that child what they didn't get or to give yourself what you didn't get. Another thing that comes more in the communication realm, when you have someone that doesn't feel like they respond when you share from vulnerability, it's probably they don't know how. And in your communication, it's helpful to preface what you're going to say, like to say, you know, I really, I want to share something really vulnerable with you. I want to share something that's hard for me to say. And what I want from you in this sharing is I want you to just be quiet and listen and then give me a hug and say, I understand. Or what I want is for you to repeat back what I say. I don't want you to fix it or I don't want you. And you're actually coaching them on what you're looking for. Now, you may say when I get it, it feels phony. But, you know, in a way that doesn't matter because you're actually giving that person an opportunity to give to you. I find most people do want to give. They just don't know how. Is it possible to heal blockages without fully understanding their history or their story? Yes, it is. Understanding is very intellectually satisfying. You know, oh yeah, I messed up because my mother didn't want me and my brother hated me and yada, yada, yada. But it doesn't change it. So understanding doesn't do the healing. It just kind of gives you the map. I find, and especially as I've worked therapeutically with people over... four decades and done trauma work i've worked with birth trauma for example where someone doesn't remember but it's clear they're going into a birth trauma the body remembers and as i say what is here with us in present time is the only thing that can really be healed what is here with us may be a vestige of the past it may come from something unhealed in the past but the discomfort or the sadness or whatever we're feeling that in present time so in present time we heal it we allow that energy to move through the body and move out emotion comes from the latin e meaning out and mover to move so it's the moving out of energy so when we can complete what didn't get completed that will allow the energy to then say, okay, I'm done with that. Now I can move on to something else. That was wonderful. That's all the time we had for today. Hope you guys had a lot of fun and you got a lot of great value from this session. Thank you very much, Nadea, for all of your great insights and knowledge and the expertise that you brought for this session. And I'm looking forward to our next session that will be on the solar plexus and the heart chakra to see what that session will bring. Thanks for listening and tuning in. Let's all bring our hands together over our heart. Take a deep breath in. And from all our places all over the world, let's take a deep Aum. Aum. And imagine that reverberating throughout the world. Namaste. Thank you, Rainbow Warriors. See you next week. That's all for me. All there's left to say is stay committed, Rainbow Warriors. Work on the piece that's in front of you. Thank you very much for all of your questions, your comments, your engagement, your participation, for showing up and for playing full out. And until next time, be extraordinary, my friends. Take care. Bye -bye.

Week 2: Heal Your Solar Plexus & Heart Chakra

====================

LESSON 8 – Solar Plexus Chakra: Healing the Psyche by Overcoming Shame
--------------------
<v ->Welcome back to your third chakra in the solar plexus,</v> the element fire. So now we started in earth, we got solid, we got our foundation. We moved up into water, we got fluid and flowing, so the energy started to move. And now we take that matter and movement and we make fire. So take your hands, rub them together. Your hands are matter, that's movement. Feel how that creates heat. That's how these chakras build, we get our solidity, we get it moving, and that generates energy. And that brings us into the third chakra. Our purpose here is to find our power, to develop the strength of our will, to develop strength in our bodies, to increase the amount of energy we have, and to be able to really direct that energy into the activities of our choice. That's following through on your will. Why is this important? Well if we didn't have individual will, nothing would ever change. There would be no evolution. We would still be in the first and second chakra that are subject to gravity, water finds the path of least resistance, it always goes wherever it will, but we need our will to go in a new direction. We need our will to say, you know, I'm not going to eat that cookie, I'm going to go someplace else. We need our will to say, I'm not going to hurt someone, I'm going to do something different. We need our will to create a new direction. And rainbow warriors need to have their power in order to make change. So let's examine the developmental stage of this chakra, which is approximately 18 months to three or four years. So what's happening there? So if we go back to visit the developmental stage of this chakra, we're looking at 18 months to three or four years. What's happening to a child at that stage? They've gone through their second chakra stage of exploring the world, and they've been developing language. And as they move out into the world, of course there's parents that say, don't touch that, don't do that, be quiet, hold still, hold back. And as that language is being internalized, the child is learning impulse control. Of course we have to learn that before we can be socialized in the next chakra. But how this goes depends on whether a child is overly controlled, or whether they have a sense of freedom to express who they are. They're also beginning to hatch from that fused symbiosis with their parents to being their own person. So a child is developing their autonomy and their will. They're saying, no, I don't want to do that. And they're learning to tie their shoes and button their clothes and hold up a cup and eat right, and they're learning how to do things. This is actually a development of the ego identity that is oriented to self definition. As a child learns to master these tasks, he or she gets a sense of self esteem, they get a sense of being okay. So one of the developmental tasks of this chakra is developing autonomy, will, self esteem and impulse control. So do we find our autonomy, or not? Do we have a sense of power that we can control our circumstances to a certain degree, or not? Do we handle what life gives us or not? Are we safe to challenge authority? Are we safe to go in a new direction? And what about your will, ask yourself, do you complete tasks? Do you remain true to your own purpose, or do you even have a sense of purpose? These are all aspects that we develop in the third chakra. So what causes blockages in the third chakra? Well, being shamed. You know, as we're learning to take our actions and our impulse control, our mastery into doing something and someone says, oh, you did that so well. We get a feeling of pride, we get a feeling of self esteem. Even when you cross something off on your to do list and you turn it into a ta da, you get a sense of self esteem. But if a child is shamed, if they're, what did you do that for, you should know better, you should do better than that. Then we start to equate our doing with who we are. And if we don't do well, we think we are bad, and that is a shame that turns against the self and collapses the third chakra. And so some of the things that can lead to this shaming is authoritarian or controlling parents. That doesn't allow the child to have his or her own will and a sense that they can be true to their own will. You know, we want people to grow up and be responsible, but we have to give them the ability to respond in order to be responsible. Another aspect that impacts our third chakra is age-inappropriate responsibility, like when a young child has to take care of brothers and sisters, has responsibilities that are much too old for their development. That can leave a child feeling inadequate, 'cause the child doesn't know they're not old enough to do that, if it's expected of them, they expect it of themselves, and they might have that sense of inadequacy lifelong. The third aspect that really impacts this chakra is not being allowed to differentiate, not being allowed to be your own person. You got to toe the line, you got to do what everybody else in this family does, not being able to express really from your own place, the second chakra, and being able to take that into action. So from all of those things that impact our third chakra, all that shaming and trauma, what is the effect that has on us? Well, it can undermine our will so that we don't follow through on things, tell us to hold back on our power. It can make us passive or passive aggressive, where we pretend not to be rebelling against something but we are in a passive way. We can lose energy, we can cave in, we can lose our backbone, or we can become overly amped and be aggressive and powerful and always in the fight mode. Those are all imbalances of the third chakra. So the way these things impact our third chakra is we become afraid to own our power, and then we become victims of our circumstances, instead of creators of the life we want. We fall into resentment, and then resentment leads to resistance, and resistance is kind of like driving with the brakes on. You know, we're doing what we're told, but we don't really want to do it, so we sort of drag our feet and go into resistance at the same time. And what I've seen is sometimes people even resist the things they're choosing for themselves. And that just wastes a lot of energy, we need energy to come into power. So we've talked a little about the effects on the chakra and how does this make us go excessive or deficient. The excessive chakra is overly controlling, overly powerful, they want to lord it over everybody else, they want to control all their situations, they might be excessively doing and have to be active and doing something all the time. And of course, in the long run that can lead to exhaustion. The deficient third chakra doesn't have enough power. They're passive, they're weak willed, they don't follow through. They cave in, they say, oh, whatever you want. They don't hold their ground, they don't hold their edge, they don't have enough fire or backbone. If the chakra is balanced, then you're proactive, means that instead of being inactive, which would be deficient or reactive, which would be excessive, we're proactive, we take action ahead of time to make the outcome we want. We're responsible, we're reliable, we have rights but we also feel that goes with responsibilities. We have a sense of freedom and an effective will, and we're confident in our lives to make effective change. So if you were shamed, you lost your power, plain and simple. So what are some of the signs that we're suffering from shame? Well, you might have a vicious inner critic that is constantly on your back. You might have feelings of worthlessness, you might self sabotage, some of the things you don't follow through, you don't believe you can, and if we don't think we can succeed, well, why even try? One thing you might find is that you're blaming other people, that's a sure sign that you're giving your power away. Shaming and blaming tend to go together as partners, one person is shamed, and then they're blamed when they're not doing what is consistent with their will. Shame bound people often have a vicious inner critic. They have a feeling of worthlessness or why bother, or I don't matter. And this vicious inner critic is like the anger that should have come out to take charge of your life, hits a wall and instead turns back against the self. So someone is consistently undermined, and then it makes it even harder to get their energy to go forward and they feel even more shame about that. So it becomes a kind of vicious circle. This all results in a broken will, loss of personal power and the tendency to be manipulated by others, which again, only heightens the shame. We have to realize that shame comes in from outside. When we overcome that, then we harness the gift of vitality, energy, a strong will, effective action, and a feeling of personal power. Examine your power programming. How is power handled in your family? What did that make you do? What was the messages you got about taking your power, was it safe, were you scared? And how does that play out in your life right now? Own your own will. Know that everything you are doing, whether you want to do it or not, you're doing with your will. And instead of saying, I have to, start to say, I choose to. I choose to do the dishes, not because I have to, but because I want a clean kitchen. I choose to pay my bills because I want to keep the lights on. I choose to do this, and that will empower your will. 'Cause when we say, I have to, automatically there's resistance coming in. Yeah, but I don't want to, has a subtext. Part of owning your own will is refraining from blaming someone else. Look at it this way, if it's their fault, there's nothing you can do about it. But if you take back your responsibility in that action, you're empowering yourself to change it. That's a hard one, but it's a very powerful practice. And that's why your exercise today is to look at where you are blaming or complaining, and take your power back to make change. Own your responsibility to create the outcome of your life. Be the master of your own charge and energy. Let your intention come down from your upper chakras to meet the energy coming from below, let them combine in the third chakra to move outward as a strong and powerful will. Write down what can you do to change it. And then really set yourself up the responsibility to take some of those actions. So in the workbook, you'll find some deeper questions that you can look at to examine the programming of your power chakra. That's for your medium to full engagement. It's just changing your language from the words I have to, to I choose to. Catch it in your own inner dialogue. So in order to do all these things, we need energy, and we have to generate that energy in the body. So that's where we're going to go tomorrow. See you then.

====================

LESSON 9 – Solar Plexus Chakra: Healing the Body by Overcoming Inertia
--------------------
<v ->Welcome back.</v> Today we're going to look at the solar plexus in the body, how to generate energy and move that energy rapidly to overcome inertia. What does it look like in the body when we have these blocks of excess and deficiency? Well, an excessive third chakra is spilling out of the the third chakra, it's kind of what I call a bully belly. It's the body is rounder here. Or it might be very hard. So take your fingers and even push into the area around your third chakra. Is it soft, is it firm, is it too hard, is it hard to get your fingers underneath your ribs? That's a little way of knowing whether you're too much or too little, that you're collapsed or you're coming out like a bully. We want it to be balanced with good muscle tone to help hold you up. Another aspect of this chakra in the body is that it rules metabolism. That's how we turn matter into energy, that's our metabolic fire. Is your metabolism slow and sluggish? Well, maybe you need a little more fire. Or do you burn everything up right away? Maybe you have too much fire. So how do we tune into this part of the body? You know, people have a lot of blockage here. They may feel that their stomach area is kind of dull and heavy, or they might feel that they can't get a deep breath down into their diaphragm, or they might feel that as soon as tension comes up, their stomach ties up in a knot. Some people feel anxiety, they get butterflies in their stomach, there's so much energy coming through, they don't know what to do with it. Some people feel depressed and there's not enough energy to hold the body upright, and they just collapse. So we're feeling, what is it doing here? What do I feel like in my backbone? What do I feel like in my belly and my digestion? Is it working, do I stay warm? Is my power moving through the body? Do I feel rightfully energized? So if you want to increase your energy, or if you want to get rid of some so you can feel calmer, we'll look at some of our bio-energetic movements of charging and discharging. So when you have the right amount of energy, when you can really be in the center of your charge, then you're in charge. And when you're in charge, you're in charge of your life, and you can move into power and will with more effectiveness. So if you want more energy, you got to stoke your fire. And that's the name of this exercise. So how do you stoke your fire? You bring more fuel in. So inhale and reach out and then make a fist and bring it back to your third chakra. Inhale again, reach out, bring it back, tap your third chakra as you do. Bring it out from in front of you, bring it down from above, bring it up from below, bring it in from the outside. And tap it and pack it into your third chakra, and you'll start to feel more energy. They say that one who cuts their own wood gets warmed twice. This is called the woodchopper, and it's good for releasing energy, especially through the third chakra. So stand with your legs nice and wide. Interlace your fingers and bring them up over your head. Pretend you have an ax in your hand. Take a deep breath, fill up your third chakra, like cat getting ready to pounce. When it's really full, go ah! And take it all the way down in one big, continuous movement. Rise up again and do it some more. And just make a big sound as you take your ax down between your legs and follow through, and that's discharging. You can also say no or stop or even yes if you want to. Whatever is true for you, you can add that to the exercise. So now that you've charged and discharged your third chakra, we're ready to go into our yoga flow. So you can practice some really powerful poses. So get out your mat, get your blocks if you need them, and that's what's coming next. Now with a combination of the first chakra's grounding and the second chakra's moving, we can create some energy in the third chakra. So shake your legs and shake your hips and get a little movement going. Think of your third chakra as a generator of energy, a furnace if you will, for the spiritual fire of prana. Our task here is to channel prana through the body, combining both movement and holding so that it vitalizes the entire body. Press your feet down into the floor, pointing your tailbone to the center between your feet, and lift your arms up overhead, palm to palm, with elbows straight, point up into your fingertips and lengthen. And as you inhale pull up a little higher and arch over to the right, keeping your shoulders in line with your hips. Keep your elbows straight and press from your heels out to your fingertips, and then inhale and come back to center, and exhale and go to the other side. Pull your upper shoulder back so you get a good stretch through the side body and inhale and come back up. Exhale, spread your arms wide, pushing energy out to your fingertips, energizing your palms and taking your hands down to the floor as you bend forward. Inhale halfway up, lengthening the tailbone from the crown. Exhale, root back down. Press your hands on either side of your feet. Take your right leg back into a high lunge, hugging the muscles to the bones, pressing both feet into the mat and drawing them toward each other. Anchoring firmly into your front leg, lift your arms up in a warrior pose. Anchor into both legs, tuck your tailbone down, pull your hips back slightly and lift up higher. Inhale and lift your arms and straighten your arms, spread your fingers wide, energize. And keep that energy as you take your hands down to shoulder level and turn 90 degrees to the right. Make sure your left knee is over your left ankle, your foot is in line with your back foot. Bend your left elbow and take it to your knee. As you lengthen your right arm and bring it up overhead, find a long line between right fingertips and the outside of your right foot. Take a breath in. And now spiral down, take your right hand back down to the floor, hands on either side of your front foot. Take your left foot back to meet your right for a downward dog. And here in downward dog as you fire up both your hands and your feet, anchoring them into the floor, press your belly towards your thighs. Release your third chakra from its cage which I call the ribcage, and let your power free. On the next breath in, move forward into plank pose, shoulders over the hips, legs and hips and knees straight. Press the heels of your hands toward your toes to fire up your third chakra. If this is enough for you, just stay here, or if you need to come down before we get to the next pose, feel free to do so. If you want a little more, we'll do pulsing plank. So with a quick exhale, lift your hips high and lower them. Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha. Nine, 10 for the 10 petals of third chakra, and then either knees, chest, and chin if you're a beginner, or chaturanga push up if you're more advanced. Come down to the floor. And inhale, your crown up. Slide your hands forward so that your elbows are underneath your shoulders, your forearms are flat on the floor. Spread your fingers wide, press your legs together, and pull your hands toward your hips, lifting your shoulders up, rolling them back, lifting the crown, and stretching all that connective tissue in the front of your third chakra. Inhale fully, expand your power, and then come back down. Tuck your toes underneath you, press into your hands, press back up into downward dog. Take a breath here, press your belly toward your thighs. And then inhale, your right foot between your hands. Stay at a high lunge. Anchor into your right foot. And rise up into warrior, lifting your torso straight up and your hands up overhead. Tuck your tailbone a little bit underneath, pull your hips back and lift your chest wide and open. Extend into your fingertips, send that energy out into your hands, spread your fingers wide. Keep that energy in your arms as you open your arms wide, opening your power. Take a light twist to the left. And extend out looking out over your right fingertips. Right knee out over the right ankle. Bending your right elbow and taking it to your right knee, keep your left arm strong and straight as you slowly take it up overhead. And extend it in a straight line as much as you possible can from your left heel all the way up to your left fingertips, opening your ribs up to the ceiling. If you're more advanced and you want to take your hand down to the floor, go ahead and do so. Lengthen, the more you press energy through your limbs, the more energy you have. And then spiral your left hand down to the floor, right hand to the outside of your right foot, both hands on the floor, bring your back foot forward. Utanasana, press your belly toward your thighs. Lengthen from hips to crown, inhale halfway up. And exhale all the way down. Press firmly into your feet and rise back up, all the way to a stand. Inhale your hands back up overhead, touch your palms together, anchor down into your feet. Lift up and breath into your fingertips, and arch over to the left. Lengthening through the right side body. Take a deep breath in, come back to center. On the exhalation, arch over to the right. And then inhale back to center. And continuing to energize all the way through your arms into your fingertips. Imagine your arms are like the rays of the sun as they spread wide out to shoulder height. So inhale up into your fingertips, energize your arms and your fingers. And keep your arms energized as they come out to the side. Feel that you are the radiant sun, and these are the rays reaching all the way to the earth. And with that, bring your hands together over your heart, and maybe touch your palms to your third chakra. And rub in a circle and feel your power, feel your fire, kindling in your belly. Namaste. So one of the everyday movements you can do is to work with the breath. This comes from yoga, called the breath of fire, or Kapalabhati. And it's a rapid diaphragmatic breathing. Just take your hand and place it over your solar plexus, over your third chakra. Relax your breath, just let the breath come in naturally, and then snap your diaphragm back toward your spine and send the air out through your nose. Like that. Then when you relax your diaphragm, the air naturally comes back in, and when you snap it, it comes out again. So do that rapidly, like this. And just notice, do you feel a little bit more energy? This is also good for toning the muscles in front of the third chakra. Another charging breath that you can do, especially if you get a little stiff in the middle, is inhale your belly to the front and take it around the back and stir the caldron. Keep your shoulders over your hips and just try to move this midsection of your body. When you get the hang of it one way, go around the other way. Inhaling when it's front, exhaling to the back. And then as you pause, stop and see, do you feel a little activation in your third chakra? You can use these exercises when you need a little more containment for your power, that's the breath of fire, or a little bit of development of that muscle that holds your third chakra in place. Or when you just want to loosen things up and activate your third chakra. Maybe you want to stimulate your metabolism or wake yourself up. Stir that caldron and see what happens. So for the next 24 hours, while you're working on your third chakra on the body level, practice any of these exercises. The everyday movements, the bio-energetic movements, maybe some of the yoga poses. See what happens, see how your body feels. Write it down, share it with the tribe, share it with each other, let us know what happens. And if you're looking for even more engagement, a reminder to look at your weekly challenge. What are you going to take on to really make a difference in your life? And tomorrow, we'll look at power in the world. How do we hold our power in the larger context?

====================

LESSON 10 – Solar Plexus Chakra: Healing the Spirit by Embracing the Power of Love
--------------------
<v ->Welcome back to looking at</v> how our power works in the world, to the spirit aspect of the power chakra. So, we're embedded in a world with a dysfunctional power paradigm, and I think it's been going on for a long time and we're just getting to the end of this paradigm when the love of power will be replaced by the power of love. But for now we're still dealing with our own powerlessness. We're dealing with a kind of power that's power over, that's part of control. A warrior tribe is going to hold power differently. We're going to find a new way, a new way of what's possible. When we live in dysfunctional power paradigms we all get taught a faulty demonstration of power. We think that power is having control. We think it's dominating other people. That it's owning more money. That it's having more dominion. But that disempowers us because what empowers one is disempowering another. And that just creates more -isms in the world. A warrior tribe is going to have a new model of power, a model of power with. When we have domination of one part over another, whether it's one race over another or one country over another or one gender or even one part of yourself taking power over another, that implies separation. But real power comes when we put things together. When we join together. When we cooperate and collaborate and work together towards something new. But we have to reclaim our own power in order to do that effectively. When we grow up in powerlessness it actually creates a love of power. We say, I don't want to be dominated like that, so I'm going to grow up to have power. And then, we do it just like everybody else and we dominate, and that's not what we want to do. Part of growing up is to take full responsibility. To join our power with each other to empower ourselves as individuals and each other as a collective. We've lost the sense of our power within, of our own sacredness. We've lost contact with that, and instead of seeing outer authority as the source, we need to see inner authority as a resource. Real power is gained by cooperation, integration, and purpose and wholeness. So, one thing about taking your power. It isn't necessarily safe. No one can guarantee that you're going to not be accosted, that you're not going to be challenged, that you're not going to be made wrong. Imagine this story. Let's take an average guy, we'll call him Carl, who wants to go to Central Park in New York and sit on a park bench on a Saturday morning. He's sitting there enjoying the sun when all of the sudden a uniformed guard stands in front of him and blocks the sun. Well, Carl, being a pretty nice guy that doesn't want to make waves just sort of moves over on the park bench and goes back to sitting in the sun. Well, the uniformed guard moves over in front of him. Carl says, excuse me. And the uniformed guard takes his hands and pushes Carl back down on the bench. And Carl, getting a little more angry now, says hey, I was just minding my own business. I was just sitting in the sun. And the guard steps on both of his feet and holds him down. And now Carl's really irate. And the uniformed guard takes a chain out and chains him to the bench. And then, all of the sudden Carl looks around the park and he sees all these people chained to their benches, and they're all scowling at him for making a fuss. So, you have to realize, what would you do in that situation? And does that happen to you? Are you the one that raises an objection at work and everyone else makes you wrong? Well, sometimes the person that rises up and takes things in a new direction, it isn't easy. Not everybody appreciates it. The people who have not claimed their power can make you wrong, so you have to really own your power and your integrity and stand by the responsibility of all the actions that you take. What's the antidote to this powerlessness? Well, we have to live from integrity. We have to have integrity in everything we think and do so that we can stand by, with responsibility, all of our actions. We have to heal the notion of power, that the notion of power is to do good in the world, to help people, to make change. We have to reward that instead of the power over. We have to bring integrity into all our actions. Rainbow warriors operate from a set of values. Power isn't something we do alone, that's the old paradigm. We have to join with others, get support from others, collaborate, cooperate, see what we can create together. Take risks, take a chance, see what happens. It may not be as bad as you think it is. You may be able to step out, and as you do and fly by the seat of your pants, you develop that muscle of power. Create a new definition of power, one that inspires and strengthens rather than diminishing others. Live by that definition. Let your actions be in that definition and inspire others by your actions, set an example. After all, it's up to us to change the world. So, the spirit practice is two parts. One is to define your values. To live from integrity and find out what's really important to you. There's a core values list in your workbook that you can look at to see for reference and inspiration on what your core values would be. Then live in alignment with your value system. Once you identify with your values, then bring your actions into alignment with your value system. Exercise choice and you exercise your will. There's an exercise where you can look at four columns. Something you commit to, an action that you want to take. Third, who does that action benefit? And fourth, can you mark it off as accomplished, that you did it? Column B is your purpose. How does that align with the values that you've chosen? So, in your workbook circle your top five values. Write it down in your journal and use at least one of those to complete the integrity exercise. Share what you're doing with the tribe and inspire someone else, set an example, and lead the world. So, now we've done three full chakras. Tomorrow we go up into the heart.

LESSON 11 – Heart Chakra: Healing the Psyche Through Self-Love & Self-Acceptance
--------------------
<v ->Welcome back to the heart chakra,</v> the center of the chakra system. Today we're going to open our hearts and breathe in the element air and spread our wings and fly. So let's do a quick review about how the lower chakras, provide the foundation. The earth gives us our stability, the water gives us our movement and nourishes and gives life and the fire directs our energy. Now that we have that activation and the third chakra, we can expand into the heart. And the heart is the integrator between the upper chakras that are more transcendent and the lower chakras that are more practical. It's the balance point between them, I call it the great integrator which is why, when our heart gets hurt, we fall apart, we disintegrate. So we're going to explore all these things today as we explore the heart chakra psychology. So what's the purpose of the heart chakra, in this great scheme of things? Well, it's to expand beyond ourselves. The third chakra and our power is basically egocentric and there's a place for that, we need to know who we are and what we're doing in life. But then the upper four chakras get beyond the ego and when we do we open to something greater. So the heart chakra is about love, about connection, about relationship, compassion, forgiveness, acceptance, generosity, and the peace that comes from balance. So, your chakras and your psyche, the developmental stage. We enter the heart chakra stage around four years old, maybe three and a half up till seven as we are integrated, into a social world. After we get the impulse control of third chakra, we're ready to be socialized. We're toilet trained, we know when to be quiet, we can control our actions and not hit somebody because we want a toy. Now we're ready to go to preschool or kindergarten or first grade. We might be old enough to play with our older brothers and sisters if we have any or kids in the neighborhood or maybe even younger brothers and sisters who have been born by then. So we enter this social world of relationship and I believe every child from the moment they're born, wants to be loved. But until we have impulse control, there's not a whole lot we can do about that. But once we have that mind over matter, we can control ourselves in the way that we think will bring us love. So, if your mother likes it when you're really quiet, you don't ask anything, then maybe you learn that's how to get love and you do that lifelong or maybe being helpful, brings you approval or being funny at school or good at sports or really smart. And as we get the feedback from our surroundings of what people like and don't like, we start to develop our personality that comes from the word persona that means mask. And we get this programming from our school, we get it from television, we get it from our brothers and sisters. And for better or worse we create this personality to go out into the world but often it's at odds with the authentic self. We learned that our vulnerability is not safe or okay or we learned that we can't show that we don't know something or that we feel insecure. And so that authentic self kind of gets buried and we get separated from that and we start living in our persona that everybody sees and they don't really know who you are. Well, that's fine when you're in a work situation or out in the street but you don't want to be wearing, your persona all the time, when you're in an intimate relationship. We want intimate relationships to be connected, between our authentic selves. If we're not in our authentic self, we don't trust that love is real. We don't have that real intimacy, it's like, oh well, you only love me because I perform well or I make money or I look good instead of who I really am. And we're all longing to have that deep self met, understood and most of all loved. So what causes blockages in the heart? Well certainly if love is important as we're going through this stage and of course it is all through our childhood and adulthood. I mean we never get over the need for love, any kind of rejection or abandonment or loss of an important loved one like a parent, divorce, death, even moving around and losing your friends and having to start all over again in a new school, these things can impact the heart chakra, we stop trusting that we can just have an open heart and keep our connections with people. Many children are raised with conditional love that is, go to your room and come down when you can be how I want you to be come down when you can be nice. Come down when you can smile and then we're taught, we can only be a certain way to get love and that split from the authentic self is increased. All child abuse is really a travesty of love and even when there is abuse, the parents usually love the children but they're wounded and they don't know what they're doing. But what that teaches the child is, this means love, punishment means love, control means love. And that gets very confusing message about what love is, makes it hard to trust ourselves or hard to trust another and that conditions our adult relationships, gives us a lot of stuff we have to work through as we come into adult relationships, looking for that authentic love. So as a consequence we learn not to trust love and some of that can show up as being judgmental or isolating, having a closed heart where you won't really let people in or being afraid to be vulnerable or maybe not asking for help 'cause you think it's selfish. All these things can happen and we lose intimacy which you can think of as in-to-me-see. When we reveal our sacred insides, our interior to another person and it's heard and witnessed, that creates intimacy, that allows someone to see into you and connect with you and love you and accept you. And if you think about who you love in your life, your friends, your loved ones, do you love them because they're perfect? Probably not, you love them because they're vulnerable, they're human, you've seen their faults, you've seen their vulnerable points and you've seen their gifts as well. And you love them because they're a real person that you feel connected to. So I have a saying that if everyone were perfect, there would be no need for love. We need to love each other in our imperfections and that goes for especially loving yourself. Now one thing about that self love, is it's conditioned by the relationships we have, especially with our parents that become internalized. For instance if you had a very critical parent, then you've probably internalized a critical voice. You don't even need your mother or father there to have that voice come up when you go to do something. And by the same token if you had a really loving parent, then you internalize that relationship and you know how to be good to yourself and others. I have a saying that as the parent was to the child so the mind is to the body. So if your parents abandoned you, you will abandon yourself, if your parents mistreated you, you will mistreat yourself. If your parents respected you, you will respect yourself. So what does this chakra look like, when this stage doesn't go well and we have to avoid or compensate? Well, in the excessive form, the chakra can be what we call codependent which is I'm more in everybody else's business, than I am in mine. That can be poor boundaries, it can be being clingy to another person or jealous, possessive, can be demanding or just meddlesome with other people, it's too much heart chakra, is someone that needs to be the center of attention all the time. So if we compensated for wounding in our heart chakra, we went to the excessive form. We might become codependent which is becoming meddlesome, in other people's business more than your own, that makes for poor boundaries. We might be overly clinging in relationships or jealous and possessive. We might be demanding or we might be very narcissistic and needing to be the center of attention. Oh, everybody love me love me as a way to make up for what we didn't get. On the other hand, some people even from the same wounding, they go to the deficient side of things they go to a void. They say well, I'm not going to trust love, I think I'll just isolate and be in my own space and be withdrawn. They might be a little cold or intolerant of others, maybe they don't relate to others quite as well. They have trouble with compassion, they just might isolate and close down their heart. That would be a deficient heart chakra. And when the heart chakra comes into balance, we're compassionate, we're loving, we're empathetic, we can feel what another person is feeling, we can feel what we are feeling and we're self loving. We just go around with an open heart but not wide open to just anybody, it still has discernment but it's centered and balanced and that love radiates outward. One of the things that compromises an open heart, is when there's too much grief. And grief is a natural response to losing someone you love, when a relationship ends or you get hurt by a friend or you lose a parent or a loved one. And that process of grief is a connection with the self as well as with the person you lost. Now, some people are told oh, you can't show your grief and then it builds up in the heart. Grief is heavy like a stone but the element air of the heart is light. So when we have too much grief there's a heaviness but like all the challenges when you face it, if you really work through your grief and you shed it and you have a good cry and you let it out and release it, the heart lightens. I've seen it so many times as a therapist after a good cry, someone takes a deep breath. They say oh, I can breathe again, I feel lighter, I can love again and that's because we know, as the great integrator, the heart can only stay open, when there's so much room and grief takes up some of the room. Like taking up room on your hard disk, we have to shed that to make more room for love. We know that if we take too many more hits, we're going to close down so we become very protective. Grief helps, releasing the grief, helps the heart open and fly. And the gift of releasing your grief, in the lighter heart is that you can love again. You have compassion for others 'cause you know what it is to suffer. We all have suffering, we all have sadness, when we share that something very profound, happens between people, a really deep connection intimacy. Healing your psyche. So how do we heal these wounds? We have to learn self love and acceptance it begins at home. I like to say that we need to develop, a healthy ecology of the heart. So let me tell you what I mean by that, in nature when have complex ecosystems, they have a balance. But when we wipe out everything except one crop, then it's easy for some kind of bug or condition to come in and just wipe out that crop. So in the same way, if we only have one inside of a personality, we're really living in our persona and that gets hit, we don't have the resilience of the heart. But when we have the ecology of the heart, meaning that you've integrated your vulnerable inner child, you've integrated your loving parent, you've integrated your rebellious teenager, you've integrated your light and shadow, your masculine and feminine aspects, then you have all these different aspects of your heart, integrated into one being and you have much more balance and resilience in relationship and you no longer think that the other person, is going to complete you, you're complete in and of yourself and you love from that place. So the exercise for today is about loving yourself and forgiving yourself in those places that you typically judge. There's a set of questions in your workbook that you can go over but it's about, starting with what you love about yourself, looking at what you most judge? Looking at where that trait came online? Where it began, did it begin when you were five years old, seven years old, two years old? And when what was that trait trying to do? What were the forces acting on you at the time? What was the pressure, acting on that little five year old boy or girl? And once you can see that it's easier to forgive that part and make room for it in your heart. So be sure and look at your workbook and do some journal writing around these questions. For medium or full engagement, develop the chakras skill set of replacing judgment with understanding and compassion. Notice when you're critical of yourself and others how is that trait that you're criticizing in someone else, possibly rejected in you? Maybe they're doing something you weren't allowed to do? What are the healthy roots of that trait and how can you reclaim that? Now one thing I've really learned in my years as a therapist, I get people's stories and when I hear their story, I'm amazed that this person is even functioning or that they can keep a job together or they're not drug addicted or something. But someone who doesn't know their story, might be judgmental. They might say, geez that person is socially awkward or, that person is uncomfortable. If they knew their story, if they understood, they would have more compassion. So judgment is what we do when we don't have understanding. Know that everybody you meet has a story, everybody you meet has been through something difficult, everybody you meet is doing the best they can. So as you work through these questions and the heart chakra, share your vulnerability with the tribe and let's make relationships among each other, open our hearts, be in touch and connect. Tomorrow we're going to take this into the body, working with the breath and opening the chest.

====================

LESSON 12 – Heart Chakra: Healing the Body by Balancing Your Heart
--------------------
<v ->Welcome back to Healing the Heart.</v> Today we go into the body. We work with the breath as the element air, and we open the chest. Because in the heart chakra, we're not talking so much about the physical heart. We're talking about the whole heart area, the lungs, the chest, the upper back, even the arms where we reach out to someone else. So, what does this chakra look like in the body when it's blocked? Well, if it's deficient, the heart tends to collapse. We see a lot of people where the heart moves to the back of the body, the shoulders round. I used to look like this as a kid. It took me lots of years of practicing yoga to get my chest lifted and my shoulders back. And when you can do that, you have a lot more room to breathe. On the other hand, some people have a puffed-up military chest that's very rigid and stiff, and that's more of an excessive heart chakra. But remember, even an excessive chakra is compensating for a wound. Doesn't mean we're good at it. It doesn't necessarily mean we're terribly loving. It means we're compensating for something that we didn't get enough of or something we got that we didn't want. So, how do you listen to your heart? Take a moment and close your eyes and see if you can hear or feel your heartbeat. Just tune in to that heart has been beating as long as you've been alive, even in the womb. Notice your quality of breath. Take a breath in and out. Is it easy or is it difficult to take a deep breath? Or maybe difficult to release your breath all together? As we come into the ease of the heart the breath becomes easier. And one of the keys in the body here is to soften. When you hug somebody, you want them to be soft and yielding. You don't want them to feel like a mannequin. So, as we soften our boundaries, we want to soften our muscles, we want to soften our stance, soften our chest, soften our position on something, and as we soften, those edges can meet and have intimacy. Now, in the heart chakra, as with any other, charging is basically receiving something from outside and bringing it to your interior, so pulling your arms in, taking in love and nurturing from others. Even that can be taking in a movie, taking in a book, taking in a walk in the park. You're nourishing yourself, you're receiving. And then discharging is the releasing. It might be crying, it might be speaking what's in your heart, it might be giving to others, it might be releasing that grief that we say is one of the challenges of this chakra. So, as we release, we are discharging. And, again, when we discharge, we make more room for more love to come in. A quick way you can do some charging for your heart chakra is what I call the winged breath. Bring your hands up to your shoulders and lift your chest, take your shoulders back, and keep your elbows at about shoulder height. I see a lot of people do this and they start to droop, but we want to keep it high, keep the shoulders back. And then you're going to inhale to one side, exhale to the other, and twist around. Inhale through the nose, exhale through the mouth. And this lets you let go in the upper back at the same time that you are bringing breath in and charging your chest. And of course, once you've done one side. So, now I'm inhaling to the left, exhaling to the right. When you're done, just pause, close your eyes, and feel the effects. You may feel a little tingling, you may feel the presence of charge or energy, and it's sort of like someone opened a window in your heart chakra. So, the breath of joy is, in some ways, both charging and discharging, but it allows you to release from your heart. So, it's three inhalations and one exhalation, and you stand for this. And as the first inhalation is bringing your hands forward, bending your knees, swinging them up, the next inhalation is bringing your hands to the side, and the third inhalation is bringing your hands all the way up and then one big exhale as you bow forward. And so now that we have charged and discharged our heart chakra a little bit, we're going to take this into a yoga flow. So, get out your mat and find your strap. If you don't have a strap you can use a belt or a necktie or even a rolled up towel, and we'll do some heart chakra opening. Stand on the front of your mat and take a deep breath. Feel the breath come into your heart. Consider a quality of the heart that you want to bring into your practice, generosity, forgiveness, acceptance, abundance, peace. In focusing on that, inhale your hands up over your head, interlace your fingers, and bring them to the back of your neck. Spread your elbows wide and lift your heart up to the sky. Take a deep breath in and then on the exhalation separate your hands and bring them behind your back as you stand, interlacing them once again. Roll your shoulders back and, if possible, straighten your arms and move your wrists away from your spine as you lift your sternum up. Can you do a little back bend here? As you lift up your sternum and open your heart. And now, come back to standing, lift your hands behind you, and bow forward, standing yoga mudra. Allow your hands to fall where they will and melt the back of your heart. Release your hands to either side of your feet, inhale halfway up. Hold the breath full and while you're holding the breath come back down and hug your torso to your knees. Let your breath out when you need to. Hands on either side of your feet and take your left foot back to a low lunge, meaning your knee is down. Finding your stability by pressing into your right foot and drawing toward your left knee, lift your torso up and interlace your fingers behind your back once more, opening your chest and reaching your fingers toward your back foot. Lift the heart. As you release your hands, take them back down to the mat and bring your right knee next to your left knee for table position. Shoulders over the wrists, hips over the knees, and we'll do a little cat-cow breathing. Inhale your crown and your tailbone up, rolling your shoulders back, pressing the heels of the hands toward the knees to open the heart. Exhale, press the breath out of you. Round into your own self with love, pressing the hands away from the knees. And a few more times. Inhale, lift the crown and the tailbone, exhale, round. Riding on the breath. The next time you inhale, come to a flat back and keep your hips exactly where they are with your thighs straight up and down as you slowly walk your hands forward and bring your chest and chin down toward the mat. If this pinches your shoulders, you can always take your hands a little wider. And take a deep breath here and imagine melting the heart. Make sure your hips are over your knees and it's a posture of surrender. Allow your heart to melt. Use the key of softness in this pose. And then inhale your crown back up, walk your hands back to center underneath your shoulders, and move your left hand slightly toward the center of your mat and lift your right arm up overhead. Opening the chest. Press firmly into the left hand to stretch across the chest and reach up into the right fingertips. Reach high and look at your fingertips and then bend your right elbow and weave your hand between your knees and your left arm, taking your right shoulder to the midline of the mat and your left arm overhead. Feel free to play with that left arm, bringing it overhead or bringing it up into the air or even wrapping it around and grabbing the inside of your thigh, if that's available to you. And then bring your left hand back down to the floor. Press up into table position once again. Bring your right hand more toward the center of the mat, and lift your left arm up into the air. Press into your right hand more firmly to press across the chest, open the heart, lift up into the fingertips, lengthen from tailbone to crown. And then bend your left elbow, weaving your hand between your knees and your right hand, taking your left shoulder to the floor and your right arm overhead. Play with that right arm if you want to. You can lift it up perpendicular to the floor, you can wrap it around your torso and tuck it into your thigh, whatever feels good to you to give your chest a good, open stretch. Press into the outside of the left arm to get more twist. And then bring your left hand back down to the floor and press back up into table position. From here, come up to kneeling position with your torso upright. And here you may want to use blocks along the side or you can tuck your toes under and raise your heels for a camel pose. So, remember when we interlaced our fingers behind our back? Begin with that, just to get the opening in the chest and the heart. Lift the chest, and maybe this is all you do if you're a beginner. If you want to go further, you can reach for the blocks or for your heels. Anchoring the tailbone down between your knees, lift up on your ribs, open the heart, and find the surrender in the pose. Inhale and come back up and take your hands back down to the floor. Shoulders over the wrists, tuck your toes underneath you and press up into downward dog. Press firmly into the hands and melt the heart. Take a deep breath here. Inhale your left foot forward between your two hands, take your right hand... Take your right knee down for a low lunge. Find your stability here by pressing into your front leg and rise up, interlacing your fingers behind your back, opening the heart. Release your hands and bring them up into cactus arms, opening your heart further, spreading your fingers wide, and taking a deep breath. And then bring your hands back down to the floor. Bring your right foot forward next to your left. Bow down toward your knees. And release the heart, soften, lengthen, be at peace. Remember the heart chakra concept that you chose to bring into this practice. Bring it into your heart and then on the next inhalation, rise back up. Lift your arms up overhead, bring your palms together, slide them down your core. Interlace your fingers behind your neck. And then rise up, bring your hands up overhead. Slide your hands down. Press them together over your heart in Anjali mudra prayer position. What is the prayer for your heart? Take a deep breath in and smile. And now that you're done with your yoga flow, let's look at some every day movements you can do in just a few seconds or a few moments. One is just to open your hands up, take your shoulders back, in a kind of ain't it wonderful feeling. So, that just lifts the heart. Just look around at any kind of magic or miracle you see around you and just, oh, ain't it wonderful? Feel how that opens your heart. And the other one is very simple. Several times in your day, especially when you're busy or hurrying somewhere, just take a moment to stop, take a deep breath into your heart, and lift the corners of your mouth toward your ears, smile. So, for the next 24 hours, practice tuning into your body, feel and use one of the techniques that we've been teaching, either the charged movements, the everyday movements, or maybe one or two of the yoga poses, and breath into your heart. Tomorrow, we will go into the more spiritual aspects of the heart chakra and bringing love into the world.

====================

LESSON 13 – Heart Chakra: Healing the Spirit by Serving Others
--------------------
<v ->Welcome back to a topic today</v> that is near and dear to my heart. And that's taking the global perspective of the heart chakra. We're going through a huge paradigm shift on this planet. I call that moving from the love of power to the power of love. And I see that humanity's evolution actually mirrors the process of the chakras. That we started as cave dwellers working close to the earth, we learned to build ships and have agriculture, and through farming, we could expand. And we came into the power paradigm, where everything was organized according to a hierarchy, someone on top telling other people what to do. And that's been our paradigm for quite some time, I think about 5,000 years since the beginning of cities and civilization. So now we're moving to a new organizing principle for humanity. Instead of being organized by power over, as I mentioned in the third chakra, we're working with power with. We can cooperate, we can collaborate, we can have more equal relationships and come to a new organizing principle of the heart that I call the power of love. We are all going through this as an initiation into the adulthood of humanity. And initiations by nature are difficult. They're challenging. That's why we're on a quest to face these challenges so we can become rainbow warriors and warriors of the heart. That means we stand in our power to protect the heart. To stand for truth and justice, to stand for equal treatment of people across races and cultures and genders and creeds. That we stand for cooperation, egalitarianism, compassion. And we look in our own lives at what we can give instead of what we can get. I mean, think of what happens when you walk into a party and you scan who's there. Do you look at, oh, there's that person, I could give them my business card, and maybe I could get some work out of them. Or there's that person, I need to impress them, and see what I can get from them. Or do you look at, oh, there's someone sitting alone in the side, maybe they need somebody to talk to. Or there's someone that looks like they could use a hug or really use a listening. Do you look at what you can give or what you can get? So rainbow warriors are also warriors of the heart. We seek to find a way to serve. We seek to help humanity evolve. We seek to restore justice. To take care of the environment, to take care of each other, and create a new world that I call the waking of the global heart, a new organizing principle. As we enter this new organizing principle, we move from a chain of command to a web of connection. We move from ego to eco, caring about our environment. We move from greed to green. And we move from an organizing principle based on domination and control to one based on cooperation and collaboration. We move from self to service. And from conflict to peace. These are just a few of the shifts in organizing principle that we are all helping to birth on this planet right now. And I invite you to join that movement. So what's our spirit practice for waking the global heart? I could say many things, being generous, learning to accept, practicing compassion. But one of the chief things is caring. So whatever we care for improves. If we care for our children, they thrive. If we care for our garden, it blooms. If we care for our car, it lasts. If we care for ourselves, we are better vessels for making change in the world. So what does it really mean to care for something? It's to consider it, to look at what it needs, to see what would make it better. Caring for your children is seeing that they're fed and they're loved and they're supported. Caring for your garden means that it's watered and weeded. We do what it takes to care for things. Now you might say in this world today with so many things wrong that you get what we sometimes call caring fatigue. Oh my goodness, it's the rain forests, and it's the people, and it's the oceans, and it's the climate, and it's the economy, and all these things to care about, which one? I like to quote Andrew Harvey who says that, "Whatever is most breaking your heart, "that's where your service lies." If you wake up in the night worrying about the rain forest, or sex-trafficked children, or the rape culture, or the people who don't have enough to eat, that's where your service lies. And when you do that service you may find the heart really sprouts wings. There's an uplift when we get beyond ourselves and give to something greater. We become something greater. So the exercise for today is that sometime in the next 48 hours, do something unexpected as a favor for someone else. You know, mow your next door neighbor's lawn, or buy some flowers for somebody at work and just put it on their desk anonymously. Give a little bit more to a beggar on the street. You know, instead of givin' him 50 cents, give him 20 bucks. And see what that feels like in your heart. Pay somebody's coffee forward when you're standing in line and they're behind you. Just see how that lifts your heart. And if you're a person that has caring fatigue, in other words, you go, "Oh, I do things for other people "all day long, and I'm exhausted," then do that same act for yourself. Buy yourself a little goodie, take yourself out on a date, have a little extra sleep in the morning, and do some unexpected favor for yourself. See what that feels like. So love begins at home in our own hearts. When our heart is filled, we radiate it outward. And that makes love contagious. Wouldn't that be a nice thing to catch from each other? That's how it spreads. And tomorrow we go into review and integration.

LESSON 13 - Meditation: [Bonus] Heart Chakra Meditation

Heart chakra meditation. Close Your eyes and bring your attention to your inner world. Find your alignment by pressing your roots down into the earth and lifting your crown up to the heavens. Acknowledging that vertical core that runs between earth and heaven, through the sacred center of you. The core upon which all the chakras are aligned and in the center of that core, midway between above and below is the heart. The heart chakra, whose name is Anhata. Anhata like the rhythm of the heartbeat. An take a moment to feel your own heartbeat beating at the deep center of you every moment. And as you focus on the area of your heart, take in a deep breath and feel your chest expand. Your shoulders lift. And then let the breath out softly ha all the way out. And another breath in to this glorious air. For air is the element of the heart chakra. We take it in, we let it out. And peace and balance. Allow your breath to deepen, taking in even more air, more expansion, more uplifting. And on the out breath, let everything soften. Let your face soften. Let your shoulders soften your hands. Let your chest soften soft like a feather, soft like a pillow, soft like a baby's skin. We soften the boundary between inside and outside, and we allow the breath to come in and out as if it was breathing through every pore in your skin. Inhaling love in with a breath and exhaling love. Back out. A simple give and take. Always another breath there to take. Always one to let go of. And an another breath in its wake. And as we take in that breath, it's the breath of the universal. It has no edges or boundaries, no differences. It accepts. It just simply is nothing to do, nowhere to go, but just to be, To love, to open. Everything around you is in relationship. Everything is giving and taking in perpetual balance, so much is provided for you. Are we grateful enough for all that is given to us? Open your heart to the gratitude of even just this precious breath. It fills your heart with love and lets it out with peace, connection, Fullness, Acceptance. Accepting yourself just as you are. A perfect being held in a web of unconditional love, like a mother holds a child. Even when the child stumbles, she knows he will walk. And this unconditional love holds you even in your trials, holds you in compassion, holds you like a baby, knowing that you are finding your way, finding your way to love, to open, to forgive, to soften, and to accept all the blessings that love can offer.

LESSON 14 – Week 2 - Q&A Call with Anodea Judith

Hi, Rainbow Warriors. Good morning, good afternoon, or good evening, whatever the case might be for you. I am Alex, and on behalf of the Mindvalley team, I would like to welcome you to your chakra healing Q &A coaching call. We have a great session prepared for you today. We have very interesting topics that we'll be covering, belonging mainly to the second week of your quest, where we learn all about chakras three and four, the solar plexus and the heart chakra. So this call is going to focus mainly on these two chakras, and I believe you'll get a lot of great insights from our session today. That being said, and without further ado, let's welcome our wonderful teacher on this journey, Anadea Chidit. Hi, Anadea. Namaste, everyone. Welcome to this wonderful day in many parts of the world. It's the celebration of Easter. which, you know, in the old pre -Christian days was Astara. It meant the fertility time. And in the Northern Hemisphere, at least, it's a time when life is coming back to life, waking up. So let's celebrate what's waking up in us. Let's begin with a little meditation, closing our eyes, going in, and doing what I call the hookup. which is the way to begin any chakra meditation. And the hookup means that we hook our roots down into the earth, pressing our sitting bone down, our tailbone to the back of the chair, firming up our base, and we lift our crown up to the heavens. So we're hooking roots down and crown up, one to the earth, one to spirit and everything above. And we're finding that line of energy between above and below that goes through the very center of each and every one of us. That's one of the things that a rainbow warrior does is they live in their core. And one of the purposes of all this chakra work is to clear out what gets in the way that keeps us from being able to live in our core. As you push your roots down and lift your crown up, feel that line of energy between them. In Sanskrit, it's called the sushumna, and it's where the chakras are aligned. And as you feel that core, you might say inside, I am in here. Feel the core is the I, the self. And you can say that in whatever language is native to you. I am in here. Meaning you're in the body. And I am right here. I am here present in this moment. This moment of awakening. All over the world, people are awakening. And as Easter symbolizes things coming back to life, notice what inside you is coming back to life. What is awakening from a slumber? Or what do you want to have awaken? What are you trying to wake up in yourself? And imagine that sun from above is shining down into your chakras. Chakras can also be called lotuses, which is a kind of flower. And as that sun shines down, it gives you infinite energy. And the flowers just drink up that sunlight and they open. So see your first chakra opening in red. Four petals. The four directions from wherever you are at the moment. The second chakra opening. Six petals of orange. The water element. The third chakra opening. One of the chakras of this week. Ten petals in a golden yellow. And the heart opening in a beautiful green. Twelve petals of the heart chakra. and feel us all blooming together in a garden and just as we know we can walk down a sidewalk or a road and see cracks in the road where plants are coming up that even if you're in a place where it's difficult to hold this consciousness people around you might not be you're one of those plants that is growing in the crack is putting roots down connecting to heaven And we are creating a garden on this planet of awakening imaginal cells. And with that, I salute all of you again. Namaste. That was very beautiful. As I opened my eyes, I see another 30 people joined us in these last five minutes. So welcome to everybody that joined during our meditation. That being said, let's go to our list of questions. And we'll start off with the pre -submitted questions that we have for this call. Question number one from Carla. If we have a deficient and excess energy in the same chakra, how can we balance it through yoga, charging and discharging poses? Do we have to do them both at the same time? So here's a way to think of the charging and discharging and the excess and deficiency. If you're in a... room indoors and you have the heat on and outdoors it's really cold all you have to do is open the window and the cold air comes in and the warm air goes out and after a while they become even so doing the yoga is like opening the window as we relax and open a part of the body that gateway is open and the excess charge can begin to leave or if it's deficient that charge can start to come in so a lot of what we're doing is just opening the door to your chakras opening the gates so they can start to self -regulate now some of us may know oh i really feel so tight and so full in this chakra i need to do a little more emphasis on the releasing than the taking in or i feel really empty in this chakra. I need to take in and keep it. So if I have clients that are undercharged, I get them charged up, maybe a little bit of discharge just to get it flowing. And then I say, but not too much. I want you to go home and keep that in your system. And if I have clients that are really overcharged, I don't want to let them get too charged. So that's where it's different. We just have a little bit of nuance how we think of it as we really learn this material. that, oh, today I need to be charged up. And so I wouldn't do a third chakra charging exercise right before I go to bed. I might do it in the morning when I'm trying to wake up and get going. I wouldn't do a big discharging exercise in the morning unless I was waking up really anxious or something. You know, so I think the proof is in the pudding. As you try out these exercises, see what makes you feel more balanced. You know, you do some charging and go, oh yeah, now I feel more alive. Or you do the charging and you go, gee, I feel jittery and I can't sit still and too much is coming up for me. Then you need to do some discharging. And that's why in each chakra, we're giving you both. And you can try both and see what feels good to you. Great. On a similar topic, a question from Kimberly. How do we close our chakras after a session? Yeah, so sometimes people can feel too open. And I notice after a workshop when people are about to go home and they've been... all in this intimate space together opening their chakras or they go to even a yoga class or a deep meditation and they get opened up and then you go out on the street where it's noisy and you know we need to close down a little bit so a really simple way in the meditation this morning we saw petals and you can even see this some in my banner in the back each chakra has different petals imagine those petals closing up a little bit And that's also what some flowers do at night. I live in California where the California poppies, they close up every night and they open up when the sun comes out. So we can kind of close up. And I even have a meditation I do from the top down at the end of the day where you... Think about what did I, what spiritual awakenings did I have today? And then you close that up so you can keep it. And what beauty did I see today? And you close that just like we close our eyes at the end of the day. And what did I talk about today? You know, what great conversations did I have? Or maybe I listened to some great music and then you close that up so you can keep it. And where did I love today? Oh yeah, that interchange was very loving. Where did I receive love? Or where did I give love? Where did I feel my power? where did I have pleasure today and where did I really feel grounded in each one you just fold up the petals a little so they're protected between in and out and that doesn't mean you're closing it it just means you're containing it you're making a boundary you have mentioned a couple of times that by getting rid of blocks we might also be releasing Kundalini I'm not familiar enough to understand what releasing it actually means would you please elaborate Well, kundalini is a force of energy associated, it comes from the yoga tradition where the chakras come from. And it is a concentrated life force. So we have life force going through us all the time, all over the body, through the meridians, through what yoga calls the nadis, which is the subtle currents in the body, and through the chakras. part can get really focused like a laser and kundalini comes from the word kundala which means coiled and and rising so it's a coiled circuit uh the a snake is said coiled three and a half times around the first chakra and when stimulated she because it's kundalini shakti is her whole name the shakti is the goddess of the life force arises and pierces each chakra in turn. And this is the theory of kundalini yoga. Now, for many people, kundalini rising is not a pleasant experience. It kind of goes through the force. It takes them by the, you know, it just grabs a hold of them and they can't sleep or they can't eat. I've had a lot of people come to me over the years with difficult kundalini risings. And what I find is their lower chakras aren't open. And so the Kundalini doesn't have any ground. It doesn't have any anchor. So this course is not about stimulating Kundalini because I don't feel that's a safe thing to do until your chakras are more open and balanced. But as you open and balance your chakras, you make room for this current to rise. And what I find is the current is a little more gentle when we have opened and balanced and cleaned things out. It doesn't have so many blocks to hit. Because remember, when charge hits a block, it's really uncomfortable. So when Kundalini hits a block, it's even more uncomfortable. So I wouldn't worry about Kundalini too much. If it happens, go for the ride, but also breathe and ground. Wonderful. Our next question is a common question that we get in other courses as well, in one shape or another. This one comes from Francesca. How do you find the balance between the spiritual work and the relaxation and pleasure? How do we prevent becoming addicted to the spiritual journey instead of love for oneself and the world? Well, I don't see them as different. So I think that one of the mistakes of spirituality over the years has been that it's anti -pleasure. It's supposed to be very serious work and it's not fun and you can't relax. I think that's a separation. That one of the things about the chakras is it connects all this into one unity. So being spiritual and meditating is not... against pleasure and pleasure is not against that that we are integrating these two so i think it's really important to know that sometimes when we're in pleasure we are being spiritual sometimes when we're meditating that is an extreme pleasure even though we're just sitting very still and counting our breath and What I do see, and I think that Francesca's question is hinting at this, is some people do what we call a spiritual bypass. They just want to go up here and meditate and be spiritual without working it out in the lower chakras, without cleaning out the basement. And then I think we get disconnected from ourselves and from the earth into some kind of principle that some teacher says you should do this. but you're disconnected from yourself. And I've seen people hurt themselves in yoga. I've seen people do things they later regretted because some teacher told them to, and they weren't really thinking and staying connected. So what we're trying to do as spiritual warriors is stay connected to ourselves, connected to higher principles, connected to each other and the world all at the same time. Wonderful answer. I see a follow -up question here. How do we know when it is better to take care of ourselves rather than giving to others? How much should we be devoted to our own evolution rather than giving others in need, for example? Well, I used to struggle with that a lot. And when I was first building my career, I had four children at home and I was working hard and I had clients and I was traveling the world teaching and writing my books. And I was kind of a big giver and I got depleted a lot. And I was working, talking to a friend about this and she handed me an empty cup and she said, here, how much can you give me from this? Can you give me a sip of water? And I went, nope, it's empty. She said, you cannot give when you're empty. And it was sort of hard for me to justify, you know, going off and taking care of myself. But I found in order to be sustainable. over the years. And I'm not young anymore. I have to take my time off. I have to do things I enjoy that renew me. I have to take care of myself. And then I actually can get in front of a crowd of people and give more because I'm giving from a place of fullness rather than emptiness. And I find that when I do feel full, I can't help but give. I just want to give it out. So think of that, you know, just Is your cup empty or is it getting low? Same way in a car, you know, you take your car in and they check the fluid levels. And sometimes our fluid levels are, are we rested? Or, you know, are we tired? Are we hungry? Are we in some kind of emotional state or are we lonely? And hungry, angry, lonely, tired, that says halt, H -A -L -T, which means stop. So check your fluid levels. Are you hungry? Are you upset or angry? Are you lonely? Take care or tired. Take care of those things. And then you have a fuller cup to give from. Do men and women have the same chakra system? And if yes, does that mean that the same exercises apply to both men and women? Is there actually no difference in our approaches whatsoever? Well, I think we have... know, the same set of chakras, just like men and women have two eyes and a nose and a mouth and shoulders and hips and whatnot. And there's just a little bit of difference between men and women. I think in the same way, we have the same chakra system. But I think that probably more due to cultural overlays than anything else, men tend to be stronger or live in certain chakras more than others. And women tend to be. in certain chakras more than others so i think it's the way we operate like women might be more intuitive and of course that doesn't mean men are not intuitive but we have maybe more permission more permission to be emotional more permission to be in the heart and so women tend to be a little stronger in emotions and compassion and intuition than some men, you know, in general. And men tend to be stronger in their third chakra, power going out and getting things done, often, you know, communicating. I notice in a group of people, if it's half men and half women, the men do more talking. Men tends to be stronger in the thinking, analytical. So I think I call them the yin and the yang chakras. So two, four, and six, even numbers, that's more the yin. And one, three, five, and seven is more the yang. And yet as men and women, we need to be in all our chakras. We just need to know, oh, you know, as a man, I didn't have permission to cry. So maybe I need to let that up. You know, as a woman, I didn't have permission to take my power. Maybe I need to do that, or I didn't have permission to speak up. So that in that way, we're balancing the chakras not only in themselves, but among all the other chakras. The initial first week was great, but I started getting some headaches and I saw in the chat a lot of other similar symptoms like coughing. I read a few times. Does it mean I am experiencing some extra energy which I cannot get out of my body? What are your thoughts on this situation? Okay, so as we release blocks in our chakras, and I know that people are doing the emotional work because I see it posted on the Facebook page, you know, and it's like there's tremendous energy in there. Just go like this if you found some of that energy as you have, you know, yeah, see, this is called a twinkle. This is me too. We can all do this and see each other. Tremendous energy gets released and it'll get released and it'll move up. through the chakras until it hits the next block. And that's different for everybody. For some people, they release their second chakra and it moves up to the heart or it moves up to the throat, or maybe it moves through or it can't get into those chakras and it goes up into the head. So what we're having is an excess of charge and it is hitting the next block and the headache may mean, oh, I can't open this up. You know, this is still... We're not at the upper chakras yet. So what I would say is that's an instance where you might want to look at the discharging exercises and get rid of some of that energy because you haven't dissolved enough blocks to really absorb it yet. So in the meantime, get rid of it. It'll make you feel a little more comfortable. If it goes up into the head. I think meditation is the best thing for that. That's coming into the upper chakras. So just be really quiet and still and take a 15, 20 minute meditation that tends to open the upper chakras and things will balance out. I noticed that if I skip my meditation for a couple of days because I'm busy, I start to get achy right across my shoulders. And then when I meditate, it's like that, oh, it hasn't been able to be processed up here. So the meditation will just take that right off my shoulders. I find it hard to really feel physical joy within myself. I wonder if you could speak to how I can support the practice of feeling joy and practices on giving myself joy. So in the heart chakra, we talked about the challenge being grief. Grief is heavy and it sits on the heart chakra like a stone where the element air of the heart chakra is light. So what we want is a lightness. So joy is the opposite of grief. And what I find, and this is from, you know, decades of sitting with clients and teaching is that when the grief is really released fully, and I don't just mean a little tear dripping out of your eyes, but, oh, you know, just really getting it out of your system. At first, the person is just kind of like, oh, exhausted, because that's a big discharge. It comes up and they feel joy. So joy is what happens when the energy within us is free to travel through the body without hitting blocks. And so by releasing our emotional charge, we make room for joy. And it is the kind of antidote. for grief now practices he also asked about practices for cultivating joy aside from just releasing these blocked emotions one is gratitude every day before you go to sleep make a list of some things you were grateful for that day you know if you can't can't find anything you're not looking, you know, just that your fact that you're alive, that you have a bed to sleep in, that you have food to eat, that someone smiled at you. I mean, just anything to be grateful. See the good in your life, which is about being grateful. And another thing is if you're struggling and you're having a hard time or you have, you know, repetitive thoughts, oh, I'm such a bad person or this kind of thing that comes up. Here's a little trick. to get unhooked from them be amused go oh there i go again i've had those thoughts before you know jim quick who's a mind valley teacher says he calls them ants automatic negative thoughts it's like oh there goes those ants and here's a great mudra a mudra is a hand motion for dealing with something for dealing with those negative repetitive thoughts it goes like this So, you know, in America, that's like a, I'm not going to pay attention to you. And it's a way of making fun of something and being light. And so being amused at yourself is a good way to get unhooked and be in the higher part of yourself rather than that part that gets caught in a repetitive loop. That was fantastic. Our next question, let's see here on the list from, let's go with this one from Karen. Would you give us your definitions of what are emotions and what are feelings? Yeah, I talked about this a little in the second chakra, and this is really more of a second chakra question. Here's the way I think of it. Sensations, like, oh, you've got a creeping sensation in your arm or your hair is rising, you know, and you're... is rising or you're hot or whatever. Those are like the words. Feelings are like the sentences that those words make. And emotions are the story. So maybe I walk into a party and I have, you know, or I'm on my way to a party and I have a certain sensation. Maybe it's excitement. Maybe it's nervousness. And then at I have more of those sensations and it kind of becomes a sentence. Oh, I'm going to a party. There's going to be a lot of people there. And then you have a story like, oh, I'm going to walk in and everyone's going to know that, you know, I'm not doing well today or everyone is going to say hello or lots of people are going to be there that I like. I'll be loved or I don't know anybody there. I don't know how to interface. So that's the story. And feel it. They all build together. So feelings are more sensate -oriented, and the story, of course, has to do with our stories of our past. That the things that will trigger us emotionally are the things that are similar to what we had in the past. If you were abandoned in the past, you're going to create a story of abandonment or be more likely to. If you were scared in the past, you're more likely to create a story that, oh, this isn't safe, so therefore I'm going to feel afraid. And what I encourage people to do is unhook from the story and just feel the charge. That's your life force. And go, oh, I'm going to a party. I have some charge in my body. Where is it? Oh, it's in my third chakra and it's coming up into my heart or it's pushing up against my throat. And just to notice and really begin possessing your own charge, owning it and saying, hey, life force, hello, welcome into my body. Instead of making it right or wrong or trying to control it, just allow that to be. Because what we're after here is reclaiming our aliveness in each and every chakra. Now, around the same concept of emotions, upvoted question here from Miranda. When trying to identify the feelings and when they might have first started, as in the age or the stage, if we cannot find this, How important is it to keep delving in or to keep coming back until we find it, all of this in order to heal the chakra? Yeah, that's a great question. And, you know, as I work with people, sometimes memories are so young that you can't find them. And sometimes they're repressed and you can't find them. It's not necessary to know every little detail about what happened to you or to make the connection. that I'm like this because this happened. It's not necessary. It helps. It's satisfying. It's like, oh, then. And what I really find is making that connection takes people out of shame. They go, oh, well, now I don't need to be ashamed that I'm so shy. Given all the things that happened to me, no wonder I'm shy. And that's part of that exercise we did in the heart chakra of what do you judge about yourself? But really what we're doing is we're working with the charge. We're working with where it is. And whatever happened to you in the past, that's done and over with. What's with you in the present is the pattern you created in yourself to deal with your past. So the way you shut down or the way you jumped out of yourself or the way you distorted yourself in some way, that's what's here in the present. So if we can heal that, if we can... discharge those blocked energies or we can charge up where we were empty or we can open a part of the body that got armored and tense by doing the yoga then we're dealing with it and we may we may not have to know where it came from we're just working with the charge and we're working what's in the in the present you know it's like if you came out to your car on the street and there was a big dent in it It doesn't really matter whether a tree fell on it or somebody hit it or it doesn't really, you know, if you just find it that way, you have to fix it. And the body shop will fix it the same way, regardless of whether you did it on purpose or somebody hit you or whatever. So we just have to fix it and heal it. Very true. Around the same notion of blockages, I see a question here from Shashuati. It says, my question is regarding the heart chakra. I know I have blockages in my heart chakra. If I continue to do the yoga, will it be sufficient to open or unblock my chakra? You know, people always say if I meditate or I do this or I tap three times or whatever, will that be enough? And I can't answer that because we're all different. You know, what I would say is the yoga opens the door. You have to walk through the door. The yoga opens the door to the heart. It stretches the pectoral muscles across the chest. It opens the shoulders so you can lift your chest up instead of having it collapse. It allows you to make more room to breathe. It starts to alter your physiology so that the door to the heart is more open. But as far as being more loving or accepting love better or loving yourself more, you have to walk through the door. Yoga can't do that for you. It can only open the way. Do we do both the charging and discharging body movements for the heart chakra as well? In fact, do we do both charging and discharging for all of the chakras every day? Or do we do either one of them as deemed necessary? What would be some guidelines for this? Well, in a way, and we've been talking about that a bit, that charging and discharging moves energy through the body and it opens the door. over time you move you you get balanced but in some ways saying do we do charging and discharging sort of like saying, do we both inhale and exhale? Well, yes, of course, because you can't take your next breath in unless you let your breath go. And you say, well, breath charges us up. Why would we want to exhale? Well, that's just the way the human body is designed. So, you know, Alexander Lohan, who is the father of bioenergetics and one of the great teachers said, human organisms can only function when there's a balance of charging and discharging. And so by doing both, we find our balance after a while. So I would say do both in each chakra and see what feels good to you. See what makes balance. And then over time, you'll go, oh, when I do too much of this, I don't feel as good. I want to do a little less of the discharging so I keep the charge or a little less of the charging so I don't get too anxious. You'll find that through the laboratory of your own body. But yeah, experience both of them and see what feels good to you. Let's see on the list. Our next question from a gentleman. Let's go with James. When considering the solar plexus chakra, what are some tools that we can use to build our willpower and impulse control? Pretty sure we all need a little bit of that. Yeah. So just to review again, the will. which is how we do things out in the world, is the combination of the energy coming up from the lower chakras, matter and movement. Matter and movement create friction and that creates fire. And that's where we get our energy, getting the body moving, digesting our food. Will, though, also requires intention coming from the crown down to direct that energy. You know, dogs have a lot of energy, but they don't know what to do with it. Children have a lot of energy, but they don't have a lot of intention. So adults want to be able to channel their energy into their intention. I intend to finish my book by the deadline. I intend to call somebody back. I intend to stay on my diet. I intend to meditate tomorrow. I intend to download the quest every day and do the exercises. That's an intention. Will can be sometimes getting messages from conflicting intentions. Oh, I want to get up early and meditate, but I'm really tired and I want to stay in bed. So they're both intentions and the will and the energy don't know what to follow. Or sometimes I'll come home from a trip and say, when I get home, I'm going to do this and this and I have big intentions and I'm really tired and I don't have the energy. So first you have to decide whether your intention is not clear. or whether you don't have enough energy. And if you don't have enough energy, do more of the lower chakra or first three chakra exercises to get more energy going. Or if you're not clear on your intention, go to your purpose. What is my purpose? We're going to talk about this a lot more when we do the manifesting current the last seven days of the course and really creating on purpose. Then as a practice to develop your will, pick one thing. in the morning that you will do that day. Something that has a little challenge, but a challenge small enough that you know you can do it and win. Don't say I'm going to lose 20 pounds today because that's not going to happen. But say just for today, I'm not going to eat sugar. Or just for today, I'm going to set my watch to alarm. Every 20 minutes that I stop, pull back from my computer and breathe and stretch. Or just for today, I'm not going to play video games on my phone. Just one thing, one day at a time, or I'm going to call somebody or I'm going to smile or give somebody. And as you develop, will is like a muscle. As you develop that, you get this feeling of winning. Oh, I can do it. And that signals the unconscious that you can do more difficult things. I also find that people need to prioritize which is more important. You know, again, conflicting messages to the will. And, you know, say this is more important than that, or I do this first and then I do that. Take things one step at a time rather than all at once. That's great advice. It also echoes a lot of the teachings in our other course called Lifebook. And I believe we have a couple of Lifebook students here in the quest as well. I'll just share one of my favorite quotes about this small actions. It comes from Jonathan Kozol and says, pick battles small enough to win, but big enough to matter. Oh, that's beautiful. Yeah. If it really... All those things don't work and you can't get motivated to do anything. There's probably a little kid in there that is sitting there with their arms folded saying, I don't want to, you can't make me. You know, a little kid that maybe had to do things that they didn't want to do. And I would say, give that little kid a voice and let him, because it was a man asking this question, but him or her, have a little said, I don't want to, you can't make me. And get it out of your system. And then say, okay, I understand. You don't want to. We're going to go for a walk after we get this task done. And I'll take you out for ice cream or I'll, you know, play with you or, you know, we'll do something fun. And I understand. And you'll find that kid will get out of the way and let you do your task. I find it challenging to define my core values. Can you offer more guidance on this process? How can we approach it? Well, I would say your core values are what is really important to you. And here's a little meditation you could do. Imagine a spirit floating above the room at your funeral. You've died and all your friends have come along. What do you want them to say about you? Do you want them to say, oh, she was so kind or she was courageous or she inspired me or she was adventurous or she was so creative? What do you want? Those are probably your core values. Or what do you admire about other people that really impresses you? You know, that person was so compassionate to me. I want to be like that. Then that's a core value. Wonderful. Next question here. When we heal our chakras and feel better ourselves, can that indirectly heal our family as well? For example, do I help the energy to flow inside my partner or my parents? Yes, to a certain degree. You know, a family is a system, a living human system. And, you know, a company is a system, a country is a system, but a family is a small unit. And in family systems theory and psychology and my, you know, therapy training, they said when any one person in a system changes, the whole system has to shift. And a lot of times people will write to me saying, how do I get my partner to change? How do I get my children to change? How do I get my friends to change? I think the best thing you can do is be a shining example. And most people don't want to be told what to do or be told how they can be different. They'll go into resistance. But when they see you going, oh, wow, I'm so much happier or I have more energy, they're going to say, well, what are you doing? Oh, well, I'm doing this meditation or I'm doing this practice or I'm taking this course. you know and then that gets people curious and i think that's the best way to make change be a shining example and some people in a family are open and will change and some people just have their hands folded up over their chest saying you can't make me and there's nothing you can do and you just have to accept that but the system itself will change a little bit that's a great answer just a add -on for me we get this question every single time for every single course we have and this is the exact same answer that every Mindvalley teacher across the board shares. So there must be some truth with that. Just putting that out there. We get it a lot. And of course, this is the only way it actually works, becoming a shining example for others around us. Let's see. Next question here from Tanya. This is a very interesting question. At the start of this program, we got paired up with our tribe buddies. How do you recommend that we should be doing what we should be doing to connect and support one another as tribe buddies? So basically when we are doing this together, this course together with someone close, how can we help each other better? Tribe Buddy is to make a little more intimacy, like somebody that's tracking your progress. You know, there's so many people on the Facebook page and there's so many people in this course, it can become a little anonymous. And it's just so great to see all your faces and you can see each other. The Tribe Buddy, you know, in my live workshops, I call it a guardian angel. At the first day of the workshop, I have somebody pick somebody that's going to be their guardian angel. in the whole workshop and they're going to know if you're getting overwhelmed, they're going to know if you need a break, they're going to know if a particular chakra or exercise is very difficult for you or if you're in the middle of going through a divorce or a breakup or, you know, they're going to know a little bit more about you and they can track your progress. So somebody special to share things through up until the end. And how that all works technologically, Sarah was handling that. As in my department, I'm not so good with those things. But it's somebody you can check in with and keep on track and keep yourselves accountable. Basically, the question is, can we share energies with children? And is there any good resource on how to raise a child supporting this programming of their chakras? We can't help but share energy with children. Children are very sensitive beings. And, you know, think of them in this little... you know little body and then here we are in our adult big bodies that's a lot of energy all you have to do is walk into a room and that little child feels the energy and they feel whether you're angry you're happy you're loving and one of the things that happens is that an adult often will discharge their adult energy on a small child an adult discharges their anger that's like too much energy for a small child's body or an adult sexuality does not belong on a child. I mean, that should not be given to a child. It's overwhelming. And so in terms of how do we raise children to have healthy chakras, that's a whole big topic. But I address that in my book, Eastern Body, Western Mind, where I go in more detail into the developmental stages of each chakra. And also in Wheels of Life, I think there was a portion that didn't fit into that book because the publisher said, this is 50 pages too long. You need to take this out. So I put it in Wheels of Life as an addendum. Wheels of Life is here. And it's how to raise children with healthy chakras. And there's several pages at the back about what stage they're going through. Like when they're in their will stage, their third chakra stage, how to support them having an individual will at the same time. not letting them play in the street or stay up all night or eat all the cookies, you know, we have to put some boundaries and limits. How to support them in coming into their heart and their authenticity and love them for who they are, not just for how they perform. You know, so how to support a child in each chakra stage that they're in. But to go into all of that is much more than we have time for. But an addendum in this book and then Eastern Body, Western Mind. is this one, at least in English. These are in a lot of languages too. I saw a related question to the one on children. How do we help heal a disabled child who cannot understand this type of work? You know, we have to meet our children wherever they are and find out from them to the best that they can say you know what's in their way and it might say they might put it in a child way i don't know how to make friends or school is hard for me or um sports are hard for me or you have to meet them where they are and take them to lovingly and compassionately exploring their own blocks and help them where they can't help themselves in managing their own energy and you know there's not a lot of that in this course but you can even just take your hand and just push that pull things out of your third eye or move things off your heart when your heart feels burdened but you can actually do that to a child you can help them move their energy they can push their hands into you and scream and let some of that out And again, you know, working with children and doing these exercises would be a whole other course. But, you know, if you find something, just keep it playful. Make sure you don't feel, communicate to the child like there's something wrong with them or they're less than or they're, you know, flawed in some way. But that here's a way that we can play together. Here's a way we can play with energy. Here's a way we can move things. And let's just see what happens. Make it a game. Beautifully said. Okay, let's see. Another question here was asked earlier by Bridget. And I see lots of people commented as well as that. As Bridget said, I was hesitant to go into my fourth chakra. I'm having relationship issues with my husband. We are separate. Since going into the fourth chakra, my emotions are all over the place. Anger, sadness, loneliness. I'm thinking emotions that were pent up are now flooding up. From what you said, maybe I need to do some discharging. What other suggestions do you have? Well, I would say discharging. And of course, if you're going through a separation, it's really good to get some support in the form of therapy. You know, it doesn't mean there's something wrong with you. It's just because so much comes out. Somebody to be a witness and help you through that and find out what's being triggered that's from your past, what is just about the present. And the more you move those emotions up, understand them and release them. the clearer you will be. And the more deeply you do that, the faster it will go. And that said, you know, going through a breakup takes its own sweet time, or maybe not so sweet. You know, it just, it's a process. But remember what you're harvesting underneath all those emotions is yourself. When we get a breakup, we're thrown back on ourselves again. And so we need that intimacy and understanding and compassion for our own self. And get out of the story about what happened and what he or she did to you or whatever, and then get back in the charge. Where is the charge? Oh, it's pushing up against my heart. How can I maybe use the yoga and the stretching to get more room in my heart so that charge can move through? If it feels like it's... in here and wants to move out. You can journal right. You can talk to a friend. You can scream in your car. You can put on music and dance those emotions. And it's like a storm. Once the storm rains, it's rained down on the earth, and the air clears, and oh, everything feels so much better. That sounds great. I see another question here from Vanessa, a question regarding the third chakra. For those with a tendency to hang on to the weight, around the middle. I have a tendency for digestive problems or aches and the solar plexus area is hard. What ongoing exercises do you suggest we do in order to release these imbalances? Yeah, it's been me in my life. It's been my toughest chakra and I tend to put it on in the middle. You know, another whole way of looking at this, and I talk about this in Eastern Body, Western Mind, and also in the Charge book, is that we develop these character structures. And the one that develops the, you know, baggage, if you will, around the middle, around the third chakra, is the endure character structure. And their tendency is to just lock down and endure. They can put up with things. They carry the heavy load. They show up and do the work nobody else wants to do. They stay with the relationship. They stay with the situation. What they don't do is they don't discharge very much. The body is a storage battery for charge, for life force. If you have to hold a lot of charge in and you're not discharging, then you've got to make a bigger body to do it in. If you go into endurance, that locks down right on the third chakra. So a great exercise I call the wood chopper. But you hold your hands up overhead. Yeah, I did. And then let it out. I'm sitting in a chair, so I can't quite do it. Or I'd hit my head on the desk. But, you know, you just let that out. Or you take a bat and you pound into a sofa. you know or your mattress or hit your hands into a pillow and really let that out that moves energy up and out from the third chakra so it's a great third chakra discharge and as we i find when i work with clients when they get in touch with their anger and they can own it and feel it a lot of the weight issues go away that's wonderful for a full demonstration you can go into the quest so this exercise is demonstrated in one of the yoga poses there I think we have time for just one more question. Let's go with this one from Anne. When something incredibly traumatic happens and it is difficult to even think about, how do we heal our heart from that type of pain? Yeah. So, you know, when something hugely traumatic, there is a tremendous charge that arises in the body as a result of the trauma. That's just what happens physiologically. It's biological. It just happens. We don't do it on purpose. And what makes it difficult is not only the story about what happened, the betrayal or the danger or whatever is the event, but there's the reaction in the body. And that charge, when it comes to trauma, is bigger than the body can handle. And that's what makes it so difficult. And because of that, it locks up. And it's as if the body says, this is overwhelming. I know I can't handle that. The way to work with trauma is to discharge it little by little, little tiny, discrete releases. And it's sort of like if you know what a pressure cooker is, you know, a pan that, you know, has a really tight top and you can boil rice in it. You don't just open the cooker when it's fully, fully, you know. boiled up you have a little valve and you let off a little steam and you let off a little steam and you let off a little steam and then when that pressure is more equalized then you can open the whole pan so in the same way with trauma you've got to be very compassionate with yourself saying this is going to take a little time and that excess charge release it a little bit you can release it by pushing into a doorway by writing in a journal by making some sound by stamping your feet remember discharge is from the inside out so it comes out the limbs the mouth the legs the hands but do it a little bit at a time don't try to get it out all at once because that will overwhelm your nervous system again and the trauma was already overwhelming so as you do that You get a little less overwhelmed. There's more empowerment for the person and less of the weight of the trauma. That's all the time we have for today. Hope you guys got a lot of fun. You got a lot of value from this session. We are at time. So thank you very much, Nadea, for another wonderful, wonderful, great session. Thank you, Alex. Thank you all of you for showing up on Sunday.

Week 3: Heal Your Throat & Third Eye Chakra

====================

LESSON 15 – Throat Chakra: Healing the Psyche by Speaking Your Truth
--------------------
<v ->Welcome to the wonderful world of sound</v> and communication in the throat chakra. Take a deep breath and let it out with a sound. Every time we breathe, we're making a sound, we're vibrating air molecules. And isn't it amazing that what actually makes you hear sound is that tiny air molecules are bouncing up and down on your eardrum. And your eardrum is about half the size of your pinky fingernail. So all the nuances of sound, of words, of language, of music, different instruments, rhythms, you can identify just by a few air molecules bouncing up and down on your eardrum. So sound is a way, it's a vibration and everything in nature is vibrating. Every cell in your body, every heartbeat, every breathe you take, every word you speak is living in a vibrational world. We know that the subtle energy is a kind of subtle vibration that goes through the body. And here in the throat chakra, we want to bring that all into attunement and harmony. And here lies the source of our creativity. This is our creative self-expression. Now, many people put creativity in the second chakra. I think because we create babies there. And I do admit that when we're emotionally triggered, we might write our best poetry. But the creativity of the throat chakra is a more conscious creativity. It is speaking, writing, singing, dancing, performing, painting. All of the arts. They are expression from the inside coming out. So the name of this chakra, Vissudha means purification. And to me that means two things: One, that sound has a purifying nature as it organizes the subtle energy in your auric field and in your body. And the other is that speaking our truth can purify a situation, even if it makes it messy in the short run, it can purify it in the long run. So the other aspect of communication is this is how create our reality. If I say to a group of students I'm teaching, let's all make a circle, those few noises coming out of my throat create the reality of everyone standing up and getting in a circle. If you say bring me a glass of water, or go away, you're creating your reality at each moment that you speak from your throat. The developmental stage of the fifth chakra I see as being that age when we're going to school, say seven to 10, we've been socialized and now we open up and we're learning. We're reading books, we're watching films, we're having discussions, we're listening to teachers, we're talking with our friends, we're receiving instructions about the world that expands our understanding. And this all happens through the realm of communication. All learning really takes place through the realm of communication, whether it's communication with yourself or communication from another. So one of the tasks during this developmental stage is to learn to communicate, to learn to share what's inside you because the throat chakra is one of the prime places where the inside comes out. In other words, you can look at somebody and you could make your guesses to what they're feeling, but you don't really know unless they open their mouth and tell you. So if your inside was riddled with shame or fear or guilt or even grief and you're not letting that out, then you're probably not letting things out in general and you have to put a sentry guard at the throat chakra to check everything that comes out of you. That slows down the whole process and inhibits your creativity. So some of the things that impact this chakra are being told lies or having to tell a lie. Sometimes it can be as simple as oh, go tell Aunt Mary that you love her when maybe you can't stand her, or it is only put a smile on your face even if you're feeling sad. These are ways that we learn to lie with ourselves and it gets to the point where we may not even know our own self what's true inside then how can we be honest with other people. Another form of lies is secrets. Many families have family secrets or things they simply don't talk about. We don't talk about Uncle Charles and his drinking, and we don't talk about what happened to your sister, and we don't talk about our financial situation. And that teaches a child not to share what's inside and sometimes these are things that have a major impact. So look at it this way. When you're pulling your crown up and your roots down, that chord going through your soul is like stringing a string on a guitar. And then life will pluck that chord. And when it does, you will vibrate. So if I strike this bell, the bell is vibrating until the strength of that striking is canceled out. And that's natural. If someone bumps into you on the street, you go, ow or hey, watch it. Or if something really impacts you during the day at work, you want to come home and tell somebody about it, oh, I got to tell you what happened to me today. It helps to talk about what happens to us. So what happens when you can't do that? What happens when a child is impacted by some kind of abuse or trauma and there's nobody to talk to, or they talk to somebody and they're not believed, or they're made wrong for saying it. Then we learn that we can't let what's inside out. And even though things impact us, we have to stop it right away. We have to keep it from vibrating. Well, the body is an instrument that the divine is playing through you and you want to be a resonant, vibrating instrument. If you have to do this to yourself all the time, that's a process in music that is called deadening. Like guitar players will deaden the string if it doesn't go with the chord. Well, when we have to do that to ourselves, we deaden ourselves. And after a while a density builds up in the body and we're not so responsive, we don't vibrate so well and we don't release and things get caught up inside and become tension and blockages. And instead of going to the harmony and ease of this chakra, we go to the disease which can be of course disease. Also children learn how to communicate by being talked with, not to. A lot of parents just talk to their children say, do this, do that. They don't really talk with them. They don't bring the inside out. They don't say, what are you feeling about this, what do you think about this, and then the parent sharing their own insights. So when there's neglect and a child is ignored and not talked to, they don't learn the language of communication. So children have a need to be heard and listened to. If they fail to receive this, they may not even be able to hear themselves. If we were ridiculed when we speak, then we don't trust that what we have to say is important. We may think oh, nobody wants to hear what I have to say. I'll just be quiet and sit on the sidelines. So some of the things you might tell yourself if you have a block in this chakra is oh, I'm not going to open my mouth, people will think I'm stupid. Or as some anonymous person said, "Better to remain silent and be thought a fool "than to open your mouth and remove all doubt." Or you think I won't be understood, or what I say doesn't matter, or I won't be able to say it the way I want, or so and so doesn't want to hear it. These are all things we tell ourselves that block our communication. So when we're looking at excess and deficiency in this chakra, it becomes pretty obvious. The excessive chakra wants to talk too much. They dominate the conversation. They might be loud, they might be boisterous, they might be interrupting, they have too much to say. We all know the person that just goes on and on and on. In fact, I say there should 12-step group for them called on and on and on anonymous. And of course, if it goes deficient, then someone is very shy and quiet, they may have a very tiny voice and they don't really want to bring the inside out into the world, they hang back in the corner and want to hide. When it's balanced, we have clear and concise communication. It comes from our ground, it comes from our heart, it comes from our higher wisdom, we have good listening skills, and we have clear, creative expression. So one of the challenges in this chakra is dealing with all those little subtle lies, not really living your truth, not really responding to the truth that another person speaks. Say, oh, well that isn't so, that isn't how it was, well maybe they're just telling what their truth is, realizing we each have our own truth and that's how life has impacted us. When we can really live honestly and vulnerably, the gift is harmony, clear communication, and creativity. To heal this part of the psyche, return to your core truth. Reclaim your voice, reclaim your right to speak, and be heard. Try to live authentically. Look at the beliefs you have about yourself and ask, are they true? How do I know they're true? That's why our exercise for today will be to activate your throat chakra and find truth and speak it. So the exercise today like the others is finding a bunch of questions in your workbook, that look at where in your life are you not speaking your truth? What are you afraid of in speaking it? Is it that you can't handle the charge of it or you think of someone else can't? What need do you have in speaking that truth? Maybe a need to be respected or a need to be understood or a need to not be judged. And how can you request a listening from the other person that prefaces that like saying, I have something really important and difficult to share with you and I just want to ask that you don't interrupt me, or I'm really afraid you're going to judge me if say this, so can we maybe hold back on the judgment? Or I'm afraid you won't help me or you won't really understand, and somehow getting that part off your chest prefaces the listening so that it makes it a little easier to speak your truth. So for our chakra skillset, remember your reflections for today. Notice when you're not saying something and see what that feels like in your body. You don't have to make yourself wrong for it. Just notice the charge that's in your body and what it is that you really want to say and what it is you really want to have the person hear. We invite you to share these aha moments with your tribe and really communicate with them. Communicate with each other. And tomorrow we will take it into the throat chakra in the body.

====================

LESSON 16 - Throat Chakra: Healing the Body by Releasing Blockages to Free Expression
--------------------
<v ->Welcome back to your body and here we'll look</v> at the throat chakra which is in the neck and throat. What does the neck do in the body? It connects the head to the rest of the body. So one thing that happens when the head is out of alignment with the body is you can see that in the neck, somebody may constantly take their head to the side, their head may jut out way in front of them, they may constantly have their chin down. It's how the head sits on the body that brings someone right into the center of their charge. You want to learn to tune in to this part of your body. What goes on in your throat? Does it tighten, does your neck tighten, does your jaw tighten? Maybe you have a chronically tight jaw. How 'about shoulders, do your shoulders get tight? And the throat chakra also goes down the outer arms, what I call the creative channels. So if we are holding our communication back, there will be tension in these muscles. If the head is not really connected to the body, if we're not processing our thoughts or we're not noticing with our consciousness what we're feeling in our body, it can go either way, then we might find tension and blockage in the heart. It keeps them separate. As you continue to practice your communication, even just letting sound out. As you make sound, you can even do the lion pose which is opening your arms and mouth wide and sticking out your tongue and making a sound. When you practice yoga or when you're taking a shower or driving in your car, you'll find that this part of the body becomes lighter and freer. Okay if you want to just feel a little bit of extra charge in your throat chakra. Most people don't really need to charge it, they need to discharge it but you can just do some shoulder shrugs. This is a good charging exercise for the fifth chakra. Inhale and bring your shoulders up toward your ears. Exhale and drop them. And do it rapidly. And then relax and feel the charge in your shoulders and in your throat and neck. As you do, just feel that tingling in the back of your throat and your neck, makes you much more aware of that part of your body, right? Now most of us really need to discharge. A lot of people have their inner critic right on the back of their throat chakra hollering its insults into you, so we need to get that pressure off. This is called get off my back and it really loosens up the shoulders. Make a fist with your hands, bend your elbows and first, one elbow at a time, just say get off my back. Get off my back, get off my back. And after doing one elbow at a time, do both at once. Get off my back. Get off my back. And then stop and stand and feel the area and the back of your shoulders, the back of your neck, and let everything and your shoulders and arms relax. So now that we've done a little charging discharging here, we're going to take it onto the mat and do a yoga flow for the fifth chakra. Now we enter the world of sound. I encourage you to make a lot of sound in your practice this morning. Especially if something is tough, just let it out, ah. So stand with feet hip-width apart. Lift your hands up overhead and interlace your palms and turn your palms upward toward the ceiling. Press your thumbs up to the ceiling and open your shoulders, tilt your head back and look at the back of your hands. And then bring your chin down to your chest, continue to press your hands behind you. Separate your hands and bow forward into Uttanasana, forward fold, hands on either side of the front two feet. Take your left foot back into a high lunge. And firming up your base, drawing your feet toward each other, hugging the muscles to the bone, back leg straight and strong, right knee over the right ankle. Lift your torso up and your arms overhead, interlacing your fingers once more and turning your palms up to the ceiling, tilt your head back, open your mouth wide and make a sound. Bring your palms together and slide them down to center of your torso and bring your left elbow to your right knee as you twist, and move your right shoulder back, pressing firmly into the core of the body, lengthening through the crown. Separate your hands and bring the knee to the side of your front foot and this time, we're going to bring our back foot forward again. And squat down with your knees and roll back and forth on your spine a few times, being playful and creative. Massaging your spine. And this might be enough for some of you. But if you would like to go into shoulder stand, the next time you roll back, press your legs up into the air, lift your hips and you can support your hips with your hands. Right at your waist line. Take a deep breath in and if you want to play with your legs, you can separate your legs or take them overhead for a plow. Or merely stay in shoulder stand. And then when you're ready to release, come back down, vertebrae by vertebrae, bending your knees so that you can place your feet on the floor, hip width apart in preparation for bridge pose. Hands alongside the body. Take a deep breath in and on the exhale, press down into your feet, lifting your hips up. And roll a little bit side to side, getting your shoulders underneath you. Interlace your fingers once more, rolling your shoulders back. Press your knees toward each other, open your mouth, make a sound. Release your shoulders and your hands. Roll back down to the mat one vertebrae at a time. Take a deep breath in, hug your knees into your chest. Roll back and forth again and roll back to a squat. And then lift your hips for a forward fold. And now take your right leg back to a high lunge. Firming up both legs, left knee out over the left ankle. Find your stability and lift your torso upright, raising your hands up overhead, interlacing your fingers, turning your palms to the ceiling, taking your head back once more, sound. And then pressing your hands toward each other, bring them down your core. Take your right elbow to your left knee and twist. Lengthen between your right heel and the top of your crown. Take a deep breath in, perhaps another sound. And then release your hands, take them to either side of your front foot. Bring your back foot forward. And lower your head . Shake your head loose. Shake your head yes. Shake your head no. Shake your shoulders, I don't know. And then press into your feet, tuck your tailbone, rise back up. Interlace your fingers overhead one more time. Turn your palms up to the ceiling, take your head back. And then slide your hands down your crown bringing your palms together, bring them to your heart. And end this with a nice om. Om. Now that you've done the yoga, let's just look at some everyday movements you can do in a few seconds. So one is when your neck gets tired, especially you've been sitting at your computer for awhile, just kind of take your head and roll it around, stretching the neck on each part. If you go to one side, you might take the opposite hand and pull your ear down towards your shoulder a little. The free hand can then massage some of the muscles on your neck. You can take it to the back and you can take the other side, do a little massaging up and down. And that helps to relieve some neck tension. Shake your head side to side and just loosen it up. Another one to work with, the tensions that happens in the jaw from clenching your jaw and closing your throat chakra is that if you take your hand or even someone else can do this to you and put it under your chin and then open your mouth and make a sound so you're pressing against the resistance of your hand. And that means your jaw muscles have to go the other way and open and that's a good way to release jaw tension. For the next 24 hours, practice tuning into your body, how it feels in your throat chakra whether you say something or whether you don't, how you might tense up when there's something important to say. Use any of these movements that we've shared with you. Today we looked at letting sound out of your throat chakra and tomorrow we will explore the cost of remaining silent.

LESSON 17 - Throat Chakra: Healing the Spirit by Connecting to Larger Truths
--------------------
<v ->Welcome to healing the spirit of the throat.</v> You know, it's not enough just to do our own work. We're all singing a symphony together. We're all creating a new world together. Our truth wants to be expressed, and your truth is necessary. Speaking our truth changes the world. It connects us to larger truths, and there is a big cost to remaining silent. Remaining silent allows the status quo to stay in place. When there is fear, guilt, shame, grief, even lies, it allows lies to prosper. People will believe anything, because we're not speaking our truths. Now, sometimes we think, good boys and good girls are silent. We're obedient. We don't want to make waves. We have to give up our need for approval and safety, and sometimes, speak truth to power. Let people know how you feel, let people know, especially, when you do that, what you would like, how you would like it to be better, what's your idea for change? Express that. We can see how the world is very disharmonious. There's horns honking, and trucks going by, and bells ringing, and, phones ringing, and we're constantly bombarded by sound. And we get out of harmony. We get out of resonance with ourselves. That's why quiet time, and meditation, and listening to music can be so important. Rhythm is actually an organizing principle, not only for the body, but for society. Look at what happens when a whole crowd goes to hear a concert. Music is part of every spiritual and revolutionary movement we've had that is successful. Creativity brings us artists. Artists are often the social architects of a new world. They create the leading edge of culture. We can demonstrate and make phrases that catch on as sound bites. We can create new possibilities by uttering them into existence. So dare to break out of your mold. Dare to break out of your silence. Dare to be creative. Speak your truth to power, and take it into a movement. So how do we become as Rainbow Warriors, speakers of the truth? How do we become change agents through our communication? Well we have to change ourselves from the inside out. And we have to learn methods of clear communication. If we had tools of communication, we could work things out, instead of going to war. So, learn techniques of mediation, diplomacy, how to listen, how to do active listening and reflect back what you hear from someone else. Learn to speak in the "I" voice, meaning you're sharing what's inside you, rather than telling the other person you're doing this to me, or you didn't do that, or you did do that. Say, I feel this inside. You can follow the lines of non-violent communication by Marshall Rosenberg that has a very good and simple model for creating clear communication that creates intimacy. As we learn each other's language, we learn each other's ways, and we create a more global community. And of course, we have the tools of global communication through the internet and our cellphones, where we are tuned into what's happening all over the world, instantaneously, through the realm of constant communication. So they say we have two ears and one mouth, because listening is so much more important than speaking. Imagine a world that really listened, where we could hear the truth of everyone, and create a symphonic chorus of creation together. Another cost of withholding our truth, is that it creates distance in relationship. Whatever you haven't said to a friend, to a partner, to a co-worker, brings a little distance between you and that person. And usually what you haven't said might be something negative, sometime when you were hurt, or annoyed at that person, and, maybe you just didn't want to share that. Well there's a simple process created by Stan Dale of the Human Awareness Institute, for sharing those kind of things, and it's called The Withhold Process. So, Withhold is anything you haven't said to a person. It can be positive or negative, but usually it's negative. And you simply say to the person, I have a withhold that I haven't shared with you. Are you willing to hear it? This gives the person a choice. It lets them brace themselves that they're going to hear something, and they have the option of saying yes or no, and you have to respect that. If they say no, I just got home from work, and I'm really tired, I don't have the bandwidth to hear anything right now, you have to respect that, and you might say, well, is there a time, you might hear it tomorrow? But, you have to accept no is no. If they say yes, and, it's good to preface this process with them ahead of time, when you're not triggered, so, you preface the person on how to do this before you share, that they would only say thank you when you share your withhold. So then you can speak from yourself, and say, well last night, when you went to bed early, and didn't do the dishes, I felt, overburdened because I do the dishes all the time. You're not saying that person was wrong, you're not saying you never do the dishes, or you don't help around here. You're speaking of yourself, and you're just saying, I felt annoyed and disgruntled. And, the person simply listens and just says, thank you. And what they're really saying is, thank you for sharing your withhold. They don't give you a rebuttal, they don't say, but I do the dishes Tuesdays and Thursdays, they don't say, but I did them in the morning. They just say thank you. Now, later they might have a withhold for you, and, this process of sitting down with someone and sharing withholds, you'll find if you do it, and you do it carefully, brings you closer. Once you've gotten those things off your chest, you usually want to say something positive. And you know, I also forgot to tell you how much I appreciate what you do do around the house, or how much you take care of the kids, or, whatever it is that you appreciate about them. You find that comes out naturally, once the withholds have been shared. What if a person consistently says, no, they don't want to hear it, or that person's not available to talk to, or maybe they're not even alive anymore? Well, you can get a third person to sit in. Let's say, you want your friend Nancy to stand in for all the things you never got to say to your ex-husband. So Nancy says, well, tell me a withhold you've held back from George. And then you say, George, blah blah blah. And, Nancy just says, thank you. Tell me something without, tell me something else you've withheld from George. Well George, I never felt that you really heard or understood me. Thank you. Tell me something else, and they pull withholds from you, until you feel empty and discharged. And then, you don't have so much connection to these negative associations. You feel more positive toward that person, you're freer, you're more able to go on to the future, without being stuck in the past. So here's a reflection for today. Underneath everything you say, underneath everything you do, what are you really trying to say? See if you can listen for that, and see if what is the core communication? Are you trying to say, I can be helpful? Or, like me? Or, take me just the way I am? Try to listen for that. And in saying that thing you're always trying to say, underneath all you say and do, what is it that you're longing to hear? And how can you tell that to yourself? And that's a really good thing to share with the Tribe. Let's hear your inner voice. Let's hear your core truth. Let's hear what you're longing to say. And that wraps up our throat chakra. Tomorrow we'll move from speaking our truth to seeing the light and seeing clearly. See you there.

====================

LESSON 18 - Third Eye Chakra: Healing the Psyche by Seeing Things as They Are
--------------------
<v ->Welcome to your third eye,</v> chakra six, the brow chakra, the pace of seeing, intuition, having a vision, opening your imagination, dreaming, all that place inside where we find insight and we learn to see clearly. So when we did the first two chakras, your body and your emotions and sexuality, those are pretty personal things, you know what's your body, we don't share our sexuality with just anybody. Then in chakras three, four, and five, they're very interpersonal, we do lots of things with lots of people, lots of conversations and relationships, they're very much between you and others. Chakras six and seven are very transpersonal, they take us upward into the transcendent. So here it goes beyond the personal, it's not so much about you and your wounds and your story as it is about really seeing the big picture. But first, we have to pierce through illusion and learn to see clearly. So we know that we see with our two physical eyes, those are like the two petals of this chakra, but it's the third eye that allows us to have insight, that sees underneath the surface of things, that sees, really, the ultimate nature of reality, the patterns that connect. And this brings us realization. I like to say that in order to realize, you have to learn to see with your real eyes. Many people associate this chakra with spiritual awakening, and what is it to awaken? It's to awaken from illusion, to really see what something is, you go oh, I see. And once you can really see that, you don't usually forget. You know, in the yoga tradition, they talk about truth as satya, and it means just what is. Well, seeing clearly is also just seeing what is, sort of like a camera. A camera takes a picture of whatever it is, it doesn't embellish, of course, we can do that in post, but we just see what is, we take it in without our value judgments of it being right or wrong or good or bad, we want to see reality clearly. So, in childhood development, this may come online early, but often once a child has learned everything through their throat chakra, and it doesn't mean that ever stops, but around adolescence, the child is pulling away from what's been given to them and starting to think for themselves. They're starting to imagine what life might be, they're breaking off in a new direction, they're experimenting with creative patterns and hair and dress and styles of being. I'd say that we come into a kind of archetypal awakening at this stage, and it gives us a way to look at a larger picture, like how are we living our life, what's the vision of our life, what archetypes are parading through? Are we playing the archetype of the lost child, or the hero, or the shadow, or the light, or the great mother? What is the archetype that is guiding in our life, and how do we see that in self reflection? So one of the tasks here is for the child or the budding adult, really, is to learn to see themselves clearly, to learn to see others clearly, and to learn to understand how they fit into the bigger picture. How do things work? How do we see beyond ourselves? How do we make our lives bigger? How do we see what people are doing on the other side of the world? How do we understand and learn to self reflect and examine our own life? So it was Socrates that said an unexamined life isn't worth living. So we really want to learn to look at ourselves clearly, without judgment, without right or wrong, good or bad, and see what's there, and especially see the light in ourselves and see the light in each other. Some of the things that negatively impact this chakra can be that you grew up seeing some things that you didn't understand or you wish you didn't see. Maybe someone that grew up in a violent environment, maybe someone that could see the suffering of others and wasn't really emotionally ready to handle that. Sometimes when we don't want to see something, we even shut down the visual acuity of our physical eyes. When people get glasses as children, I often like to say so what was going on in your family around that time? Was there anything that you didn't want to see? And that's not always a correlation, but sometimes it's worth looking at. And that effect of having to see something we didn't want to see can have a few different ways that we respond to that. We might repress the memory and then just not even remember it at all, but like keeping something back in the throat chakra, when we repress something we don't want to remember, it keeps us from seeing in real time as well. Or we might dissociate from the memory, we inhibit our consciousness from making sense of it, it's there, but we say oh, well that was nothing, that had no effect on me. Or we dissociate the seeing of it from the emotion of it or the behavior of it, and we want to bring those things back into some cohesive relationship. So children have a need to be seen, but if they don't feel safe, sometimes they have a need to hide as well, and then that conflicts with their need to be seen later on, like oh, why doesn't anybody see me? I often find that people still have that need to hide in safety. And when you're invalidated, or when your thoughts or feelings are rejected or ignored or judged, then we often shut down this chakra and we learn to invalidate ourselves. In other words, just not see some part of ourselves as valid, as worthy of notice. What do we learn as a consequence of this? Sometimes the vision we need to look outward is busy looking inward, not in terms of just receiving what we are and noticing what it is, but in vicious self scrutiny and self consciousness, so we're very aware, how do I look, how am I moving? Instead of just being in ourselves. Also, you might lose trust in your intuition and listen more to the outer world than what that still small voice inside, that hunch, that awareness of intuition, and what that's trying to tell you. So what does this chakra look like when it's excessive or deficient? The excessive chakra is so open to any input, I run into them sometimes at psychic fairs and they said oh yes, you were my mother in a past life, and this is happening and that's happening and they're kind of overloaded in psychic input and maybe not quite able to separate out the truth from the fantasy. And the deficient is just the opposite, they don't notice anything, they're the person that's over for dinner and everybody at the table's looking at their watch and yawning, and that person's talking on and on, oblivious to what's around them, or somebody that can only see things in one true right and only way, and they can't see other options. Or denial is another kind of deficiency in the sixth chakra. When this chakra is balanced, you have a good, clear intuition that you can feel and sense and listen to. You have insight, you're perceptive, you see things in people. You're able to visualize and think symbolically, you have a good imagination, and as we'll talk about in healing the spirit, you're able to see a vision for your life. So the challenge we have to overcome is illusion. Illusion can be very subtle. We can be attached to thinking how something should be, instead of seeing how it is. We might be fixated on our body being 10 pounds thinner, or attached to what I call perfect pictures. One thing about perfect pictures is they're never in real time. Oh, I should have this kind of relationship, or this kind of job, or this kind of body, and it keeps you from seeing what you do have. Another aspect is always seeing what's wrong and failing to see the light and the beauty in yourself and others. And when we overcome this illusion, we have clear perception, we have an awakening, we have insight, and that takes us to understanding. So developing your third eye, this is less about healing your past than it is about practice and development. You want to learn to see yourself and to see others, so I'm going to take you on a quick meditation to just look down at yourself and watch yourself going through a typical day. So close your eyes and center yourself in your breathing. Imagine you can see your breath rise up your spinal column to the crown, and you can see your breath go down all the way to the base. And the next breath in, rise up, and imagine there's a little ball of light that you're going to see right in your sixth chakra at the brow level, right in the center of the head where that vertical line going through the core intersects the line going forward right at your third eye. See that as a glow of light. And so, from this vantage point of your third eye, your brow chakra, imagine that you can rise up above your body and look at yourself down below as if you were watching a movie. And that character is going through a typical day. So look at yourself waking up in the morning, how do you wake up? Do you wake up with a smile on your face? Do you wake up groggy, or swearing about your day? Do you wake up alone or with someone? How do you greet your day? And now notice, you're getting out of bed, you're brushing your teeth, you're taking a shower, whatever you do in the morning, eating your breakfast, maybe you live alone and you're by yourself, or you tune into the news, or maybe you're talking to other people in your family. Just be the observer of this person, as if you were fascinated by them. What do you notice about how they interact with others or interact with themselves, about their attitude? And now, watch yourself going into your day, maybe going to work or taking children to school, whatever it is you do in a typical day, watch yourself going about it. How do you look? How do you interact with other people? What's your attitude? What do you see about this person that maybe they don't see about themselves? Take yourself into your midday, maybe you break for lunch, maybe you go out for lunch, maybe you're with other people, notice what you do, notice how you do it, watch this person with fascination. See that person go into their afternoon, whatever tasks they are doing, how they interact with other people. Notice again, what do you see that they might not see? Now maybe you're winding up your work day and going home for dinner, or going out to dinner, or maybe you work in the evening. Take yourself into your evening activities, whatever is typical for you, and notice, what does that look like? And notice, what does that look like? What do you see about that person you're watching that he or she may not see or notice about herself? And then finally, you're winding up your day at night, getting ready to go to bed. Notice the attitudes with which you do that, how do you finish your day? How do you close off everything you've been doing? How do you get into bed? And watch yourself falling asleep. And as you review what you saw about this person going through their day, and their typical struggles and activities, what advice would you give this person? What do you see that the person you were watching, the person who is you, doesn't see from down here on Earth? Take some time and write this in your journal, communicate that from the wise witness that likes inside your brow chakra. So when you've taken the time to really see yourself objectively, without judgment, and you're ready to give that self feedback, you can slowly open your eyes and take in the world around you. so the skillset that you want to develop for this chakra is to see things in the positive. Now, I'm not talking about to the point of denial here, but when you look at yourself, when you look at your partner and relationship, when you look at your job or your coworkers, what can you see that's the positive? Rick Hanson says in his book, Hardwiring Happiness, that the brain is like Velcro for the negative, meaning everything that's negative sticks, and it's like Teflon for the positive, that the positive slips away. It's a natural survival mechanism when we had to look across the bushes and see a subtle ruffle that might be a dangerous animal, or it's that thing that happened when you brought home a report card that was all As and one B and your father said well, what's with the B? So we need to learn to focus on the positive to savor it, to really soak our brain cells in that image of the positive and see the light, see the beauty in things. You know, it's said that we need to be told a ratio of five positive things for every one negative thing. If somebody criticizes you, that's what you're going to remember. You're not going to remember all the nice things they said. So any time you have a withhold for someone, be sure to say something positive, make a positive statement, something good, then what you have to say, and then end it with something good, that way we accentuate the positive. In yoga, our gaze is called our drishti, so keep the gaze focused on what you want to see and you'll make more of that. So as always, we ask you to share with the Tribe your ah-ha moments, your insights, whatever it is that you see, your vision, your imagination, and we will take this tomorrow into the body.

====================

LESSON 19 - Third Eye Chakra: Healing the Body by Opening Your Channels of Seeing
--------------------
<v ->Welcome back to looking at</v> what the third eye does on a physical level. I think of our two actual eyes as the two petals of this chakra. The third eye is the organ of perception in the middle. One aspect of the third eye is that it's related to the pineal gland. The pineal gland is a small, light-sensitive organ that hangs down right in the exact center of the head. In fact, it's just found at the bottom of a section of the brain called the Cave of Brahma. The pineal gland produces all kinds of hormones, melatonin is one of them, that allows us to sleep, and melatonin is affected by the light we take in from our eyes. If we see light all the time, we don't produce a lot of melatonin. We produce it at night when it's dark. Melatonin can lead to dreams, can increase the power of your immune system. It's very strengthening. And of course there's some chemicals that we convert in our pineal gland that allow us to have visions, and the visions even that we see in our dreams. We talked about excess and deficiency as being someone who sees everything and can't sort out the truth from the fiction, or someone who doesn't see well at all doesn't see what's right in front of them. But how does this look in the body? Well often, if someone is really leading from their sixth chakra, the head juts out in front of everything else. It's like they're trying to see out in front of them. A deficient chakra tends to be more closed down. You see somebody is furrowing their brow all the time, and they're constricting here. So we want to be able to smooth that out and open it. Also, are the eyes wide open or are they partly closed? These are some of the things to look at physically, all those mostly the pineal gland is more in the head than it is in the body. But I would suggested that you notice what you do in this part of your body. Do you furrow your brow? I know I do some. So I can even see it in myself that I have furrowed my brow over my life, and it's really nice to just do a little massage and pull that back out, to close your eyes and see widely. So here's a breathing exercise that I like to do for the sixth chakra. Imagine you have curtains over your windows of perception, and you want to inhale and spread those curtains wide. I think of it often, you know, I travel a lot, and I stay in hotel rooms, and hotel rooms usually have these very heavy blackout drapes, and I'll wake up in the morning, maybe I'll get in late at night and not really see where I am, and I wake up in the morning, I go to the window, and I open them up, and I look out wide, where am I? And then I think, oh, I want to go back to sleep, and I shut them and I close my eyes. So this breathing exercise is sort of like that. We inhale, we bring our hands close to our eyes. So bring your hands up in front of your eyes and imagine you're opening those curtains on your third eye as you inhale and open your eyes wide. Exhale, close your eyes, bring your hands over your eyes. Inhale, open wide, spread your arms wide. Exhale, hands over the eyes as you close your eyelids. Inhale, widen, open, exhale, close. Inhale, open and widen, exhale, close, rapidly. Inhale through the nose, exhale through the mouth. So how do we discharge the sixth chakra? Well, one technique that I learned long ago when I was studying at Berkeley's Psychic Institute, this was probably 45 years ago, was a technique called blowing pictures. So we have all kinds of pictures in our heads. Things that we remember, pictures of how something should be, pictures of how we think it is. And a lot of those pictures are part of the challenge of illusion. They aren't real. So if you are going to a job interview, for example, and you have this picture you just can't get rid of that oh, there's so many people applying for the job, and my resume's not good enough, and why would they hire me? All those negative pictures need to be blown out of the way, out of your consciousness. So all you do is close your eyes, allow the picture to come into your mind as an image, and then imagine creating a rose or some kind of container that you put the picture in. So you just take that negative picture of being rejected on your job interview, and you put it in the rose, or you put in a box, anything you're imagination wants to use, and then you imagine you've got this third eye laser beam that can disintegrate and just blow up the rose or blow up the box until it isn't there anymore. And we do that until we can get some of these pictures out of our head. Then we make room to see clearly. So we'll take this into doing a yoga flow and working with gazing at various places, called drishti in yoga, as we develop our stillness and our center line. In chakra six, we want to work with the element light. We want to imagine our core as a glowing column of light. And as we move, we want to train our gaze to be fixed on a single point. So inhale your hands up over head. Interlace your fingers all except the first finger, making a steeple position, and keep your gaze fixed on your fingertips as you arch back, drawing a straight line across the ceiling, until you find the limit of your flexibility, and then just as steadily draw it back forward. And as you bow forward from the hips, keep your gaze fixed on your fingertips, as if you had a flashlight between them and you were making a straight line on the opposite wall and down along the floor as you bring your forehead to your knees and your hands to either side of your feet. Inhale halfway up and look forward. Exhale, take your forehead back down to your feet, hands on either side of your feet, and take your right leg back just a few feet, both legs straight. Separate your hands on either side of your front foot and move your right leg back another foot, taking your right knee to the ground. Finding your stability here, once again, interlace your hands up overhead, draw the line up as you take your gaze across the ceiling and back to the limit of your flexibility, and just as steadily draw that line forward and take your hands down to the floor. Press your hands into the floor and take your left foot back next to your right for a downward dog. Come forward onto your knees and allow yourself to come down to your forearms, keeping your elbows underneath your shoulders. Your forearms should be parallel to each other, fingers spread wide. Tuck your toes underneath and lift your hips once again for a dolphin pose. Lift your gaze to look between your fingertips. Bring your knees back down to the ground. And tuck your toes underneath and press up into downward dog. And now bring your right foot forward between your hands, left foot to the mat. That is the other side, right? Your right foot forward between your hands, left knee to the mat, and from the low lunge, find your stability, and inhale, your hands back up, make the steeple position again, and once again draw that line backward on the ceiling to the limit of your flexibility, and just as steadily draw it forward, bringing your fingertips to the mat in front of your right foot, and then separating your hands and lifting your hips up, bringing your right leg forward just about a foot. Both legs straight. Lengthen through the tailbone. And bring your forehead down toward your knee. Bringing your fingertips together if you feet that you are in balance. Then separate your hands, bring your back foot forward next to your right foot. And inhale your crown up. Bring your fingertips up overhead. Interlace your fingers and draw your hands back. Draw your hands back across the ceiling once again to the limit of your flexibility and back up. Close your eyes and bring your palms together, returning to anjali mudra prayer position, once again imagining that your body is a glowing vessel of light. The next pose we're going to do is eagle pose, or garudasana. It's a good pose that squeezes you like wringing out a washcloth, and you want to keep focused on your core. So inhale your hands up over your head. Inhale your hands up overhead. And then swing them down and bring your right arm underneath your left, and if possible, wrap your fingers around so you can touch palm to palm. Swing your right arm underneath your left, and if possible, wrap your forearms around each other so that you come palm to palm. Focus your third eye right on that center line and lift your elbows and lower. And then, shifting your weight to your left leg, lift your right leg, bend your left knee, and wrap your right knee over your left thigh. If possible, wrap your toes around your calf, although many people can't do that until years of practice. And take your hips down. Focus and concentrate on your core. See it as a band of light. And then rise up, take your right foot to the floor, release your hands, bring them overhead. And as you exhale, bring your hands down around and bring your left arm underneath your right, wrapping your arms around in the reverse direction. Find your center and your core, maybe even touching your thumb to your third eye. Lift and lower your elbows, stretching out your shoulders. Take your weight onto your right leg. Find your balance. Bend your right knee. Bend your left knee. Take your left thigh over and wrap your right leg around, if possible, tuck your toes underneath your right ankle, and lift up into the crown. Squeeze, and then rise up, lifting your left leg, freeing your arms and bring them together. So there's an eye exercise that comes from yoga that is good for strengthening the muscles of your eyes, and actually they say it is good for helping to improve your vision. And it's simply looking in different directions systematically. Yogic eye exercises. Look directly forward from a calm place. And then, following a straight line, lift your eyes up, looking as high as you can without moving your head, looking up toward your eyebrows, and then a straight line down past the center line and look down below, again, without moving your head. Then bring your eyes once more up to center. And now, without moving your head, take your eyes to the right as far as you can. And then looking across a horizontal line, take them to the left as far as you can, and back to center. Now we're going to go diagonally, looking to the upper right, across the center and to the lower left, again, without moving your head. And back to center. And now up to the upper left. And down to the lower right. And back to center. Now we're going to lift our eyes up again without moving the head, and take them around the clock to the right, down below, up the left. Circle them around a couple times. And then back to center. And then once again lift your eyes upward without moving your head. Take them around the clock in the opposite direction, to the left and down, and to the right and up. A couple times, and then back to center. Then close your eyes and rub your hands together, creating some friction and some heat in your palms. And when you feel that heat in your palms, gently cup your hands over your eyes, and feel the warmth. So I mentioned how when we block off this chakra we often furrow our brow. So a nice thing to do is do a forehead pull. Take your four fingers along the midline of your forehead and press in and pull out toward the side of your head. Maybe a couple times. And then when you get to your temples, massage your temples. And then go back to the inner corner of your eyebrows. Really press, it's probably going to be a little tender, and pull, follow your eyebrows out, just massaging gently. And then I like to take it around to the bottom of the skull and just do a little tapping here. That's a good third eye stimulation. So the exercise for today, I call capturing light. If you go outside and you see light glinting off a windshield, or you see a very beautiful color, like a very red rose or a very pink shirt or something that is just a very rich green lawn, pause, take a breath, and really open your eyes to see it. Drink in that color or that light. Drink it in and nourish yourself with it. And look at it until you can close your eyes and see it in your own mind. So practice closing your eyes. Can I still see it? If not, I'm going to open it and look at it more. Drink. Close my eyes. Ah, now, I can still see the image of that red, red rose. You're depositing it to your inner temple. I've been doing this for a number of years, and I find that as I do it, my ability to visualize gets brighter, the colors in my dreams gets brighter, my imagination gets more intense. It's sort of like, if you put those colors on your palette, then you can use them in the painting. So nourish yourself with light. Light is a vitamin, just like vitamin C or protein or anything else that we need. We need light, and most of us are light starved. Tomorrow we're going to explore seeing in the bigger way, looking at the bigger picture, and maybe even creating a vision for yourself. And remember, when we get to the manifestation current at the end of this course, you'll learn about how to bring that vision down into reality and really create its manifestation.

LESSON 20 - Third Eye Chakra: Healing the Spirit by Creating a World of Beauty
--------------------
<v ->We've now looked at the third eye in terms of the body,</v> and now we move into the soul. It's often said that the eyes are the window to the soul. Here, we look at creating and seeing a world of beauty. I think of beauty as a very underrated spiritual value, that when we see beauty, we know we're very close to the divine, and here, we're one step away from our ultimate seventh chakra, connection with everything. So being able to see is about opening to the big picture, and what an amazing picture it is, of how everything goes together, the world we're creating, to see through time and space, and even see our perspective from cosmology that we are this little speck of a planet, and one star among billions of stars in our galaxy alone. And then when you consider that they're now saying there are trillions, not billions, but trillions of galaxies, each with billions of stars as big as our own, that is an incredible expanse of universe that we are living in. And we are probably the only creatures on this planet that are capable of seeing out that far through our telescopes, and seeing into the micro through our microscopes, so our ability to see into past and future, large and small, is enhanced by this chakra. And so when we look at how this chakra is impacted by the world or how we can impact the world, it all comes down to creating a vision. I think people today, and societies in general, are floundering for lack of a vision. Most of what we have built came from a vision that was active at one time, and now we need a new vision, a new vision of what we can become at this time on the planet. We have the most amazing technology we've ever had, power is in the hands of the common people like never before, we can go where we want, we can say what we want, we can broadcast, we can create, and we can put this out and share among the millions. But what is it we want to create together? What is the vision of where we're going in the future? What is our evolutionary vision? That's what we want to create in this chakra. And then we want to use our throat chakra to tell a vision and broadcast that everywhere. When people come to a building site to work, there's piles of lumber and glass and nails and cement, they don't know what to do with it unless there is a blueprint, and the blueprint says, "This is the house we're building." And by that blueprint knowing what they're building together, each of the workers knows what to do with the materials they have. Well, in the same way, we need to be building an architecture of the future, we need to be making that architecture something that fits onto the human body and the human predicament and the human journey of its soul. So we talked about how illusion is the challenge of this chakra, and there's a major illusion that many people are under, and that is that we are all separate from everything else, that I'm separate from you, that we're separate from the planet, we're separate from the cosmology, one race or gender is separate from another, and we call that the illusion of separation. But as we come in to see the big picture, we see that we're really all one. Just think about when we first saw the pictures from the Moon landing of looking back at the Earth from space, there were no political boundaries of countries, it was just one single blue planet floating in space. Another way to think of this is to look at the ocean, each wave is individual, but each wave comes out of the body of the ocean, and each wave is connected to every other. So if you were just a little fish on the tip of a wave, you might think each one was separate, but as the wave goes back down, you realize this is all one ocean of creation and each one of us is rising and falling. So seeing, especially in the imaginative sense, is an act of creation. If you hurt yourself and you keep looking at your knee and you see it as whole and healthy, you're actually beginning to create that reality. Attention follows what we see, what we see is what we download. So where you have your gaze fixed, whether you're looking at the positive or negative, that all has an effect on what you are receiving and what you are creating. So begin to see something, even if it isn't there yet, to see the cities turning green, to see people being helped, to see a new world, and every day that you visualize that, you bring it that much closer to coming into being. So make use of your power to visualize. Instead of seeing roadblocks, turn them into stepping stones, opportunities, see them as possibilities for what you can create. Audrey Hepburn said, "It's not that we have the word impossible, "the very word says, 'I'm possible'". So see possibilities instead of roadblocks. So the practice here, as we come up into our sixth chakra, is a practice of becoming still. Imagine that your consciousness is reflected in everything around you, if you want to see the contents of your consciousness, just look at the world you've created, it's a reflection. Our general world is a reflection of our collective consciousness. But in order to see that reflection clearly, you have to be still. Imagine you're camping out in the wilderness, next to a big beautiful lake, behind which are mountains. If you wake up early in the morning and you sit in front of the lake when the lake is perfectly still, the surface of the water is like a mirror that reflects the mountains clearly, no distortion. As the ducks wake up and the boats come and the children swim and the wind comes up, there will be waves on the water, and then that image is broken up into pieces and you won't see so clearly. Well, all day long, there are things stealing our attention, saying, "Look at me, look at me, "look at this, look at that", and our attention becomes fragmented. So in meditation and in the act of stillness, we are quieting the mind so that the reflection we see is not distorted, we see it clearly. So if you want to come to clarity, allow yourself to come to stillness. So the exercise for today is to take some time and really come into stillness. And in that stillness, bring yourself up to your third eye, and take a perspective on something from outside yourself. Maybe you imagine being in another person that you're having conflict with, and imagine you're looking out through their eyes at their world. Maybe you're taking the perspective of someone that's very different from you, a different gender, a different race, a different nationality. Take perspective of someone you don't like and see what it looks like from their point of view. If you really want to up it, take a perspective from beyond this Earth or looking at the whole earth. What if you were a god or a goddess looking at the planet, what would you see, what would you change, what would you imagine? The more we expand our perspective, the more we expand our world and our understanding, the more we see the big picture. So that takes us through chakras five and six, the throat and the brow. Tomorrow is an integration and review day, and then next week, we will start our seventh chakra and our conclusion of the upward current.

LESSON 21 - Summary of Your Third Week & Live Call Recording
--------------------
<v ->Okay, you've made it this far.</v> You've done chakra five and chakra six. Six out of seven; that's pretty good progress. How are you feeling? What's happened? What are your moments of insight? What exercises really work for you? I'd love to know that. I'd love to know what's happening in you as a result. So once again, share things with the tribe. Interact with each other. See what other people are doing. You can contribute to each other's insights. So remember what it feels like to open your throat. To get somebody off your back. To loosen that jaw tension. To write down, what are you really trying to say? Remember how we drank in light to bring light into your inner temple. How you looked down at yourself going through a particular day. You could also use that exercise for any situation. Look at yourself and how you're behaving in a relationship. Or look at yourself back in different stages of your life. So we're working through a lot. Six chakras. It doesn't mean the first two chakras have been handled by now or the third and fourth. We always have issues coming up. But now you have a set of tools to go back and apply to these issues. So you may find you're still working on your first chakra. I've taught this many times, and even all the way through, somebody says, you know, I'm still working on those survival issues. Sometimes that's big for people. Or maybe you're still working on your power issues. But do keep up. Share what you're doing with the tribe. Download next week's chakra companion workbook. We're going to look at chakra seven, and then we'll do some integration and get ready for the manifesting current that is the last week.

LESSON 21 - Week 3 - Q&A Call with Anodea Judith

Let's get started. Hi, Rainbow Warriors. Good morning, good afternoon, or good evening, whatever the case might be for you. I am Alex, and on behalf of the Mindvalley team, I'd like to welcome you to your chakra healing Q &A coaching call. We have a great session prepared for you today. We'll be covering very interesting topics, mainly belonging to the third week of your quest. And first of all, congratulations. You passed the halfway mark. We have two more weeks to go. And during this week, you learned all about chakras five and six, the throat chakra and the third eye chakra. call is going to be focused mainly on these two chakras, and I believe you'll get a lot of great, wonderful insights from tonight's session. That being said, and without further ado, let's welcome our wonderful teacher on this journey, Anandaya Jidit. Hi, Anandaya. Namaste, everyone. Good morning, good afternoon, good evening, good day. Welcome, welcome, welcome, rainbow warriors. So let's close our eyes and go inside to our inner temple. Wherever you are, I see some of you are outdoors. That's great. The sun is on your face. So close your eyes and drop down inside. And we're going to use the powers of imagination this morning in our sixth chakra to imagine a column of light going all the way up and down the inside of you, right through the very center of your body. And that column of light continues all the way up into the heavens and all the way down to the center of the earth. And that column of light is your sacred core. And using the powers of your visualization, imagine a red glowing jewel at the base of your spine, your grounding, your first chakra. Imagine roots. sprouting out of the bottom of your spine into the earth and feel that sense of grounding, of anchoring, of settling down into your chair, into the ground. And then above that, in the sacral chakra, we see a beautiful orange jewel. We're working with light today and just see that in the center of your abdomen. the area between your hips and low back. For women, it's the womb, just below the navel. And feel that right in line with that central line of light, as if the line of light is piercing the center of the jewel, the way a string on a necklace pierces the center. And next we go to the solar plexus, a beautiful yellow jewel, the jewel of fire. a third chakra feel that fire aligned with that central line of light your will your power and then bringing your attention up to the heart and imagine a beautiful green blossoming in the heart like the green that is coming out in spring for those of you in the northern hemisphere green is bursting out everywhere Imagining all those little passages in your lungs. They're like upside down trees. And imagine each one of those is sprouting green leaves. And then coming to the throat, a bright blue. See waves of vibration, waves of sound emanating from your throat chakra. In harmony, make sure you're breathing. Deep inhales, deep long exhales. Then we come up to chakra six. We imagine this vertical line of light and another line of light going forward to back. That is your lifeline. In the front is the future. In the back is the past. And it intersects in the center of your head, that vertical line. And feel how you are living right now in the present moment. But from this place, you can see the past. You can see into the future. And imagine you can take a little bead forward into the future along that lifeline and smooth out the difficulties. Smooth out the struggle. And just infuse that future with light. And then finally coming up to the crown chakra, the one we haven't gotten to yet in our quest, but we can imagine the thousand petaled lotus blooming out of the top of the head and our awareness deeply centered in the very middle of that lotus, allowing the lotus to unfold and yet remaining still and centered. in the center of the flower and see that rainbow all the way up and down the seven jewels indigo in the sixth and violet in the seventh all pierced by a column of light and that is what it means to be a rainbow warrior namaste uh we will kick off tonight's session with a few pre -submitted questions great our first question comes from beatrice She said, I grew up in a family where children should be seen but not heard. Now, as an adult, I have difficulties speaking my truth. How should I go about reclaiming my voice? And basically, where should I start? The first place to begin reclaiming your voice, you can't just start with, why can't I communicate out there? You have to start by listening to the voice that never got heard. If you were in a family that should be seen and not heard then your voice wasn't heard you might not have heard your own voice because if the family's not listening to us we don't even hear ourselves so begin maybe in a meditation or journal writing you know just seeing what does your five -year -old have to say what does your 10 -year -old have to say what does your teenager have to say What does the woman you are, Beatrice, I assume is a woman, have to say? So listening to the voice first and from inside your head, acknowledging, you know, the consciousness that dwells within is hearing that voice. It's receding it. Acknowledge to the five -year -old, I hear you. I hear that you're lonely. I hear that you're scared. I hear that. You want to ask somebody to play and you don't know how. I hear that you don't have any friends. Whatever is their truth. And by letting that child be heard, then that makes more courage able to speak your truth out in your day -to -day life. Using the chakras, how can one stay calm and focused during an important situation, such as an examination or an interview or a talk? Well, thank you, Mudit. I actually saw your question before the call, and it's why I threw in that part of the meditation of the thousand -petal lotus that keeps blooming all the way around you. That's the world unfolding around you in a meeting or a crisis or challenges with children or whatever. But we stay in that dimensionless point in the center, and we allow it to unfold. And the more we practice being in our core and that line of light through the center that I just led you on, the more you practice being there, despite whatever is going on, the more you can remain centered and grounded. And grounded at the other part, when you root down and that grounds you down into your legs and feet, that also keeps you anchored and centered in a challenging situation. You mentioned that blockages in the throat chakra are caused by lies or secrets in some cases. But what about white lies or trying not to hurt someone's feelings? I find that I have to resort to this often. Will these cause problems? And what are your thoughts on this? Yeah, I like the test for communicating something is to answer three questions. Is it true? Is it necessary? And is it the right time? And that of those three questions, you need at least two out of three to be able to say something. So sometimes someone needs a little cheering up in that moment. That means it's necessary and timely. And it might not be exactly true, you know. And that can maybe give them a little support in that moment. But if that's the thing we do all the time, we have to ask, are we being codependent to people? And are we afraid of their reaction if we tell them the truth? Personally, I would rather somebody told me the truth. No, that outfit doesn't look good on you. Yes, you're putting on a little weight. You know, I'd rather know the truth myself. So you can always ask if someone wants to know what you're thinking, if they want some feedback. And if they don't, you have to accept no. I think a lot of us can resonate with this question. How to silence our inner critic? I have always had to deal with this, and I find that by just doing the movements, like in the video, is not enough. What other things should I try? So in the manifestation part of the quest, in the fifth chakra, there will be a specific exercise that we do for silencing the inner critic. But to give you another one, besides that one, since we haven't gotten there yet. And here's what I do with clients when they have a vicious inner critic. I say, well, tell me what your critic is saying. So they tell me, oh, you're no good. You messed that up. You should be farther along in your life right now. You're too fat. You're too whatever. And I kind of take notes on that. And then I say, okay, I'm going to be the voice of your critic. So you could do this with a friend and tell your friend what your critic says. Then the friend says it back to you. Now, I don't feel good saying these things to people, but usually when it's externalized, in other words, it's coming from a real person outside, what happens in the person is say, hey, wait a minute, I'm doing the best I can. Get off my back. Remember that exercise? Get off my back. That's what we want to say to the critic. But by having it instead of right here inside your own head, somebody else saying that, you realize how ridiculous it is. And so externalize it and then talk back to that critic. Defend yourself. Not all people appreciate honest and open communication. I find it especially difficult when delivering feedback to a co -worker and often in my own relationship. How should we deal with these type of challenges? Well, this is certainly true. Not everybody wants to hear the truth. That's quite obvious in our world today. So a few rules for that. I mean, the first thing I think is always to ask permission. Say, you know, I've got some feedback for you if you're willing to hear it. Or I have a withhold. We talked about that in the course. Are you willing to hear it? And again, if the answer is no, you have to accept that. And then when it is delivered, It always helps to begin with a compliment. Well, I really appreciated that you got the report to me on time last week. And you go and instead of but. And I would have liked it to have been corrected before it was submitted. Or I really like that you cleaned up last night and I would have liked for the garbage to be taken out. Or I really liked how, you know, but, or not but, but and, and so you add on. So you sandwich the criticism in two complements. It's in between like a sandwich. The other thing that really makes a big difference is that we speak from the I. We speak from our own experience. And that, you know, we call it I statements. So I felt scared last night when we had a fight. Instead of, you make me scared. Or you're always yelling. Or you do this or you do that. Because as soon as we say you, the person's defenses come up. And when their defenses come up, their listening goes down. And so if we speak the I, and this is using the steps of nonviolent communication as well, a person is much more likely to hear it if it doesn't come across as a criticism, but as a request. Can you tell us more about the bioenergetic movements, starting with where they come from? Sure. Just a little history on that. When humans started to discover their inner psychology, came up with Freud, then Freud and Jung. Jung went into the spiritual dimension of psychology more, and Wilhelm Reich went into the body, and he discovered that there was energy in the body. He called it orgone energy. And then Reich had two students, John Paracos and Alexander Lowen, and they founded core energetics and bioenergetics. Bioenergetics is what I studied more of. And it's the science of moving energy through the body in order to dissolve blocks. And Lowen brought several movements to that, like the grounding movement that we learned. Now with my work in yoga and with the chakras, I have developed more of these movements. You know, bioenergetics is based on the science of charging and discharging. So a lot of them I have come up with myself to add to the body of bioenergetics. So that's a little history of the past and how it comes from. You mentioned trusting our instincts and our intuition. but how do we know that our intuitions are accurate versus based on our insecurities delusions or simple biases well that's really a great question arjun because i think in many ways we don't know for sure and that is something that we need to hold when we get an intuition or a hunch this could be true but it doesn't mean it's automatically true. So we hold it with what we call in English, a grain of salt, you know, a little bit of, you know, filter, a little bit of testing. And, you know, sometimes we can say, all right, is this coming from my higher self or is this coming from my ego? And you ask the question inside, if you know yourself well, then you can know, okay, that's the kind of thing that I'm always doing. I'm always grasping. Or, yes, I'm always getting messages to eat, but I know I eat too much. So those messages are not coming from my higher self. Or I'm getting messages to spend money, but I spend too much money. And so that is not coming from the higher self. Often, if the intuition is really accurate, the ego doesn't even like it. The intuition says, you know, you need to do this or that. And the ego says, I don't want to. And then, you know, it's probably your higher self. So, you know, and then in doubt, ask a friend, say, this is my intuition. I'm getting this hunch that I should. change my job or you know do this whatever your intuition is saying and you know me is that feel accurate is that feel like what i'm always saying to myself that i'm always dissatisfied and i'm going from thing to thing so part of it is self -knowledge and part of it is testing it out and this is a big one how do we learn to see reality clearly that seems like a huge task and how do we start to see ourselves more clearly What would such a process look like? Well, it's certainly a lifelong process of working through illusion as we get wiser and deeper and higher and all that, that things that we held to be true or this has to be, we find out, oh, yeah, that's just, you know, false grabbing, going after money, going after fame, going after this and that. is part of the illusion but how do we do it is your question and in in the quest even i talked about how in order to see clearly you have to come to stillness and everything in life is grabbing for your attention you know we sit at the computer and these little pop -up menus for ads come up and you go to pick up your phone to call someone and there's headlines of news and three messages that you haven't seen yet and everything is distracting your attention so we need to take command of our attention back and when you have command of your attention it becomes like a laser beam that can focus and see anything that you want to look at long enough to see clearly and that's keeping your attention focused on something And, you know, that clarity comes, think of a glass of dirty water. If you let the glass sit really still for a couple days, all the mud in the water will sink to the bottom and the water will become clear. So when we ground, we let everything sink and we let all our grasping and kneading and all that start to slip away in a deep meditation and we come to stillness. That is when things start to clarify. And if you develop that as a state of consciousness, you will see more clearly as you look around at your world. The other thing, and I mentioned this in the quest, is that seeing clearly is sort of like a camera. A camera just takes a picture of what's there. And it sees the mess in the corner and it sees the light coming in and, you know, it doesn't edit. We can do that later. And so if we get rid of our, you know, this is good, this is bad. I want to see this. I don't want to see that. And we just become detached and impartial. It doesn't have to be the way I want it to be. Then we can start to see how it is. So as we come into the transcendent chakras, we have more detachment to see clearly. That's wonderful. Next question comes from Jasmine. I grew up in a Christian culture and struggled with the duality of good and bad and nothing in between. As we arrived in the higher chakras, the word divine is being used. What is your personal definition of the divine? Yeah, I like to use the word divine because it gets out of any religious context. It's not a god or a goddess or some figure. It is a force of grace. It's a combination of power and intelligence and love. to me and actually it has qualities of all the chakras it has the intelligence a greater intelligence than mine it has beauty because the divine the natural world is always beautiful Even in a burned out forest, there's a strange beauty to it. It has truth. It is just what is. It has love. It has power. It feels good. It's pleasurable. And it grounds us in nature, in the natural world, in our body. It's creative. It's a creative force. So I don't think of it so much as a being, but as a force, as an energy. that we can tune into and run through ourselves, and that lives inside each one of us. Great. Let's see. Another question here, and I think it's a variation on something that we answered also in previous calls. Is it typical to feel pulled to both sides of the spectrum with the chakras? I know I am not balanced, but I feel like I swing to both sides of the chakra pendulum. I think that is why I am feeling in my body soothing peace and relaxation, but I also feel discomfort and some sort of confusion. What are your thoughts on this? Yeah. So, I mean, that does mean it's common. And I find it interesting because so many people will ask a question sort of asking, do other people do this too? So it's sort of underneath that is, am I okay that this is how it is? And of course you are. But I like to get out of, you know, just is it typical, but just to make that a deeper inquiry into what's going on. So we are learning to manage our charge. We're learning to manage our life force and balance it. And, you know, recently outside in the garden, we broke a pipe. We had a plumbing problem. We had to turn the plumbing off. And then when we turned it back on, I open the water in the sink and it goes, you know, it's really, it bursts out and then there's nothing and then it bursts out and there's nothing. And that's because, you know, we were fixing a problem. So when you are learning to open up the chakras, open up your charge, it may be turbulent at some times. And then other times when that charge is dissipated, discharged, let go of, then we can feel really calm and peaceful. And then. that gate is open and then maybe something else comes up and it's turbulent again. And then we have another insight and, oh, we let that go and it's calm and peaceful. So that's kind of like what the ride is like. And as you practice over the years and as you work these things out, it becomes more calm and more peaceful more of the time. And that's what I can tell you. Wonderful. An upvoted question, which is similar to this one, comes from Claire here and she says, often in the beginning of the day, I feel balanced. I am proactive and I can pursue and accomplish my plans. But then at a point, a few hours later, I enter into a deficiency mode and flop, stop, and I am unable to carry through. I need time out, rest, and start again later. Then I can go into overdrive to catch up. Is this normal to move through all of these modes within a day? So again, that question, is it normal? So it's not whether it's normal or not that is really the issue. It's how do you keep your energy more sustained for the day? And most people that I've seen with this pattern, it has a little bit to do with how much coffee they drink and keeping their blood sugar steady. My partner had this problem, and I started correcting how he ate, and I saw he drank half a pot of coffee in the morning, no food, went out to work, and then crashed in the middle of the day. And I said, well, of course, you haven't had any protein to sustain you. You're not keeping your blood sugar steady. regular meals, getting some breakfast, getting some lunch, maybe not doing too much coffee because that stimulation then has a crash. And learning to pace yourself. That's something I've had to learn a lot in life because I'm a go -getter. I just want to go out and do. And I think, oh, I can do just another hour of this and I'll be finished. And then I'm kind of over the line. So learning to pace myself, learning to breathe, learning to take time to smell the flowers. um makes a a big difference so we have to pay attention while we're doing it and then you have a steadier movement of energy all day long and you're doing the right thing when tired rest very true uh our next question comes from alex a different diacs of course uh alex says how is manifestation related to the third eye How is manifestation? Well, we'll get that in the manifestation current, but just to give you a heads up here, this is where we have our vision. And a vision of what we want to create is what guides our path. It guides our attention. It guides what we download into consciousness. So if I sit down at my desk and I don't have a clear vision of what I want to accomplish, I'm going to spend all day answering email and poking around on Facebook. Whatever grabs my attention is going to take me unless I know what I'm going to do. So we begin manifestation by having a vision of what we want to accomplish and continuing to see that in our mind's eye in its finished, completed form. So if I'm writing a book, I keep seeing the book. published and in my hand and on the shelf in bookstores. That's its finished form. If you want to manifest a business, you visualize every day that there are customers coming into your business, there are clients coming into your practice, there are students coming into your classes, whatever it is that you want to manifest, that's what you keep seeing. It's a target, but it only exists here. Our next question comes from Tanya. She says, could my hypothyroidism be the principal cause of the imbalance in my throat chakra? And if I find a way to bring it to balance, could it help me cure a little bit of this hypothyroidism? Well, I think that the hypo and hyperthyroidism is related to fifth chakra, very much so. But which is the chicken and which is the egg? I think the imbalance in the chakra... will then cause the imbalance in the endocrine system in the thyroid. And I've seen this in many of my clients. One was going in because she had a tumor on her thyroid. She was going in for surgery, and she came to me for a couple sessions. And very quickly, she dropped into this memory that seemed like from a past life where she said something and got her throat cut. Now, was that real or not real in a former life? There's no way to know, but it really cleared something for her. Now, she was so close to needing the surgery that that wasn't canceled. She went ahead and had the surgery. But I think that the imbalance in the chakras then caused the imbalances in the physical body. So as we address those concerns and that hyperthyroidism, too much thyroid, overactive, might be because that can be very speedy and that can be like too much pressure overcharge in the fifth chakra. Hypo might be that you've been keeping your words down and blocking them and that's being blocked right at the throat chakra so it's toning down the thyroid. Can it heal? it completely. You know, I'm not qualified to say that in every case. I think there's a lot of new agers that think if I just visualize the right thing, my cancer is going to go away. I think it's more complicated than that. And sometimes we need medical attention or we need to take thyroid medication, but still we can address what's underneath. Great answer. I saw a fantastic comment here from Jackie that said, listening to Anadea's responses to everyone is simply fantastic. It reminds me that I need to practice daily during this class. And it also reminds me that I should be rereading all of her books and listening to her audios. Thank you. Yeah, there's a lot in the books too. Yeah. Fantastic. Okay. Next question on the list here is about the third eye chakra again. You talk about the illusion of separation when we are in fact just one. Do you have any advice to help us feel more in sync with this notion of one at moments when we feel overwhelmed or sometimes when we are attacked from all sides? You know, in this archetypal energy that we get into in the sixth chakra, We realize that whatever's happening to us in a situation, we're not the only ones that happens to. If you're a woman and you feel like you've been the target of sexism, well, you're not the only woman to have that experience. If you feel like you've been the target of racism, you're not the only person to have that experience. And that doesn't make it right that someone is racist by any means, but it means that there's a more universal connection that takes us into something larger. Instead of an individual persecution, this is happening to me, this is happening in the larger field. And instead, we can say, what is that larger field asking of me in this situation? What is it trying to wake up in me? What is it trying to develop in me? Is it more balance? Is it more compassion? Is it more stillness? Is it more patience? That's one of mine, to be patient. What is the situation asking? And then you're looking again at the bigger picture. It's all a matter of perspective. down here on the earth I look out and I see individual trees and I see my neighbors houses and things like that. When I go up in an airplane I can see that that's just all one bit of the countryside. I can see it's all, you know, I can fly over my state, over my country, over another country, and we get the perspective that it's all connected. You look at the earth from space, you see that it's all one. So I'd say raise your perspective higher and get out of your individual self and look at the bigger picture to see this connection. I saw a question here from Lori, which we touched on at the beginning of the call a little bit. What advice do you have for a person with a fear of public speaking? Well, there's a good calming point right on the outside of your wrist here and on the outside of your ankle bone that will calm you down. But, you know, I do a lot of public speaking. And believe me, when you stand in front of a crowd of hundreds of people or thousands or even... 10, you know, the charge goes up in your body. And what makes people afraid of public speaking is that they're afraid that charge will get them off center. And you can sometimes hear it in the voice. Oh yeah, that person's nervous. What I do is I ground the charge. I ground down into my feet and do a couple of knee bends and deep breaths. I come into my core, I come into my heart. And I connect to something higher. For me, I connect to grace. That's my word for it. And often, you know, if I do that, something will come through me and come out of my mouth that I didn't even know I was going to say that's just perfect in that moment. So I ground down into my feet. I take a deep breath. I connect to grace. And then I get myself and my little ego out of the way. It's not Anadeya up there talking. It is. I'm just a vessel for something greater to come through. And so then my ego of how I'm going to do doesn't get hooked up as much. How does one chakra affect another chakra if the chakras are not next to each other? For example, the root chakra related to the third eye chakra. Yeah, great question. And we'll get some of that when we get to integration of all the chakras next week, second half of next week. The lower chakras are a base to support the upper chakras. And here's how I think of it. They're spinning wheels, right? And you have one current, you see those figure eight patterns in so many drawings of the chakras. You know, you see the lines, the center line, and then the figure eight, sort of like the caduceus, the healing symbol. Those are called the sushumna, the center channel. And the Ida and the Pingala are the masculine and feminine channels. Ida is feminine, Pingala is masculine. Or Ida is moon, Pingala is sun, cool and warm. So they're opposite. So one flows down and one flows up. So as they're going like this, one's going down, one's going up, it's going to make a chakra spin. But this one's going down, it's going to make it spin in the opposite direction. As the chakra expands, That spinning, let's say the spinning of my heart right here, is going to start to make this spin, which is going to make this spin. I hope that makes sense to you. And then as we expand the energy, it will push up into the next chakra. Now, how does root relate to being in the third eye, for example? Well, many, many years ago, like 40 years ago, when I was studying at Berkeley Psychic Institute, there was somebody on the tribe that mentioned they were there too. I was not a very grounded person and I studied there because I had a lot of psychic intuition but it was very irregular I didn't know quite what to do with it sometimes it was on sometimes it was off sometimes I was right sometimes I wasn't and I wanted to learn how to manage it better so I saw these courses and I started taking them and the first thing they taught me was grounding and being in my body it wasn't about opening this but I found that as I got grounded and I learned the difference between being in my body and being out, my vision got clearer. My physical vision got better, and my psychic vision got better. And I didn't see just everything. I could focus my attention better. So again, the lower chakras are a base that holds up. the upper chakras especially the root it said that muladhara means root support so we get the support to come up and blossom the plant needs deep roots in order to flower and we're coming up into the thousand petaled lotus or flower in the crown we need really good roots to do that and every chakra plays a part in relating to every other chakra Could you say something about how to improve our intuition? And is this related to developing the third eye chakra? Yeah, intuition is like a muscle. The more you use it, the stronger it gets. So practice using it in ways like, you know, if you hear your phone ringing before you look. to see who's calling, see if you can guess. Say, hmm, I wonder who that is. And notice when somebody's face just comes to your mind and then they call or they call and before you pick up the phone, you know it's them. Ask yourself, you know, questions during the day. And let yourself work with symbols. Like I was driving once trying to find a location. This was long before cell phones had mapping on them. It was before cell phones, actually. And I decided in my mind, I said, all right, I'm going to see a flash of red when I get to the driveway. And I just, you know, set that up in my mind. And I was driving along and all of a sudden. The car in front of me slammed on their brakes several times and the brake lights flashed red, red, red. And I looked and that was the house. So it manifested. So you start to set up questions in your mind. Should I do A or B? And then you look at, all right, A would look like this and visualize that. Okay, it would have this much color and light and would feel like that. And B would look like this. Oh, that doesn't have as much light. That doesn't feel as grounded. That picture is not as clear. then you know that maybe A is the answer that you want. So make up ways that your mind can ask questions and just start exercising your intuition and testing it out. And as you develop it, you'll become more confident in it. I have noticed that you and Ade are changing clothing colors according to the chakra we are working on. Can the energy of the colors support the work of the chakra in the same color? I think it helps to remind us. I have a friend that when she learned grounding from me, and she was very much an in -her -head kind of girl, she went out and bought some red socks. Because when she put on the red socks, it would remind her to be grounded. Now, did the red actually ground? Who knows? There are studies of the effects of color on the nervous system and we know that different colors have different effects. Red is invigorating and blue is calming. Then we say somebody's green with envy. Well, I don't know how that works, but does the vibration really help or is it just something inside that helps us connect? I can't really answer that. There haven't been any systematic. studies. But I love to play with the color. Yeah. Wonderful. Another question here from Amy. What advice do you have for someone who has suffered from depression for most of their life and would like to go off antidepressants that numb your emotions, but fearful of the brutal withdrawals of such a process? Yeah, well, it's true. There is quite the withdrawal period. And if you go off antidepressants, you need to do it with whatever doctor prescribed them so you can do it very slowly. And there's things you need to do instead in order to support going off. One of them is exercise. Vigorous exercise will clear the liver. It will clear the toxins from your body. It moves energy. So join a gym and work out several days a week. That's a must for overcoming depression. Another is paying attention to diet. A lot of studies have shown that eating gluten, which is in wheat, contributes to depression. Sugar contributes to depression. So stay off carbs as much as possible, and that can help with it. And then the third thing is really dealing with the source of the depression. It's probably something from your childhood where you got your energy shut down. And, you know, you may need to uncover what that is and work through those feelings. I like thinking of depression as the repression of expression. So when you're not allowed to express, that's when we get depressed. Consciousness is pushing down. So see what wants to be expressed and let that. So threefold, exercise, diet. and some kind of therapy to look at what are the causes. And these exercises, bioenergetic exercises to move your energy help too. What causes the chakra to spin in the wrong direction and what can be done to spin it in the right direction? Okay, I always somewhere along the line get the question about spinning and I don't actually believe there is a right and wrong direction. I think that when we think of chakras as some, you know, flat, round thing like the face of a clock, then the clock can spin clockwise or counterclockwise, you know, right or wrong direction. But chakras aren't a flat thing that is just spinning in this way or that way. And so they are deep, like more like a sphere, more like a globe. a ball that is spinning out into our life. And I don't think there's a right or wrong direction. And I don't think changing that when some psychic healer says, oh, let's make it spin this way. I don't think that's going to change anything at the core any more than if I part my hair on the other side, I'm going to be smarter. You know, what we're talking about is deep core patterns that are not going to be permanently affected. On a superficial level. Now that superficial level on a temporary basis can feel a little better. You know, just like taking a shower makes you feel better. You get clean, but it doesn't change your interior patterns in life. So I don't think the spinning is so important. How is one's chakra affect the other one's chakra when you are in a couple, for example, between husband and wife? Yeah, well, they certainly do. And I think that, boy, that's another book I could write someday, Chakras and Relationship, that we tend to balance each other or seek someone that is going to balance us. So, for example, I see a lot with women who are not in their power and haven't reclaimed their will. They pair up with a man who is very powerful. Or someone that's not grounded will pair up with someone that's very practical and grounded. And then the grounded person will pair up with somebody very spiritual. And so I think what we find is a kind of balance. And if we stay stuck in that, okay, I'll be the grounded one and you be the spiritual one. Well, then we all stay stuck in our own patterns. What we want to do is learn how to be grounded from the other person or learn how to be spiritual or learn how to be more loving. The excess chakras will come out and they will match often somebody else's deficient chakra. So an excess fifth will match a deficient fifth chakra. An excess heart might match a deficient heart. It's not always true. And then when someone is discharging energy, like they're in anger or something like that. It's important not to take that energy into our chakras. I like the advice of kind of energetically turning sideways. Maybe you don't do it physically, but you just sort of close your chakras down a little. Let that person finish discharging. Let them dump their anger or whatever they have to say until they're discharged. And then you can turn back, open up your chakras again and say, well, I heard you say this and I heard you felt. that? And do you want to hear what I have to say? After they're discharged, that's much easier, but don't take that energy into your chakras if it feels toxic. Do we need to close our third eye chakra or leave it open, but will that make us vulnerable to other types of attacks? You know, I don't know whether it's just the third eye chakra that would make you vulnerable to attacks. I'm not, you know, big on attacks myself. I think mostly life happens. The thing I see when someone's third eye chakra is too open is that they get bombarded with too many images. Long, long time ago when I was doing psychic readings at fairs and also I was, you know, part of a church and I would do them on the audience and all that. And I had, I was doing so much of that. It was open so wide. I found that when I was parking my car and the tire hit the curve, I could see sparks in my mind's eye. And I went, wait a minute, this is just too open. I'm seeing everything. And it actually, when I got pregnant with my son, it was like so overloading. I had to just stop doing that work because I couldn't, I was just too, too unbalanced with the. pregnancy. So yeah, if we get bombarded and there's too much coming in, we get overwhelmed and then we need to shut down a little. But I think in general, keeping our eyes open is a good way to avoid the mishaps. You know, I find most of the things that have happened to me in life was because I wasn't really looking. And I didn't really look ahead that, oh, this could happen in this relationship or this could happen if I do this. Or, you know, to look down the road, I didn't have my eyes open. So I think having your eyes open makes it less likely you're going to trip on something. So I see a follow -up question here. Can you please explain again this idea of opening and closing the chakra? What does that mean and how do we do it? You know, the chakras are also called lotuses, which is a kind of flower. Flowers have many petals. And so to open it, I like to get energy going through, to imagine those petals opening wide. And to close it down, like an exercise you might do before you go to sleep. I think I mentioned this on another call. Look at what did you think today? What did you see today? What did you speak about today? Where did you love today? And after each question, fold up the petals a little bit. the way a flower sometimes folds up at night and if you are in a very open situation like people that take my workshops they get all opened up and then they're about to go home and they have to get on an airplane or drive in traffic or go back to the city i tell them oh close down a little bit fold those petals over so you're not tightening the chakra like that the chakra is still open but it's protected and that's really we don't want to close down we want to protect ourselves and that's different when we're protected we can stay open wonderful here's a fun question is your favorite color a suggestion that that might be also your strongest chakra i think that could be and i think the colors you know When I teach a live workshop, I have a seven -day workshop, and the students are told, and I have to bring a lot of luggage, but to wear red on the first day, to wear orange on the second day. The whole class does. So, you know, we've got like 40 people sitting there all dressed in shades of red. And people always tell me, you know, when I had to do that exercise in PAC, I realized I didn't have any yellow, and I've avoided it all my life, or I didn't have any red, or I never, you know, I wore only black and white. um and that might be a it might be more about a chakra you're avoiding the colors that you avoid now some of it you know maybe a redhead doesn't look good in red or somebody's complexion doesn't look good in yellow that's also true but um yeah there was a time i was really working on my third chakra and i was visualizing a lot of yellow all around me and i went to the dentist and this was a dentist that worked in his home And he came into my appointment and then he said, excuse me, I want to change my shirt. And he came down in a yellow shirt and he said, I just had a feeling you'd like that better. And I said, well, I've been visualizing yellow in my meditations every day. That's amazing. Let's go with one more question. Let's go with the last one here. And that came from Karen. When we run our hands together and put them over our eyes, are our eyes open or closed? Closed. Yeah. And you just let the heat come over your eyelids and soak into your eyes. All right. Two weeks left, folks. We're almost to the top of the chakras. Then we look at a global vision and then we take it back down. So great to see you. Have a wonderful evening, day, whatever it is. And much love to you. Rainbow blessings. Namaste. That's all for me. All there is left to say is stay committed, Rainbow Warriors. work and the piece that's in front of you. We have two more weeks to go. So thank you very much for all of your questions, your comments, your engagement, your participation, for showing up and for playing full out. And until next call, be extraordinary, my friends. Take care. Bye bye.

Week 4: Heal Your Crown Chakra & Begin Your Downward Current

====================

LESSON 22 - Crown Chakra: Healing the Psyche by Surrendering Into Grace
--------------------
<v ->Welcome to the seventh chakra,</v> our final step in the upward current. If you've made it this far in this course, congratulate yourself. You've done an amazing job to take in this much material in a short time so pat yourself on the back. And if you've missed a couple calls, that's probably normal and you're just jumping in at this point, that's perfectly fine. Make a point to go back at some time later and pick up on the chakras you missed. Right now, we're going to step across the threshold into the realm of pure consciousness. So your lower chakras are the stepping stones to your highest consciousness. We mentioned how roots that go deep allow the plant to grow tall, how those roots need to be watered and water needs to move all the way through, how we need to harness the sunlight, that's your power chakra, your fire, to bring that fire into the belly and into your core and how we want to blossom out from the heart and expand and soften. We attune in the throat, we see our way in the sixth chakra, but here's the question. Who is it that's doing all of that? Who is it that's living inside you, seeing out from your eyes, hearing these words right now, living in your body, running the show of your life, making your decisions? Who is that and how do you know? Ultimately, it's consciousness. It's consciousness that's doing all that, consciousness that sees, consciousness that hears and turns those words into meaning, consciousness that loves and feels the connection with everything else, consciousness that knows how to take action and what to do, consciousness that feels, and consciousness that is operating your body. So stepping into the seventh chakra is actually using that consciousness to examine itself, to examine your own consciousness, to be aware of your own awareness, and that near exercise is one that takes you into the thousand petals unfolding. So why is it important to come to consciousness? Well, all of the great spiritual movements from so many traditions are about realizing the consciousness that is behind everything. It's consciousness that's infinite. It doesn't take up any room. It doesn't take up any time. It can expand indefinitely. It's our consciousness that allows us to see out to the stars, to see inside us. It's consciousness that is operating and creating everything that we experience. If it weren't for consciousness, you wouldn't even know it was there. So what's the psychological aspect of the crown chakra? Well, this one is not so much about a developmental stage because we're constantly learning about the world, processing our thoughts, studying, taking in information, and making our own internal roadmap of the world around us. But there does come a time when we kind of graduate from childhood, when we grow up enough to leave home and go out on our own, and at that time, we begin to make our own worldview. It might not be the same one that your parents taught you. You might have a change in religious ideology, you might have a change in point of view, you're questioning, you're saying, who am I? What am I for? What's my purpose? What am I doing here? We question and we start to create our own worldview, our bigger picture, our understanding of how everything goes together. There's an enormous expansion of consciousness that happens through learning and that happens as we grow up and go out and explore the world. And as we do that and realize that it's consciousness that's running the show, then we want to develop techniques for expanding and refining that consciousness. But one aspect of our higher consciousness you might call higher power. This is where we can download some piece of wisdom or guidance. It seems like it comes from something beyond ourselves. And whether you explain that to yourself as being from a god or a goddess or a spirit guide or just your higher mind, it doesn't really matter. We are reaching to something beyond some kind of grace and downloading it. And some people find that difficult to do which is understandable. Your first experience of your higher power was actually your parents. When you were a little infant and you didn't know much about the world, they were your guidance, they were your teachers, they were the ones who watched out for you and taught you what you needed to know. And if you couldn't trust that for some reason, maybe your parents weren't in the right mind or maybe it just didn't go smoothly or they didn't give you the guidance you needed, or maybe you didn't really trust their wisdom, then you might've closed off your crown chakra a bit to being able to download and trust that higher power. So maybe you go back to the sixth chakra exercise of blowing pictures and maybe doing some forgiveness in the heart, moving that image out of your way, and imagine a divine god or goddess as your parents and download a higher power from that. So another aspect of the consciousness within and the aspect of consciousness that we call the mind, which is not our only consciousness, but that the mind is busy interpreting your experience. The mind is busy making meaning out of everything that happens to you. So when you were growing up as a child and your mother was crossed with you or your father wasn't around much or whatever happened in your life, every time that happened, you took it to mean something and the meaning you gave yourself might have been mommy's having a bad day or it might be there's something wrong with me. That meaning may or may not be accurate but nevertheless, you took bits of meaning from your experience. We do this all the time and as we do it, we add up those bits of meaning to become beliefs. And if you thought I did something wrong so mommy's mad at me and you thought that enough times, you might say there is something wrong with me, I'm fundamentally flawed, and that becomes a negative or limiting beliefs. When we get to the manifestation current, we're going to show you a powerful technique for changing those believes. But right now, just begin to understand that meaning is the component of beliefs and though we want meaning in our lives, we have to watch out for what kind of meaning we take. So what does this chakra look like in and out of balance? Well again, you're not going to see too much physically but ask yourself, do you live up in your head most of the time disconnected from your body? Are you always trying to figure things out? Are you gathering information more than feelings? Do you have trouble keeping your attention focused? Are you overly spiritually attached to your purity? Some of that might be an excessive seventh chakra. If this chakra is deficient, then you might be too anchored in the mundane world. You might be a spiritual skeptic. You might have learning difficulties, rigid belief systems. You might feel separated from spirit like you're alone in the world, close-minded, narrow thinking. Those are deficiencies. But if the chakra is in balance, you feel connected with something larger than yourself. You have the sparkle of intelligence, you're able to think for yourself, you're able to think clearly and learn things, you're in your wisdom and you're able to bring that wisdom into your life. So as we go from first chakra to seventh, we go from having one single body to a multitude of thoughts. We go from the finite to the infinite. And expanded consciousness wants to frolic in the infinite. And one thing that gets in the way of that is our attachments. You might say that's one of the challenges of this chakra. And while attachment might be necessary for making commitments and keep you focused in your lower chakras, you could be attached to taking care of your children for example or attached to showing up for your job, that's pretty normal, but there's other kinds of attachments that keep us from completing the liberating current. So maybe you're attached to what people are going to think of you, maybe you're attached to understanding why and figuring things out, maybe you're attached to looking good, attached to your youth. Of course, we know about attachments to people and pets and money and things, but there's all kind of subtle attachments. And in your workbook, there is a list of common attachments that you might not think about. So circle the ones that you can relate to and as you do, say what can I do to release that attachment, to let it go? Because whenever you release an attachment, you're freeing up your attention from that attachment to come back into your consciousness and be freed up to go somewhere else and that's liberation. So whenever you let go of an attachment, just say, I'm just not going to be focused on that anymore, you free up your attention. Attention is a facet of consciousness and then your attention can go somewhere else. You'll find the experience very liberating, and after all, we're at the top of the liberating current now. So something I want to bring here as we talk about the seventh chakra and the expansion of consciousness is the power of Kundalini. Kundalini is a very powerful force. It's concentrated prana or Shakti or charge. Shakti is the goddess of energy in the Hindu cosmology. And Kundalini is such highly-concentrated charge that it is said to be a like a hot poker that pokes through the knots in a stick of bamboo. Well, we have knots in our chakras. In Sanskrit, they're called Granthis and they are knots that keep the energy from passing through. And I think of them often as where we are not or where we cannot or where we will not instead of just K-N-O-T, the knots that tie us up. But Kundalini is a powerful force. The name really refers to Kundala which means coiled and her full name is Kundalini Shakti, a form of the goddess that takes this concentrated energy and rises chakra by chakra up the spine, piercing each chakra in turn and rising up to the crown. And one reason they call it Kundalini and name it after the form of a serpent, is sometimes when people have Kundalini awakening, they vibrate and they tremble and they move in a kind of serpentine wave-like fashion. So Kundalini is a powerful healing and awakening force but it's a very tricky and unpredictable force to play with. Many people say that the only way to receive Kundalini is through grace. We can invite it through our meditations and our yoga and our practices, but it doesn't happen for everybody and it happens to some people without doing any of that. So we can invite it but we can't control it. Many people say you get it from contact with a guru who awakens these energies within you and that it's only safe to practice Kundalini under the teaching of a guru who is educated and capable in these matters. But I mentioned it here because many people get spontaneous Kundalini awakenings and when that happens, they often don't know quite what's going on or how to tolerate it or how to handle it or treat it. And so if it happens to you, know that it's a powerful healing force that is trying to break through your blocks and take you back to wholeness. You might experience visions, you might hear voices, you might feel tingling or movement in your body, it might keep you awake at night. If that Kundalini awakening is difficult for you and many people have come to me over the years with difficulties with this, I usually find that it's lack of ground, that the energy is only moving up and that's moving toward freedom, yes, but if we have too much freedom, it can become chaos and we need to ground and anchor down into the body. You may need to eat something, you may need to have somebody hug you or touch you to help bring the energy back down to your lower chakras that usually kind of smooths out the difficulty of this ride. But if you can open to it, it's a great healer and awakener. The objective of this quest is not necessarily to awaken your Kundalini. What it is is to open and clear your chakras so that if Kundalini should awaken, there's fewer blocks to push through and you can enjoy and tolerate that spiritual energy. So in this chakra, we want to develop our higher mind. We want to develop and go to higher consciousness, our higher power. And as we release attachment, we find that we're more letting go, we're going in to surrender. Most people that have a spiritual awakening describe it as a kind of interior surrender, a surrender to something greater, a surrender to grace. So think of a difficulty in your life. Take it into meditation. Tune in to a greater field of wisdom. Form the question in your mind. A question is like a browser on your computer. When you type that in, it goes out in this vast field of information that we know is the internet and it downloads the websites that might bring you that answer. So when you ask a question in your mind, you are calling in that information. Sit quietly and just surrender to what comes. Take it dispassionately. Don't decide if it's true or not or good or bad. Just watch. Be it your silent witness. Let that information come to you and it may come in that moment, it may come a few days later, it might come in a dream or a chance conversation with a friend, but the more you put out that question, the more you invite the information to come in. I've sat with a question sometimes for six months or a year. When I wrote Waking The Global Heart, I asked the question, what's the next organizing principle for humanity? And books would tumble into my lap and conversations would happen that would contribute to that until finally, I felt like I had my answer. So if you're struggling with the question of where do you go in your life, what to do about a relationship or a health problem or where to live or career, let yourself sit with a question and don't expect an answer right away. Sometimes, we have to gather a lot of information before the answer comes. Be willing to sit in the unknowing because if you get the answer too soon, there's a whole lot that you're going to miss. So open your mind and see what comes. Know the divine mind always has a plan for your best growth. So your exercise for today is to practice this. Ask a question that you want guidance on. Sit in meditation and notice what happens in your mind, in your conversations, in your dreams, write it in your journal, share it with the tribe, and see what happens. Start incorporating that higher mind. For your seventh chakra skillset, I encourage you to enter into meditation, to practice being in the silent witness. Remember we asked who's living in there? Just sit and ask that question. Who is it that's thinking these thoughts? Who is it that is feeling what I'm feeling? Who is it that's asking this question? How do I know? And just practice observing yourself dispassionately without judgment, without changing anything, just be in your silent witness so that it concludes the first part of chakra seven. So tomorrow would be our day of going into the body but the seventh chakra doesn't have a whole lot to do with the body. So instead, we're going to go into a deep meditation, the primary practice for this chakra. Can't wait to share that with you. In the meantime, write down your reflections and breakthroughs and share it with the tribe. See you tomorrow!

LESSON 23 - Crown Chakra: Expanding Awareness
--------------------
<v ->Welcome back to what would be our body day,</v> but instead we're going into a meditation since the seventh chakra is more about consciousness than the body. Not that the body's void of consciousness by any means, as you will see in this meditation. So find a comfortable place to sit where you can be upright, your crown placed above your base. Tuck your tailbone to the back, draw into your core, and lift your crown up to the heavens while keeping your roots down. Close your eyes, and withdraw your attention from the outer world. And come into the deep and infinite inner world of your own awareness. Let go of everything outside of you and embrace the divine being that lives within your body. Open to your breath. Open to your breath, and notice what it feels like when your body fills with air. And what it's like to release the air. Feel yourself as the breath, inhaling and exhaling, expanding and contracting. Notice the awareness that can become aware of your breath. Notice that that awareness can be directed in the form of attention to anything you choose. And we're going to first direct our awareness to our body. Take an internal scan of your body. Your location in the room, the way you're sitting, the clothes upon your body, the temperature on your skin. Allow yourself to be aware of any aches or pains or tensions and any pleasures that you feel in the body. As you allow your body to become still. And as you become still, you become anchored into the ground. But who is it that lives in this body? Know that you are something more than just the body. Release for a moment your physical identity and allow yourself to move deeper. Release yourself from your physical identity and allow yourself to move deeper. Now let your awareness scan your emotions. What are you feeling in this moment? Are you feeling restless or patient? Happy or sad? I hear it. Simply let your awareness scan your emotional state, even if you're not feeling any particular emotion at all, just notice that. And then ask yourself: who is it that's feeling these emotions? Know that you are more than just your feelings. Allow yourself to release your emotional identity and move deeper. Now we come up to the third chakra. Everything you do, your ego identity, who is it that you think you are in the world? Are you a singer, a mother, a teacher? A worker? A caretaker? And what are the things you do to fulfill that role? Who is it that is doing all those things? Allow yourself in this moment to let go of the urge to do anything at all. And rest in the stillness. Let go of that ego identity and know that you're something more than what you do. Release, and go deeper. Think about all the things, and people, and places that you love. And what it feels like to open your heart and really love. Breathe into your heart chakra. Let your awareness feel that love radiating out from your heart. But who's in there, who is it that is doing that loving? Who is it that connects with other people in caring and compassion? Who is it that wants to be loved? Know that this is part of who you are but there is even more. There's something behind all of that. Let go of your identity as a lover, and go deeper. Bring your awareness up to your throat chakra. Your creative expression, all the things you say, and underneath that, all the things you're trying to say. Who is that in there? That wants to say these things? Who is that that listens to the words of others? That listens to music, rhythm? Who is it that hears and speaks? Know that this is something beyond your creative identity. So release that and move deeper. Now we come to chakra six, the place of seeing. All the things you see in a day, in a week, in a year, in a lifetime. All of the things you remember and imagine. What is doing all that? Who is seeing out through your eyes? Who is imagining and remembering? And with what? Let go of the need to see, and draw your attention inward, and take one more step. Bring yourself up to consciousness itself. Who is the one that lives inside here, thinking my thoughts? Who's the one operating this vehicle, taking me on the journey? What is this faculty of consciousness that even allows me to ask this question? What is questioning? Allow yourself to be aware of your own awareness. Feel the infinity of awareness looking at itself. And then finally, imagine that there is a greater awareness that is looking at you. A greater awareness, that divine mind. A universal intelligence. A greater wisdom that is aware of you and your consciousness. And you are aware of this greater consciousness as well. And as you prepare to conclude this meditation, draw that greater awareness around you like the thousand petals of the lotus that is the symbol of the Sahasrara crown chakra. Imagine that awareness is holding you the way a mother holds a child, the way a flowerpot holds roots around the earth. That awareness is guiding you, is understanding you, is loving you, and is always there around you. Imagine those thousand petals unfold all around you and hold you in a loving embrace. And as it does, your awareness remains in the exact center of that lotus. The center of your crown chakra. And as you come out of the meditation, increase the depth of your breath. And you wiggle your fingers and toes. And at first, just open your eyes just a little tiny slit so the barest amount of light is coming through. And you feel the awareness within you, and the awareness of what's around you beginning to connect. And as you open your eyes wider and return to the world, stay centered in the middle of your thousand petal lotus even as the blossoms unfold in everything around you. Thou art that, namaste. So your exercise for today is to practice the meditation or any kind of meditation that you do. To look in your workbook to remind yourself of the challenge for this week. And make sure you share your experience and lessons with the tribe. And tomorrow we will be exploring the spirit of the crown chakra, and the path to the divine.

LESSON 24 - Crown Chakra: Healing the Spirit by Remembering Your Divine Nature
--------------------
<v ->When I look at evolution,</v> I see that evolution is the god's way of making more gods. What do I mean by that? Well, life on Earth began as single-celled organisms that spread across the planet. It took about three billion years for them to begin to put themselves together. And then we had our first multicellular creatures that became more and more complex, more and more intelligent, more and more capable, and growing into perhaps the most recent but not the last iteration of humans now walking around the planet, texting on cellphones. So as we have evolved, we have become more sophisticated, more powerful, and as I say, more intelligent. If you take this trajectory and you keep on going to total power, omnipotence, to total consciousness, omniscience, to total presence, omnipresence, you're taking a journey to the divine. As we evolve, we are becoming more like gods. We have the power to blow ourselves up, we have the power to change the climate, we have the power to influence the gene pool. For better or worse, for creation or destruction. We have the power on the scale that used to be attributed to gods. In that way, evolution is the god's way of making more gods. But are we godlike? Are we goddess-like? Well, that depends on our consciousness. Do we have the partnership with divine consciousness that enables us to hold these powers with wisdom, with balance? I think the journey through the chakras is the journey through the sacred elements, the sacred earth that brings us our base. The sacredness of pleasure, sacred, well-balanced power, sacred love or divine love, truth, beauty, and wisdom. When we partner with these divine attributes of the chakras, we are evolving our own being and we are evolving to partnership with the divine and its infinite wisdom. Many people think there's nothing beyond us. We are it. That we're not part of divinity, that there's not anything out there that we don't know anything, we can't trust our wisdom. But if you look at the universe with its trillions of galaxies, billions of stars in each one, when you look at the perfection of this planet holding its temperature, its level of oxygen, with its oceans and all the ecosystems that go together, despite what humans are doing to disrupt it, you can't deny there is a divine intelligence at work. Things are not running into entropy, there is an order in everything. So as we contemplate the divine and say what is it, what is this force of grace, of intelligence, of creation that we are privileged to witness and grow toward? And like a plant with its roots in the ground, we reach up and drink in wisdom and grace. And as we do that, we are connecting with the divine. We are taking the journey to awaken the divine within ourselves to see it within each other. So in many fairy tales, there is a story about a king and a queen. And maybe the queen gets pregnant and has a baby that maybe she isn't supposed to have, maybe there's too many kids vying for the throne already. For whatever reason, they decide they're going to let this baby go. They're going to put it in a basket and send it down the river. They're going to put it out in the woods, they're going to put it on a mountain top and make that sacrifice. And we assume if they do that, the baby might die. But we know from all these fairy tales that the baby doesn't die, that the baby in the river is found and raised by a fisherman. The baby that's left in the woods or on a hillside is found and raised by a farmer or a baker or a woodcutter. And that baby is raised with love in the world of the common people. It's raised to know their ways, it's raised to be grounded in the practical ways of life, and it's raised with love, but perhaps with parents that have some limitations. And it follows in these fairy tales that sometime around the point of late adolescents, as the child is becoming an adult, through a series of adventures or through a quest or through coincidences, they find their way back to the kingdom and they discover who their parents really are, not the mortal common people that raised them, but the king and the queen. And that they're really set to inherit the throne and become a prince or a princess or a king and a queen themselves. Well to me, this is a metaphor for the mortal parents that raised us with love and did the best they could and taught us the ways of the world that we needed to learn to remember our connection with the commonality of all humanity. And yet, our real parents are the divine mother and the divine father, the goddess and the god in whatever or the myriad forms that they take, a feminine form of divinity, a masculine form of divinity, and that we ourselves are what in mythology is called the divine child. The divine child is said to have powers that are beyond either of its parents. The divine child is said to bring something to the world that has never existed before through understanding who they really are, that each of us is a divine spark, a son or a daughter of the divine mother and father working in partnership. So we are here to experience divine consciousness, to experience the creation of a miracle, and to see life itself and everything that happens as a miracle. It's a miracle that you just turned on your tap and water comes out that you can drink. It's a miracle that a baby comes out of the womb fully formed. It's a miracle that we meet the partner in life, that we find our way, that everything in the city happens, the garbage gets taken out and the food gets taken in and people have jobs, most of them, and that we somehow get along together in a divine order. If you're going to learn to create miracles, first you have to see them. You have to see that the divine is in everything. It's shining with a sparkling luster. It is truth, consciousness, and bliss. It is behind the sacred order and that we are sacred beings embedded in a sacred universe, and our job is to awaken that, to see it, to live it, to be it, and to harness divine consciousness and bring it down through our chakras to shine out into the world. That is the true meaning of namaste. Namaste means the divine lives in me in an awakened state and the divine lives in you and the divine is in everything around me. Namaste. So when we forget that the divine is in everything, and we treat matter as just some substance that we can do whatever we want to with, we treat other people as if they didn't matter, and we create many crises in our world. You could see this in some way that we have moved away from the sacred, we have moved away from the divine, and in that, nothing matters, nothing means anything, nothing's worth anything. It's all dispensable and we begin destroying it. So if we want to change this paradigm, we have to start with treating ourselves as sacred, treating the ground we walk on as sacred, the food we eat, the people we know and interact with everyday as sacred, divine beings that we are here together to create heaven on Earth, to learn how to create a miracle, and we change ourselves from the inside by remembering that we are a god or a goddess walking this Earth to bring blessings. For the next 24 hours, and make it a practice that perhaps you do everyday, see the divinity in everything. Treat each object as if it were sacred. Even if you throw away a piece of paper, say thank you for the time that you used it. Thank you to the tree that gave its birth. If you eat, say thank you for what you're eating. If you have an interaction with a friend, say thank you. Realize that the universe is here to shower you with divine blessings if you can just open to receive it. The divine gave us life. The only thing it asks in return is that we give our gifts back. So take a deep breath, congratulations! We have concluded the upward liberating current moving all the way from the first chakra up to the crown. If you've gotten this far, really pat yourself on the back. Give yourself a hug. Say a real to the tribe. You've taken quite a quest and quite a journey. From here, we're going to examine where we've gotten to and then we're going to start the journey back down, taking our divine consciousness down through vision, through communication, through relationship, through empowerment and action, through moving with passion into life and through manifesting our highest aspirations and our true purpose. So fasten your seat belts 'cause that's going to be a fast ride down. It's going to be lots of fun. We're going to change the format and you're going to learn exercises to do with another person. It's great for coaches, great for finding your way. We're going to laugh and we're going to enjoy. We're going to create the world that we know in our hearts is possible.

====================

LESSON 25 - Review & Integrate: The Upward Current of the 7 Chakras
--------------------
<v Judith>Congratulations,</v> you have completed the upward current. You've journeyed through all seven chakras. You've looked at your survival, your emotions, your power, your love, your communication, your insight and reached the crown chakra, the consciousness that you are, the divine being. That's a lot of journey. I hope that you've had insights along the way, I hope you've had shifts. It's just been wonderful to be on this quest with you. And now is the time to look back over your progress. Maybe read some of the entries in your journal, maybe go back at some of the comments in the Facebook group, share what you're doing with the tribe. Look at the exercises that were most meaningful for you and see which ones you want to repeat. Maybe you know now what chakras are toughest for you which ones need the most work. You'll want to do a little extra work on those chakras, maybe practice those exercises a little more often, review the material, read a little more about it. And know that you know, this is a lifelong journey. We've done this in 28 days. But there's really, it's something I've been doing this journey for 45 years and I'm still on it. I'm still traipsing back and forth across the Rainbow Bridge, learning new things. So once you have this under your belt, it doesn't stop. The insights don't stop, the growth doesn't stop. The learning doesn't stop the practice certainly doesn't stop. The more you do your practice, the clearer you become. So be patient with yourself, know that it takes a long time. Know that you've got this map for the rest of your life that you can do these exercises again and again. So if you've made it this far, you've gone through 25 days of learning on a really intense fast track. Clap yourself on the back and give yourself a break. You might be feeling tired, that's understandable. Maybe this is as far as you want to go. You've made quite a journey and quite a quest and I hope you've gotten things along the way. But if you want to apply this to your life, and really bring heaven down to earth and co-create with others, heaven on earth, download the Chakra Companion Workbook for Week five, the manifesting current and I'll see you tomorrow and look at the fundamentals of the downward current and how that works, before we go off to start in Chakra Seven and one chakra at a time taking it all the way back down to earth so you can create heaven on earth.

====================

LESSON 26 - Begin Your Downward Manifesting Current
--------------------
<v ->Welcome back.</v> And once again, congratulations for completing the upward current for all the work you've done to get here, for sticking through this quest and continuing to hunt for the treasure. Now we're going to begin our descent so fasten your seat belts, just like when you're in a plane and the captain says we're getting ready to go in for a landing. You got to put your tray table up. Fasten your seat belts 'cause we're going to take a rapid descent down to the earth to learn how to bring heaven down to earth, to learn how to manifest your highest aspirations. So in the journey upward, you did a lot of healing on yourself. You learned the movements, you practiced the yoga, you were clearing your chakras and you were taking the steps to go up to higher awareness. But the question is in this spiritual journey, what do we then do with that higher awareness? Now, comes the time to make it practical, to learn how to apply it to your life, to create the life you want, the life of your dreams. So why is it important to work on both channels? The upward current of liberation takes us from our fixed forms. We go from earth to water, water's a little freer than the fixed earth. To fire that's radiating upward, to air that's invisible, to sound, to light and to consciousness getting freer and freer with each step. In the downward current, we are taking our higher consciousness and bringing it into a vision. We're talking about it, we're bringing it into our relationships, we're doing something about it. We're bringing things together and moving things into place and we're manifesting our dream. Both currents are always working together in the chakra system. We're taking energy in from our thoughts, from consciousness, from the divine, from grace. We're bringing it down and we're always evolving and moving out of limitations and expanding and moving up. And the two currents passing each other create a vortex, the wheeling, spinning disk that we describe as the chakras, as remember the word means wheel or disk. And so, these are always working together, they're always mixing together. When you're in your lower chakras, you have only a little bit of the liberating current and a lot of the manifesting current. So you have things that you can feel and see and touch. When you're in the higher chakras you have more of the liberating current but not so much of the manifesting current, so things might be a little vague and ethereal. But as we go down we get denser and denser and more specific with each step. Now, what's very natural to feel when you go on the downward current is resistance. Because when you go from a plane of less density to a plane of more density, you experience a little resistance. Think of a meteor that's coming in from outer space, it's going through the vacuum of outer space and it has no resistance. And then as it comes toward the earth, you feel it hit the atmosphere. The atmosphere gives just a little bit of resistance then it goes through the atmosphere, might catch fire and then it hits the ocean. Well, the ocean is thicker than the atmosphere so it experiences even more resistance. Until finally maybe it goes all the way to the bottom of the ocean and it hits land, that's the ultimate resistance, it can't go any farther. So when we go from thought planes to trying to be specific about what we're imagining or we take it out of our imagination and we try to tell somebody what we're talking about, that requires being more specific. When we try to bring it in to our relationships, everything requires getting a little more clear, a little more concrete, a little more formed, and into a little less freedom. So it's natural to feel resistance. And what we experience in that resistance is more blockages in the chakras and what we're going to learn in this downward current is some methods to clear out those resistances so that you are straight on course from your highest thought all the way down to what you manifest. And we'll learn that chakra by chakra. So, let's apply these principles to something like building a house. So, when you build a house, first of all you have to have the idea to do it. You have to want to do it. You have to set the intention. I want to build a house. And you have to think about, well, where do I want to build it? What kind of house do I want to build? For how many people, how many bedrooms? How big a house and what do I want to do with that house? Do I want to entertain or do I want something simple to take care of. So all creations starts with thought, it starts with an idea. And we get lots of ideas in the course of our life and we kind of file them away like an arrow that we put in our back in a quiver. And we say, yeah, someday I'd like to do that. I have lots of ideas for books I want to write and I go yeah, someday I'll write a book about that. But when you begin to take the downward current, you say, all right, today I'm going to pull that arrow out of my quiver and I'm going to set an intention. Now I'm going to build, begin building this house or now I'm going to write this book. Or now I'm going to make this for dinner. It could be as simple as that. Or now I'm going to take that vacation. Now, you're notching up that arrow in your quiver and you're aiming it toward your goal. So setting intention and having the idea is seventh chakra. And the manifestation principle here is consciousness creates. Everything that comes into creation started with an idea. And then as you continue to think about your idea, you begin to imagine it or maybe even at the same time. You visualize your house. What kind of house do you want it to look like? You visualize your house. What do you want it to look like? What do you want it to look like as you walk in the door? What do you want to see out through the windows? What do you want your kitchen to look like? And in this visualization process you're probably going to be visiting other people's houses and looking at them differently than you would. You're going to look at what they did with their kitchen or different architectural aspects. Maybe you're looking through magazines, pictures of houses or kitchens to get more ideas. This all takes place through the visual frame and that's sixth chakra, the chakra that sees. And so, the manifestation principle here is vision vitalizes. Consciousness creates but vision vitalizes. It's sort of like you can have a line drawing but when you color it in with color it brings it to life. So, once you visualized your house that you want to build and you've gotten clear enough about what you want, you're going to go talk to somebody about it, probably an architect. And you're going to sit down with the architect and you're going to say, well, here's what I want and here's how I envision it, and here's what I've seen in my mind. And the architect's going to ask you questions that's going to take you into further clarification. They're going to say, well, how many square feet do you want the kitchen to be and what is your budget? And what kind of materials do you want? And do you want the windows to face north, east, south or west? How many bedrooms and what kind of carpet? And these are things that make you refine your vision. So, when we communicate, that's fifth chakra, and the manifestation principle here is communication catalyzes. When you talk about your dream, you may find someone else that has an idea, someone else that helps you refine your vision, someone else that gives you feedback and you get more clear and more specific by talking about it. So the realm of relationships is the heart chakra. The principle here is love launches. We want to treat all our relationships with love and respect and positive regard. That's the way you'll get the most out of your relationships. And in any dream that you want to create, there's probably lots of relationships you need to have. In the dream of building a house, you need a relationship with the architect, probably a relationship with the banker to get some money. You need maybe a relationship with a real estate agent that's going to find you the piece of land. You're going to have a relationship with the contractor and all the workers. You're probably going to have to relate to the neighbors and tell them trucks are going to be coming in and building the house. You want the house to relate to the land. So there's lots of relationships you're going to have. And so, when you're looking at your dream it's good to make a list of all those relationships and call them in. Sometimes just naming those relationships help them come into being. For example, after I created my DVD, The Illuminated Chakras, I decided I wanted to put it in some other languages and I wanted Spanish, Italian, French and German. And I want online and I looked at who does translations and voiceovers and everybody was very far away, and I didn't know who was good, and it was very expensive. And so I just set the intention that I would find the right person. Well, two weeks later, I went to a party, kind of a networking party. The first person I met handed me a card and she said she did voiceover translations and I said really. And I said what languages? And she says, "Well, I'm native in French and Italian "and I have a co-worker that does Spanish, "and she knows someone that does German." She named the four languages that I want. And when I told her what the project was, The Illuminated Chakras, she says, "Oh, I've seen that movie. "I would love to do that." She was half the price, she was right there. Within a month I had the whole project done. So now that you've done all these planning and communicating and relating in the upper chakras, now you come to the third chakra. This is the hard part, this is where you have to do something. Third chakra is oriented to action. The manifestation principle here is power produces. So you want to empower yourself to get things done because that's how you're going to produce the results that you need. So, we make a plan. We prioritize our plan. We say, okay, I have to do this first and then I have to do that. You have to build the walls before you can put the roof on and you have to build the foundation before you can build the walls. So, in every project we take into bite size chunks and you say yes, this I can do. If you look at the whole thing all at once it can be overwhelming. But you say okay, in six months I'll get this done. In the next six months I'll get that done. First, I'll write the business plan then I'll find the bankers, then I'll do the project, then I'll build the house. So, we break it down into manageable chunks and we empower you to overcome your obstacles and get things done. Power produces. And now we get to the fun part. Second chakra, pleasure pleases. You know, to do all these things you got to make it fun. You got to have a sense of play. People are attracted to what is beautiful, what is powerful, what is fun, what is enlightening. So if you want to attract customers or clients or business people or collaborators, then you want to make it pleasurable and that will keep you on track. So, get a sense of play into what you're doing. And the other aspect of this chakra is once you've started to do this work and you're really taking your action steps and moving things forward, you start to get little results. You know if it's a garden you start to see the first shoots come up out of the ground. If it's your house you start to see it take shape. The basic building and the walls are there and you can walk through and see what it's going to be like. And at that point we get really excited, we get really passionate. It's like, oh, it's working. You get the first reviews on your book or you get your first clients that tell you they had a wonderful experience. That's when we get in the waters of passion and we keep moving and things start to come down toward gravity and start to come together almost of their own accord. Pleasure pleases. And then after all these work, we finally come down to the manifested plane, the root chakra. Here the principle is matter matters. And in building a house for example, it really matters that you cut the boards to exactly the right length, that you nail them together in a very specific way, that you have glass for each and every window, that you have enough bricks and cement, and that you follow the plans exactly as they're meant to be. So, there's a very exacting nature to the earth plane. If you borrow money from a bank, you borrow an exact amount or if you go to the bank to cash a check you have to have exact amount. So we have to be very specific here. And in that we also want to put things on a calendar and move them forward. On Wednesday at 10 o'clock I'm going to make these phone calls. On Friday I'm going to meet with the banker. By the following Friday I'm going to find myself a contractor. We have to be very specific and make an appointment with ourselves to really ground things into space and time. And if you do that, you get to have your dream in its finished form. So now that you understand the overview of how this manifestation current works, tomorrow we're going to take an overview of looking at this in the larger picture. How you can become a love-powered evolutionary to really create a big vision for yourself. I hope to inspire you to do something that gives back to the world and then we'll follow that with our deep dive one chakra per day. The manifestation principles, how to move the blocks out of your chakras and create heaven on earth. Okay, so I'll see you tomorrow and we'll discuss this era of global awakening that we can all be part of.

====================

LESSON 27 - Awaken the Global Heart
--------------------
<v ->Welcome back.</v> Now that you understand how the downward current of manifestation works. I want to talk to you about something that is near and dear to my heart and my greatest mission. You see the Chakra system is not only for healing the individual, but it's a mapping system for the collective of humanity. Our journey through time, our evolutionary journey. Our journey as a species. And this map connects the individual to the collective. It connects us in mind, body, spirit, and culture, into one indivisible whole. A map that we can use, not just for manifestation, but for the evolution of humanity itself. So this connects the personal and the universal, the I and the we, the inside and the outside. So that a mutual evolution occurs, of you and I, and the world we live in together. And the world we're creating together for our future. This whole time you've been learning about why you do what you do, how to change the patterns, how to become more effective and clear, in higher consciousness, and a better communicator. But here's the question, now that you have found the steps to higher consciousness, what are you going to do with that? What are you going to give back to the world? Is our spiritual journey just some kind of narcissistic preening on our own mats and on our own meditation cushion? Or are we evolving our consciousness for some greater purpose? To be instruments of creation, to be instruments that can help bring heaven down to Earth. That can learn to create miracles in our life. So we've healed ourselves, and we've even looked at how each Chakra fits in with the world. But now it's time to examine the global Chakra pattern in a little more detail. So why now? Why is this so urgent? Our world is in crisis. Population has exceeded the carrying capacity of the planet. And we're devastating the environment. The environment that's our life support. We're headed into catastrophic climate change, which will produce further issues of food scarcity, weather disasters, and refugee crisis. People becoming homeless because of fires, and floods, and temperature. Our financial systems benefit the rich at the expense of the poor. Our healthcare systems are neither about health nor care. Anyone who's aware today knows that there is a mountain of problems humanity has to face. As Barbara Marx Hubbard has said "these problems can be seen as evolutionary drivers, challenges that are forcing us to change our operating principles, change the way we organize society, change our value system.". Without these crisis, we might not change. So we need to welcome them, as hard as they're going to be. And say what are they wanting to evoke from us? What are they wanting to bring to life, that isn't already on board? After billions of years of evolution, we who are alive today have the most advanced technology, the most advanced sciences, knowledge, spiritual systems, ways of connecting, tools of power, that we have ever had at any time in history. Of course, the future will probably have even more powerful technologies. But now we are advanced as we've ever been. And the tools of power are in the hands of the common people, like never before. The tools to publish, the tools to broadcast, the tools to travel, and teach, and learn, and study, and create. Everyone can do this now. These are at our disposal, but we have to start asking what's all this put here for? Our ancestors worked hard to lay down the roads, and build the hospitals, and the schools, and create the machines, and the airplanes, and the buses, and the cars that are all given to us. To do what? We have to start saying what moment is this in evolution? And what is our part to play? To be grateful for all that's given to us, and lets use this to our advantage. Let's use this to create something wonderful together. To bring heaven to Earth, not to escape into some lofty ideal that isn't practical. But to take our lofty ideals down to Earth. So all systems are go for the next stage in evolution. We just have to take the next step. But how do we get there? How do we know what to do? It's so overwhelming, what role do each of us play in this evolution from what I call the love of power, to the power of love as an organizing principle. What will guide us through this transformation? How do we co-create with the divine, and with each other, and with the Earth? I like to think as evolution as the Gods way of making more Gods. Think of it, for three billion years we had nothing more than single celled organisms that spread across the planet. But they couldn't do much, until they started putting themselves together. And then as they did, they created more complex creatures, more intelligent, more sophisticated, more powerful, more capable. And through the course of evolution we have been moving toward the power of Gods. We now have the power to blow up the planet, to change the gene pool, to do all kinds of things that are on a planetary scale. But do we have the wisdom to do it wisely? So if we are evolving to become as Gods, how do we do that? I looked through all kinds of creation mythologies to see what was the story, but none of them told us how we evolve. And the only story I found that could be a model for it, was the story of how the caterpillar turns into a butterfly. So when the caterpillar has eaten 27 thousand times its weight, over its lifetime it gets too bloated to move. And it turns upside down and a chrysalis forms around it, confining its freedom. Inside the chrysalis a miracle occurs. Tiny cells that biologists actually call imaginal cells begin to appear in the caterpillar body. And these cells are so different form the caterpillar, they vibrate to a different frequency, they have a different agenda. That at first the caterpillar's immune system attacks them. And yet, despite being attacked, these cells appear more and more, in greater numbers. And as they do, they start to clump together, they start to form networks. And pretty soon, they become too powerful for the caterpillar's immune system. At that time the caterpillar body becomes a nutritious soup to feed these cells. These are the cells of the butterfly. And as that develops and matures, the chrysalis becomes transparent. Just as things are becoming more transparent today. And finally, the butterfly pokes out, it opens its wings, its right wing and its left wing, organized along its core, and it flies off into the garden. So this is a metaphor for how we're transforming. We don't need to prop up the caterpillar, it's on its way out. But imaginal cells are waking up all over the planet. People who are healing imaginal cells, people who are artistic imaginal cells, people who are co-creative, working for peace. Whatever it is, we are coming together in conferences, and festivals, and organizations, and groups. And we're organizing a new principle. A new way of coming together. And the stronger we build that network, the more the caterpillar can let go. It doesn't have to hold society together anymore because a new network is forming. And then all of that will become nutritious. So just be an imaginal cell, and look for your co-hearts, look for your tribe, look for what resonates with you. Go to conferences where they're talking about that, and get renewed. And in that, you will become stronger in who you're becoming in the future. As a love-powered evolutionary. So you can see there's a personal evolution, and there's a collective vision that we need to create. And they need to go together and mirror each other. So I see this as moving from the love of power, to the power of love. Or a collective movement from being primarily based in the third Chakra of power, and aggression, and control, to one of the heart, of peace, and love, and co-creation, and collaboration. But we don't give up our power in order to go to the heart, we stand in it. And I love the quote from Martin Luther King, that says "Power without love is reckless and abusive, but love without power is sentimental and anemic. Power at its best is love implementing the demands of justice, and justice at its best is power correcting everything that stands against love.". So they go together, and rainbow warriors do both. We stand in our power, and we spread the wings of the heart. We work to transform ourselves so that we can become better agents for change. That's the higher purpose. Rainbow warriors are evolutionaries, meaning people who make a commitment to help humanity evolve to its next stage of consciousness. And because I believe that stage is the heart, we are heart-centered evolutionaries, or love-powered evolutionaries. And we do this together, the old model was doing it alone, the new model is networking and co-creating to do it together. And that's what I hope can inspire you to pick a lofty vision to take into the manifestation current. Because nobody can do it alone, we need lots of people who know how to manifest a vision in order to make this happen. And we don't have a lot of time to waste. So with that vision in place, tomorrow we're going to kick off the downward current, with an opening meditation that allows you to look at your life purpose, and set your intention. Get ready.

====================

LESSON 28 - Opening Meditation & Setting Your Intention [Live Call Recording]
--------------------
<v ->So we start out our manifesting current</v> with having a sense of purpose, and here in this meditation, I want to lead you along your lifeline looking at the past and the future and harvesting the points of impact in your life that may have shaped your life purpose. Now I see life purpose as something fairly general, like to make people laugh, or to create beauty, or to be loving, or to heal, or to teach, and out of that life purpose, you find your vision. Your vision is the vehicle that helps you fulfill your life purpose. So if your life purpose is to make people laugh, you could be a clown at a children's party, you could be a comedy writer, you could be a standup comedian, you could just be a funny guy and do your life purpose, but each one of them is a different form. So your vision is the form that your life purpose takes. So as we go through this meditation, I just want to say that sometimes some traumatic memories can come up. Maybe you look at your past, and it was pretty rough, and I want you to see that in the context of that molding you for your service. So if there was alcoholism in your family, maybe that's part of what made you become a drug and alcohol counselor. If you were orphaned, maybe you want to go work with orphans in India. Try to see that as a teacher and not get caught in the trauma, so just harvest the charge of it, and get ready to have a nice, centered meditation. So close your eyes, and come into your inner world, the world of the soul. Sit with an erect spine, lifting your crown, and pushing your roots down into the ground. Take a few deep breaths, and center into your core. And we're going to imagine that there is a line intersecting your vertical core. Maybe about third eye center. A line that you will become aware of. And that line goes behind you and in front of you. Behind you is your past, and in front of you is your future, and that line stretches from just before your birth to laying on your deathbed. And so imagine in your third eye center that glowing ball of light, and it's going to be like a bead on the string of this line. And we're going to slide it all the way back to just before your conception. Your spiritual energy in the unformed plane. And you're being drawn to earth, you're being drawn to a particular set of parents who are relating to each other, who are making love, you're being drawn to a particular set of circumstance, particular location in the world, a particular race or gender or religion. And just notice whether or not there's any intention there, in being born in a particular way and place that you were, in the particular body that you have, being born male or female at this time, being born the race that you are, being born in that religion, and maybe you see that and maybe you don't. And then imagine you are pulled into your mother's womb, conception takes place, and you grow. And you are assembling energy, you're building your body, you're building your nervous system, nine months in the womb, your mother's getting ready to give birth to you, your family's getting ready, and then one day the birth process starts, and you are pushed out of the womb and pushed in your body outside to survive in the first chakra. And you're welcomed, and arms are put around you, and you're taken to a warm breast, and you're given a name, and they say, oh, it's a girl, or a boy, or it's Johnny or whatever is said, just feel what's around you. And imagine that everything that's around you is like a great big basket, a basket that you get to carry through life. You get to put things in it, and you get to take things out of it. And so into this basket you put your first experiences. And then imagine from this point way in your past you move the bead forward to your earliest memory. Most of us can't remember things at one or two, but what's the earliest thing that comes up for you? If you're not sure you remember it, just imagine it. What did you notice? What were you doing? Who were you talking to, what were they saying? What did you become aware of? <v Man>Hold please,</v> and clear. <v ->What impact did that have on your soul?</v> Whatever that is, harvest it. Take it from your timeline and put it in your basket. And now you move the bead forward, carrying the basket with you, to becoming a little older. Maybe you're starting to play with other kids in the neighborhood, maybe you're going to school, you're starting to form relationships, friendships, have interests. What kind of friends did you have? What did you like to do? Did you like to play outside, or did you like sports, or did you like to read, or make art? Just notice what was your tendency that came naturally to you, what made you happy? And harvest that and put it in your basket. And then move the bead and the basket forward in time to being a little older. Maybe you're in your fifth chakra stage, you're learning, you're reading, you're writing, you're watching films, you're having discussions, you're going through grade school. What are you interested in? What subjects were you good at? What kind of things did you like to do with your friends? What moments stand out? Maybe it was a trip your family took, maybe it was seeing poverty on the street. These impacts could be positive or negative, but what did you notice that was shaping you already to go in the direction of your life purpose? Now we move the bead and the basket and your life forward to a little older, maybe coming into high school, becoming a teenager, becoming more of yourself. What were your interests? What impacted you, what did you think about? What did you like to read? What did you do with your friends? Who were the models that really impressed you in public life? What did you think you wanted to be when you grew up? Notice that and harvest it into your basket, and move your bead and your basket forward, and now you're out of school, you're out of home, maybe you went to college, maybe you went into the workforce, maybe you went into the military or traveled. Whatever you did when you left home to a certain point was self-determined. You chose what school you wanted to go to, and what you wanted to study, or you chose where you wanted to travel, or you applied for a job and you learned a particular skill, or you met people that influenced you to go in a certain direction. Which way were you headed? What were the things that you found yourself doing that just came naturally? Were you a good listener? Were you lots of fun, were you good at sports? Were you smart, were you creative? Harvest that and put it in your basket. And then we move forward into adulthood, and you really start on your career. And that career may have changed many times, but what are the different things you did? And I know people who are listening are all different ages. Some have had more life experience than others. Take a few moments now to notice the points of impact, the places you felt really good, or really inspired, or really moved to do something about the world, and put those in your basket, and take a few moments to fill that in until you come to this moment, present time, where you are sitting here listening to this. Then we'll go into the future. So now as you're sitting here in present time, we're still staying in the meditation, you're holding a basket that is full of your life experience, full of the skills you've developed, the things you've learned, the fun you've had, the suffering you've had. It's full of everything that makes you who you are in this moment. And now we're going to take that bead of light down the lifeline to the future. And as we step forward in time, you're going to take things out of your basket, and you're going to give them to people. So imagine as you finish this quest, and you interact with your friends, what's the first thing you're going to take out of your basket and give away? And then a month from now, what do you see yourself doing that you're giving from yourself, from your experience, from your basket? And now move yourself forward one year. In a year from now, what would you like to be giving to others? What's in your basket that you are giving away? How are you helping other people? Five years from now, where would you like to be? What do you want to be giving? 10 years, a full decade, can you imagine the ripeness of what you're doing, what will you have given? And then slowly move the bead all the way to the end of your lifeline where you are lying on your deathbed surrounded by loved ones, and you're looking at your long and fruitful life, you're looking back, and you say, yes, I did it. I did what I came here to do. I fulfilled my purpose. And your loved ones say, and what was that? And just imagine what your answer might be. But we're not going to die in this meditation. We're going to remember what that was, and we're going to slide our bead back again into our third eye and into the present time and into your body where you are sitting right now on this particular day in this particular place in the body that you have incarnated in, and when you're back to your body in present time, open your eyes and take out your journal and write down some of the things that stood out for you. So see if you can state your life purpose in very specific and yet general terms. That may sound contradictory, but like my life purpose is to heal the splits in collective consciousness between heaven and earth, mind and body, spirit and matter. That's pretty concise, and it's pretty general. It doesn't say what I'm going to do to do that. And now we set our intention of how we want to be and what we want to create, so for the purpose of this manifestation current, it's good if you have something to apply it to. So in your workbook is a list of 13 different areas of life, from relationships and family to finances to career to your health, your personal growth, to your contribution to community to your creativity or your service to a great vision. So in each of those areas, think about how you would love life to be. That's what a dream is, something you would just love. How would you love your relationship to be? How would you love your finances to be? How would you love your, maybe you have a vacation you've always wanted to take. And just naming these things sometimes brings them into fruition. So do that work, and then pick one of those areas that you'll work on for the manifestation current. One of those areas in which you have a very particular dream, a vision, of what you want to create. It could be your career dream. It could be your family dream. It could be your dream to own a home. It could be your dream to be of service in some way. So we're going to pick something very specific and then we will begin to work with that from our intention all the way down to our manifestation. Be sure and share your vision and your statement with your Tribe. That inspires us. I love to see what everyone's going to create, and starting next week, we will take one chakra each day, and we will work this dream into its concrete manifested reality. Now that doesn't mean you're going to get your dream within seven days, some dreams take longer. You're not going to write a book in seven days, but you're going to learn the steps of manifestation all the way down, so that you can apply it to your dream, and however big or small your dream is, it'll take as long as it takes, but knowing these steps will make it happen a little faster. So I'll see you tomorrow, and trust me, we're going to have fun.

====================

LESSON 28 - Week 4 - Q&A Call with Anodea Judith

Let's get started. Hi, Rainbow Warriors. Good morning, good afternoon, good evening, whatever the case might be for you. I am Alex, and on behalf of the Mindvalley team, I'd like to welcome you to your Chakra Healing Q &A coaching call. And we have another great call. prepare for you today. We are in week four. So there is only one more week to go from this great quest that you embark on. So congratulations for making it so far. Congratulations for showing up to all of these calls as you normally do. And we have very interesting topics that we'll be covering belonging mainly to this fourth week of your quest where we learn about chakra seven. the crown chakra, and we started diving into the downward manifesting current. So this call will be mainly focusing on these topics, and I believe you'll get great, great insights from tonight's session. And we have a couple of really hard questions for Anadea today. That being said, and without further ado, let's welcome our wonderful teacher on this journey, Anadea Judith. Hi, Anadea. Greetings, everyone. Rainbow warriors. Happy... End of the rainbow here, that's where the pot of gold is, right? If we go to the end of the rainbow, that's where we find all the treasure. So this is what we want to harvest and reap and take back down to earth. And remember, the rainbow in ancient mythology is what connects heaven and earth. And it was said that the goddess of the rainbow, who in the Greek mythology was the goddess Iris, she brought the messages of the gods down to the humans across the rainbow. And she carried the human wishes and their pledges and their offerings up to the gods across the rainbow. So we're making that connection between heaven and earth. So let's just do a very quick meditation so we have more time for questions. And as always, send your roots down and lift your crown up, lengthening your spine and coming into your breath, inhaling fully and exhaling. Even with a little sound. Inhaling up the spine all the way to the top. And exhaling that little ball of light all the way down to the base. And imagine that the line that goes through the center of you goes all the way out to the heavens and all the way down to the center of the earth. And each one of us, wherever we are in the world, and we have so many countries that checked in. already this morning or afternoon or evening that we are all going down to the center of the same earth we all have this rainbow bridge inside us and we are all connected to something greater above and beyond and each one of us is like a little acupuncture needle that vertical column poking into the earth for the healing of the earth And so open your vision wide to imagine some part of your world. Could be your neighborhood, your city, your country, your workplace, or your home a little better. Maybe you want to make it greener, more friendly. And imagine that where each of us are in our place in the world, there's a circle of light coming out from that acupuncture point. Feel it all around you in your auric field and see those circles of light expanding outward and connecting with each other and creating a network of love all around the planet. Namaste. Beautiful. So let's kick off our session because I really want to hear as well your answers to a few of these questions are really hardcore. Let's call them. So let's kick off with the first question from Susanna. I have difficulties with attachment, especially to my own opinions and need to be right. Don't we all, Susanna? This often leads to arguments. What are your suggestions to learn detachment? Well, I think I mentioned someone who also wrote on the Facebook, we have a choice. We can be right or we can be happy. You know, as a counselor, when I had couples, together you know and they were arguing about who's right i said look that's your choice you can insist you're right but you're not going to be happy and neither is your partner or you can say what will it take to be happy first of all we're assuming there is a right you know and um you know in a few things i suppose two plus two equals four there is a right answer but most of the values and the beliefs we have are culturally imposed and we think they're right At one time, you know, they thought it was right to burn women at the stake. At another time, they thought, I mean, even today, to throw acid in the face of children and girls who want to go to school. There's all kinds of things that people feel are right. And it's just from one perspective. What brings connection is to be able to see someone else's perspective, even if you don't agree with it. to say, oh, I can see how that might be from your point of view. I can see how you might think that. And then they're more willing to hear what you think. Stephen Covey said, if you wish to be understood, seek first to understand. So if somebody's not getting what you're saying, saying, maybe I don't understand what you're saying. And then once they feel understood, they're more willing to listen. But how do we detach? You can think of attachments like cords that are coming out from your chakras that are attached to a person or a place or an outcome or to money or possessions. And what we can do is just look at that cord and go, so what am I really attached to here? And then once you get the answer, how can I give that to myself? in a healthier way, and then unhook that cord and draw it in, like pulling in a fishing line. You just draw the cord right back into your own being. You unhook it and you let that thing fall away. And the thing is, when we release attachments, it's liberating. That's the end of the liberating current. So when we can let go of something, we have a tremendous freedom that comes with that. I am developing my higher mind and going to the higher consciousness through meditation, but I noticed that if I don't make a powerful question, I don't receive any answers. Do you have any recommendations on how to improve this process of using the correct words to create a powerful question? Once again, I would say there are no correct words. I do think that forming a question, it's like typing something into Google. You type a few words into Google and the search engine goes out and it pulls in that kind of information of what you're looking for. So sometimes when we type into Google, we get a bunch of stuff and we go, well, that doesn't work. Maybe I should word it this way. You know, that gave me a bunch of things I didn't want. Maybe I need to put prayer flags in rainbow colors next time instead of getting all the white ones. I don't know. So we can always adjust. But what I think happens in meditation and in prayer is the intention speaks louder than the words. So focus on the essence of what you're asking, what you're longing for, what you're needing to find out. And the words, you don't even have to say words if you focus on the intention. So let go of them having to be perfect and focus on the intention. Okay. I often get caught up in limiting beliefs about my abilities or what is possible with my goals. Although I started recognizing them more and more, it's still difficult to break free and replace them with empowering ones. What should I do? Well, the very next video on the quest tomorrow is going to be on beliefs and a process for clearing out limiting beliefs. And I learned that technique from a person named Lyon Goodman. We wrote the book Creating on Purpose together. We actually taught the manifesting current together for many years. And he's developed a whole program for clearing beliefs. But, you know, in brief, what we're going to learn is how to see your belief as a costume, as an outfit. And you take off the outfit and you put on a new belief that you create that's more beneficial. But I take you through the whole process in the video tomorrow. How do you personally honor the divinity in yourself and in others? Is this a daily practice? Or how do you suggest we approach this for the long term? This is one of the hard questions. But yes, I do try to remember to do it on a daily practice. I'm human more than divine like everybody else. And I miss. As I meditate, I open to the larger beyond and I imagine it pouring into me. So the intelligence of the cosmos, what have you, is I'm taking it in so that I have a little spark of divinity. And that's my meditation. That's my daily practice where I sit in meditation for as long as I have that day, 20, 30 minutes, an hour if I'm lucky, five minutes if I'm in a hurry. That brings it in. But the other thing that's a daily practice is just the namaste. Namaste means the divine in me salutes the divine in you. And some cultures, they just do this to everyone. You know, they have a conversation and then they bow and they're saluting the divinity in each other. You can do this to the mirror every morning after you comb your hair and put on your makeup or whatever, shave or whatever you do, bring your hands together. and bow to the divine in yourself and ask the divine to guide you that day. Can you please elaborate on this idea, miracles happen when we notice the divinity in all things and treat them as sacred. I am not sure I fully understand what this means or how miracles will happen once this is done. Well, the manifestation current is a process for creating miracles. And I've seen people who have taken this workshop, and usually it's a four -day workshop, four full days. And, you know, miraculous things start to happen in their life. But it begins by seeing, you know, I'll ask people in the room, you know, who's experienced a miracle? And almost in every class, at least, some woman raises her hand and says, I gave birth to a baby. That's a miracle. that I could create something in my womb that has eyes and nose and hair and teeth and well not teeth yet but you know everything and you know push it out into life that's a miracle and then people have other miracle stories but sometimes miracles are really ordinary like here's a story right after I published the book Creating on Purpose where I talked about creating miracles I was tested. I was in Washington DC at a really large conference and I was staying at a friend's house, which was an hour train ride. And I was really late at the conference. I was tired. I fell asleep on the subway. And while I was asleep, somebody stole my purse. Now I had to be on an airplane at seven o 'clock the next morning to go to a workshop in Seattle. And my ID was there, the keys to the apartment I was staying at, and the people weren't home. They just gave me their apartment because they were going away for the weekend. My money, my checkbook, my phone, everything. And I'm in a subway. I can't even get out of the subway without money to put in the turnstile. And I thought, oh, no, I'm going to spend the whole night in the police station trying to recreate my ID because I can't get on an airplane without an ID. I don't have any money. I, you know, I can't even get home. I can't even call the people because I don't know their phone. It was in my cell phone and I don't have the keys to their apartment. What am I going to do? And it's like 11 o 'clock at night. I went, okay, say it's possible to make miracles. This is a test. I sat down right on the edge of the subway tracks, not on the tracks, but you know, right on the floor. I went into meditation and I affirmed that miracles are possible. And I saw myself on the plane. I imagined myself, you know, going through security, checking my luggage, you know, getting on the plane, arriving at my workshop in time for the next day. And I just affirmed that. And then I said, thank you in advance for bringing this miracle because I knew a miracle was the only way I was going to get out of it. And as soon as I stood up from meditation, three people came through the turnstile. And one of them bumped into me because she was talking on her cell phone. And I went, oh, cell phone. I have a phone in my purse. I'll borrow their phone and I'll call myself. And it will ring somewhere. And if somebody threw the purse in the bushes, sometimes they just take the money and then they drop it. Or, you know, maybe I'll find it. Well, I had to call three times before anybody answered. And finally somebody answered. And my purse was on a train going in a different... direction it was going the opposite way that i was going but the purse was there and so they said they would leave it at the station at the end of the line so it took me another hour but i went and everything in the purse was there except for the money And my keys and my ID and my checkbook and my phone and all that. And I got it back and it was a late night, but I was on the plane the next morning and had everything. So how does it happen? What made that person bump into me and think at that moment of calling? You know, at first I was so freaked out that didn't occur to me. But when you affirm miracles are possible, when you really need one. You can't use it all the time. It's when you really need it. Then be open to something coming through. How do we know when we need to hold on to our specific vision and when we need to be open to things unfolding as they will? For instance, I recently received a promotion at work, and in a way, I didn't even foresee it or intend for it. Could you clarify this? Well, sometimes things happen just by grace, and we didn't intend for it, and they're a gift, right? I would say Mindvalley coming to me was the same way. Mindvalley sought me out, and I had heard of them and watched some of their videos and courses, and I went, great. I love it, but I hadn't really been trying, so it was a blessing. you know, give thanks for those blessings. But it's a great question, you know, because when people are manifesting and things get difficult and obstacles arise, they say, oh, well, maybe I'm not supposed to do this. The universe is trying to give me a message that this is the wrong path. And more often than not, it's just obstacles. But sometimes it is trying to steer you to something better. And if you are doing all the steps to manifest what you want, then you're ready for something better. And I'll give you another story from my life. I was in this house and I wanted to buy the house. Beautiful home, just like my dream home, exactly what I wanted. The guy said, well, you have to buy it or I'm going to put it on the market and you'll have to move, you know, because I was renting. And so this was also right after the book on manifestation came out. So I took it as a test and I did all the process, you know, that you're going to learn the visualization and the communication and the magic. And I got my friends to pray with me that we'd hold this house and we held events there. And every time there was an event, I said, all right, see us being here for many years and all that. And he had given me six months to get the money together. So I was going to the bank and scraping all my savings and all that. And finally, at six months, I thought, you know, it looked pretty good like I could buy the house. But we had an event there that weekend, and it was actually the same weekend that it is right now, you know, several years ago. And so I thought, well, I won't call him on a weekend. I'll call him on Monday because we had this event, and it was a business thing. So I waited until Monday. When I called Monday, he said, I'm sorry, the six months was up on Friday, and I didn't hear from you. And now I'm going to raise the price $200 ,000. And I was like, oh, no, I can't. I could barely do it as it was. $200 ,000 more was out of the question. And I thought, I failed. This doesn't work. Everything I'm teaching doesn't work. But I had all my ducks in a row ready to move. So then what happened is right away, I found this other house, the one that I'm in now. And it was a whole lot cheaper, like $400 ,000 cheaper. And because I was ready, I was able to get it. And this one turns out to be so much better for a whole lot of reasons. So that's when, you know, if you're still trying and trying and trying and it doesn't, then it's setting you up to get something better. Great. Okay. Let's see another question here from Elisa. I love this concept of the evolution from the love of power to the power of love. How do we define the role we want to play in this? Are there any steps that we can follow? How can we make the role clearer? The role kind of emerges in your life as you come into your own heart. To move to the power of love is to move from love in your heart. And it could be so simple. It could be helping somebody who lives next door to you. It could be helping an elderly person. It could be helping a child or a single mother by babysitting for her child so she gets a break. You know, it could be a simple thing that you do. And you take a step in a direction that your heart calls. Andrew Harvey said, whatever is breaking our heart, that's where our service lies if climate change is breaking your heart that's where your service lies if sex trafficking is breaking your heart that's maybe where your service lies so find what you feel concerned about and then say, what can I do about that? And you just take steps in a direction. We don't have to know whether it's the right direction because you can take a step this way and then, oh, there's a little course correction. Now something that happens here takes you there and something that happens here takes you over here. And one step leads to another. So we don't have to know the end at the beginning. We just have to start out and make an offering. Another question here we have from Barbara. How do we discover what our lofty vision is? You mentioned that it is the vehicle that fulfills our life's purpose. But what if both are unclear? Are there any suggestions or guidelines that we can follow? Well, these are big questions. What is our life's purpose? What is the vision in which we carry out the life purpose? And they don't necessarily get answered in one meditation. You might have to sit with that question, asking for guidance in your meditation every day for a week or a month or six months. As you ask, little things will start to happen in your life. You'll bump into people that mention something that interests you or connects you with somebody or you'll read something that tweaks your interest or you know how when you're online, some YouTube video comes up unexpectedly and you click it and you watch it and you go, oh, I didn't know that, you know, or some other site comes, you know. or an email comes so as we ask those questions we're starting to direct our life and we may not have an answer you know like painted on a sign we may just have an urge to go in a certain direction and we just say you know how can i carry that out now the meditation that we did with the timeline the past going out the back and the future coming out the front That meditation is designed to give you patterns in your life to see what you were good at. And I apologize that the meditation went so quickly. We were trying to fit it into the 20 -minute timeline for each video. You know, more time, I've been giving you more time to think. So you could play that meditation and then just hit the pause button and see what visualizations come to mind because it takes a little more time sometimes. Just to see what comes. Now, when I do this in a workshop, I have people write down the themes. Like I was outside, I was leading people, I was making art, I was singing, I was writing, whatever they were doing. And then they share with a partner. all the themes and the partner helps them kind of see which ones go together. Okay, you like leadership and you like being outside, you know, maybe it's taking people on nature walks. Maybe it's, you know, being a park ranger, you know, you can find things. from the themes that are going together. But usually the life purpose is very general. The vision is more specific. Can you please talk about how does the physical removal of a body part affect a particular chakra? Yeah. In the master class there, I talked about Kirlian photography, where you take a picture of a leaf and you see the energetic view of the leaf all around the edge and what they find is they can rip off part of the leaf and they take a picture of it again and it still shows the whole leaf in the energetic imprint. So that means that even if a part is removed we've lost our uterus or someone has had a leg amputated or you know they've lost you know a kidney or something there is still an energy imprint that was there. Some people talk about phantom limb syndrome when they have had a leg amputated, but they can still feel the leg that isn't there. So energetically, it's still there. So I think that instead, the energy of the chakra may have affected the body part. That means that has to be removed, that it became diseased or something, rather than that affecting the chakra. However, that can be a trauma. And so we have to look that trauma can create disturbed energy patterns. On a similar note, a now -voted question from Karen. My question concerns the Kundalini. Many years ago, I read that your spine needs to be straight for it to flow properly and to avoid major problems. This has left me concerned because I have scoliosis, so my spine is naturally curved. I don't like to be in fear, but I need to know if I should avoid Kundalini because I have scoliosis or does it not matter? As Kundalini awakens in people, the spine moves a lot. You know, it vibrates and it undulates. It doesn't hold rigid. And so if you have scoliosis, Kundalini might actually help begin to straighten your spine out. straighten out the scoliosis. I think that could be helpful. If it's really, really bad scoliosis and the kundalini arises, it might be a little uncomfortable at first. And I suggest yoga and rolfing, which is deep tissue massage that can help you find better alignment. But I don't think that you need to avoid it unless you start doing kundalini and it creates pain. And then if it has pain, you should probably stop. On the same note from Edgardo in regards to Kundalini energy, would you recommend attempting to release it only after we've cleared out all of our chakra blockages, or is there a good enough point, as in 80 % progress in balancing our chakras, at which it is safe enough to try to release our Kundalini? Boy, that's a tough question too. You know, I don't think we're ever completely clear. That would take lifetimes. So if we had to wait until we were perfect to raise our Kundalini or enter a relationship or become successful or whatever, nobody would ever do it. So I think we're never perfect. I think it's a trial and error. You try it, you see what happens. If you're not ready, the kundalini is going to push up against another layer of stuff. Your history, your unresolved emotional issues, and then you stop with that and you deal with those. So, you know, it's trial and error because how do we say, oh, I'm 80 % healed? We don't really know that. We just know we're in a process. And I think that when there's a sufficient amount of clearing, kundalini will rise by itself and it'll be gentle. What is a torn or ripped open chakra and how do we diagnose this? Yeah, well, a torn or ripped open chakra is not a terminology that I would use personally. You might have heard that from somebody. So I would never actually diagnose somebody's chakra as torn or ripped. But if someone is talking about that, what I can imagine they mean is that there is a disturbed energy pattern in the chakra. And that disturbance was probably caused by some kind of trauma. So if there is an imbalance, you know, if you think of a spinning top, when it's spinning really fast, it stays upright. But when it starts to run out of energy, it kind of goes and then finally it falls over. So when things become unbalanced, then their turning is not so smooth. And that's a disturbed pattern that, like I said, comes from trauma. But I wouldn't actually diagnose someone with that myself. What role do the alpha, beta, and gamma brainwaves play with the chakras? Are the brainwaves connected to the chakras? As in, if I have an excess root chakra, am I more in the beta brainwave? Oh, interesting question. So yeah, there's four basic levels of brainwaves that give us different states of consciousness. The beta frequency is our thinking mind. As I'm talking to you, I'm in my beta mind right now. That's when you're reading a book or you're doing intellectual thinking. I don't think that's root chakras so much, but it is our intellect. The alpha is your light state of meditation. So going into alpha, you know, you could find your feelings better. You could connect with your heart better. You could hear your own silent voice better. I mean, I don't think any of the brain waves are connected to a particular chakra. They're just different states of consciousness, different ways to access yourself. The gamma and the delta are the deeper. Mostly we reach those in sleep. And they are deep rest. So if anything was connecting with a root chakra, I would say would be the deeper ones, like when we're sleeping and we're very still. Sometimes I feel under pressure to achieve as much as I can in this life. And I'm afraid I will not be able to realize my mission. How to be sure that we are doing enough effort to fulfill our mission? We can never be sure. What we do is what we can. And I think it's quite universal. especially when the problems are so big in the world right now that no matter what we do, we kind of feel like it's not enough. I know I do, and I've accomplished a lot in my life, and I still feel, oh, it's not enough. I want to do more. I want to make more change. So I don't know that we can ever be sure that there's anybody up there with a measuring tape saying, okay, you know, you've done enough. Now you can go into heaven. I think we just do what we can, when we can, as we can. Just like in all life, we try to do the best we can. How can I integrate my spiritual path with my social political involvement? Ah, yeah. I think that's one of the integrations that needs to happen right now. And I know that sometimes I write political blogs and people write and say, you're a spiritual teacher. What are you talking about politics for? And I say, well, you know, we can enlighten ourselves if we don't take care of this world. You know, what are we what are we doing with that? So I think that our spirituality is our practice. It's our belief system and our practice. It's how we evolve ourselves. You know, I mentioned that we're in a grand symphony together and to play in a symphony, the musician has. to practice. So whether it's meditation or yoga or martial arts or gardening or walking in the woods, you know, we have our practices. And that evolves us so that when we go into a social situation, we're coming from a clearer, more compassionate, more centered state of consciousness. And that enhances everything we do. In regards to something that you mentioned earlier from Tanya, I don't get in touch with my life vision. I am good at meditation, but I don't see my vision at all. Is this something that could be trained somehow? We can train ourselves to see and imagine, to the most part. Now, some people, just like being colorblind or tone deaf, don't have... the capacity to see and then they just have to feel it or hear it or find some other way of sensing but um so we can train ourselves to focus to see but again looking for something like your vision or your life purpose if you don't know what it is it takes a while to find out. These are big questions. It's sort of like saying, who shall I marry? Well, that doesn't mean that the person's going to show up in your life the very next day, and then when you meet them, you know whether they're the right one you want to spend your life with. These things take a while to find out. So, you know, we all want to know. I want to know, too. You know, give me my instructions. And we just have to wait sometimes because when we wait, more information comes. If we close the file too soon, we don't get more of the information. I would really love your advice on this. I am fine and I did a lot of healing work the last years on myself, but my family members suffer a lot and are stuck in old patterns. How can I be with them and still feel happy? and not angry and not get angry or sad because they don't do anything for themselves. Yeah, so this is a great question. You know, I think it was Ram Dass who said, oh, you think you're enlightened? Go visit your family for a weekend and then find out how enlightened you are. And all of a sudden, all your little kid things of feeling angry or misunderstood or, you know, whatever your family dynamic was, it comes rearing up so that you can heal it. So I think the first step when we're with people that are not at our level or we're with family and that's just where they are, is to be amused. To imagine this is like a comedy that you're watching on TV and this is how the people are behaving. I could name some American comedies, but you all have your cultures and I'm sure there's that kind of TV show in every culture. inwardly you don't have to be outwardly laughing at them but inwardly you're amused and that helps break the trance it breaks the the spell that they have on you and then from that amusement be compassionate we are all on wherever we are in the road because of what happened to us and how much we had to heal and from a grander perspective in some ways nobody's ahead of anybody else You know, we might be ahead in certain departments, just like some of you would speak another language better than I do, you know, because that's the country you were born in. But if we can say that we all have a purpose and hold them with compassion, the toughest thing, I think, is to let go of our attachment to trying to fix them and get them to change. That's the toughest thing. And when you can let go of that and be amused and appreciate them for what they are. Oh, there goes Uncle Joe doing his whole rap on grandma again. I've heard that a thousand times. There he goes. Now he's going to say that. Yep. Oh, there goes mom giving me the guilt trip. You know, we just be amused. Use it as an opportunity to bring up your own charge. That's fantastic. I can share one here. I think I learned it from Dr. Rao. He said that you can also view people that the universe send these people in your path to teach you and then you insert in this part whatever you want. So for me, I get angry quite easily. So I'm saying the universe send these members of my family to teach me patience. and to teach me uh tranquility you know so whenever i get into one of these uh conversations i just look at them and i'm like okay i'm here i'm learning patience from this interaction i'm learning patience so that's right that's a good way focusing on ourselves yeah all right great okay another question here from camilla about spirit and soul i haven't found the correct definition for them Are they inside of our body? Where's the place of each one in our body, for example? Our consciousness, is that our spirit? Can you share your point of view on this? Yeah, and I can only share my point of view because there's no definitive answers to this. But I look at soul as the individual expression of spirit. So each of you has your own soul. I have Anadeya's soul. Alex, you have your soul. And Valeria and, you know, the people that I'm seeing here, you each have your own soul. But spirit is universal. So spirit is the universal expression of our souls. And soul is the individual expression of spirit. That's how I look at it. It's sort of like you turn on a lamp and that light is in that particular light bulb. But the electricity is going through the whole house. You know, it's going through the whole neighborhood. It's universal, but it lights up the individual. So your soul is your individual expression of spirit. The more I focus on my dreams, the more I don't see them coming true. What is the real way to do it? How can I find more peace? So if you focus on your dreams and the more you do that, the less. They're happening. And I would say there's a fundamental belief in your way. And of course, I don't know what that belief might be, but it could be some of the common beliefs. I'm not worthy. There's something wrong with me. I don't deserve it. Something will happen if I become successful. Everybody will want a piece of me or I'll make a mistake in front of everybody or, you know, some kind of belief is in there. that is interfering. I find the same thing with money. People can work three jobs and then they get an extra paycheck and suddenly somebody hits their car and they have to go, you know, pay to get their car fixed. There's some belief about not being worthy. So look at what your beliefs are about success or about what you want to manifest. Anadeya, do you have a guru? You know, I don't have a particular guru. And I have gone to various gurus over the decades of my life. And I've gotten Shaktipat from some of them and awakening. But the regular going to a guru just doesn't quite work for me. I see everyone that I meet as having something to teach. So I see the guru in everything. It is said that we are to help ourselves first before we are ready to help others. Many make the mistake of thinking they must be helping others and and before they help themselves and are coming from an unaligned and balanced core self. However, as we will never be perfect, how can we best find this balance? Well, I think we have to do both no matter what. If you're working on yourself and you say, okay, now I'm ready to serve and you stop your practices, then you're going to burn out. And so we never stop that maintenance. Just like, you know, we never stop taking a shower. You know, you never say, okay, I'm clean now. I never have to take a shower again. Or I ate today. I never have to eat again. Or, you know, we always have to keep learning. We always have to keep practicing. And that sustains us for our work in the world. So I think we do both all the time. As we become more whole. Wholeness is really wanted in the world and things will show up that give you opportunities to serve. The more you evolve yourself, the more things will just present themselves for you to serve them. Is there a difference between having a great day when everything else is in alignment, for example, energy, productivity, easy communication, and connection to a higher self and having a Kundalini awakening? If so, what is the difference? The Kundalini awakening is not about the outer world at all. It's about the inner world pretty much only. You might get vision, but the vision is more colors and sounds, and it's an interior experience of your own energy. And when you have a great day where everything's going well and you're in sync, I mean, that's great. When we have our blockages removed, that's going to happen more often. But that's not about Kundalini. And Kundalini isn't about your outer world. One asked if I see chakras. I noticed that came up in the chat. And yes, I do. But here's how I look at it. I can see chakras. I can read chakras just like I can read a book. But I imagine you can all read too. And if I said, all right, tell me what this says. But you say, well, I have to sit down and read it, and then I can tell you what it says. So it's the same way for me in reading people's chakras. I have to go into a certain state of consciousness and concentrate and focus, and then I can see. But when I'm just walking around, I don't have that vision turned on. I might see a headline if it's really big, but I don't know the story unless I sit down and look. I still have chakras which are out of balance. Will the manifestation process work for me, or do I need to wait until I have balanced all of them? No, you don't need to wait. You know, I have these different workshops that are, you know, the upward current and the downward current. And a lot of people, the downward current is their first workshop with me. And they do it just fine. And they learn a lot. And what we're going to learn in the downward current is some additional techniques to remove blocks. So we're still going to get, you know, freeing techniques so that things can dispel the resistance that we feel as we move down. No, you don't have to be perfect. I'm noticing in the questions both on the Facebook and here that there's a lot of people that think there is a right way or that am I normal if I do this and that we should be a certain way. And I would love to encourage people to let go of that. and be with what is for you. That those right and wrong ways, that's just somebody's overlay. What we're finding is a model that teaches us how to explore ourselves deeper and how to take that out into the world. Did you learn to see chakras or did you always see chakras? Well, I actually had a kind of... This kind of psychic vision that was not very regular. Sometimes it was there, sometimes it wasn't. And because of that, I went to a place called the Berkeley Psychic Institute back in the late 70s, long time ago. And I did study there how to read chakras. And I studied there for a couple of years and developed my clairvoyant vision. And that was a useful training. I took what was useful to it and I let go of the rest. But I learned some valuable things there. She said, in the heart chakra, so the one we did before, in the heart chakra, we learn about integrating the vulnerable inner child, loving parent side, rebellious teenager, light and shadow selves, and masculine and feminine. But how to do it all. How to identify our shadow self and how to heal it. That's the difficult part because the shadow, by definition, is something we don't want to see. It's hidden. You know, your shadow is behind you. And the technique that I use in my workshops is that whatever you find yourself frequently judging in other people, like, oh, that person, she's so loud, or that person, she's so messy, or so irresponsible. Whatever that is, is our shadow as well. It's something that we have not allowed. So when we see it in somebody else, we say, how dare they be so loud? I'm very quiet and I'm never loud. Or how dare they be so selfish? I'm not selfish at all. But there's usually some part inside us that is longing to be a little louder, a little more selfish, a little more of whatever it is we judge. When we can start to own that, then the judgment goes away. Those people don't show up in our life as much. And we start to reclaim our shadow. And the shadow is something that starts out with a healthy root. Like for me, I found years ago, one of the things that I judged was people that I thought were getting something for nothing. You know, the people that come and hang on and they don't help with the dishes or they don't do anything to help. They just want to show up. Anybody else have that? See that in their life? And I realized that I was like an over worker all the time. I was working, working, working, a workaholic. And I didn't give myself a break. I didn't let people give to me, you know, just for the sake of giving to me. So once I started to own that, that there's a healthy route to that, then. The lazy people trying to get something for nothing, they didn't show up in my life anymore. So whatever we judge is a clue to our shadow. Do you feel that particular chakras are blocked when people burn out or is it just an overall blockage? You know, third chakra is fire, right? That's the element fire. So solar plexus. So when we burn out, it is often... you know, the third chakra has just burned up its fuel and we've burned up all that we have and we haven't taken more in. So to keep the fire burning, you have to keep bringing logs in from outside and you have to keep putting them on the fire. So if we're giving and giving and giving and we're not taking in, then we're going to burn out. But that could be the heart is giving and the heart's not taking in. It could be we're talking and not listening. You know, it could be in any chakra, but burnout kind of refers to fire. So I think of third chakra. How do our energy bodies... our auras fit into all of this and how do our energy bodies interact with our chakras ah that's a great question um i think of the chakras as the generators of the energy you know we have this core and the chakras generate the patterns just like a light bulb generates the light but if you look at a lamp you see kind of a field of light around the lamp right It's generated by the light bulb, but that field goes out or a flashlight. The light is in the flashlight, but it shines all the way down the path. So the aura is the field that is generated by the chakras. And in that way, there's people who correlate the layers of the aura to different chakras. I don't find that so true. And I hear it all different ways. Some people say the one farthest out is the first chakra. Some people say the one closest in is the first chakra. If I were to correlate that, I would say the one closest to the body is your first chakra, and then the layers get larger. And then was there another part to that question, Alex? How do our energy bodies interact with the other chakras? Yeah, how do they interact? Let's even look at how do they interact with each other. So I come with my chakra pattern and I come together with another person. It could be a friend over dinner or it could be a loved one or whatever in their chakra pattern. And then the fields that are created by the chakras overlap. And anytime we're in close... you know, we're close physically to someone and sometimes even when it's not close physically, there is an overlapping of energy. And then someone's dominant energy may come into someone else's deficient energy and we're balancing each other out for better or worse. So, yeah. And, you know, when we pull something out of the field, sometimes that chakra can let go and heal. I have an energy worker working on me right now that's pulling some things out of my field and wow, I feel better. So it's all a mystery though. They're still doing a lot of research trying to figure these things out. Great. Let's go with this question from Josefina. My chakras are kind of in zigzag and unbalanced. One excessive, two deficient, three excessive and so on. Which is the best approach to use the yoga flows? And what should I focus on from these exercises to come into balance? Well, again, the yoga is designed to open the gate. So if something is unbalanced and you open the gate, it's going to start to balance out. Just like if I open a window and it's warm outside, the warm air will come in. Or if it's cold outside, the cold air will come in and the warm air will go out. So if we open the gate, then the energy that needs to be let go of has a way to get out. And the energy that we need to receive has a way to get in. So unless the gateway is open, we can't balance anything. And that's what the yoga is designed for. Now, by opening your shoulders or strengthening your legs or lifting your chest, you're opening a place to have better alignment so the energy can follow. Should we deal with blockages that come from a traumatic event in a different way than blockages that appear during the evolutionary stage of our growth? Well, if there is trauma, you know, trauma is very, very high charge that is blocked from release. That's what creates post -traumatic stress syndrome. And the rules in trauma are slightly different. And in general, to say quickly, to release the energy more slowly, to release a little bit and stabilize, and then release a little bit more and then stabilize instead of trying to get everything out. So if you're doing the bioenergetic exercises, do them a little bit and see what happens. Maybe take a day off, feel the rest of the day. Don't do it too much and do a little bit more. Make sure you don't get what we call dysregulated in your nervous system because that's what trauma is. It's a dysregulation. of the nervous system and the energy pattern. So we don't want to recreate that. So little by little. How can we see or think about the current political division in a way that brings more healing? Yeah, I think about this all the time. I think that, you know, in the metaphor of the butterfly, the butterfly flies out on a right wing and a left wing. but there's an organization at the core. So it is neither left nor right. The political division, I think, is what happens in a cell when a cell is going to divide is the chromosomes line up on one side and line up on the other because the cell is pulling apart. So it can reintegrate at a higher level with maybe another cell. So I think if we look at this deep, you know, I think it's all over the world, but certainly in America, you know, the deep divide between left and right in America, it's Republicans and Democrats, but we have it in many places in the world I'm seeing, is that these are systems that have been in place or trying to get in place that are clashing because everyone has some piece of truth in their system. So we have to find that piece of truth and take it to a higher level. and part of moving from the love of power power is struggle and duality and all the movies that have a good guy and a bad guy and they're fighting each other and which one's going to win that's all third chakra and the heart chakra goes to a higher level where it's not about the differences it's about the commonalities and i think that when we can paint a vision of where we're going that people, regardless of what side the fence they're on, they can start to say, oh, well, that vision I can go for. And I think that we're in this area of tumult because it's creating something better. That's really beautiful. Let's read two really fast comments here that we got. I see one from Bianca. Thank you so much for all of this wonderful information. I love every part of this quest. Thank you, Anadeya, for all of your knowledge and your impact. We have one more from Monica. This quest has helped me a lot so far. And I'm so grateful that I found this quest just at the right time in my life. And I feel, as you said, that we should keep healing every day. Oh, thank you. Thank you. You know, in answer to that last question, can I take another moment and tell a story? And this is from the stories of the incarnations of Vishnu. And in one of his incarnations, The good guys and the bad guys, the devas and the rasuras, is it? Maybe Shishwati you know. They line up with a serpent wrapped around the central mountain. What is the mountain called? I forget at the moment. Anyway, and they pull. And so one on one side, they pull in this direction and then they... pull in the other direction and they pull back and forth and the mountain spins and it churns the ocean of milk into new ideas. So if we see this push and pull between the two sides, that's churning the ocean of milk into the birth of new ideas. And that is where we're going. Really beautiful. That's all the time we have for today. So I hope you guys had a lot of fun and got a lot of value from this session. So thank you very much, Anadella. for all of this wonderful information and see you for one more call next week. Namaste. Have fun coming down, back down the chakras, back down to earth. Namaste. See you next week. Thanks for coming on. That's all for me. All there's left to say is stay committed, Rainbow Warriors. Work on the piece that's in front of you. Thank you very much for all of your questions, your engagement, your comments, your participation, for showing up and for playing full out. And until our last call, be extraordinary, my friends. Take care. Bye -bye. Bye.

Week 5: The Downward Manifestation Current

====================

LESSON 29 - Crown Chakra: Consciousness Creates
--------------------
<v ->So here we are taking the first steps</v> in our manifesting current. Starting at the crown chakra. So you've done work to clarify your life purpose, to choose the area in which you want to create the life of your dreams. Now we're going to pull one specific arrow from the quiver of your ideas, and notch it up in the bow, and shoot it towards its target. That means setting an intention. So in this lesson, we're going to learn how to clarify and strengthen the power of our intention. Everything you manifest starts out with saying, "I'm going to do this." So think of your intention like a rubber band. In fact, the word comes from tendare, which means to stretch. So here you are in your given reality. You have only so much time, so much money, so many skills, that's what's current. And you want to stretch toward your goal. Now your goal is something that isn't here yet, but you put a stake in the ground. "I'm going to have this business developed "by such-and-such date. "I'm going to have the family I want. "I'm going to have the home I want. "I'm going to go back to school and get my degree." You're putting a stake in the ground at some point in the future for what you want. And your stretching. So what do we know about rubber bands? When we let one end of it go, it snaps back, right? So if this is your reality, and this is your dream, which end do you think you want to let go of? Well, most people say, "I want to go back to school, "but you know what, I don't really have time." And, "I don't really have the foundation course I need "to study what I want." And, "You know, I'm not even sure I'm smart enough." And, "You know what, it's way too complicated." And they give all the excuses for not having their dream and that stretch shrinks back, and they're left with their ordinary reality. But if instead you set your intention and you put a stake in the ground so that end doesn't slip, and you move your reality toward your dream, then that stretch will pull you toward your dream. So what does that look like? It says, "I might be busy, but I can find the time. "I might had not had that one course I need, "but I know I can go to "the community college and take it. "I might not have the money, "but you know, there's student loans." And you take the steps you need to move your reality to your dream. Now the fact is we do this all the time. You do it when you have to be at work in the morning, you say, "I have to be at my desk at 8:30," and you know what time you have to get out of bed, and how long you have to eat your breakfast, and what time you need to leave your house so that you can be at a certain place at a certain time, or if you have a dentist appointment, or you have to pick up your kids. We do this all the time. Use the same principle to manifest your dream. But here's the thing, if your goal is only this far, there's no stretch, nothing is going to move, nothing is going to pull you. So the farther you stretch, the more that's going to pull your reality forward. Remember to reach far. It was Michelangelo who said, "It's not about reaching too far and missing our mark, "it's about reaching too low, "and making our mark and staying there." So to help you follow along with the manifestation exercises, so we have Melissa here, who has volunteered to get vulnerable and process the downward current as a demo for the exercises. And you can watch what I do with Melissa and you can do it on your own as you watch the demo. So she will be the stand-in, and we thank you for coming Melissa. <v ->Thank you for having me.</v> <v ->Do you have a dream that you want to manifest?</v> <v ->Yes.</v> <v ->Ah, can you tell me what it is?</v> <v ->I want to create a social enterprise</v> that inspires heart-centered revolutionaries to co-create the next stage of revolution in the world. <v ->Oh, that's beautiful.</v> That's beautiful. So we want to get that really concise. So see if you can take a few words out of it and just say it a little bit more clearer so you got it, and you can say it in just a matter of seconds. <v ->I'm here to inspire others to a world of possibilities.</v> <v ->Beautiful, I'm here to inspire others</v> to a world of possibilities. So you would have picked something from your dream areas. Say out loud what your dream is going to be. Great. So you're setting your intention. In our intentions, we talk about being, doing, and having as three levels of manifestation. Being is kind of your upper chakras, and it's very personal. You can decide to be happy or unhappy, and it's really just up to you. Doing occurs in the social universe. "Let's do lunch sometime." That occurs by negotiations and promises and agreements, and it involves other people most often. And then having occurs in the physical universe. Having follows the laws of physics. If you want to have an apple, you have to grow an apple tree and harvest it or go to a store and give them some money. You can't just go, "I'm going to have an apple in my hand." What we want to do now is work from the place of being. So most people think if I only had, and I say this all over my lectures and people always say, "If I only had more money," or, "If I only had more time." So for you, if you only had, what? <v ->More money and time.</v> <v ->Then you could do, what?</v> Then you could do, what? <v ->Can take that time and infuse</v> into more of my hobbies and projects. <v ->Okay, and if you could have that</v> and you could do that, you would be, what? <v ->Happy.</v> <v ->Say, "I would be happy."</v> <v ->I would, I'd be happy.</v> <v ->So almost everywhere I go,</v> when I ask this question, the audience says time or money for having, the doing is whatever they choose, and almost everybody says, "I would be happy." <v ->Happy.</v> <v ->And some people say,</v> "If I could only do something, then I would have this, "if I could only go back to school, "then I would have the job I want, then I would be happy." But in the manifestation process starting in the upper chakras, we turn it around. And so I'll say to you, who or how would you have to be, in order to have and do what you want? <v ->I would be happier.</v> <v ->All right, so we did the do, be, and have,</v> so now I want to ask you the question who or how would you have to be in order to do and have what you want? And that might be being more focused. Like for myself, to write my books, I have to really be focused. I am not a focus person by nature. I'm very scattered, I'm very easily distracted. So I have to create being focused. So pick something that you don't have that you would like to be. And it's not a thing, it's not like, "I want to be a dancer," it's, "I want to be happy, "I want to be peaceful, "I want to be confident, "I want to be powerful." Pick something like that. <v ->Powerful.</v> <v Anodea>Okay, so you want to be powerful.</v> <v ->I'm full of power.</v> <v ->You want to be full of power.</v> That even has more power, that's great. Okay, so we want to make that statement. Once you know what you want to be and develop, we want 'em to take that statement and we want to say it in the present time as if it were so. So say, "I am full of power." <v ->I am full of power.</v> <v ->Great.</v> And as we say it, we want to actually create it. <v ->Okay.</v> I am full of power. <v ->Right, okay, so that's your intention.</v> Now as soon as we set an intention, we see everything that's not that. That's preexisting conditions. If I want to build a house on top of a hill and I make that declaration, the next thing I notice is, but there's no road to the top of the hill, or there's no water up there, or there's a lot of trees there, or there's boulders in the way. These are obstacles, they're preexisting conditions. Now in the psyche, 'cause we're in the personal universe, your obstacles can be thoughts that you have, feelings that arise, things you tell your self, they could be a little quirk or tension in your body, they could be internal obstacles or they could be external. So these obstacles are not going to go away by ignoring them. Sometimes we say, "Well I just won't look at that, "and maybe it'll go away on its own," but that doesn't usually happen. In fact, they need our attention, but they don't need to take away from our intention. So what we do is we give them attention by allowing them to come up, and out through the body by exaggerating. And then as that energy is freed up, we take that and we pound the stake in the ground to our intention a little deeper. So exaggerate means to get it out. We don't want to intensify, we want to get it out, that's a discharge, and then with that freed up energy, bring it to our intention. So you ready to do that exercise? <v ->Mm-hmm, let's do it.</v> <v ->Okay, great.</v> Okay Melissa, now that you have a being intention and you know what crosscurrents are, we're going to do an exercise with that. So I'm going to ask you, I'll just say, "Intention," and I want you to state your intention that this is so, in present time, and to create it while you're saying it. And then I'll say any crosscurrents and I want you to bring up the crosscurrent and I'll ask you to exaggerate it and get it big out of your body, then we'll go back to the intention. Let's see what happens, you ready? <v ->Let's do it.</v> <v ->Okay.</v> So what is your intention? <v ->I am full of power.</v> <v ->Okay, great.</v> What's the first counter current that comes up, the first crosscurrent? <v ->I'm not.</v> <v ->Yeah.</v> So how would you exaggerate, "Oh no, your not. "Who do you think you are?" <v ->Who do you think you are--</v> <v ->Not in your head, get it in your body.</v> <v ->You don't know what you're doing!</v> How can you do this? <v ->Yeah.</v> Okay, state your intention. I am full of power. <v ->I am full of power.</v> <v ->And now notice if you don't know what you're doing,</v> is that a little bit less, or is it gone? <v ->Less.</v> <v ->A little bit less, yeah.</v> But it's not gone yet. Yeah, you didn't fully exaggerate it. So I'm going to ask you to exaggerate it again, even bigger, get it out of your body and let's see if we can shrink it down or get rid of it. So, intention. <v ->I am full of power.</v> <v ->crosscurrent.</v> <v ->You're not full of power,</v> you don't know what you're doing! How could you do this? <v ->Right, yeah.</v> So now intention. <v ->I am full of power.</v> <v Anodea>Is that one gone or is it less?</v> Do we need to do it again? <v ->Let me say this over.</v> I am full of power. Hmm, there's still a little bit left. <v ->A little bit left, so exaggerate it one more time.</v> <v ->You don't know what you're doing!</v> How could you do this? <v Anodea>Yeah, good.</v> Now intention. <v ->I am full of power.</v> <v ->Is that one gone?</v> <v ->Mm-hmm.</v> <v Anodea>Meaning, the energy of it gone?</v> <v ->Mm-hmm.</v> <v ->Okay.</v> Intention again. <v ->I am full of power.</v> <v ->See what is the next crosscurrent that comes up.</v> It could be a feeling in your body, a thought that you have, an outer circumstance. <v ->I'm not good enough.</v> <v ->Okay, can you exaggerate that voice</v> that says, "I'm not good enough?" <v ->Oh, it's a hard one.</v> <v ->Yeah, just exaggerate, you want to get that</v> out of you. <v ->Whoo!</v> I'm not good enough. <v ->Yeah, okay, intention.</v> <v ->I'm full of power.</v> <v ->And how does that feel, I'm not good enough,</v> is that power of that, how does that feel, I'm not good enough? Is that message a little less, is it gone? <v ->It's getting there, it's really, really small now.</v> <v ->So sometimes we exaggerate it and it clears in one try,</v> sometimes it's still hangin' around and we have to exaggerate it several times. One more time, give it all you got. Get this out of you. <v ->I'm not good enough!</v> <v ->Right, okay!</v> Intention. <v ->I am powerful!</v> <v ->All right, how does--</v> <v ->I am full of power!</v> <v Anodea>That feel?</v> <v ->Did the same thing, yeah.</v> <v ->Say I'm full of power.</v> <v ->I'm full of power!</v> <v ->All right, feel how that's getting more powerful?</v> <v ->Mm-hmm.</v> <v ->Now is that</v> I'm not good enough, is that gone? <v ->Done.</v> <v ->Okay.</v> Intention. <v ->I'm full of power.</v> <v Anodea>And what's your next crosscurrent?</v> <v ->I'm not ready.</v> <v ->Ahh, okay, so you're not ready.</v> Can you exaggerate the feeling of not being ready? Can you act that out? <v ->Like this.</v> Oh, I'm not ready! <v ->I'm not ready!</v> <v ->Yeah, what do you want to do with your hands,</v> you want to push things away? <v ->I don't want to do anything.</v> It's sort of like this. <v ->Yeah, you want to get it out.</v> You don't want to intensify it and take it in. You want to get it out. Oh, I'm not ready, I'm not ready-- <v ->Not ready.</v> <v ->The same way!</v> <v ->'Kay, I'm not ready, I'm not ready,</v> get out. <v ->Good.</v> <v ->I am full of power.</v> <v ->And now what's your next crosscurrent?</v> <v ->I'm not ready!</v> <v ->Okay, can you exaggerate that and make it big</v> and get that one out of you? <v ->I'm not ready!</v> Yep. <v ->Yeah, okay,</v> so intention? <v ->I am full of power.</v> <v ->Is that one less or gone?</v> <v ->Less.</v> <v ->Okay, can you do it</v> one more time to get it gone? <v ->I'm not ready!</v> <v ->Yeah.</v> And now come back, intention. <v ->I'm full of power.</v> <v ->And is that one gone?</v> <v ->Yes.</v> <v ->All right,</v> you just cleared three crosscurrents. <v ->Whoo hoo!</v> <v ->Whoo hoo!</v> The more you clear the crosscurrents, the more you get them out of the way, and then there's nothing left but your intention. Now sometimes it takes four or five tries to clear a crosscurrent. And what we mean is we're clearing the energy of the crosscurrent out. And as you do that, your intention'll get stronger and stronger and you may have 17 crosscurrents. The idea is to uproot them and get them out. So don't quit the exercise too soon, take it for all it's worth, and really get those crosscurrents handled and strengthen your intention until that's all you have left. So I'll finish this up with one question. Are you full of power? <v ->Yes!</v> <v ->Whoo!</v> I feel it. So when you're shooting your arrow toward your target, and setting your intention, anything that does not come into alignment with that, you could call a crosscurrent. These are the obstacles that are pre-existing conditions, feelings in the body, thoughts that you have, doubts and fears. These are the crosscurrents that are going to blow your arrow off course. So we want to exaggerate them, X means get it out. We want to get them out of the way, and then harness that energy to be in alignment with your intention. And that makes your intention stronger and more likely to manifest. Just know that crosscurrents are natural and you can expect them. They're there all the time. Do not ignore them, they are obstacles wanting your attention to be handled. Nothing more, nothing less. Good manifesters, they don't have fewer obstacles than other people, they just don't get stopped by them. They know how to handle the obstacles or get rid of them and they keep on going. So that's what we're going to teach you on this being level. Now you can do the same exercise for doing and having, it just takes a little longer. But it sets up a path of opportunity. Being intentioned happens more quickly. That's why we're going to start here so you get to experience it. So now you know how to clarify your intention. You can even do this on your own if you don't have a coach, you can just be on your way to a meeting and set an intention for how you want to be in the meeting. And then exaggerate being tired or not wanting to go to the meeting and just exaggerate that and get it out of your system, but always go back to your intention. It's a powerful way to create the reality you want. So your exercise for today is to practice getting some of these crosscurrents out of the way, to write it down, share it with the Tribe. Tune in tomorrow, and we're going to explore the principle vision vitalizes.

====================

LESSON 30 - Third Eye Chakra: Vision Vitalyzes
--------------------
<v ->So welcome back.</v> Now that you've declared your intention it's good to start putting it in motion. When we take that arrow of our idea and we notch it up in our bow, we aim it toward a target. Otherwise we're not going to hit our mark. And when we set that, we want to visualize that target. Now, that target only exists in your own mind. Your finished product does not exist in the world yet, it only exists right here in the third eye chakra. So you have to keep on visualizing it. Okay, we're now back with Melissa and I'm going to teach her a Clear Beliefs Process that was created by Lion Goodman and we're going to go into chapter six. We're going to use the powers of visualization to imagine our dream and also to change our negative beliefs and replace them with positive beliefs. So Melissa, can you see, I would call it the endpoint but sometimes the endpoint is the beginning. The endpoint of our romantic dream might be walking down the aisle with our beloved, the beginning of a lifelong relationship. So if you see a point of fulfillment of your dream and you visualize it, what does that look like to you? <v ->I am...</v> <v ->What do you want to say what your dream is,</v> I see myself doing interviews, I see myself running a company. <v ->My point of fulfillment,</v> I see myself traveling around the world. I am following the greatest stories of these impactful people and I'm elevating these stories. I've got this social enterprise that's working with Heart Center Revolutionaries and they're there to inspire the world and just work on the next stage of human evolution. <v ->Beautiful, beautiful.</v> So sit back and visualize that a moment. And as you look at that create like a laser beam between this moment and that moment of fulfillment. So you're making a direct line and it's like the laser beam is going to really cut through. Now, tell me if there's anything that comes up for you that makes it hard to believe you can really have that dream. Any doubts you may have, any part of you that says, no, that's not possible and tell me what that is. <v ->I don't have the resources.</v> <v ->You don't have the resources, anything else?</v> <v ->I don't have the full picture,</v> the steps to get there completely. I don't know completely the way. <v ->You don't know the way, that's what we're figuring out</v> in this manifestation process and most of us start off not knowing the way. Any doubts about yourself? <v ->Don't have the,</v> I don't have the energy, I don't have the time, I'm scared. <v ->You're scared, yeah.</v> And what are you scared might happen? <v ->I'm scared</v> it's not what I'm supposed to do or if I get there, I wasted my time. You know there's always this fear like maybe you will succeed and maybe that wasn't the point. Maybe you wasted your time, maybe you should have just stuck to something simpler. <v ->Oh yeah but then when we talked about the rubber band</v> and how we have to really stretch or it doesn't make anything move, he gets something simpler. You're not going to make that move anything. <v ->What if it doesn't happen?</v> <v ->What if it doesn't happen?</v> So these are all beliefs that we get that come up, that get in our way. And beliefs we create in our consciousness. They're where we take bits of meaning but they're there. Not all of them are we aware of, some of them are just beliefs that are hidden from consciousness but they're like filters through which we see the world. And if those beliefs are in the way, when we're shooting that arrow toward our target, they're like a crosswind that's going to blow the arrow off course. So Melissa, let's pick one belief that you might like to change that is a limiting belief that is going to keep you, if you really believe it, from achieving your goal. And what I like to say when someone makes these beliefs is that's an interesting belief so that I'm highlighting that it's just a belief. It may or may not be true. <v ->Okay, let's do it.</v> <v ->So you seem to have a belief</v> that it might not be the right thing, I might make a mistake, I don't have everything I need. <v ->I don't have everything I need,</v> it might not be the right thing, I might be wasting my time, I'm scared. I'm scared I might not have what it takes. <v Anodea>That you might not have what it takes.</v> Now, that's a very common belief that we have when we go to manifest something big. That there's something wrong with me or I don't have what it takes or, yeah. <v ->Am I good enough?</v> <v Anodea>Or I'm not good enough.</v> <v ->Am I ready for this?</v> <v ->Yeah, am I ready for this?</v> These are the things that come up as countercurrents. But in this exercise, we're going to learn a new way of removing those countercurrents especially the ones that stick a little deeper and they don't quite go away in the former exercise. So what if we, what does it feel like to pick the belief I don't have what it takes. <v ->Just saying it, right over here it feels really heavy.</v> <v ->Okay, would you like to work with that belief?</v> <v ->Yes.</v> <v ->Would you like to change it?</v> <v ->Absolutely.</v> <v ->Okay, good.</v> So we're going to take you through a visualization exercise that will give a visual form to that belief and allow you to remove it and replace it with something more positive. So uncross your legs, put both feet across the floor and just go to your meditation position. Relax and center yourself. And as you breathe and close your eyes, imagine you're walking through a beautiful forest. The path is so smooth, many people have walked it before, that you can actually take your shoes off. And as you're walking you notice ahead a kind of clearing. You're not sure what it is but you're drawn toward it. And it's a large clearing. And as you get there you see a circle of stones and a fire, big fire and funny enough, next to the fire there's a full length mirror. Just nod if you can see all this. So walk up to the mirror and notice what you're wearing. See yourself in the boots and the gray pants and sweater, white blouse. And we won't really be watching this part, it's only in your imagination but take off your current clothing and whatever belief that represents and set it aside. And now, in your imagination, feel what if feels like to hold the belief, I don't have what it takes, maybe even say it out loud and feel it in your body, what it's like to live life holding the belief, I don't think I have what it takes. <v ->So I should say it out loud.</v> <v ->Yeah.</v> Remember all the times you felt that way all the way back to the first time you can remember thinking or feeling that belief. <v ->It's more like a doubt, can I really do this?</v> Do I have what it takes? <v ->But what does it feel like in your body?</v> Does it feel heavy or tight? <v ->My feet feel really heavy.</v> <v Anodea>Your feet feel heavy.</v> <v ->Like immovable.</v> <v ->Yeah, what does it feel like</v> in your breath and your shoulders. <v ->I felt my chest just clench up.</v> <v ->Okay, so it doesn't feel good to hold this belief, right?</v> So make a conscious decision. Do you want to keep this belief or are you ready to let it go? <v ->Let's let it go.</v> <v ->Let's let it go.</v> So feeling how this feels in your body, imagine that an outfit, a set of clothing, could be realistic or unrealistic, it could be you're in a suit of armor or shards of glass or you're in something too tight or heavy. Feel an outfit that feels the way it is to hold that belief and when you're ready imagine you're looking in that mirror and you're looking at the outfit that represents the belief, I don't have what it takes. <v ->I've got a giant backpack on.</v> <v Anodea>A giant backpack.</v> <v ->And it's a boulder.</v> <v ->And it's a boulder.</v> And I may write these things down as a coach. And what are you wearing besides that? <v ->Black.</v> <v ->What kind of cloth, is it tight?</v> Does it cover you? <v ->It's tight, it covers me, it's constricting.</v> It's like a ninja outfit. <v ->Like a ninja outfit that's constricting.</v> Okay, so does that feel good? <v ->No.</v> <v ->Not particularly, doesn't sound like it.</v> So make a conscious decision. Do you want to keep this belief or do you want to let it go? <v ->I want to let it go.</v> <v ->You want to let it go.</v> So if you want to let it go, imagine taking this outfit off. By any means necessary you can rip it off, you can cut it off, you can unzip it and let it fall to the floor. And tell me when it's gone. <v ->Can I move my hands?</v> <v ->Yeah, and after the outfit's off</v> you can take that out from any part of your body where you still feel it. So like you're pulling it out of your shoulders or you're pulling it out of your throat, you're pulling it out of your chakras. <v ->I sort of feel like doing just...</v> <v ->Yeah.</v> <v ->Okay, it's off.</v> <v Anodea>And notice that the feelings come off</v> along with the outfit. How does it feel to not have that on you anymore? <v ->It feels lighter.</v> <v ->Good, so let your brain body interface notice that feeling</v> and then scoop up the outfit on the floor and compact it, wad it into a little ball and hold it in front of you. <v ->Recognize that this belief, this belief outfit,</v> has served you in some way although you might not see or understand at the moment and address that saying, "Thank you for having served me in my life." <v ->Thank you for having served me in my life.</v> <v Anodea>I've outgrown you and I don't need you anymore.</v> <v ->I've outgrown you and I don't need you anymore.</v> <v Anodea>Your job is done.</v> <v ->Your job is done.</v> <v Anodea>I'm now sending you back to the nothingness</v> from which you came 'cause it's just a belief made of consciousness. <v ->I'm sending you back to the nothingness at which you came.</v> <v Anodea>And anything else you want to say to the belief.</v> <v ->Good bye.</v> <v ->Good bye.</v> So this is making a formal separation from the belief. And now take what you've wadded up in your hands and throw it in the fire and see it burn completely. So feel what it feels like to have that outfit gone, burned up, off your body, out of you, how does that feel? <v ->Relieved.</v> <v ->Oh good, yeah.</v> You just have a big smile on your face, wonderful. Now, we don't want to leave you naked. So we want to put a new belief in its place. You know, nature abhors a vacuum. We get rid of something, it will just come right back unless we put something in its place. So we're going to install a new program, a belief that's counter to the belief you just got rid of. So we'll work together to get one that works. So what's a new belief you might want to have? What's a belief that would replace the old belief, I don't have what it takes. <v ->I do have what it takes, I can do this.</v> <v ->Yeah, that's getting there but that's, you know,</v> we could make it even a little more positive. We could give it a punch more than you have what it takes, you were born for this. <v ->I was born for this.</v> <v ->Yeah, or this is what the universe has empowered me to do</v> or I contain everything to make this a gift to humanity. Something that has a little more punch. <v ->The universe has given me everything I need to do this.</v> I just got to trust the process. <v Anodea>Yeah, yeah.</v> Does that feel like it has a little charge for you? <v ->Yeah.</v> <v Anodea>Okay, all right.</v> Say it again. <v ->I was born for this.</v> The universe has given me everything I needed to make this come true. I just have to trust the process. <v ->Beautiful, beautiful.</v> Can you make it to one concise thing. How about just I was born for this. <v ->I was born for this.</v> <v ->Great, great.</v> Feel what it feels like to hold that belief and feel it shining out like a light from every cell in your body, from every one of your chakras. And now imagine that this belief also has an outfit that goes with, I was born for this, I have everything I need and put that outfit on. What are you wearing? <v ->It's just a shiny space suit.</v> <v ->It's a shiny space suit.</v> And how does it feel to wear that? What color is it? <v ->It's sparkly.</v> <v Anodea>It's sparkly.</v> <v ->And shiny.</v> It's like rainbow colored. <v ->And rainbow colors.</v> It's got all the chakras in it, wonderful. So you're looking in the mirror, you're seeing yourself in this, how do you feel? <v ->Expansive.</v> <v Anodea>Wonderful.</v> Is this a belief you want to keep? <v ->Heck yes, yes.</v> <v ->Sure, okay.</v> So then when you're ready just imagine that you're looking in the mirror, you're approving over yourself, you thank the fire, you thank the stones in the circle, you're wearing your new outfit, your new belief and you walk back through the forest back into where your body is sitting, right here in this chair. Open your eyes and return to normal consciousness. How do you feel? <v ->I feel expansive, light.</v> Now I have a spacesuit on so now I can just go on into space. <v ->Oh great, great, I see you dancing up there.</v> So take some time in the next 24 hours to integrate this new belief and to see what feels different. Get it really in the cells of your body. Note that it may change your attitude, some things around you may change and other beliefs might even pop up. You can do the same thing. You can do this on your own, imagine you're at the fire looking at what belief that is, taking it off, thanking it and allowing a new belief to replace it and a new outfit. Great, enjoy your new belief. <v ->Thank you.</v> <v ->All of you have many beliefs that can get in the way</v> when you go to manifest your dream. We have thousands of them, many layers. So whenever one comes up, notice that it's just a belief and take yourself through this Clear Beliefs Process that was created by Lion Goodman. And if you want to learn a little bit more you can go to his website that will be listed in the manual. So your exercise for today is to practice the belief closet, follow along and do your own belief and to spend some time writing in your journal about your negative beliefs, your positive beliefs, what you believe about yourself, about money, about life, about relationship. Just do kind of a belief upheaval and dump and then when you just have it on paper you can spend time saying, "Which beliefs do I really want to change?" "Which ones serve me and which ones limit me?" Tomorrow we'll go down into the fifth chakra, we'll work in communicating your vision and getting rid of those negative voices that get in your way.

====================

LESSON 31 - Throat Chakra: Communication Catalyzes
--------------------
<v ->So today, we're going to move out of the realm</v> of pure being and seeing, into the realm of doing, into the realm of communicating, communicating to another person, the realm of speaking, and sharing, and share with each other. So you want to do a lot of communicating here, you want to share what you're doing with the tribe. And we're going to find the words to concisely say, what we want to create, and to talk to people. So when we're talking about building the house, remember that we see it and we imagine it, and then we have to go tell an architect about it, who helps you refine your vision. But as we do this, it's inevitable that those nasty little critical voices, will come up in your head. Do you have any of those? <v ->Yeah, sometimes.</v> <v ->What do some of those voices say?</v> <v ->"You don't have enough time,</v> what are you doing? Do you know what you're doing?" <v ->Right?</v> Does anybody relate to that? Do you have those kind of voices? So this is an exercise called seven voices, that we're going to get those voices out, so that next time you hear them, you can just recognize them for what they are. And those seven voices, three are positive, three are negative, and one is neutral. I'm going to take Melissa through an exercise where she speaks from each one of these. And the diagram is in your companion workbook, that shows you how to mark this out on the floor, and step into each of these positions. So follow along as we do this. Okay Melissa, so those negative voices you have inside you, we're going to get them out. And we're going to balance them with powerful voices. This is going to be seven positions. And for all you following along these positions are shown in your workbook, you can do this on your own, or you can do it along with us. And I'm going to just coach you to let those voices really come out, both the positive and the negative. So Melissa, take a step right to the middle here, face forward and state your dream in neutral terms. <v ->I'm inspiring others to a world of possibilities.</v> <v ->Wonderful, now take a step to the left,</v> and speak from the voice of your Realist. The Realist says, "You know, I know it's tough, there is a tough job market, things are expensive." Whatever is the realistic voice. <v ->It's going to like take a lot of time.</v> It's going to take a lot of energy, I have so much to do. When I start. <v ->Okay, now just take a step to the left,</v> and step into your Doubter. The Doubter says, "I doubt that you know what you're doing?" What does the Doubter say to you? <v ->Can I really do this?</v> What if I don't get the resources that I need? What if this doesn't work out? What if I'm just wasting my time? <v ->Okay, so let's do it again.</v> You say, "I doubt," <v ->I doubt Okay.</v> <v ->Yeah, I doubt that you can do it.</v> It's your Doubter are speaking to you. <v ->Okay.</v> <v ->Okay.</v> <v ->Okay.</v> I doubt you can do this. I doubt you know what you're doing, I doubt you have enough time. I doubt this is worthwhile. <v ->Okay, now take one more step to the left.</v> And this is your Annihilator. The Annihilator is mean and vicious, and it might be bigger than it really is and you're just let it out. <v ->You're not good enough.</v> You don't know what you're doing. <v ->You don't have a right to do it.</v> <v ->You don't have a right to do it.</v> <v ->Yeah, okay how's that feel?</v> <v ->Not good</v> <v ->Yeah, right.</v> So one more step into your Doubter, one line. <v ->I doubt you can do this.</v> <v ->Okay, one more step into your Realist.</v> <v ->I don't have the time or energy.</v> <v ->Now step into Neutral.</v> <v ->I'm inspiring others to create a world of possibilities.</v> <v ->Wonderful, okay, so now we go to the positive end.</v> We balance out the Realist with the Doer. That's the person in you that knows how to do things. Take a step to the right, and speak from the voice of the Doer. <v ->I make time and I give myself energy.</v> <v ->Beautiful, and now take another step to the right.</v> And being the voice of the Dreamer. The dreamer says how wonderful it would be to have this. <v ->I'm alive, I'm living my purpose.</v> This is my passion, I'm living out my purpose in life, and I'm having so much fun with it. <v ->Great, okay, one more step into your Visionary.</v> Now, your visionary can even get beyond realistic, to, "This is going to save the world." So speak from the voice of the Visionary. <v ->I'm going to change the world</v> <v ->Like just get a little bigger than--</v> <v ->Bigger.</v> <v ->I can see how I'm going to just,</v> this is going to be the major show that people watch or you know. <v ->Okay, okay.</v> I'm going to inspire and change many lives and impact to many people all over the world. <v ->Wonderful okay, one step back to your Dreamer, one line.</v> <v ->I'm excited, I'm passionate, I'm living out my purpose.</v> <v ->Take a step to the left into your Doer.</v> <v ->I make time and I have energy.</v> <v ->Wonderful, and one last step back into the Neutral,</v> balancing all these voices on your left and right. Just state your dream, matter of fact. <v ->I'm inspiring others to create a world of possibilities.</v> <v ->Great, how does that feel?</v> <v ->I realized where my voice tend to be most of the time.</v> <v ->Yeah and where is that?</v> <v ->That's very interesting.</v> Sometimes they're mostly in the extreme, but I'm working more towards the middle now. And that's a lot getting more things done. <v ->Good do you feel more balanced?</v> <v ->Yes.</v> <v ->Great thank you, thank you.</v> <v ->Thank you.</v> <v ->So Melissa, how was that, how do you feel now?</v> Do you feel more balanced? <v ->Yeah, it was very enlightening.</v> <v ->Yeah, so you can see how the positive balances</v> the negative and next time you're Annihilator comes up, balance it with your Visionary. Next time your Doubter comes up, balance it with your dreamer. Next time your Realist comes up, balance it with your Doer. And then when you come back to normal, you've got that all in balance. And if you hear those niggling little voices, you know how to deal with them. <v ->Umh.</v> <v ->So practice this on your own.</v> Listen to those voices, get them out, share your experience with the tribe, and tomorrow we will go down into the heart.

====================

LESSON 32 - Heart Chakra: Love Launches
--------------------
<v ->Welcome back, how is your manifestation going?</v> Welcome to the realm of the heart. We're in the middle of the chakra system again. We're coming into the realm of doing, of social interaction and we're here with Melisa and how's it going? Are you getting some clarity and getting rid of those negative voices? <v ->Yep, feels great.</v> <v ->Oh good, good.</v> Is your dream becoming a little clearer? <v ->Crystal.</v> <v ->Crystal clear, wow.</v> I like that. Well, now we want to take it into the next step which is the heart. And you've even said your dream is about empowering the heart and humanity and love powered evolutionary. So this is a great place to go in the heart. And we achieve this through generosity and love and really embodying the principals of the heart as we do it. So the first thing I like to think of is what do you love about your dream? When you think about it, what makes your heart sing? <v ->I think about all the people who,</v> it's like when I read a book or I watch a movie and that point of inspiration or a thought or a spark kicks off and I just get all this energy. And to know that I can be that spark for somebody else or we can create that spark together for somebody else. <v ->Beautiful. Beautiful.</v> And this is sometimes along the same lines but how does your dream serve others? Because the heart chakra is the element, air. We say whatever serves more than yourself puts the wind in your sails. The universe wants to help you with that. So how does your dream serve others? <v ->Well, hopefully it doesn't just inspire</v> but it impacts and transforms other people that it touches. <v ->Yeah, beautiful.</v> So just focus on that and bring that into your heart. And see that happening. And then to achieve anything we need to cocreate with other people. Every dream that comes into being comes into being with many hands. It takes a village. It takes a community. And even if you are just writing a book and you're alone at your desk or you're in your studio painting a painting, you want someone to read the book, you want somebody to see the paintings. You may have a relationship with a studio owner that gives you a show, right. So you might be creating this but there's going to be many, many people involved in it. So take a moment to write down or list some of those relationships and they may not be people you actually know. It may be an abstract form like I'm going to need a web designer or I'm going to need a real estate agent or I'm going to need a director or a banker or a coach or even your audience. So name some of those relationships and maybe write some down. In fact, name as many as you can think of. <v ->Okay, first thing's,</v> okay, a graphic designer. I got a CEO, chief of operations. <v ->Yeah.</v> <v ->An accountant.</v> <v ->Yep.</v> <v ->Web developer.</v> <v ->Yeah.</v> <v ->Film crew.</v> <v ->What about your audience?</v> <v ->A tribe.</v> <v ->A tribe, yes.</v> <v ->Community.</v> <v ->Yeah.</v> All those people that it's going to effect, list those. <v ->Every name?</v> <v ->No, not every name but a big, wide audience.</v> <v ->Okay, the audience, who?</v> Well, the heart centered evolutionaries of today and tomorrow. <v ->Of today and tomorrow, beautiful.</v> And over time you're going to want to add to that list. You'll be going by and you go, oh, I'm going to need a this or a that and a collaborator maybe or a director or... <v ->Director and multiple collaborators.</v> <v ->Right, so you can just continue to add</v> to that list as you think of it. And as you do, imagine the perfect person, 'cause we don't want to take just any graphic designer. We want to take one that's going to understand your vision and create just the right graphics for it. And not just any director but one that can really get behind what you're doing. So we imagine that. <v ->Okay.</v> <v ->And then the last thing we do</v> in the realm of relationship is we write down the names of people, and this is actual people that you know, that can be on your dream team. <v ->I already have it.</v> <v ->That's great.</v> These are people that can support you, that can hold you accountable, that can inspire you. It might be a coach. It might be a friend. It might be a mentor that can be on your team. <v ->Okay, do I write those names and say them?</v> <v ->Yeah, just take a moment to write those names.</v> <v ->I have a business mentor,</v> somebody actually I coached and is now my business mentor. It's a professor in business. I have a co-founder. I have a collaborator. Should I say their names? <v ->Sure.</v> <v ->Okay.</v> <v ->Hey, you know,</v> you can even include your mom. <v ->My best supporter,</v> my best fan is my mother. So I've got Jackie here. I've got Hanna. I've got Prida. <v ->And that's probably enough, yeah.</v> And so you can invite your dream team, enroll them in what you're doing, invite them to give you support. Say, can I talk to you once a week and just tell you what I'm doing? Will you check in with me? Tell them exactly what you want. You could have a meeting with them one on one or you could bring them all together and have a little party. And this is a way to keep you accountable. <v ->It's a great idea.</v> <v ->Great.</v> So as she's getting out her notebook I want all of you to get some paper and a pen and write along with her. Write down the relationships you want to have in your dream. Well, for your dream you're going to write all the relationships that you can think of and that will come in time. You'll write a few and then one day you'll think of another one that you want to add. As far as your dream team, it's probably good to keep it to between 3 and 7 people. Too many cooks spoils the broth and it gets confusing. So people that you can actually get in touch with that will keep you on task. So the exercise for today is to write down these relationships, to write down members of your dream team and maybe even contact one and tell him or her about what it is to be on a dream team, what you want from them? And share some of that with the tribe. Continue to focus on your heart, your deepest heart's desire and what you're willing to offer in order to have your deepest heart's desire fulfilled. And when you share it with the tribe you might even meet a member of your dream team or enroll someone in the tribe to support you or mutually support each other. That's how it works, you can cocreate, you don't have to do it alone. And now, even though we've talked about moving from the love of power to the power of love, we're actually going to move down in the chakras. Tomorrow we will talk about how power produces and how to really engage your will with what you have to do to bring your dream into reality.

====================

LESSON 33 - Solar Plexus Chakra: Power Produces
--------------------
<v ->Welcome back,</v> take a breath and remember your heart, and we are now going to step into the third chakra, Power Produces. This is a big one in manifesting your dreams. Is this a stumbling block for you to follow through in your will? <v ->Sometimes.</v> <v ->Yeah, so this is going to help you plan what you</v> have to actually do, to identify obstacles and to strengthen your will to move through. So in every dream, there's things that you actually have to do. Some of them you want to do, some of them are fun, and no matter what career you pick or how much fun it is, there's probably some things you don't like to do, like I don't like catching early flights when I have to get up at three in the morning, but I love traveling and teaching, so there's some things you just have to do, right? There's just something you have to do on your dream that's kind of repugnant to you. <v ->The books.</v> <v ->The book, yeah, you want to say more about that?</v> <v ->Numbers, business, calculation, accounting,</v> taxes, all those things. <v ->All those things, yeah.</v> Does anybody else have resistance to those kind of, those kinds of tasks? So we are now descending down past the halfway mark, between matter and spirit. Things get more physical now, more specific, more practical. Setting intentions, visualizing, communicating, and loving, they're all wonderful, but they're not going to come to fruition unless you actually get up and do things. So here in the third chakra, to make it a little easier to accomplish what you need to do, you need to make a big plan. If we think about getting from here to there, and all the things you have to do, does it feel overwhelming? <v ->Sometimes, yeah.</v> <v ->Yeah, because we don't know where to start,</v> but if you take it one chunk at a time and you say, you can do this part first, and then this part, and then this part, then it becomes easier, so we make a plan and we prioritize. So think of the chunks, the goals, that are part of achieving your dream. Write them down and write down the things that you actually have to do to complete those. Now, some people will say, I have to lose weight. Well, that's nice, but it's not very specific, you want to say, I want to lose 20 pounds. Well, by when? By 10 years from now, or by a certain date, or by your friend's wedding? So we want to be very specific. We call them SMART goals. Specific, measurable, attainable, relevant or realistic, and time-based. So as you think about what you actually have to do to lose weight, well, I have to work out at a gym four times a week, that's a doing. Just to say I have to lose weight doesn't tell you what you have to do to do it. It leaves us knowing, well, how do I do that? So when we talk about doing, we often have distractions or excuses or obstacles that get in the way. That's a weak will. So I'm going to talk about some of the disorders of the will and what you can do about them, and then we're going to take Melissa into an exercise of destroying your obstacles. Okay, so one obstacle to the will I call should-ing on yourself. So we say, I should go pick up my mother-in-law. I should do this, I should do that, or I have to do this. We talked about that in third chakra, change it to I choose to. Another one I call, distractomania. With all the emails and the phone calls and the kids, there's so many distractions, choose what you're going to do, clarify your intention, and don't give any energy to the distractions. Another one is otherizing, telling yourself, well, others do it better, or faster, more capably. Others aren't you. You're the one that's going to do it. Then there's always the don't-have-itis. I don't have enough money, I don't have enough skills, I don't have enough time, friend, support, I don't have the right guy, the right woman, that's just another obstacle in your thinking. Decide what you're going to do and do it. And then, of course, finally, there's tomorrow-crastination. Oh, tomorrow's a better day, I'll feel more rested and more ready. I can do that next week, I can do that when the kids aren't around, and we all know that that tomorrow often never comes. So take what you're going to do, set a time to do it, and just do it. So Melissa, out of all the things you have to do to bring your dream to fruition, what are some of the most onerous tasks, the things you don't want to do, like you talked about accounting, right? So what would you actually have to do to keep track of your books for this business? <v ->I have to create a budget plan and sheet,</v> and list down all the numbers and projections and strategize those numbers. <v ->So you have to sit down and do that.</v> How long would that take? <v ->A while, and it's a continuous thing.</v> <v ->And a continuous thing.</v> So you'd have to spend maybe how many hours a week doing that? <v ->At least an hour.</v> <v ->Okay, so take a piece of paper</v> and write down your most onerous task, put it at the top of the page, put a line, and now tell me about four or five obstacles, or distractions that come up when you think about doing your accounting. <v ->I'll do it next week .</v> <v ->Okay, I'll do it next week.</v> <v ->I'd rather watch Netflix.</v> <v ->I'd rather watch Netflix.</v> <v ->Can this wait till later?</v> <v ->Can't this wait till later,</v> that's kind of like doing it next week. <v ->Okay, I don't like numbers.</v> <v ->You don't like numbers.</v> <v ->I just want to spend time with my friends.</v> <v ->Okay, great.</v> So Melissa, I'm going to take this list of obstacles and I am going to impersonate your obstacles. Your job is to get your energy bigger than mine, and when I feel that happen, I'll get out of your way. Then the next obstacle will come up until you meet your goal. <v ->Okay.</v> <v ->All right, we're going to stand up to do this.</v> <v ->Okay.</v> <v ->So Melissa, I have this list of obstacles.</v> So imagine that your goal of sitting at your desk and doing your accounting and paying your bills for one hour each week is up there on the wall. <v ->Okay.</v> <v ->And I'm going to impersonate your obstacles.</v> You have to get through me to get to your goal. You have to get bigger than me. You can move me aside. You can yell at me. Let's just see what happens, okay? <v ->Okay.</v> <v ->So state your goal.</v> I'm going to. <v ->I will.</v> <v ->I will.</v> <v ->I will work for one hour a week on my accounting.</v> <v ->Okay.</v> But you know what, you could do that tomorrow. <v ->Oh, I know.</v> No I'm going to do it today. <v ->You could do it tomorrow.</v> <v ->I'll do it today!</v> <v ->No!</v> <v ->I'll do it now!</v> <v ->All right, okay.</v> So the next one, yeah, but you know, there is that perfect movie on net, there's that movie on Netflix you've been wanting to watch, all your friends have been talking about it, you're the only one that hasn't seen it. Don't you want to watch that movie on Netflix? <v ->Yeah.</v> It's so confusing. <v ->Oh, okay.</v> <v ->You're so persuasive.</v> <v ->Okay, so here's what we call hitting kryptonite.</v> Kryptonite is what Superman was around that made him lose all his powers, so sometimes you hit an obstacle that drains the power out of you. So here's a little subroutine to do for that. Four levels. One is, shh. <v ->Shh.</v> <v ->One is, be quiet.</v> <v ->Be quiet.</v> <v ->One is, shut up.</v> <v ->Shut up!</v> <v ->Another one is bug off.</v> <v ->Bug off!</v> <v ->So I'm going to say it again.</v> The Netflix movie. <v ->Shh!</v> <v ->Oh, you want to watch at the Netflix movie, don't you?</v> <v ->Be quiet!</v> <v ->Oh, it's a really good movie,</v> I can't wait for you to see it. <v ->Shut up!</v> <v ->Really, it's on now.</v> <v ->Bug off!</v> <v ->There you go.</v> Okay, so now the next obstacle, but you don't like numbers. You hate dealing with numbers. It makes your head hurt. <v ->I can, I can deal with numbers.</v> <v ->Are you sure?</v> I don't know, it's really hard. You're going to have to sit there for a whole hour. <v ->That's what I have a calculator for.</v> <v ->Push me away.</v> <v ->That's what I have calculator for!</v> <v ->All right.</v> Ring-ring-ring. Melissa, I'm your friend, and I haven't seen you for so long. Won't you go out and have coffee with me, I got to tell you about my new boyfriend. <v ->I love you but this is really important right now.</v> <v ->Okay.</v> Now go touch your goal. Boom! So find a friend that you can do this exercise with. Make sure your task is an actual doing, that it's very specific. You're going to sit at your desk and write four times a week for two hours each, you're going to make five cold calls, you're going to do three job interviews, you're going to write your resume, and then write down the obstacles that come up for you. Just whatever it is, the distractions, the I don't-wannas, write those down. Get a friend to impersonate that with you. Get bigger than the obstacles. Have your friend coach you, and have fun with it. This is good preparation for coming down into the second chakra where pleasure pleases, and our goal is going to be to make this fun.

====================

LESSON 34 - Sacral Chakra: Pleasure Pleases
--------------------
<v Anodea>Wow, we're almost down to the bottom</v> of the manifesting current, we're here with Melissa. She's done every step so far. You really moved things with your will and you got rid of some of those obstacles, right? And do you feel like it's starting to happen now? So if you move your dream ahead every day, just do something, even if you only have five minutes, sit down and visualize it or make one phone call or make some notes. If you move your dream ahead every day, you start to build up some momentum. And as you build up momentum, it's like, remember the second chakra is water. And as you build up momentum, it's sort of like the tributaries coming down the mountain, entering the streams and the rivers and gaining power and gaining movement as it goes. And that's when your passion really gets lit up, oh my God, it's happening. And it might be only a tiny little return. You know, somebody read your business plan and they like it or someone offered you something, or someone gave you some feedback and we go, oh yeah, really is real. You starting to feel any of that? <v Melissa>Oh yeah.</v> <v Anodea>Oh yeah.</v> <v Melissa>I'm meeting the right people at the right time.</v> <v Anodea>So now's the time to really get in the river.</v> And with that momentum, not just float by and coast, not just float by and coast but really paddle and use that momentum to help you. So that's the waters and the passion of the second chakra. But another aspect of second chakra is your needs and your wants. For every dream that you're going to create, there's certain things you need, like you need a certain amount of money or you need time or you need people. And there's probably some things that you want, you know, and if it's talking about money, well you might need this much but you'd sure like to have that much. And so it's very important to identify the needs and to name them, remember, as we're going down, we're being very specific. We're naming our negative beliefs in our positive beliefs. We're naming what we're creating and we're learning how to say it succinctly. We're naming the people we want in the heart to help us in our relationship, in our dream team. We're naming our tasks and our obstacles. So here, it's about naming the needs you have and the wants and learning to separate them, which is the needs and which is the wants? Since chakra two is water, it tempers the fire 'cause the fire of will can burn out unless you're having fun. So here's the chakra where you really want to open up to the waters of pleasure and have fun. And that might be, find a way to play at what you're doing. It might be schedule in breaks where you have time for pleasure and engaging other people in a way that's fun. So this might be going to the movies, getting a massage, a vacation, sexual pleasure or just hanging out with friends. <v Melissa>Okay.</v> <v Anodea>Yeah, that brings a smile to your face.</v> So, schedule in fun. But underneath that, for every dream there are things you need and things you want. You may need a certain amount of money to buy some equipment. And you'd sure like to have a little more than that. There's nothing wrong with needs, there's nothing wrong with wants, we have both, the difference is that needs are necessities and sometimes our needs and wants are diametrically opposed. Like you might need more rest and you want to work more. And what you really need is rest. You say, "Well, I want to work more "'cause I want to get this done "and I want to make more money", but you need rest. I know mine has always been traveling and loving to teach and then needing time at home. And so if we don't take care of our needs, because they're necessities, we don't have what's necessary to manifest the dream. <v Melissa>Yep.</v> <v Anodea>So you need gas in your car for it to go</v> or you need to plug it in. So we want to sort out some of the needs. A lot of people can't identify their needs, right? So in your workbook, we have included from nonviolent communication, a needs inventory list. So many of us were taught as children not to be needy. I mean, in this culture, who likes a needy person? So we think of needs as bad, but you have to start regarding needs as necessities. And we have to learn how to ask for them. There's a connection between the throat chakra and the second. So how do you ask someone you're working with to give you just what you need? If you're getting a place painted how do you ask to have just the color you want? And maybe if it's not the right color you have to ask to change it. So in everything I've manifested, I've looked at some of those places where I didn't quite ask and I've regretted it every time I see it. And remember, the challenge of second chakra was guilt. So often we feel guilty about our needs. That means we don't ask for them to get met and they never get met. And we go through trying to create our dream with some missing pieces that are really important. So before you can ask for your needs, you need to identify them, right. Are you familiar with what all your needs are? Are they there hanging out or are some of them hidden? <v Melissa>Some are there right up front</v> and some that I have to take some time to remember and become more mindful of. <v Anodea>Okay, great, well have a needs inventory here.</v> This comes from non-violent communication and you'll find it in your workbook, to kind of circle and identify some of the things you need and also a chart of needs and wants. So Melissa, we want to identify the needs and just circle a few, maybe name them out loud. A couple that you recognize that you have, that are necessities for bringing your dream into fruition. And they might be personal necessities too. I mean, maybe you don't think sleep is necessary to fulfill your dream but it's necessary to sustain you, so you can fill your dream. <v Melissa>Play, growth, freedom.</v> Authenticity. <v Anodea>Great, those are some.</v> Okay, so here is a chart where we're going to separate our needs and wants and see if we can identify both. And again, it's not that your wants are bad but your needs have to get met first, they're more important. So you might take some time and this is in your workbook, to write down the things you need. And it could be some things that are not on that list you just looked at. You might come up with, I need X amount of dollars and be very specific. If you need $50,000 or whatever form of money is in your country, then write that down very specifically. And if you need a certain number of hours or a certain number of months or a certain size studio to film in, or certain equipment write all those things down and also write out what you love to have. Yeah, so this is going to take her a little while to write but I encourage you in the practice for today to take some time and look at the chart in your workbook and write down your needs and wants. And this might be something you ponder over a period of days. You'll add to it as you think of things. And so now we want to connect the throat chakra with that. And your assignment is to find a buddy in which you can practice. Now, this doesn't have to be related to your dream but asking for exactly what you want. Say, "Can I ask for exactly what I want "from you for 20 minutes?" And it might be you want your head massaged or your feet massaged, or you want them to listen to you talk, or you want them to read you poetry or bring you a cup of tea. But the practice is to say exactly and precisely what you want. So let me give you a demonstration of that. <v Melissa>Okay.</v> <v Anodea>Melissa, would you massage my hand please?</v> <v Melissa>Okay.</v> <v Anodea>Okay, that's very nice,</v> but I like a little deeper touch. Oh, that's better, yeah, yeah. And then maybe even grab my hand and pull it. Oh, that feels really great. Oh yeah, and pull each finger, one at a time. Oh yeah, that's just what I like, yep, yep, yep. Oh, good and then turn over and massage the palm a little. Great, that feels so nice. Okay, thank you. So see how I directed her to give exactly what I wanted. How did that feel? <v Melissa>Easy, super clear, easy.</v> <v Anodea>Isn't it nice?</v> You know, it's like when you're buying a birthday present for somebody and you know exactly what they want. It's so much fun to get it, but then there's that uncle that you think, "Oh, I don't know what to get him". And it's no fun to shop, right. So when someone asks you for exactly what they want, know that you're giving them a gift in being able to give to you, and this is a practice. You can do it when you're ordering food at a restaurant, you can do it with a friend. You can do it when you have something you want to communicate and say, "Here's how I want you to listen to me" and practice expressing your needs, asking for them in a mature way and practice getting exactly what you need and want. So the exercise for today is to complete the needs and wants exercise in your workbook or practice expressing your needs by asking someone to give you exactly what you want. Ask for your 100% and do it without guilt, share your experience with the Tribe. And tomorrow we will take the final step in the manifestation process, the last lesson in our Quest and we will bring it all down to earth and bring it home. Okay, see you there.

====================

LESSON 35 - Root Chakra: Matter Matters
--------------------
<v Anodea>Well, here we are finally taking</v> the last step back down to earth. You have made quite a quest, you've made quite a journey. You've gone all the way up and taken all the steps down. And here we are at the act of completion. Congratulate yourself, really feel good about this. You have really used your will to fulfill something. And I hope that you are finding the treasure. Today, we are going to the root chakra where the manifestation principle is that matter matters. Here we take it down into concrete reality. We are condensing things into form. We're getting very, very specific and we are completing all the steps. Completion is necessary to manifest something. You know, you wouldn't want to buy a shirt that they left off one of the sleeves or half the buttons. You know, it wouldn't be complete. It wouldn't want to move into a house that, you know, has some walls missing. So completion is necessary in order to have your dream. And in going from being to doing, to having, remember we were in being up in the upper chakras and we were stating, you know, I am powerful, I am peaceful and creating that. We made list in the third chakra of doing and how do we do our tasks and get rid of the obstacles to that. And if we've done all that, if we've taken the steps down from the top and not missed one, then we finally get to have our dream. You get to have something, you get to have it for the rest of your life. And that's a powerful concept, but nobody can create and nobody can give you what you can't have. So we're going to look at our ability to have something 'cause you don't want to do all this work and then not let yourself have it. So we're going to expand that ability today. And we're going to really look to put things right on our calendar. So let's get on with it in getting down. So as I say, coming down into matter, we have to come down into our own bodies. So you might even review the first chakra on the way up, where you learn the grounding exercises and you really get embodied with what you're doing 'cause the more you're in your body, the more you're going to bring your projects all the way down to earth. This is also about getting really specific of what you need. And some of that has to do with money. You know, every dream usually requires some amount of money. You need money to go back to school or take a vacation or build your business or build your house. And for some people, money is a big issue, for others, they have that handled. But one thing about money is you want to be very specific. I taught this once with someone that decided she wanted to go back to graduate school and she needed $60,000 for her graduate school program. And in the workshop, she affirmed that, she wrote it down exactly how much she wanted. Well, what do you know? Within two weeks after she went home from the workshop, two people volunteered to loan her money to go to school and it totaled exactly $60,000. So ground by nature is hard, it's difficult. You want the ground to be hard in order to support you. And you want things to be exact so they fit together and they're sturdy and they give you what you want. So be specific about everything. When do you want it, how many do you want? You're looking at, how many clients do you want? How much money do you want to make in a year? How many people do you want to affect? How many books do you want to sell? And keep that in your mind, in your visualization. Be exact and you know, some people think, well if I'm exact, aren't I limiting it. Well just imagine, if you want to get a drink of water, you going to hold a cup under the faucet. You're not going to get a drink of water if you just say, "Well the cup's going to limit "what I can have". I'm just going to put my hand there. If you're going to order food from a restaurant, you don't just go in and say, "Bring me some food", when the waiter comes. They're going to say, what do you want? And you're going to say, well, I want this and that. And they're going to say, how do you want it cooked? And I want fries with that. Or I don't, or I want the salad dressing on the side. Only when you tell them, can they bring you so you have to learn to be concrete. And one thing I've found about people that struggle with money is they're very vague about it. I say, well, how much do you need? "Well, I don't know, more than I have." Or how much do you owe or how much do you want to make each week? Or when do you want to have your debts paid off? Or how much is your debt? And they're very vague. So be exact, set a goal for yourself to pay your debts off by a certain time or to make a certain amount of money by a certain time or to have a certain amount in the bank by that time. And you'll find it's a powerful act for bringing things down to earth. So this is your ability to really have your dream and to really have everything you've learned here and to have the life that you want. So we're going to do a quick meditation, looking at having as an ability. Like something people have a great ability to have abundance or to have people love them or to have time and space to themselves. How are you at any of those things? <v Melissa>t's a work in progress.</v> <v Anodea>Okay, so we're going to look at your ability</v> to have, on each of the seven chakra levels. And we're going to start at the top and we're going to go down. And give you a quick little technique to expand that ability so you can have a little bit more. Are you ready for that Melissa? <v Melissa>Yeah, let's do it.</v> <v Anodea>Okay, so close your eyes</v> and imagine in front of you one of those old fashioned kind of gas gauges with a needle that goes from empty to full. Only, your needle is going to go from zero to 100. And we're going to look at 100 as if you were living in the full capacity of all that is possible to have in that department. And zero, of course, you can't have any, and you're going to just let the needle go when I clap my hands, to whatever number it goes to, okay. All right, we're going to start in a crown chakra. So, go to the crown chakra and think of your ability to have a strong, spiritual connection, to have guidance come in. And when I clap my hands, just see what number your needle goes to. What number Melissa? <v Melissa>74.</v> <v Anodea>74, that's pretty good.</v> Is that high enough for what you want? Or would you like it to be a little higher? <v Melissa>Let's go higher.</v> <v Anodea>Okay, so when we move the needle up,</v> we don't want to automatically move it to 100 'cause you already proved to yourself you can't quite have that. So we want to move it up just a little bit, until you feel that needle kind of get some resistance. So go back to your gauge and take it from 74 to maybe 85, something, between 85 and 90, see where it goes. Just nod when you get there. And now, with your havingness for spiritual connection at that level, run that through your body. What would that look like, feel like, be like in your day to day life? Take it in your imagination and soak yourselves in it. <v Melissa>One side feels different</v> from the other side of my body, which is interesting. <v Anodea>So you can have it</v> more on one side than the other. <v Melissa>Yeah.</v> <v Anodea>Maybe you want to make the other side</v> of your body match a little bit. <v Melissa>Tried to bring it down, maybe it's around 88.</v> <v Anodea>Okay, 88, so just notice what that's like,</v> put a little bookmark there. Just like we bookmark a website and let it go. Okay, we're going to look at your ability to have a strong and powerful intuition, to have your intuition really working for you. So when I clap my hands out of 100%, that would be you're really functioning, full steam on that to where you are now, where does it land? <v Melissa>90.</v> <v Anodea >90 okay, that's pretty high.</v> You happy with that? <v Melissa>Yes.</v> <v Anodea>Okay, so if you're not happy with that,</v> close your eyes again, see where your needle is, move it up a little till it gets a little resistance. And then imagine what that would feel like in your body, in your life, in the things that you do and the way that you think, as if it were so. And then let it go. Okay, are you ready to go down to the throat chakra? Okay, so now we're looking at our ability to have creativity, to have creativity in your life, in your work, in your thinking. At what level, from 100 being totally creative every minute to zero, not being allowed to have that at all. Where are you living? <v Melissa>58.</v> <v Anodea>58, that could be a little higher, couldn't it?</v> Yeah, so move it up. Where are you moving it up to? <v Melissa>I went from 60, now 70, now 80, 80.</v> <v Anodea>Okay, so take it at about 80.</v> And now imagine you're functioning at 80% of your creative capacity. You're functioning at 80% of your creative capacity. How does that feel in your body? How would that look in your life? How would that look in your dream? <v Melissa>I feel like dancing.</v> Ah, you feel like dancing, that's creative. <v Anodea>That's what it feels like in my body.</v> <v Melissa>Yeah, great, great.</v> Okay, so feel that in your cells and then let go of it. So now we go to the heart. This is your ability to have love in any form that it takes for you. It could be the form of walking into a party and knowing people that you meet are going to love you. It can mean having this to have one person, an intimate partner really, really love you. To be loved by your friends, to even love yourself. So once again, when I clap my hands, see where the needle goes all by itself. <v Melissa>34.</v> <v Anodea>Oh, I think that could use a little improvement.</v> <v Melissa>Yeah.</v> <v Melissa>All right, so there might be a belief</v> in there somewhere too, that you'd take into the belief closet. Okay, into the belief process. Okay, so go back to your gauge at 34 and move it up, maybe to 50, maybe a little higher. See where it sticks. <v Melissa>91.</v> <v Anodea>91, that's a real movement.</v> Okay, feel that in the cells of your body, see that in your life, what would that look like? What would that feel like, what would that be like? <v Melissa>Connected.</v> <v Anodea>Connected, so feel that sense of connection,</v> that sense of your heart being met and filled. And when you're ready, let it go. Okay, you ready to go to third chakra? Okay, chakra three is power. So what is your having this level or your ability to have power? That means you have confidence. It means you can take charge when you need to, you can be respected. You can put up your boundaries, whatever power means to you. If 100% is full throttle, where are you living? <v Melissa>70.</v> <v Anodea>70, that's pretty good.</v> You happy with that or do you want to move it up? I'm good with that. We could try, we could move it up a little bit. <v Melissa>Yeah, well some of the people listening</v> might want to move theirs up a little, so we can close our eyes again and see that gauge at 70 or whatever number you went to and move it up till it gets sticky. And then imagine what in your life would be different. Would you walk differently, would you talk differently? Would you interact with people differently? Would you dress differently? Okay, do you respond? <v Melissa>Yeah, so I got to say 88.</v> <v Anodea>88, this is you're havingness for power.</v> That's pretty good. <v Melissa>Yeah.</v> <v Anodea>So good, you got it up to 88</v> and notice what your numbers came up too. All right, now the fun one, we go to second chakra. This is your ability to have pleasure. How much time in your life do you carve out for pleasure? That could be sexuality or could be having coffee with friends or going to the movies or walking on the beach. It could be any number of things that bring you pleasure. But how much are you living fully in the pleasure of what's possible and making room for that in your life? When I clap my hands, see where the number goes. <v Melissa>24.</v> <v Anodea>24, you're not having enough fun Melissa.</v> <v Melissa>Work in progress.</v> <v Anodea>All right, sounds like work too much.</v> All right, let's raise that up a little bit. Go back to your gauge and raise it up until it gets sticky. <v Melissa>95.</v> <v Anodea>95, that goes all the way up there.</v> So look at that capacity. You're so able to expand that and download that and feel it in the cells of your body. What would that look like? Imagine it happening. <v Melissa>I'm like dancing on a mountain top.</v> <v Anodea>Dancing on a mountain top, great, great.</v> Okay, so see that fulfilled and let it go. And now we get to the last one. This is a big one for people, you're having this or your ability to have prosperity. If that's money it's, you know, whatever prosperity is for you. if 100% is you are living full throttle into your havingness for money, then that's where it goes. But let's see what happens when I clap my hands. What number do you get? <v Melissa>64.</v> <v Anodea>64, you happy with that?</v> <v Melissa>We can make it higher.</v> <v Anodea>You can make it a little higher and I'll bet</v> most of you could make yours a little higher. I have to say the first time I did this meditation, mine was a negative 10. Now I'm living in about 95, so we're pretty good. Okay, so let's see your gauge again at 64 and imagine raising it up till it gets sticky. And then imagine at that number, what your life would look like, what your bank account would look like, how you would glance at a menu deciding what to order or how you would shop, how comfortable you would feel. Would you sleep better at night? See that extra zero in your bank account. <v Melissa>You can go above 100, 'cause I'm getting 104.</v> <v Anodea>Well, why not?</v> So let that in, allow that to soak your cells, and then when you're ready, let go of it. And when that's complete, open your eyes. So how's your ability to have now? <v Melissa>I think it just exponentially grew,</v> it hit the roof and skyrocketed. <v Anodea>That's great, that's great.</v> So you have to have room to have your dream. You know, when I first did this, when I first did this and I noticed I had a negative 10 for money, I thought, but I have a big havingness for love. I had lots of friends and I always knew love was going to come. I never doubted it and so I thought, well, I know how to have one thing. Maybe I just apply that same feeling to a different department where I'm not so developed. And I did and now they're evened up. <v Melissa>That's a good idea.</v> <v Anodea>Yeah, so that's the having meditation.</v> Okay, so now we're going to bring this down into the ground by taking what we have to do to complete our dream and take a moment to pause the video and go get your calendars and something to write with. Okay, welcome back. So now you're going to take something that you will do within one month. Something you will accomplish, some step along the plan of your dream that you can and will accomplish within one month, put a date down that you're going to do it or that it's going to be completed and write it in your calendar. Maybe it's even a time, and maybe write a few things you're going to do in one month. You're going to do this by this date. You're going to do that by that date. And you might take some time with this in the next few days to really work out your calendar and your plan. But now we're going to go to the wow factor. WOW, stands for within one week. Write down something you're going to do tomorrow. And a couple other things you're going to do this week to move your dream forward. Write down when you're going to do it. Maybe even how, do it right now. And so now when you do those things, I know you're going to move your dream forward. You're going to take steps and being on the ground is walking on your path. It's putting your foot to the floor and taking step after another and one step after another. And pretty soon if you keep going, if you keep taking steps, you will get to your goal. So some of you are already good at planning and you probably have very full calendars. So if you want another exercise for the more advanced option, and this is a real challenge, it's called the completion exercise. Look at everything in your life that is incomplete. Could be a book you haven't finished, a letter you haven't written, a project you started in your home that you never finished or it could be a relationship that's incomplete. Write down everything that is incomplete in your life and take some time to do this, several days, maybe some weeks. And then decide for each thing, well, I'm never going to finish that book. It was a lousy book anyway, and fold the book up and put it on your shelf or take it down and donate it to the library or decide when and how you will complete it. And the idea here is that completion is a manifestation practice. Everything in your life that is incomplete is still stealing your energy. Every time you walk by that pile of laundry, it says, "Fold me". And every time you walk by that door, that isn't fixed, it bugs you and it takes a little bit of your energy. But when we complete something, we get the energy out of it. We get to have the finished product. So make it a practice to complete things in your life. You'll find a tremendous satisfaction and payoff with completing things. So just to complete that thought, be sure and check your workbook. There's an exercise in there around completion.

====================

LESSON 35 - Week 5 - Q&A Call with Anodea Judith

Let's get started. Hi, Rainbow Warriors. Good morning, good afternoon, or good evening. For the last time, whatever the case might be for you, congratulations. You made it all the way to the end of this quest. So big, big congratulations to all of you. I hope I'm seeing a few of you are partying in the webcams. That's amazing. I'm so thrilled to be with you. You played full out and you reached the destination. So I'm looking forward to this final session we're going to have. It's going to be a great session. As always, we'll have very interesting. topics that we'll be tackling, belonging mainly to the fifth week of your quest. So this call is going to focus mostly on these topics, and I believe you'll get great, great content from tonight's session and many wonderful insights. That being said, and without further ado, let's welcome for the last time on this quest, our wonderful, glorious teacher for this journey, Anadea Judith. Hi, Anadea. Thank you, Alex. Namaste, everyone. Congratulations. You have made it all the way through 35 days of questing. This is a really fast journey up and even faster journey down. And if you've made it this far. Congratulations. That's really amazing. I'm so sad that it's ending. I've gotten to know you all. I go on the Facebook every day and read all your posts. And even if not all of them get answered, because I think some disappear, I've been there reading them, cheering you on, going, woohoo, she did it, or he did it, or just reading those struggles. And you've become like family. So let's begin with a quick meditation, and then we'll take the questions. So let's close our eyes and feel this amazing community that we have of Rainbow Warriors, the Rainbow Warrior tribe on this quest. People who are learning this information, aligning their chakras from 63 countries around the world, taking this into their community wherever they live. And in honor of the manifesting current, let us all imagine that we are joining hands together to create a network of rainbow manifestors that want to bring into the world wisdom, crown chakra, and see us downloading wisdom from spirit, from courses, from books, from experiences, teaching it to friends and community. being wisdom keepers, and see that wisdom seeping into the community around you, and then see this tribe as visionaries, people who are creating beauty in their life, in their community, in their world. Visionaries that can see another way, that have a vision for how they're living their life, that we can see each other. and see this tribe as inspired communicators, that we can talk about what we're learning, we can talk about our dream, that we want to create and manifest, we can get ideas from people and inspire other people, that we are all warriors of the heart, creating a network of love, love -powered evolutionaries, moved by the power of love. Acting with compassion, understanding, generosity, peace. And in the third chakra, we are movers and shakers. We are making a difference. We're using our power to join with each other, to join with friends, to empower ourselves, to make a difference in the world. So needed right now. Feel that fire, those flames inside each of our third chakras connecting into a web of energy. And that we all have a second chakra. Pleasure pleases. We have fun. We create things that are enjoyable. Enjoy means to be filled with joy. And that we are bringing all this down to earth. We're bringing heaven down to earth. Through all our chakras, through our vision and our communication and our heart and our doing and our feeling and our manifestation, bringing it into concrete form to create something that's never been there before. Until we became manifestors, we are creating something new on the planet, joining with other co -creators. And this is our mission to evolve into. Bring that evolution down to earth. Namaste. Hello. Now we can take some questions. Our first question comes from, I think it's pronounced Pava Deep or Pava Deep. Is it okay that we align all seven chakras each day of the week for complete healing and make this a regular practice? What do you suggest? It's more than okay. It's what we should do. This is a way, you know, we've learned each chakra one at a time. But now that you have the whole map, each day, just sit down, put your roots down, your crown up, and align your chakras. It's a 30 -second practice that just helps you remember. Every time you sit down at your desk, you sit down to a meal, you get in a car, you sit on a bus, you can align your chakras. It's a daily practice. And then that takes you into your core. So it's more than okay. It's what we want to do. How to set proper intentions? What are some guidelines? My intention, for example, is to become, quote, financially independent within the next five years, end quote. Is this precise enough? What do you recommend? Well, for an intention, it's precise enough to start in that direction. That's your intention that you, you know, we could say we want to pay off our debts or whatever. What helps is to be more specific. So how much money do you need? Name a specific amount. That tends to crystallize it. And as I said in the very last video, rather than see that as a limitation, we need limitation to manifest. You know, we have the limited cup that can only hold so much water, but if we don't have a cup at all, we can't hold water. So we start with an intention. and then we get it more specific as we move down through the chakras. Clearing cross currents that go against my intentions by exaggerating them, like we've seen in the video, doesn't seem to work for me at all. What other methods can I try to clear them? Well, first I'd like to talk about some of the ways that it might not be working. Because we showed it so briefly and I didn't get a chance to practice with each one of you to make sure you got it, let me give you some tips. One is that after we exaggerate a cross current, we always go back to naming the primary intention. So I am focused. Oh, no, I'm not. I'm all over the place, blah, blah, blah. You exaggerate it, then you go back and you say, I am focused. So that's really important that you go back. Each time you go back to your primary intention, it's like hammering the stake in the ground a little bit more. So a little deeper, boom, boom. And so that's one important thing. The other thing that I find where people make a mistake is in exaggerating, they actually intensify. So in means coming in. X means getting rid of something. So to exaggerate is to get it from inside out. And that means get it big in your body. I don't want to do this. I hate this exercise. I don't want to do my taxes. I don't want to write the report. And really get it out. That helps. And then always go back to your intention. I am focused. I am peaceful, whatever it is. Do it again and again until that cross -current curve clears. And some people, they intensify. Some people, they don't go back to their main thing. The other thing is if the voice comes in from outside, like... do you think you are? A you voice. You know that's an internalized voice from the past. Step back behind where you are and point to where you were standing. Anaday, who do you think you are? And that's getting it from outside. Then step back into yourself and say, I am focused. Now, if all that still doesn't clear the cross currents, there's probably a belief in there that's stuck. Then you would use. The belief changing exercise where you imagine the belief is an outfit, you take it off. You imagine a new belief, you put on a new outfit. So that's in our sixth chakra call. Vision vitalizes. Okay. Okay. Since this is also our final call, you can also consider this like a graduation call. So if there are any wonderful success stories that you'd like to share with us, please let us know in the chat and I will be reading some of them as we progress. So for example, here's one from Sarah Sue that said, I'm Sarah Sue from Wales. So thank you so much for this amazing course. I started the course looking for work. And now I love my role as a receptionist. You manifested something, Sarah Sue. Yay. Great. Okay. So if there are anything, any stories like this, we would love to read some of them during this call. And now we'll continue with the questions for now. Next question comes from Lydia. In regards to the needs and wants in the sacred chakra, you stated that unmet needs may sabotage our plans because the wants will take over in unhealthy ways. Can you elaborate on this, please? I'm curious as to how these wants take over in this process. Well, it's not so much that the wants take over, the unmet needs take over. You know, it's like if you don't put gas in your car, unless you have an electric. Your car will eventually stop. I mean, that's a need. The car has a need for a certain amount of fuel. And if you're driving and you don't pay attention to that need, you're going to stop in the middle of nowhere and you're going to be stuck. So if you don't take care of your need for sleep, you're going to be very fuzzy on the job. If you don't take care of your need to eat well or whatever, your health is going to suffer. So the needs is what sabotage. Now, what we tend to do is we look more at our wants and less at our needs. And that's where we get into trouble. But it's not that the wants really sabotage. The unmet needs will sabotage in order to get what they want. I really love this idea of moving your reality towards your dream. But how to keep the energy and motivation consistent and work towards your dream if it is far into the future and your current reality has a lot of obstacles in it? Well, sure. The bigger our dream, the more obstacles we will have, the more we'll find. So what I've given you in this downward current is tools to handle the obstacles. That's basically what we're doing here. And it's been very brief, but... If you get stuck, you can say, well, what is the cross current that I need to exaggerate? And again, when you exaggerate a cross current, you always want a primary intention to come back. So remember that expression, oh, I forgot when I was up to my neck in alligators that I was going to drain the swamp. That's an American expression. But, you know, we forget what we're doing when we're up to our neck in problems that, oh. I was here to clarify my intention. I was here to be a shining light for people, whatever your intention was. So you can also go to beliefs. If you get stuck, what's the belief that's operating? Maybe there's an underlying belief, I'm not worthy, or it can't happen, or it's too hard. Then we can either exaggerate those or we can use a belief closet. Maybe the inner critic is interfering with your process. And then you need to do those seven voices and get rid of that inner critic. Maybe you don't have support. That's your heart chakra. Maybe you haven't made the plan and prioritize the plan. I have to do this before I do that before I do this. If you really get stuck and you can't go forward to your goal in a direct way, you can do that exercise that I did with Melissa on the video where you have a friend impersonate your obstacles and you have to get in her face and move the obstacles aside and then go touch your goal. These are all tools for handling the inevitable distractions and obstacles that come up. They will come up. It doesn't mean they won't come up. It's just how to handle them. Okay, I saw from Edina that said, thank you very much, Anadea, for this quest. It has been a life -changing journey. Thank you. Okay, next question on the list comes from Randall. How can I have or build the focus necessary to take consistent daily actions? I have good intentions to do so, but I often get distracted or simply life gets in the way. So this is a great example to use that. you know, intention and cross -current exercise. So say, I am focused. And then the distraction comes up and you go, oh no, I've got to do this. And I can't think. And the phone's ringing and the email's coming in. Exaggerate that. I am focused. Then the next cross -current comes up. Oh, but my dog wants me to take him for a walk. I am focused. Oh, but there's all this stuff coming in that I have to handle. I am focused. And of course, I'm doing that a little too quickly. You want to take more time for the exaggeration. But, you know, if that's what you want, pound that primary intention into the ground, exaggerate the cross currents. Same exercise. It works. How do I know when it makes sense to persevere and work through all of the cross currents that show up where I can continue to work? achieving the dream I want to manifest versus giving it up or giving it up because the dream is impossible to achieve. What I say is that if you are clearing your intention and you're moving toward your intention, the form might change a little bit as you go toward your intention. And if you're trying to accomplish one thing and the obstacles are too many, it's trying to turn you just a little bit over here. But you keep your primary intention. So your intention is to pay off your debt. Well, maybe you have a job change somewhere in there. You know, my intention was, the story I told last week was to buy this house I was renting. And I did everything I could. And at the last minute, he raised the price and I couldn't buy it. I bought a different one that was even better, that was cheaper, because I had everything all ready to go for the first one that I couldn't afford. So, you know, you get all your, you get the energy going and then you can make subtle changes. It's like, you know, you're driving and all of a sudden you come to a road closure because they're working on the highway. Well, what do you do? Do you stop and say, well, I'm not going to go to my meeting or I'm not going to go to my friend's house? You say, no, I find another way. and you find another way and you might say oh and finding that other way i never saw that really good restaurant there or you know i've discovered a park that i didn't know was there or something so you know sometimes an obstacle will steer you in a new direction but don't give up on your dream because of the obstacles allow them to change form Beautiful. Another comment here from Barbara that says, thank you, Anodea. This course helped me remind myself of my many spiritual abilities. It's been a great ride and I'm very grateful to the Rainbow Warriors for all of their gifts. Wonderful. Thank you. Okay. Question here from Rita. What can I do when I know I have the skills and resources to undertake a significant task and yet... cannot seem to make myself take action. What are your thoughts and suggestions? Well, I would suggest there's a belief in the way about taking action. Like you might make a mistake or something bad might happen if you don't do it right. Or self -worth or some kind of command you got from your parents. It sounds like if taking action is your problem, that would be third chakra. So I would look to the third chakra either in the going up to clear. out the limitations or in the going down to handle your obstacles. But that's third chakra, taking action. What can I do if I have a clear intention, but I don't know what are the clear steps that I should take to achieve it? Well, this manifesting current is outlining the steps. You know, you look at what you want and your life purpose and what your dream is, and then you talk about it. And as you talk about it to people, they'll refine it, and that'll help you get clearer on your intention, bring it into your heart, all the things that we've taught here. And if you get stuck, again, look at what step you got stuck on. You know, that's the best thing I can say about how do we clarify. is just keep going and you clarify as you go. Do you have any recommendations around how many intentions are proper to set at once? How many goals should we be working with? Or where in the chakra system will we know we are doing enough or too much? Yeah. Well, you know, whether we're doing enough or too much is whether it works. If it's working, then you're doing it right. That's the simple, you know, proof is in the pudding. But remember, intentions are like an arrow that you put in your back and then you notch them up and you shoot them toward your target. How many arrows can you shoot at once and hit your target? Only one. But shooting one arrow doesn't mean you can't shoot another one. you know, right afterwards. So we have this fear that how do I know what to choose? If I choose this, I won't get that. But that's not true. You choose this, you get that done, then you can choose the next thing, then you can choose the next thing. Now, it doesn't mean that you have to take every single thing all the way to its completion before you try any other arrows, because I can make an intention of what I want to cook for dinner. And that's not going to interfere with my intention to write a new book in the next six months. Right. So some things take longer and some things are shorter. Some intentions support each other. I have an intention to get this much money so I can go back to school and that will help me with my intention to get a better job. So some intentions are all related to each other. But as we do like the. primary intention declaration exercise where we exaggerate our cross currents, we want to do one intention at a time until we feel like we've made that strong, we've created that in ourselves. Then you can go do another one. Same thing, exaggerate one cross current at a time and then you can do another one. So one at a time, shoot one arrow at a time. Building on this answer, we have a question here from Beth that said, if we have multiple big dreams, like, for example, working around relationship, our health, our financial life, how do we choose the one to focus on? Is there a specific chronological order that we might pick? What do you recommend? There is no chronological order because it's different for everyone. Some people, their health is at the basis of everything and they can't have the other dreams unless they're healthy. and they have something they have to address there, or they're not going to get the job they want. They're not going to enjoy the relationship they want. Health is primary. Other people don't have a health issue, and maybe money is primary. Another might be they want their relationship better because it's in a crisis, or they don't have a relationship and they really want one. So it's different for everyone. And how do you know which one to choose? You just choose. Again, choosing one does not mean you can't have the others. It's just you focus on one thing at a time. How do you choose which piece of laundry to fold up and put away? Well, you just pick it up. But if you keep, you know, picking one up and throwing it back in the pile, you'll never get your laundry folded. So you pick one at a time, you put it away, then you get the next one and the next one. So it doesn't matter what you choose. Start somewhere and start working. Here's another great comment that came in from Fiona. The course is really helping me stay focused and positive whilst we are on a building project having to move after 20 years. The course makes me see the situation from the perspective of the chakras, keeps me feeling I can handle the fears and resistance to change. This move is all part of a bigger, more exciting future. So thank you so much, Anandia, for inspiring and for helping me. You know, having a move is a wonderful place to make changes. So set your intention for what you want it to be like in the new place, you know, in terms of friends and finances and work and community. And you've got a blank slate to start with, a blank canvas. So, you know, use your visualization. Could you speak to how we can work with increasing our ability to visualize and manifest our dreams or even visualize any dream? in general yeah so some people think visualizing is going to be very it's like watching a movie and it's going to be very clear it's not and our ability to visualize varies from person to person That exercise in the sixth chakra of capturing light where you look at a beautiful rose and you look at it till you can see it with your eyes closed. And if you close your eyes and you can't still imagine it, you look at it again, close your eyes, look at it again until you can carry it with your eyes closed. That's a great exercise for developing your intuition and for developing your ability to visualize. Here's a quick question from Diane. It says, are we always sitting? when we are aligning our chakras? No, no. We can do it when we're standing in line at the grocery store waiting to pay for our goods. We can do it when we're taking a walk. We can do it when we're lying down and going to sleep at night, that you're just kind of lengthening your spine, you're pulling up into your crown, you're coming into your core. I always like to start flat on my back, aligning my body like a shavasana when I go to sleep at night and just really lay there and kind of... it like a meditation. So no, it doesn't have to be sitting. We started with affirmations for each chakra. Now, as we are manifesting, there is only one intention. I'm interested in Anadeya's explanation of the difference of affirmations and setting intentions from an energy perspective. Well, that's an interesting question. So affirmations are something we tell ourselves. It's like a program. You're writing a program. I am okay. I am worthy. That's an affirmation. An intention is I will have X amount of money in the bank by the end of the year. I will have a supportive, wonderful relationship. I will have a finished book by the end of October. That's an intention. So it's a little different. Intention is something that's actually going to happen. An affirmation is a state of being. A belief that came up for me is that it's wrong to charge money for doing work based in love. Rationally, I know that this doesn't make sense as I need money for my own life and to pursue more of the work I want to do. Yet, it continues to feel icky when I think of how to price the product of my work. Any advice on how to resolve this conflict? Yes, I would identify the belief that you have about money and something that feels good to you. And there's a lot of, you know, beliefs about money and spirituality, you know. So meanwhile, people charge huge amounts of money for stuff that pollutes the earth and rips people off. And the people that are really trying to do good in the world don't get paid hardly anything. So we need to change that belief collectively. But, you know, try to name the belief like it's not okay to make money doing what you love or. you know, whatever that belief is, do the belief changing exercise and find a new belief that is more supportive of what you need. I mean, money is just a reality. We need that to support ourselves in order to do what we need to do. My goal is to find a good and loving partner. I don't have problems to do the practice of all of these exercises and meditation, but where can I find the right partner or how would I go about this? This is not only about me. I know the missing piece. I don't know the missing piece of my resistance. Any advice? Well, if you pick a primary intention and you state it, that exaggerating the cross -currents exercise is designed to bring up the obstacles and the resistances, even the ones that we don't know are there. So if you're not sure what the resistance is, start to name your intention. You know, I have a wonderful relationship or whatever your intention is. See the cross currents, keep exaggerating that one until it's gone. See what the next one is. You know, cross currents are what arise as soon as we start off in a new direction. You know, we say, oh, you know, I want to go here, but the path is blocked. Okay, so that's a cross current. How do I get through the path? So if we don't know what the resistance is, practice that. It'll bring it up. Why is it so difficult to manifest healing in the body within the root chakra? It is difficult. And someone else had asked, why is it so difficult to heal the body? I saw that question go by too. The body is the densest level of all the chakras. You can change your mind much more easily than you can change your body. You know, people who go through gender changes, you know, and they know that they can feel like they're a woman or a man in an opposite gender body, but then going through the surgery to change it is a big deal. You know, so we can say, oh, I might have changed the way I eat and lose some weight. Well, that weight doesn't come off just because we think about it. So it's our densest level. And that means it has the most resistance. the whole physical world is habits and our body is a series of habits those habits are deeply ingrained and very hard to change that's why we have to bring our practice from the mind all the way down into the body that's why i teach this current of manifestation to complement the liberating current so yeah it just is you know it's much more difficult to you know, change the structure of a house than to change the color of a wall. You know, it's just more dense. How do you clear the block when feeling you did all your necessary actions and the process is stuck due to somebody else's needing to take action on their part? You know, I think just every day visualize that going through. You know, I heard a story of a friend that was in India and it was time to go home and had lost his ticket or i forget exactly the details but again he kept visualizing being on the plane and it depended on this person at the you know the council to say yes we can do this for you and everything he had no control over that person he just kept visualizing visualizing visualizing and finally they said okay you can go so um we just keep at it now if someone is not cooperating then we have a conversation with them What's going on? You know, what's your problem here? How can I help you do what you need to do? How can I help you complete this part? How can I support you? So we take action to see what we can do. And if that person still doesn't, and it's, you know, crucial to completing our dream, we may have to find another way or a different person to do something, you know, a way around it. But don't get stuck by the obstacle. I have the most difficulty in maintaining a consistent regime with employing what I all know now. What routine do you suggest we follow daily in order to effectively use these wonderful tools you have shown us? Great question. How many twinkle to that? Like, yeah, I know what I should do, but I have trouble doing it every day. You know, we know how we should eat. We know we should exercise. We know we should do all these things. We have trouble following through. That's very universal. So, you know, pat yourself on the back. You're not alone in that. And, you know, again, the program for each person is going to be different depending what you need. I would say start with something simple. Pick two or three, maybe the daily movements, those exercises you can do in one or two minutes, or just taking your tailbone to the back when you sit down. Those daily movements, pick three of them and practice them for a week. Once these things get ingrained into your nervous system, maybe you don't need to do it anymore because you've got that one. Pick the ones. that were most valuable to you. You know by now, probably, which chakras are yours that are pretty open and functioning well, and which ones have the problems. So you can go back to the videos on the ones that have the problems and say, review those exercises. Maybe you pick one exercise for a whole week. I'm gonna do this third chakra exercise. I'm gonna do the breath of fire. I'm going to do the wood chopper. I'm going to do the get off my back. That's a fifth chakra exercise. Whatever it is, just pick one until you really feel some shift. Then you can pick another. There's no right or wrong way to do it. Some people are open in the top and they need to move down. Some people are open in the bottom and they need to move up. Some people are centered in the heart and they need to move up and down. So I can't give a one size fits all to each person. I can only give you the tools and say, try it out, trial and error. If something doesn't work for you, try a different tool. Here's a popular question in the chat from Myra. It says, for our next individual meditations, can we simply send our energy and good vibes to everyone else's intentions so in this way we help each other to manifest all our beautiful dreams? Oh, I love that. That's really great. Yes, we can. You know, when I teach the manifestation as a live workshop, I have everyone write down their intention on the first day of the workshop. And on the last day, I read their intentions back to them. because usually they got it it's like what can they get by the end of the week and then i read everybody's and then i go i got my intention and everybody says what was it and i say my intention was for all of you to get your intention and that is my intention for all of you to get this map and have it be a guide for the rest of your life be able to manifest your truest dreams one right after another and become co -creative rainbow tribe warriors I created a whole website for this tribe called Rainbow Warrior Tribe. They didn't want me to mention it until the end, but I do rainbowwarriortribe .com. Beautiful rainbow website where you can register in what color of the rainbow do you zoom in on as this tribe? Are you a visionary? Are you a wisdom keeper? Are you a storyteller? Are you a mover and shaker? Are you a healer and feeler? What kind of... Webb, do you want to come in on? And we're connecting everybody. So rainbowwarriortribe .com. Beautiful. Okay, let's go with another question. I suspect that the havingness factor is something that I need to work on more in depth. Can you suggest another resource that I can work with regarding this issue now that the class is wrapping up? Yeah, so there was certainly the one in the video today where you look at the gauge and how much can I have? Can I have 100%, 50%, whatever, and you move the gauge. That's in the last video, video 35. And do that more than once. When I started doing that meditation, my having this for money, for example, was at minus 10. Now I'm running at about 90, 95. But, you know, I had to really move it up slowly. It took many, many times to do it. You know, but I noticed by having this for love was great. So I, you know, could do that and I could apply it to the other realm and, you know, say, okay, that's how to have. But if it's really stuck and that doesn't work, then there's again, there's a belief in the way. There's a belief that I'm not worthy. It's not okay to have this. If I have this, somebody else won't have. Having is an ability. What I mean is to really let yourself have it, to enjoy it. It's like if you have a meal, do you take time to really taste it and really have it so you feel satisfied at the end? Or do you shove the food down and realize, oh, I just ate that and it wasn't even present. I didn't really have it. even though I ate it. So to really fully have your experience is a learned ability and just keep practicing. Slow down, fill the container. That's what it is to have something. Beautiful. And Shashwati also has a question. I always get vibrations during my meditations almost for one year now, mostly up the heart and throat level. Is this Kundalini rising by any chance? And if yes, how should I go about dealing with this since it's a bit disturbing and often breaks my concentration? Well, those vibrations are energy in the chakra. It's charge. You know, you could call it Kundalini. It may be, it may not be. It's hard to say, but it is the chakra, you know, handling that energy in your fourth and fifth chakra. I'm turning my head to look at your pictures just buddy. And again, we try to feel what's going on there. What is that? Make a question. What is this about? What are you here to teach me? Is it something that needs to be released? That energy is there to bring your attention to that spot so that you can facilitate the moving of energy all the way through. So, you know, do some of the bioenergetic exercises. Say, oh, maybe I need to do some breathing in the heart. Maybe I need to do some sounding in the throat to release so that that comes through. Or maybe you just want to contain it and feel it. Maybe it feels good. Say, oh, wow, I feel alive in those areas. I get to have that. Nothing wrong there. Yeah. Or maybe you want to let it rise to the upper chakras. Yeah, so nothing wrong there. Beautiful. Okay, let's go with this question here from Sarah Sue. Can you discuss the difference between actualizing, as in to show up, and manifesting, how it shows up, and how this may affect our practice? Between actualizing and manifesting. I think of them as very much the same thing. But actualizing might be less material. Manifesting is bringing it all the way down into the physical world. You're manifesting your finished product, your dream. It's actually happening in reality. Actualizing can be maybe actualizing our energy. You know, that we have our energy living full out, that it's open, it's happening. That might be actualizing, but it doesn't have anything to do with a physical product. That would be the only difference I would see. Both of them affect our practice. You might say actualizing more of the liberating current manifesting is more of the descending current. Since I have been giving meditation group sessions for years, I had a hard time in getting paid. People forgetting to bring the money or not wanting to pay when they don't attend, coming a month and not showing up for the next one. I really feel disrespected. Can you help me understand if this is a cross -current or a belief that's in the way? Yeah, it probably is a belief, you know, that if you really honor yourself and you're... and your need and your right to get paid for what you do and you honor that with no cross current in there people will feel that on an energetic level and they'll be more respectful so maybe you're shy about you know confronting them if they haven't paid saying hey you know you owe me for the last two sessions or something um but if you really own that and you're comfortable with it i think people will receive so you might look at what is your belief and if there's a cross current like they won't like me if I you know challenge them about saying you owe me money a lot of people have trouble asking for the money that they feel like they deserve you know naming the salary that they think they're worth or the hourly rate or a lot of people have trouble with that and so create a belief that supports that like People paying me allows me to give even more. I'm doing them a service. It's better for them. I find sometimes when I've given, you know, scholarships, I always try to give scholarships, but some of the people that take it, they don't really respect the container. They come late and they don't do the work because they haven't paid for it. So you're giving them a gift and you deserve to be gifted in return. This course came at a time when I needed it the most. In 2016, I learned about the law of attraction and somehow I misunderstood it in the sense of all matters is the thought in our head. But actions matter and finally matters matters. That was something this course mentioned clearly and made the manifestation process much clearer and also how to honor your inner voice and let your emotions speak. Wonderful. Thank you, Mudit. Yes, matter matters. We bring it all the way down. You know, most people only think that the chakras go up, but when we have the upward and downward current together as they pass, that's what actually creates the spinning of the chakras. The upper and downward are always mixing together at each chakra level. And I see another comment here from Josephina, which we also have. The camera is open there. Hi. Yes, I would like to share gratitude and transformation with you all. A few years ago, I went through something which blackened out my sixth chakra, the third eye, to beyond efficient, and I could not visualize or see any colors, anything. Every time I closed my eyes, it was so very black, totally black, all caps. Until this quest, I have begun to see colors and think again and even remember dreams in the morning again. top exercises. Thank you very much. Wow. I'm so glad that you've got some of the color coming back. Yeah. Do that capturing light, you know, bring the light in, bring the visualization in. That's a great practice for sixth chakra, illumination. Beautiful. I see an upvoted question here from Rugar. I feel a lot of energy blocked in my knees. and i was wondering to what chakra it could be connected i think of knees as a combination of first and second chakra first chakra because they're part of the legs and they're part of the roots connection to the ground and second chakra is because the knees are how we bend how we move we can't walk if we don't bend our knees so i think of them first and second chakra but it's about bending and yielding. And it's also about support. You might look at what kind of support do you have in your life? Richard says, I asked the question earlier about the fact that I shut down my emotions at six months old. I am interested to know how I can reconnect with my emotions again. Yeah. So, you know, when somebody says, well, connect with what you feel, if that's blocked. You know, they could be talking a different language. You know, it's like, oh yeah, great. I connect with how I feel. But when I go down there, it's all numb and I don't feel anything. So what I'd say is sensations are the key that begins to unlock the door of emotions. So even the sensation of being numb is a sensation. Even the sensation of emptiness is a sensation. So you might say, oh, I feel cold in that part of my body, or I feel warm, or I feel stiff, or I feel achy. And just begin to breathe into those sensations. Also, I would say, tell that little six -month -old, you know, let your adult self tell that little boy that it's okay to feel. and that you will be there for him because he probably shut down for a very good reason, that no one was supporting him in his emotions or he was told not to feel. And so that programming is in there. You want to change the programming. You might even do a belief around it's okay to feel emotions or I am reconnecting with my emotions and do a belief closet exercise around that like we did in the sixth chakra. So use some of the tools, but be patient and really tell that little boy it's okay to feel. And it's going to happen a little bit at a time. It's like thawing ice, you know, one drop at a time as the ice turns to water again. Good luck. Yeah. Next question from Purmina. There are no body exercises for the third eye chakra. So what to do with the vibrations in our third eye? You know, when we have these things, we don't have to do anything with them except sit with it and allow ourselves to feel it. The third eye is not so much in the body, although we did do some yoga for the third eye, yoga for sixth chakra. That was like really visualizing our standing point and some of the things we did in that video. But we think that if we have energy, we're supposed to do something with it. Actually, that's the gift. The energy is the gift. If you feel some kind of vibration in your third eye, just put your attention there and enjoy that. See where it wants to go. That energy has a healing agenda and it is trying to move through. So our job is to allow it or to listen to it and say, what do you want? What do you need from me? Ask it questions. But it doesn't mean we have to do anything except be with it. Wonderful. Here's another upvoted question. What techniques do you suggest we use or source out to further discover what inner beliefs we might have that we are unconditionally aware of that could be creating blocks? Well, I highly recommend, I mentioned Lyon Goodman and the Transform Your Beliefs process. clearyourbeliefs .com, transformyourbeliefs. He's a master at working with people's hidden beliefs. So I got those techniques from him. We used to teach together. And I highly recommend his work to do deeper. levels. One way to get at it is whatever is continually happening in your life, whether it's an illness or a money situation or relationship situation, you might step back and say, what would someone have to believe in order to keep creating that? So anything that persists has a belief in there and try those out for size and say, well, maybe somebody believes they're not worthy if they're not manifesting money or they're not good enough. or they deserve to be punished, or they feel guilty, or, you know, just try out and see which one. And when you hit one that is relevant to you, you're going to feel a little bit of charge in your body, especially if you're telling someone else about it. So I could say one belief, that's not my thing, doesn't have anything to do with me. I don't really feel anything when I say it, but another one, oh yeah, that's the one I've got. So we'll feel a charge when we hit the ones that need to be worked. but ask what do you have to what would someone believe about situation in order to create that beautiful as we are approaching the end of our call here i have two more questions uh the first one you also hinted about it a little bit earlier but what are the immediate next steps that we can take after we finish this quest which is today to make sure that we continue improving and make these teachings into a consistent practice Yeah, so in terms of the manifesting current, the immediate steps is to put some actions on a calendar. On Wednesday, I am going to do this at 10 o 'clock. On Saturday, I'm going to do that. I'm going to call three people. Put it on the calendar. Keep the appointment with yourself. That's one thing. But now that you have done the whole quest, you know, you might sit with your journal and make some reflections about, you know, what part was most meaningful for you? What part was the most difficult? And what is most difficult is where your work lies. So what do you want to revisit? If you say, yeah, I really, I hated the third chakra part. I didn't want to do any of those exercises. And yeah, I have a problem with my will and my life. Well, then you know, that's where your work is. That's what you go back to. Then you might just pick a couple exercises. Pick some practice that you can do every day, even if it's sitting down, aligning your chakras, pulling your roots down, your crown up, and taking seven breaths, breathing into each chakra. That's a great little practice, just to do a quick tune -up. And in doing that, you might feel like, oh, today... oh my heart chakra is a little blocked or today i feel kind of fuzzy in my third eye then you know oh i'm going to do a little extra focus visualize that chakra opening like a flower you can visualize the color you can breathe into it more or you can pick any of the exercises that we learn to address that. But always start with just a general assessment. Where am I today? What's blocked? I like to do the meditation of opening my crown and letting grace pour down and in. And I try to let it down all the way through. That's my daily meditation and it's wonderful for manifesting too. That is beautiful. And one final question for those of us who really want to go even deeper with these teachings. What do you suggest we study or read or do? Well, wonderful, because this quest, you know, with only a 15 minute video each day is a very fast, you know, it means 45 minutes on a chakra. I have live workshops where we spend a whole day on each chakra. We do like an hour and a half of yoga. We do... deep guided meditations. We do psychological processing. We do ceremony together. So I'd love to see you at a live workshop. The manifestation workshop is four days. So you get about three hours per chakra to really do the exercises. A lot of them are very physical and involve other people. And because they involve other people, you can't really do it by yourself. So, you know, look up anadeajudith .com is my main website that has all my upcoming workshops. I have a chakra therapy workshop happening at the end of this month in Santa Cruz, California. And I also have a number of books. So if you want to yoga, there's the chakra yoga book. You want to learn more about charge, there's charge in the energy body. You want the psychology and the excess and deficiency that's in Eastern body, Western mind. So the manifestation is creating on purpose. I mean, I have all of these here, you know, creating on purpose. The chakra yoga, somebody posted this on the Facebook. So the books go deeper. And there's a chakra balancing kit that has, you know, exercises and guided meditations. And all that's on my website, anadayajudith .com. That'll take you to a page that has all the books. It'll list all the workshops. And please sign up for my mailing list because I'm always making new videos. I often have some live free stuff. I'm going to be putting together a video of all the yoga. I know people wanted that. Somebody just said, please come to Europe. I do just about every year. If you want me to come teach someplace, you can email me through the website or Anadea Judith. Actually, Anadea at sacredcenters .com would be the best website email for me. Anadea, A -N -O -D -E -A at sacredcenters .com. And sign on to the Rainbow Warrior Tribe website now. I created that for all the people that are doing this quest because we have a new batch that started May 6th and they're going through it and we can continue to stay in touch with each other. Feel free to email me with questions that didn't get answered and I will be active on the Facebook for a while longer. That was great. Actually, we have one more question here. I think it's a very fun question and it's uprooted. Let's quickly go through it. How can we introduce the chakra subject to people who could be skeptical about it? Yeah, that's a great question. Well, I think we can talk about all of this and we can even without ever using the word chakra. You can say, well, you know, I'm working on my power issues or I'm working on my communication issues. Or if some friends talking about something, you say, well, is that a communication issue you're having with your, you know, is that a heart, you know, not heart chakra, but is that a heart centered issue? So you can talk about the meaning and you don't have to use this fancy word chakra. And that's a good way to just say, you know, and. You can also just, you know, say, yeah, and here's a word I learned for that. You can take it or not. Beautiful. That's all the time we have for today. Hope you guys had a lot of fun. You got a lot of value from this session. I want to celebrate you, Anadea, for all of your great insights and all of your knowledge and expertise and the clear cut exercises and explanations that you brought both in the videos and also in this call. So thank you very much. Thank you, Alex. And thank you, everyone, for hanging in there. I felt really sad this morning when, oh, the quest is ending. All these people have become friends. And I hope to see you at something live sometime so I can get to know you better. Feel free to email me. Thanks for the happy Mother's Day. Thanks for all your lovely comments. And I just want to send love to everyone in the Rainbow Journey. And there's a way we can all recognize each other. One hand over the heart. So here, meaning that we come from the heart, the middle of the chakras, and the other hand right here that we see eye to eye. So namaste from the heart -centered revolutionaries to the visionaries. I love you all. Namaste. May the force be with you. Namaste. We love you as well, Anodea. Thank you very much. That's all from me. All there's left to say is stay committed, Rainbow Warrior. Stay committed on this journey of growth and development. So thank you very much for all of your questions, for your comments, for your engagement, for your participation, for showing up. and playing full out to each one of these weeks and calls. And until maybe I see you on another live call or on some of our other courses, I wish you an extraordinary life filled with lots of love and lots of laughter. And as always, lots and lots of learnings. Be extraordinary, my friends. Take care. Bye -bye.

LESSON 36 - Continuing Your Growth & Healing
--------------------
<v ->Congratulations on completing your Quest.</v> You have muscled your way up the chakras and the ladder of liberation, and you've come down step-by-step using the map to manifestation. You have found a formula for your wholeness, for your transformation. Hopefully you've gained some insights and aha moments and some jewels along the way. And you know that you have a full set of tools and practices to continue your development. Doing an exercise just once doesn't quite cut it. You got to do it again and again. Keep using the belief process to change your beliefs. Exorcize that, get those negative voices out of you. Open your heart, think about your relationships, use your power and create a plan and take it step-by-step. Remember to have fun along the way, and be exact and bring it down to earth. And don't forget all those tools we learned on the way up. You're a rainbow warrior now. You're fully equipped to go out in the world and meet whatever comes your way. And you've got other members of the Tribe you can touch in with if you run into problems or say, "Hey, remind me of that exercise", or "Run me through a belief process". All of these tools are yours to keep. The Quest is yours to keep, all the downloads, you can review the videos, you can review the workshop. You can do this as many times as you want. You can join with another Tribe and do it all over again. And by the way, just for finishing the Quest, there is a bonus track, a meditation called Harvesting your Day that you can do before you go to sleep at night and look at how each chakra went during your day. What did you think of spiritually? What did you see of beauty? Where did you speak truth? Where did you love? Where did you feel in your power? What was pleasurable? And I guarantee by the time you get to that point, before you ask what you did with your body, you're going to to fall asleep. So enjoy that, and I hope to meet you on the rainbow bridge. And this is how we become Rainbow Warriors. This is how we create the bridge between heaven and Earth, and the way to bring heaven down to Earth. This is how we create a miracle together. And I am so grateful for the time you have spent to join me in this Quest, and I hope to meet you live somewhere along the Rainbow Bridge. Namaste. So one last thing, just for completion. Celebrate. Go out to dinner, open a glass of champagne. Celebrate that you completed this Quest. Film a video of yourself, check in with the Tribe, share your breakthroughs. So remember that self-assessment you did at the beginning? Now, fill it in, a post self-assessment, that's in your companion workbook and see how much you've grown. See what has shifted. So know that you can interact with your Tribe for as long as you want. As long as you want to stay active in the group, it's forever. You may make lifelong friends through your Tribe. Know that you learn the best when you communicate and share with others. So there will be other groups coming through this Quest. If you stay in the tribe, support them, tell them what they have coming, tell them what you learned, inspire them along the way. Remember the places where you got stuck, and help the Tribe evolve. So now I'm taking a deep breath. I feel like I've come to the end of this Quest, and I just want you to know it's been my life's dream to present this material, to carry people back and forth across the Rainbow Bridge, to weave that connection between heaven and Earth. I feel like this Quest has contained everything that I've been writing about and teaching about for my whole life. Like Melissa, I feel like I was born for this. And this has given me the opportunity to share with all of you the deepest love and vision of my being. I thank you so much, and I hope to join you in the future that we're going to create together. Namaste.

====================

LESSON 36 - Bio-Energetic Movements

- Yesterday we talked about fear being one of the challenges of this chakra. And these exercises these bio-energetic movements and the yoga they're ways to condition the body to run energy through the places that might have become constricted. And as you do, you'll feel safer and more secure. So let's go into some bio-energetic movements for charging and discharging the legs. First one is a standing bio-energetic grounding. So stand upright, your feet hip width apart or even shoulder width the apart I find most people bring their feet too close together. Turn your heels out a little wider than your toes and soften your knees. So you're bending your knee out over your second toe. Ideally you would see your big toenail right on the inside of your knee cap. That is if there's no clothing or anything in the way. And now press down and out with your feet as if you're trying to push apart to floorboards, or you're trying to stretch a sticky mat that you're standing on. And notice how your ground really hooks on. How it really grabs hold, how your base becomes more stable. If someone were going to push you around from this place they'd have a harder time doing it. So that's the grounding stance now to charge it up inhale and bend your knees a little bit more keeping your shoulders over your hips. And as you exhale, push down through the core of each leg push down and out with your feet, and very slowly begin to straighten your knees but don't straighten them all the way maybe 90% of the way. Then inhale and bend again, inhale deeply press those knees down and exhale, press down and out through your legs as if you're pushing the floor away and the result of that is your legs begin to straighten but it's a slow movement. Come to about 90% of the straight don't lock your knees, then inhale again. And go back and forth, inhaling and bending, exhaling pushing through the core of each leg. Now if you're doing this correctly you're going to start to feel a little bit of trembling in your legs, and that's a sign of charge or energy coming up your legs. That's what you want. That's delivering some energy through the roots of your legs, up into your first chakra. Now if that brings up too much charge for you you might want to do a little discharging, that also happens to the legs and feet. So simply run in place and stamp your feet into the ground and let that release, do it until you feel tired and then stand still and feel. You're going to feel calmer in your legs. Maybe a little more expansive. That's what it feels like to discharge. So now that you've gotten a little energy coming in and going out and you've felt what that's like, we're going to take this into a yoga flow. We'll do a little more charging and discharging but we're mostly going to flow into our root chakra. So get ready. Be in clothes you can stretch in get on your mat and follow along with us. The bio-energetic movements for charging and discharging the second chakra will be part of the yoga flow that will be coming up next but know that opening and closing your knees. What we call the butterfly exercise, will be the charging. And the pelvic pulses that is rocking your pelvis back and forth will be the discharging. Both of these are listed in your workbook. So when you have the right amount of energy when you can really be in the center of your charge, then you're in charge. And when you're in charge, you're in charge of your life and you can move into power and will with more effectiveness. So if you want more energy, you got to stoke your fire. That's the name of this exercise. So how do you stoke your fire? You bring more fuel in so inhale and reach out and then make a fist and bring it back to your third chakra. Inhale again, reach out, bring it back tap your third chakra as you do. Bring it out from in front of you. Bring it down from above, bring it up from below, bring it in from the outside and tap it and pack it into your third chakra. And you'll start to feel more energy. They say that one who cuts their own wood gets warm twice. This is called the woodchopper and it's good for releasing energy, especially through the third chakra. So stand with your legs nice and wide interlace your fingers and bring them up over your head. Pretend you're having an ax in your hand. Take a deep breath, fill up your third chakra, like a cat getting ready to pounce when it's really full go, ah. And take it all the way down in one big continuous movement. Rise up again and do it some more and just make a big sound as you take your ax down between your legs and follow-through and that's discharging. You can also say no or stop, or even yes if you want to, whatever is true for you. You can add that to the exercise. So now that you've charged and discharged your third chakra we're ready to go into our yoga flow so you can practice some really powerful poses. So get out your mat, get your blocks if you need them. And that's what's coming next. Now in the heart chakra as with any other charging is basically receiving something from outside and bringing it to your interior. So pulling your arms in, taking in love and nurturing from others, even that can be taking in a movie, taking in a book, taking in a walk in the park, you're nourishing yourself, you're receiving. And then discharging is the releasing. It might be crying. It might be speaking what's in your heart. It might be giving to others. It might be releasing that grief that we say is one of the challenges of this chakra. So as we release, we are discharging. And again, when we discharge, we make more room for more love to come in. A quick way you can do some charging for your heart chakras is what I call the Winged breath. Bring your hands up to your shoulders, and lift your chest, take your shoulders back and keep your elbows at about shoulder height. I see a lot of people do this and they start to droop but we want to keep it high. Keep the shoulders back. And then you're going to inhale to one side, exhale to the other. And twist around inhale through the nose, exhale through the mouth. And this lets you let go in the upper back at the same time that you are bringing breath in and charging your chest. And of course once you've done one side so now I'm inhaling to the left, exhaling to the right. When you're done just pause close your eyes and feel the effects. You may feel a little tingling. You may feel the presence of charge or energy and it's sort of like someone opened a window in your heart chakra. So the breath of joy is in some ways both charging and discharging but it allows you to release from your heart. So it's three inhalations and one exhalation. And you stand for this. And as the first inhalation is bringing your hands forward bending your knees, swinging them up. The next inhalation is bringing your hands to the side. And the third inhalation is bringing your hands all the way up and then one big exhale as you bow forward. And so now that we have charged and discharged our heart chakra a little bit we're going to take this into a yoga flow. So get out your mat and find your strap. If you don't have a strap, you can use a belt, or a neck tie, or even a rolled up towel, and we'll do some heart chakra opening. If you want to just feel a little bit of extra charge in your throat chakra most people don't really need to charge it. They need to discharge it but you can just do some shoulder shrugs. This is a good charging exercise for the fifth chakra. Inhale and bring your shoulders up toward your ears, exhale and drop them. And do it rapidly. And then relax and feel the charge in your shoulders and in your throat and neck. As you do just feel that tingling in the back of your throat and your neck makes you much more aware of that part of your body. Now most of us really need to discharge. A lot of people have their inner critic right on the back of their throat chakra, hollering it's insults into you. So we need to get that pressure off. This is called, get off my back and it really loosens up the shoulders. Make a fist with your hands, bend your elbows. And first one elbow at a time, just say get off my back, get off my back, get off my back. And after doing one elbow at a time, do both at once get off my back, get off my back, and then stop and stand and feel the area in the back of your shoulders, the back of your neck and let everything in your shoulders and arms relax. Here's a breathing exercise that I like to do for the sixth chakra. Imagine you have curtains over your windows of perception and you want to inhale and spread those curtains wide. I think of it often, I travel a lot and I stay in hotel rooms and hotel rooms usually have these very heavy blackout drapes. And I'll wake up in the morning. Maybe I'll get in late at night and not really see where I am. And I wake up in the morning. I go to the window and I open them up and I look out wide where am I? And then I think, oh, I want to go back to sleep. And I shut them and I closed my eyes. So this breathing exercise is sort of like that. We inhale we bring our hands close to our eyes. So bring your hands up in front of your eyes and imagine you're opening those curtains on your third eye as you inhale and open your eyes wide, exhale close your eyes, bring your hands over your eyes. Inhale open wide spread your arms wide, exhale hands over the eyes as you close your eyelids. Inhale widen open, exhale close, inhale open and widen, exhale close, rapidly. Inhale through the nose, exhale through the mouth. So how do we discharge the sixth chakra? Well, one technique that I learned long ago when I was studying at Berkeley Psychic Institute this was probably 45 years ago was a technique called blowing pictures. So we have all kinds of pictures in our heads. Things that we remember, pictures of how something should be, pictures of how we think it is. And a lot of those pictures are part of the challenge of illusion. They aren't real. So if you are going to a job interview, for example. And you have this picture, you just can't get rid of that oh, there's so many people applying for the job and my resume's not good enough. And why would they hire me? All those negative pictures need to be blown out of the way out of your consciousness. So all you do is close your eyes, allow the picture to come into your mind as an image, and then imagine creating a rose or some kind of container that you put the picture in. So you just take that negative picture of being rejected on your job interview, and you put it in the rows or you put it in a box anything your imagination wants to use. And then you imagine you've got this third eye laser beam that can disintegrate and just blow up the rose or blow up the block until it isn't there anymore. And we do that until we can get some of these pictures out of our head. Then we make room to see clearly. So we'll take this into doing a yoga flow and working with gazing at various places called drishti and yoga. As we develop our stillness and our center line.

====================

LESSON 36 - Chakra Yoga Flows

- [Instructor] Welcome to your First Chakra Yoga Flow. Before you step on your mat, take a deep breath and let go of all your worries and frustrations, let them drain down into the floor. Step onto your mat with intention, knowing you're stepping into a sacred place, this is the floor of your temple. Place your feet carefully hip-width apart making the outside of your feet parallel to each other. Ground down into your heels, lift up into your crown and extend yourself from Earth to Heaven. Inhale your hands up overhead, and reach higher to the heaven while bending your knees, taking your tailbone behind you and slowly bringing your arms forward, reaching from your tailbone out to your fingertips. Pull your shoulders back, lift the chest, and press down and out with your feet. Inhale and come back up, inhaling your hands up overhead, straightening your legs, reaching once more, And on the exhale, take your arms down around your side, place them on your hips and bend forward all the way keeping your knees bent. And wrapping your arms around your thighs, bringing your belly as close to your thighs as possible, give your legs a hug. On the inhale, press your knees back until you find your edge, then release your hands, take them to the floor. Straighten your legs and inhale halfway up, extending from the tailbone to the crown. Deep breath in and then lower back down, hands on either side of your feet. Once again, honoring your legs that carry you on the journey. And the next breath in, take your right foot back into a High Lunge, straightening the right leg, hugging the muscles to the bone and pressing your left foot into the mat and drawing it toward your right foot. Feel the stability that comes from anchoring into the ground. Take a breath here and slowly lower your right knee down to the floor, flatten your right foot. And gently bend your left leg, sliding your hands back using blocks if necessary. As you straighten your left leg and flex the left foot make some circles with your left ankle clockwise and counterclockwise to exercise the foot and the ankle. And then with toes pointing toward the ceiling and the foot flexed gently press your left heel into the mat, drawing the left leg up into the hip socket as you press your tailbone out behind you, inhale and lengthen through the crown. And on the exhale, keep that length as you slowly bow over your left leg, go to wherever you find your edge. If you need to use blocks, that's fine. If you only touch your knee, that's fine. Press your tailbone out behind you. And then on the next breath in, lift your head, bend your left knee back out over the left foot, tuck your toes behind you, hands on either side of your front foot. Then take your left foot back next to your right for a Downward Dog. On the next breath in, lower your hips, move your shoulders over your hands, bend your knees, take your knees, chest, and chin down to the mat. Wiggle that tailbone a little bit just so you feel it and then lower your hips. And just with the muscles of your back do just a Baby Cobra, lifting your crown, hugging your legs towards each other. And on the exhalation, lower back down, tuck your toes in behind you, press your hands into the floor, press your hips back up once again for a Downward Dog. Stretching into your Dog, wiggling each knee, pressing into the four corners of your mat, anchoring into the ground. On the next breath in, take your right foot up between your hands bending your right knee. And slowly lower down onto your left knee, flattening the left foot. Place your hands on your block or slide them along the floor as you slowly straighten your right leg. Flex your right foot, make some circles with your ankle clockwise and counterclockwise, pointing and flexing the toes. And then with your toes pointed straight up and your foot flexed, press gently into your right heel, hugging the right leg into the hip socket. And lengthen through your tailbone and your crown, inhale. And as you exhale, keep that length as you bring the center of your torso down over your right leg to wherever you find your edge. Just pause at that edge and allow your breath to so gently move you maybe a quarter of an inch with each exhale, without strain pulling the roots down out of the base of the spine. And then on the next breath, inhale your head up and your right knee forward, press the left toes underneath and bring your left foot forward next to your right. And once again, in a Forward Fold let gravity pull your spine down, let your head be heavy, your neck loose, let your legs support you, and feel this hinge at your hips. Softly bend your knees as you rise up, lifting your arms up into a Chair Pose in front of you, pulling the shoulders back, lifting the chest, pressing down into both feet down into the ground and then press through the core of each leg as you slowly come to a stand. Lift your hands up overhead bring your palms together and slide them down the core of your body to your heart. Anchor down into your feet and feel your ground. So now, we want to become anchored like a tree, this is good for developing the strength in your legs and your balance. So, bring your weight onto your right leg, maybe just gently touching your left toes to give you balance. And anchor down through that right leg, all the way from the crown of your head to the heel of your foot. And staying in balance, slowly lift your left foot and place it either against your right ankle for a beginner pose, or you can move it higher up and place the foot against your thigh, and take the left knee out to the side. And if you're in good balance, you can take your hands up and then bring them back down to the heart and slowly lower your left foot. Shake your legs out, and now place your weight on your left foot. Gently lift your right foot so your toes are touching as you establish your balance, grounding down through the root of your left leg. And when you feel that balance in your core, take your right foot against your right ankle or higher up, depending on your flexibility, and bring your hands together over your heart. Feel the trunk of your tree anchored down into the roots of your left leg as you lift your crown, tuck your tailbone. And if you're in good balance, you can lift your hands up overhead, expanding your branches. Take a breath in and bring your hands back over your heart, and bring your right foot down again. Shake your legs out and feel your ground. Now, that both feet are on the ground, stand and feel your legs as roots supporting your body. Bring your hands together over your heart, press right hand into left hand and give thanks for your first chakra. Align with the center of your core. Pull your crown up over your base, feel the alignment from Earth to Heaven. Energy wants to move along a line, and second chakra is about movement, being fluid and flowing. Bring your hands together over your heart and press your right hand into your left hand, feel the polarities that can push into each other and continue that pressure on your hands as you lift them up overhead. Polarities can also pull apart, so pull your fingers away from your heels, lengthening the spine, press your hips forward slightly in a mini backbend, and then come back up to a stand, opening your hands wide, bringing them to your hips and bow forward into a Forward Fold, Uttanasana Imagine your legs are supporting you and now your torso is like a waterfall, flowing from the waters of your second chakra. Feel free to sway back and forth to undulate. And then breathe and come halfway up, hands on the knees. And imagine there's a bowl of water, the rim is on your back and you're going to lift the rim and deepen the bowl as if you could collect water there, and then bow forward, let it wash down over you. Place your hands on either side of your front feet, and take your left foot back into a Low Lunge, touching your left knee down. Take your right hand to the inside of your right foot next to your left hand and deepen this stretch in the groin, maybe being on your wrist is enough for you. If you have the flexibility and want to go down onto your forearms or down onto blocks. You can increase the stretch, hug the right knee in toward the shoulder and lengthen the spine between the crown and the tailbone. Inhale and come back up, take right hand to the outside of your right leg. Take your right leg back to meet your left and wiggle your hips, bending each knee, wiggling each hip up toward the ceiling. Next, inhale and bring your left foot forward between your hands, taking your right knee down into a Low Lunge. Inhale your crown up and take your left hand to the inside of your left leg, placing it next to your right hand and hugging your knee close to your shoulder. This might be enough for you, if you have the flexibility and want to go deeper come on down to your forearms and be sure to keep your spine lengthened. Slightly pull your left hip back and extend into your crown. Inhale and come back up onto your wrists, take your left hand to the outside, press your back toes underneath you and take your back foot forward next to your right for an Uttanasana Forward Fold. Inhale halfway up, extend from the tailbone to the crown, deepen that bowl and the second chakra. And come back down into your Forward Fold, perhaps swaying side to side to let everything get loose and watery. And with a slight bend to the knees press down into the floor, tuck your tailbone underneath and slowly rise back up into a stand. Bring your hands together overhead, press right hand into the left hand and bring them down over your heart. Wiggle your hips a little and feel your second chakra. Inhale your hands up overhead once again, lengthen from root to crown and bow forward, hands on the hips into a Forward Fold, hands on either side of the front feet. Take your right leg back into a High Lunge, press your hands into the floor. Take your left leg back into a Downward Dog, wiggle your hips once more, and then come forward into Table position. Take a moment to increase the curve of the sacrum, as you inhale, lift your crown and your tailbone, arching the back as you exhale round into yourself, pushing your hands away from your knees. As you inhale, lift the head and the tailbone, drawing your hands toward your knees. As you exhale round down. And then the next time you inhale, take your hips back to your feet, bringing your feet together and opening your knees as wide as the sticky mat. Allow the front bones of your hips to drop between your thighs as you extend into your hands and lengthen your spine. And then keeping your knees exactly where they are, inhale and lift your hips and your head, pressing your hands into the floor, and come forward into a Wide Knee Cobra, where your hips are dangling in the air. And then press back into open leg Child Pose once again, and go back and forth slowly a few times, feeling the various positions of the hips and finding where you need the stretch. Exhaling as you bring your hips to your heels, and inhaling as you come forward. Exhaling as you bring your hips to your heels, and this time, bring your knees back together. Tuck your toes underneath, press back up into Downward Dog. Lift your right leg up into the air. bend your knee, open the hip. And bring your right foot back down, take your left leg up into the air, press into your hands, push through the core of your body all the way to your left toes, then the left knee, open the hip. Bring the left foot back down and slowly walk or jump your feet forward between your hands. Bow down, remember that waterfall washing over you, shake your head loose, sway in the wind. And with the soft bend to your knees push through your legs, tuck your tailbone, curl upwards, bring your hands up overhead, touch your hands together and bring them down the core. Wiggle your hips and say hello to your second chakra. Find your alignment from tailbone to crown, and say hello to your own place, Svadhisthana. Now, with a combination of the first chakras grounding and the second chakras moving, we can create some energy in the third chakra, so shake your legs and shake your hips and get a little movement going. Think of your third chakra as a generator of energy, a furnace if you will, for the spiritual fire of prana. Our task here is to channel prana through the body combining both movement and holding so that it vitalizes the entire body. Press your feet down into the floor pointing your tailbone to the center between your feet, and lift your arms up overhead palm to palm with elbows straight, point up into your fingertips and lengthen. And as you inhale, pull up a little higher and arch over to the right, keeping your shoulders in line with your hips. Keep your elbows straight and press from your heels out to your fingertips, and then inhale and come back to center. And exhale and go to the other side. Pull your upper shoulder back so you get a good stretch to the side body, and inhale and come back up. Exhale, spread your arms wide pushing energy out to your fingertips energizing your palms and taking your hands down to the floor as you bend forward. Inhale halfway up lengthening the tailbone from the crown, exhale root back down, press your hands on either side of your feet. Take your right leg back into a High Lunge hugging the muscles to the bones, pressing both feet into the mat and drawing them toward each other. Anchoring firmly into your front leg, lift your arms up in a Warrior Pose. Anchor into both legs, tuck your tailbone down, pull your hips back slightly and lift up higher. Inhale and lift your arms and straighten your arms, spread your fingers wide energized, and keep that energy as you take your hands down to shoulder level and turn 90 degrees to the right. Make sure your left knee is over your left ankle, your foot is in line with your back foot. Bend your left elbow and take it to your knee as you lengthen your right arm and bring it up overhead. Find a long line between right fingertips and the outside of your right foot. Take a breath in. And now spiral down, take your right hand back down to the floor, hands on either side of your front foot. Take your left foot back to meet your right for a Downward Dog. And here in Downward Dog as you fire up both your hands and your feet, anchoring them into the floor, press your belly towards your thighs. Release your third chakra from its cage, which I call the rib cage and let your power free. On the next breath in, move forward into Plank Pose, shoulders over the hips, legs, and hips, and knees straight. Press the heels of your hands toward your toes to fire up your third chakra. If this is enough for you, just stay here, or if you need to come down before we get to the next pose, feel free to do so. If you want to little more, we'll do Pulsing Plank. So with a quick exhale, lift your hips high and lower them. Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, nine, 10 for the 10 pedals of the third chakra. And then either knees, chest and chin if you're a beginner, or Chaturanga push-up if you're more advanced, come down to the floor and inhale your crown up. Slide your hands forward so that your elbows are underneath your shoulders, your forearms are flat on the floor, spread your fingers wide, press your legs together and pull your hands toward your hips, lifting your shoulders up, rolling them back, lifting the crown and stretching all that connective tissue on the front of your third chakra. Inhale fully, expand your power. And then come back down, tuck your toes underneath you, press into your hands, press back up into Downward Dog. Take a breath here, press your belly toward your thighs, and then inhale your right foot between your hands. Stay in a High Lunge, anchor into your right foot and rise up into Warrior, lifting your torso straight up and your hands up overhead. Tuck your tailbone a little bit underneath, pull your hips back and lift your chest wide and open. Extend into your fingertips, send that energy out into your hands, spread your fingers wide. Keep that energy in your arms as you open your arms wide, opening your power in. Take a slight twist to the left and extend out looking out over your right fingertips, right knee out over the right ankle. Bending your right elbow and taking it to your right knee, keep your left arm strong and straight as you slowly take it up overhead and extend it in a straight line as much as you possibly can from your left heel all the way up to your left fingertips, opening your ribs up to the ceiling. If you're more advanced and you want to take your hand down to the floor, go ahead and do so. Lengthen, the more you press energy through your limbs, the more energy you have. And then spiral your left hand down to the floor, right hand to the outside of your right foot. Both hands on the floor, bring your back foot forward, Uttanasana, press your belly towards your thighs. Lengthen from hips to crown, inhale halfway up. And exhale all the way down, press firmly into your feet and rise back up all the way to a stand. Inhale your hands back up overhead, touch your palms together, anchor down into your feet. Lift up and breathe into your fingertips and arch over to the left. Lengthening through the right side body, take a deep breath in, come back to center. On the exhalation, arch over to the right. And then inhale back to center. And continuing to energize all the way through your arms into your fingertips, imagine your arms are like the rays of the Sun as they spread wide out to shoulder height. So, inhale up into your fingertips, energize your arms and your fingers, and keep your arms energized as they come out to the side. Feel that you are the radiant Sun and these are the rays reaching all the way to the Earth. And with that, bring your hands together over your heart and maybe touch your palms to your third chakra and rub in a circle, and feel your power, feel your fire kindling in your belly. Namaste. Stand on the front of your mat and take a deep breath. Feel the breath come into your heart. Consider a quality of the heart that you want to bring into your practice, generosity, forgiveness, acceptance, abundance, peace. And focusing on that, inhale your hands up over your head, interlace your fingers and bring them to the back of your neck. Spread your elbows wide and lift your heart up the sky. Take a deep breath in, and then on the exhalation separate your hands and bring them behind your back as you stand interlacing them once again. Roll your shoulders back, and if possible straighten your arms, and move your wrists away from your spine as you lift your sternum up. Can you do a little backbend here? As you lift up your sternum and often your heart. And now, come back to standing, lift your hands behind you and bow forward, Standing Yoga Mudra. Allow your hands to fall where they will and melt the back of your heart. Release your hands to either side of your feet, inhale halfway up. Hold the breath full, and while you're holding the breath come back down and hug your torso to your knees. Let your breath out when you need to. Hands on either side of your feet and take your left foot back to a Low Lunge, meaning your knee is down. Finding your stability by pressing into your right foot and drawing it toward your left knee. Lift your torso up and interlace your fingers behind your back once more. Opening your chest and reaching your fingers toward your back foot. Lift the heart. As you release your hands, take them back down to the mat and bring your right knee next to your left knee for Table position, shoulders over the wrist, hips over the knees, and we'll do a little Cat-Cow breathing. Inhale your crown and your tailbone up, rolling your shoulders back, pressing the heels of the hands toward the knees to open the heart. Exhale, press the breath out of you round into your own self with love, pressing the hands away from the knees. And a few more times, inhale, lift the crown and the tailbone, exhale round, riding on the breath. The next time you inhale come to a flat back and keep your hips exactly where they are with your thighs straight up and down as you slowly walk your hands forward and bring your chest and chin down toward the mat. If this pinches your shoulders, you can always take your hands a little wider. And take a deep breath here and imagine melting the heart. Make sure your hips are over your knees, and it's a posture of surrender. Allow your heart to melt. Use the key of softness in this pose. And then inhale your crown back up, walk your hands back to center underneath your shoulders. And move your left hand slightly toward the center of your mat, and lift your right arm up overhead, opening the chest. Press firmly into the left hand, stretch across the chest and reach up into the right fingertips. Reach high and look at your fingertips, and then bend your right elbow and weave your hand between your knees and your left arm, taking your right shoulder to the midline of the mat, and your left arm overhead. Feel free to play with that left arm, bringing it overhead, or bringing it up into the air, or even wrapping it around and grabbing the inside of your thigh if that's available to you. And then bring your left hand back down to the floor, press up into Table position once again. Bring your right hand more toward the center of the mat and lift your left arm up into the air, press into your right hand more firmly to press across the chest, open the heart, lift up into the fingertips, lengthen from tailbone to crown and then bend your left elbow, weaving your hand between your knees and your right hand, taking your left shoulder to the floor and your right arm overhead. Play with that right arm if you want to, you can lift it up perpendicular to the floor, you can wrap it around your torso and tuck it into your thigh, whatever feels good to you to give your chest a good open stretch. Press into the outside of the left arm to get more twist, and then bring your left hand back down to the floor, and press back up into Table position. From here, come up to kneeling position with your torso upright. And here you may want to use blocks along the side or you can tuck your toes under and raise your heels for a Camel Pose. So remember, when we interlaced our fingers behind our back, begin with that just to get the opening in the chest and the heart. Lift the chest, and maybe this is all you do if you're a beginner. If you want to go further you can reach for the blocks or for your heels. Anchoring the tailbone down between your knees, lift up on your ribs, open the heart and find the surrender in the pose. Inhale and come back up, and take your hands back down to the floor. Shoulders over the wrists, tuck your toes underneath you and press up into Downward Dog. Press firmly into the hands and melt the heart. Take a deep breath here. Inhale your left foot forward between your two hands. Take your right hand, take your right knee down for a Low Lunge. Find your stability here by pressing into your front leg, and rise up interlacing your fingers behind your back, opening the heart. Release your hands and bring them up into Cactus Arms, opening your heart further, spreading your fingers wide and taking a deep breath. And then bring your hands back down to the floor, bring your right foot forward next to your left. Bow down toward your knees and release the heart, soften, lengthen, be at peace. Remember, the heart chakra concept that you chose to bring into this practice, bring it into your heart. And then on the next inhalation rise back up, lift your arms up overhead, bring your palms together, slide them down your core. Interlace your fingers behind your neck and then rise up, bring your hands up overhead. Slide your hands down, press them together over your heart, Anjali Mudra prayer position. What is the prayer for your heart? Take a deep breath in and smile. Now, we enter the world of sound. So, I encourage you to make a lot of sound in your practice this morning. Especially if something is tough, just let it out . So stand with feet hip-width apart, lift your hands up overhead and interlace your palms, and turn your palms upward toward the ceiling. Press your thumbs up to the ceiling and open your shoulders, tilt your head back and look at the back of your hands. And then bring your chin down to your chest, continue to press your hands behind you. Separate your hands and bow forward into Uttanasana Forward Fold, hands on either side of the front two feet. Take your left foot back into a High Lunge and firming up your base, drawing your feet toward each other, hugging the muscles to the bone, back leg straight and strong, right knee over the right ankle. Lift your torso up in your arms overhead, interlacing your fingers once more and turning your palms up to the ceiling. Tilt your head back, open your mouth wide and make a sound. Ha. Bring your palms together and slide them down the center of your torso, and bring your left elbow to your right knee as you twist. And move your right shoulder back, pressing firmly into the core of the body, lengthening through the crown. Separate your hands and bring them either side of your front foot. And this time, we're going to bring our back foot forward again and squat down with your knees and roll back and forth on your spine a few times, being playful and creative, massaging your spine. And this might be enough for some of you, but if you would like to go into Shoulder Stand the next time you roll back, press your legs up into the air, lift your hips, and you can support your hips with your hands right at your waistline. Take a deep breath in. And if you want to play with your legs, you can separate your legs, or take them overhead for a Plow, or merely stay in Shoulder Stand. And then, when you're ready to release, come back down vertebrae by vertebrae, bending your knees so that you can place your feet on the floor hip-width apart in preparation for a Bridge Pose. Hands alongside the body, take a deep breath in. And on the exhale, press down into your feet, lifting your hips up, and roll a little bit side to side getting your shoulders underneath you, interlace your fingers once more, rolling your shoulders back. Press your knees toward each other, open your mouth, make a sound. Ha. Release your shoulders and your hands, roll back down to the mat one vertebrae at a time. Take a deep breath in, hug your knees into your chest. Roll back and forth again, and roll back to a squat. And then lift your hips for a Forward Fold. And now, take your right leg back to a High Lunge. Firming up both legs, left knee out over the left ankle. Find your stability and lift your torso upright, raising your hands up overhead, interlacing your fingers, turning your palms to the ceiling, taking your head back, once more sound. Ha. And then, pressing your hands toward each other, bring them down your core, take your right elbow to your left knee and twist. Lengthen between your right heel and the top of your crown. Take a deep breath in, perhaps another sound. And then, release your hands, take them to either side of your front foot, bring your back foot forward and lower your head. Shake your head loose. Shake your head, yes. Shake your head, no. Shake your shoulders, I don't know. And then press into your feet, tuck your tailbone, rise back up, interlace your fingers overhead one more time. Turn your palms up to the ceiling, take your head back. And then slide your hands down your crown bringing your palms together, bring them to your heart. And end this with a nice Om. In chakra six, we want to work with the element light. We want to imagine our core as a glowing column of light. And as we move, we want to train our gaze to be fixed on a single point. So, inhale your hands up overhead, interlace your fingers, all except the first finger making a Steeple position. And keep your gaze fixed on your fingertips as you arch back, drawing a straight line across the ceiling until you find the limit of your flexibility. And then, just as steadily draw it back forward. And as you bow forward from the hips, keep your gaze fixed on your fingertips as if you had a flashlight between them and you were making a straight line on the opposite wall and down along the floor as you bring your forehead to your knees and your hands to either side of your feet. Inhale halfway up and look forward. Exhale, take your forehead back down to your feet, hands on either side of your feet and take your right leg back just a few feet. Both legs straight, separate your hands on either side of your front foot and move your right leg back another foot, taking your right knee to the ground. Finding your stability here, once again, interlace your hands up overhead. Draw the line up as you take your gaze across the ceiling and back to the limit of your flexibility. And just as steadily, draw that line forward and take your hands down to the floor. Press your hands into the floor and take your left foot back next to your right for a Downward Dog. Come forward onto your knees and allow yourself to come down to your forearms, keeping your elbows underneath your shoulders. Your forearms should be parallel to each other, fingers spread wide. Tuck your toes underneath and lift your hips once again for a Dolphin Pose Lift your gaze to look between your fingertips. Bring your knees back down to the ground. And tuck your toes underneath and press up into Downward Dog. And now, bring your right foot forward between your hands, left foot to the mat 'cause that is the other side, right? Your right foot forward between your hands, left knee to the mat. From the low lunge, find your stability and inhale your hands back up, make the Steeple position again. And once again, draw that line backwards on the ceiling to the limit of your flexibility. And just as steadily draw it forward, bringing your fingertips to the mat in front of your right foot. And then, separating your hands and lifting your hips up, bringing your right leg forward just about a foot. Both legs straight, lengthen through the tailbone and bring your forehead down toward your knee. Bringing your fingertips together if you feel that you are in balance. Then separate your hands, bring your back foot forward next to your right foot. And inhale your crown up, bring your fingertips up overhead, interlace your fingers and draw your hands back. Draw your hands back across the ceiling once again to the limit of your flexibility, and back up. Close your eyes and bring your palms together returning to Anjali Mudra prayer position. Once again, imagining that your body is a glowing vessel of light. The next pose we're going to do is Eagle pose, or Garudasana. It's a good pose that squeezes you like wringing out a washcloth and you want to keep focused on your core. So, inhale your hands up over your head, inhale your hands up overhead, and then swing them down and bring your right arm underneath your left. And if possible, wrap your fingers around so you can touch palm to palm. Swing your right arm underneath your left, and if possible, wrap your forearms around each other so that you come palm to palm. Focus your third eye right on that center line and lift your elbows and lower. And then shifting your weight to your left leg, lift your right leg, bend your left knee, and wrap your right knee over your left thigh. If possible, wrap your toes around your calf, although, many people can't do that until years of practice. And take your hips down, focus and concentrate on your core, see it as a band of light. And then rise up, take your right foot to the floor, release your hands, bring them overhead. And as you exhale, bring your hands down around and bring your left arm underneath your right wrapping arms around in the reverse direction. Find your center in your core, maybe even touching your thumb to your third eye. Lift and lower your elbows, stretching out your shoulders. Take your weight onto your right leg, find your balance, bend your right knee, bend your left knee. Take your left thigh over and wrap your right leg around if possible, tuck your toes underneath your right ankle and lift up into the crown. Squeeze and then rise up, lifting your left leg freeing your arms and bring them together.

LESSON 36 - Everyday Movements

- So in each chakra we're going to learn some everyday movement, simple things you can do in a matter of seconds to begin to develop new habits in your body to open your chakras. So in the first chakra, one of them is to create a wide base. And we do that by taking the tailbone which we know curls under in the spine and energetically pressing it toward the back of your seat. So anytime you sit down to a meal, to work at your computer, to sit in the driver's seat and drive a car, to have a conversation with someone, just simply take your tailbone back and notice how that begins to set the tone to have an upright spine. And one more thing you can do that's really fun is to just bounce up and down on your tailbone. You can do it on the floor and move side to side. You can do it on a chair. And what that does, it stimulates the base of the spine and starts the cerebral spinal fluid moving up and down. It's fun and it helps you remember your first chakra. Remember, anytime you lose your first chakra, just sit down. That's where it is. You're sitting on it. Some everyday movements that you can do that just take a matter of seconds? Well, as you stand, as you inhale take your tailbone way back. Arch the small of your back a little bit. As you exhale, swing it forward. Just practice breathing in and out, swinging your pelvis backwards and forward. Once you get the hang of moving it backward and forward, you can now move it forward and let a wave form go all the way up your body. So inhale, take it back. Exhale, take your pelvis forward and let that movement make a wave motion all the way up to your crown. So one of the everyday movements you can do is to work with the breath. This comes from yoga called the breath of fire, or Kapalbhati, and it's a rapid diaphragmatic breathing. Just take your hand and place it over your solar plexus, over your third chakra. Relax your breath. Just let the breath come in naturally. And then snap your diaphragm back toward your spine and send the air out through your nose like that. Then when you relax your diaphragm the air naturally comes back in and when you snap it, it comes out again. So do that rapidly like this. And just notice, do you feel a little bit more energy? This is also good for toning the muscles in front of the third chakra. Another charging breath that you can do, especially if you get a little stiff in the middle, is inhale your belly to the front and take it around the back and stir the cauldron. Keep your shoulders over your hips and just try to move this midsection of your body. When you get the hang of it one way, go around the other way, inhaling when it's front, exhaling to the back. And then as you pause, stop and see, do you feel a little activation in your third chakra? You can use these exercises when you need a little more containment for your power. That's the breath of fire, or a little bit of development of that muscle that holds your third chakra in place, or when you just want to loosen things up and activate your third chakra, maybe you want to stimulate your metabolism or wake yourself up, stir that cauldron and see what happens. One is just to open your hands up, take your shoulders back in a kind of "ain't it wonderful" feeling. So that just lifts the heart. Just look around at any kind of magic or miracle you see around you and just "ah, ain't it wonderful". Feel how that opens your heart. And the other one is very simple, several times in your day, especially when you're busy or hurrying somewhere, just take a moment to stop, take a deep breath into your heart and lift the corners of your mouth toward your ears. So one is when your neck gets tired, especially you've been sitting at your computer for awhile. Just kind of take your head and roll it around, stretching the neck on each part. If you go to one side, you might take the opposite hand and pull your ear down towards your shoulder a little. The free hand can then massage some of the muscles on your neck. You can take it to the back and you can take the other side, do a little massaging up and down. And that helps to relieve some neck tension. Shake your head side to side and just loosen it up. Another one to work with the tension that happens in the jaw from clenching your jaw and closing your throat chakra is that if you take your hand, or even someone else can do this to you, and put it under your chin and then open your mouth and make a sound. So you're pressing against the resistance of your hand. Ah! And that means your jaw muscles have to go the other way and open. And that's a good way to release jaw tension. So there's an eye exercise that comes from yoga that is good for strengthening the muscles of your eyes. And actually they say it is good for helping to improve your vision. And it's simply looking in different directions systematically. Yogic eye exercises. Look directly forward from a calm place, and then following a straight line, lift your eyes up, looking as high as you can without moving your head, looking up toward your eyebrows, and then a straight line down past the center line and look down below again without moving your head. Then bring your eyes once more up to center. And now, without moving your head, take your eyes to the right, as far as you can, and then looking across a horizontal line, take them to the left as far as you can, and back to center. Now we're going to go diagonally. Looking to the upper right across the center and to the lower left, again without moving your head, and back to center. And now up to the upper left and down to the lower right, and back to center. Now we're going to lift our eyes up again without moving the head and take them around the clock to the right, down below up the left, circle them around a couple of times and then back to center. And then once again, lift your eyes upward without moving your head, take them around the clock in the opposite direction to the left and down and to the right and up couple of times, and then back to center. Then close your eyes and rub your hands together creating some friction and some heat in your palms. And when you feel that heat in your palms, gently cup your hands over your eyes and feel the warmth. So I mentioned how, when we block off this chakra we often furrow our brow. So a nice thing to do is do a forehead pull. Take your forefingers along the midline of your forehead and press in and pull out toward the side of your head, maybe a couple times. And then when you get to your temples, massage your temples and then back to the inner corner of your eyebrows really press is probably going to be a little tender, and pull, follow your eyebrows out, just massaging gently. And then I like to take it around to the bottom of the skull and just do a little tapping here. That's a good third eye stimulation.

LESSON 36 - Meditation: Chakra Alignment Meditation: Opening Inner Temple

- Opening the inner temple. Chakra alignment meditation. Find it quiet place where you can sit comfortably. Make this a special time for yourself. Time to go inside to your inner temple, that sacred space within your skin, that you identify as yourself. Let the images of the day fall away as your attention turns inward, into the peaceful sanctuary of your inner world. Begin to focus on your breath, naturally coming in and coming out. Letting the inhalation be just a little bigger and then letting it out all the way, even with a soft sigh. Wait for the natural inclination to inhale again and imagine the air streaming into your inner temple like a fresh breeze through a window. And release again, releasing any tension in your body and settling in to the depth of your soul. Say hello to this inner temple. Take up residence here, this is your sacred space Yours and yours alone. Begin to align your chakras by pressing your tailbone toward the back of your seat, widening your base. Notice what happens to your body, to your posture, to your breath. From the center of that wide base, press down into the earth, pressing down through any floors or foundations, to imagine strong and vital roots penetrating the earth below. Feel the sense of settling into the floor of your inner temple, into your foundation of being, into the home of your body. Now, keeping your roots down, lift the top of your head up toward the heavens, inhale into the vast spaciousness of the starry night sky and feel yourself expand into the infinite. Imagine you can lift higher and higher, yet still keep your roots anchored in the earth. Extending upward and downward at the same time. Filling your spine. When you come to your next exhalation, draw that cosmic energy downward into the crown of your head. And down through the core that runs through the vertical center of your temple. See that core in your mind's eye as a vertical column of sparkling, bright energy. Imagine that column of energy as the capital letter I. A straight line with a little hat at the top and a foot at the bottom. Feel that core as your personal eye, the sacred center of your inner temple. As you breathe in silently utter the word I and affirm that core, bringing in beautiful golden energy from your crown. And as you breathe out, imagine the words I am, moving the energy all the way down to the earth Affirm the I on the in breath, and the I am on the out breath. I on the in breath and I am on the out breath. And then feeling that I, the presence that is you. Now give it a location. I am here, I am in here. I am here now. Now that you have established your core, imagine that strong like spinning, shining jewels, along the cord of your central column of energy are the seven chakras, seven chambers in your inner temple. Each one handling a different type of energy. We will now charge up each one of these sacred chambers with the breath. Beginning at the base of the spine, where the first chakra is located. Imagine a red, glowing ball of energy. Roots moving down to the earth, pushing into the solid body of the mother. Inhale and draw that earth energy up your legs and into your body and exhale and push it back down to the earth. Pressing your tailbone to the back, your sitting bones down, your feet into the floor. Say, I am in in here. Inhale and draw the earth energy up the way roots drop nutrients and exhale and let your roots penetrate even deeper. One more time, inhaling up exhaling, pressing the roots deep and wide. All the way around you, like the roots of a tree. And on the next breath, bring your attention to your second chakra. Just below the navel, midway between front and back. Its name, svadhisthana, means ones own place. So acknowledge this as your private place, an intimate place. The chakra of water who's flow is the river of life, flowing through you moment to moment. Allow those rivers to flow through your body right now, making little micro movements wherever you're sitting, oscillating back and forth with your spine according to what feels good to you. Imagine a warm orange color expanding out to your skin as you inhale. And then with a sensuous caress, draw that energy in to your own place. Inhale and and expand into the orange, exhale and gather that light into your core. Seeing the light brighten right in the center of your inner place. Imagine this center directly above the red first chakra, in alignment, the radiant core connecting them. And as that radiant core moves through the second chakra, it rises up into the fire of the third chakra. Here, the energy of matter and movement combine to create friction and sparks energy. That energy can bring you power. Imagine that fire burning inside you, burning with purpose, burning with strength, feel the energy of that fire. Feel that charge to go forth and take action, to do what needs to be done. As you inhale, imagine the yellow fire expanding. And as you exhale, draw those flames into embers, knowing you can breathe in those sparks any time and move it into a fire, and you can let go of the breath and come into a calm. And now your red first chakra, your orange second chakra, your golden yellow third chakra connected along the radiant core which now rises out of that fire. Up into the air of the heart. Take a breath of this glorious air, fill yourself with its presence and let it out. Softening the body is your release. Let the next breath in be breathing in the love that brings everything in this world into relationship. The love that has provided this earth and all the beings on it. And as you breathe out, let that love flow through your heart. Loving creation in return, in gratitude, inhaling the love in like a divine caress to your heart, filling your heart with beautiful green energy and then releasing. Opening the chest, softening the shoulders, opening the arms wide. Maybe you would like to bring your hands over your own heart, holding this precious jewel, this sacred center of the heart chakra. Anahata, sound that is made without any two things striking. And as the heart settles into the peace, the unity and expansion of the air. We spread our wings and fly up to the throat chakra. The realm of sound, vibration, the bright blue of communication, expression, creativity. Allow the music to be a caress to your fifth chakra. See waves of radiant blue light, oscillating sound waves moving out from your throat and moving inward to your inner listening. Imagining your expression to be effortless. Your deepest truth abides here. As the vibrations of this sound massage your being, imagine rising to even a higher, faster vibration of light. The light of the sixth chakra, the place of vision, intuition, imagination. Now we feel the charge of our life force is a luminous light that comes pouring in from the sunlight, pouring in like light through a window and illuminating the inner temple. Cascading down through the center, where we see these beautiful, colored jewels spinning and sparkling, strung together by the luminous, radiant core. And as you breathe in, imagine this light expands. And floods your being. And as you breathe out, imagine you focus that light into a laser beam, penetrating focus to see forward, to shine a light on whatever you need to see. And inhaling and expanding into the light, exhaling and focusing, what is yours to do? What is your vision? What is your dream? We finally take the last step up to the crown chakra. Sahasrara, 1000 petal lotus, fully blooming at the crown of the head, consciousness itself. Who is it that is hearing these words? Who is it that is hearing this music, that is living in your body, who's lives in this sacred temple? The answer to this is the same as what is asking, consciousness itself. But it is not you alone that is conscious, but everything around you. Open to the divine cosmos the way a flower drinks in the sunlight, pulling it down, letting it tumble into your inner temple, filling each chakra overflowing to the one below. Radiant nectar of the gods caressing you with divine intelligence, guidance, wisdom. Let this wisdom settle within you and from your mind's eye, see this radiant inner temple, seven rainbow jewels spinning on a radiant core. The core of the eye, the core of the south. These radiant jewels shining out into the world around you. Radiating love and light and truth power, pleasure. The infinite presence of your being. Know that this is what you are, a rainbow bridge from heaven to earth, complete and whole and present.

LESSON 36 - Meditation: Chakra Healing: Harvesting Your Day Meditation

- Harvesting your day into your chakras, a meditation to aid you in falling asleep. As your day winds into a close, and you climb into your bed at night, know that you are pulling into yourself to drop down and to go to sleep. Align your body vertically on your back and close your eyes. Sink into the softness of the bed, and feel that your day is ending. Harvest memories through each chakra that you can pull into your inner temple and keep. We begin at the crown, a chakra of consciousness and awareness, spirituality. What was the spiritual moment that you had today? Perhaps a moment of realization or awakening? An insight? Maybe a good meditation? Take a moment to review that experience. Draw it into your crown chakra. And like a flower folding up for the night, fold up the thousand petals of the crown chakra lotus. And take that memory inside, and let it settle. Take a breath in and experience a moment of gratitude for what you just harvested. And next, come down to your sixth chakra, the chakra of seeing. What did you see today that was beautiful? Do you remember color or light? A smile on a child's face? A beautiful person walking down the street? A landscape? And if nothing comes to mind, you can always create something in your imagination, something of beauty, to harvest into the core of your sixth chakra. As the two petals of that lotus close like your two eyes, and pull that memory in to the deep Take a breath fully in, and as you let it out, let that settle down into your body. And next, review the conversations you had today. Was there a moment when you felt particularly connected? Where you spoke your truth or heard someone else's truth? Or a moment of hearing beautiful music? Gather this memory into your throat chakra, and fold up the 16 petals of the throat, to keep that memory inside, as you take a deep breath in and out, letting that settle deep into your core. Next, bring your attention to your heart chakra, in the middle of your chest. Where did you love today? Where did you receive love? Where did you give love? Where did you do something that you love? A moment when your heart soared? Fold up the 12 petals of your heart chakra lotus and bring it inside to your inner temple. Take a breath in and let it out. And let that love settle in the deepest part of your being. Now, move your attention down to your third chakra in the solar plexus, the power center. Where did you feel powerful today? What was a moment when you had a lot of energy? When you were strong and effective? What did it feel like to have that power coursing through your veins? Fold up the 10 petals of the third chakra, and bring that power into your core and let it settle. And now, you come down to your second chakra, the center of pleasure. How did you feel today? What did you do that was pleasurable, enjoyable, fun? Do you remember laughing or playing? Or perhaps it was a touch on your skin? A delicious taste at a meal? A way your body moved? Harvest that feeling of pleasure into the cells of your body, as you breathe in to your second chakra. Folding up the six petals of the second chakra lotus and letting that pleasure settle in your body for the night. And then finally, as you settle down into your body, to thank your body for what it went through today. Thank your body for doing the work that you did. Reviewing what touched your body. What did you eat? Where did you go? And feel gratitude for another day of living. All these experiences folding up the petals, bringing it inside and letting it settle in the deep core of your being. And as your breath softens and the day drifts away, know that these treasures are yours to keep as you drift off to a deep and restful sleep.
