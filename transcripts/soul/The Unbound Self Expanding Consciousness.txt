========================================

Preparation 1: Welcome to Your Quest
--------------------
<v ->Welcome to this collaboration</v> between the Monroe Institute and Mindvalley. My name is Allyn Evans. I'm the CEO. I'm also a long-time trainer, have been doing it since 2011, and I teach energy medicine with a physician out of Rochester, New York. I'm also an energy healer, and I'm just looking so forward to this Quest and offering it to you. <v ->My name is Luigi Sciambarella.</v> I'm a trainer for the Monroe Institute, have been since 2010. I'm also a hypno-psychotherapist and a tutor for therapists, and it's an absolute pleasure to be here, to be able to provide you with a toolkit for exploring and expanding your consciousness. So what is the Monroe Institute? To answer that question, we have to start with Robert Monroe, who's the founder and the consciousness pioneer who popularized the term "out- of-body experience" in his three books back in the 1970s. And Bob was a businessman. He worked in radio production and in the 1950s started having spontaneous out-of-body experiences, which first of all scared him but then led him in a very deep way to explore using his curiosity what that state actually meant. And from that work, from the research that came out of that, he developed a noninvasive technology, a sound technology, which has been developed further, and you'll be listening to that within the meditations of this particular program. And he also established an institute called the Monroe Institute, which is based in Faber, Virginia. So at the Monroe Institute, we teach residential programs, taking people through a variety of programs and systems for exploring and expanding their consciousness. <v ->So Bob Monroe created the original technology using</v> binaural beats called Hemi-Sync which is short for hemispheric synchronization. And basically it means that we can lead ourselves to a whole-brain state where our left brain and our right brain are communicating harmoniously, which we'll talk to you more about later. Although he began his exploration in the 1950s, it wasn't until the mid seventies that there actually was a Hemi-Sync product available to the market. For this Quest, what you're going to be listening to is our proprietary sound technology, which is produced exclusively by us. It's very purpose driven; it's focused on specific frequencies that help us with certain subjects and aspects of our lives. We are innovating right now. No one else is doing this in our field, and it's just an exciting time to be at the Monroe Institute as we evolve and as we grow. <v ->So as we continue our 50-year</v> journey in the exploration of consciousness, we're incorporating new understandings of neuroscience and evolution in how we can actually produce sound technology and putting it all together into new signal mixes. And part of those signal mixes is what you're going to be listening to in the meditations in this particular program, which I think is very exciting and quite exclusive to what this particular collaboration is offering. <v ->So here's what we'll be covering in this Quest:</v> we'll cover the art of relaxation. Relaxation is a core skill; however, so many people just do not understand how to relax, what relaxing means, and that's what we will be discussing in that topic. Relaxation is the key to our personal power. <v ->We'll also explore focus,</v> and being able to train a sustained focus is actually a skill. And often people try to be a bit too forceful in trying to focus on something. So what we'll be exploring is this idea of gentle persistence, of being able to often reset your focus so that you can keep returning to the task at hand. And we'll be exploring two dimensions of this, which is the breadth, so what's in the actual background of what you're focusing on. And then the, the center of that focus. So the, the, the object in the foreground and how to use and cultivate the two to support each other so that you can focus for longer periods of time on whatever it is that you put your attention on. We'll also explore solving problems, and everybody has problems from time to time. So I think this is relevant to pretty much anybody doing this particular course. But a problem is a bit like a gas; it can fill a room, and it can fill your head space. So one of the things that we'll be doing in this particular section is learning how to worry well; in other words, ask the right questions to move you through a problem space so that you're not just circulating around the same territory, racking your brain and and trying to work things out in a purely logical and limited way. But we'll be moving our attention, moving our awareness, into more of an appreciation of more of our resources, into our deeper being level so that we can bring more of ourselves onto a problem. And this helps us to find solutions that perhaps we wouldn't have been able to work out if we'd only stayed in a logical frame of reference. And then we'll be discussing confidence. And people have this misconceived idea that confidence is an emotion, and it's really not. It has two components, which is physical relaxation, which then can kind of lead to mental relaxation, and absence of self-concern. So when you have that kind of relaxed open focus on a particular task, and you're not worried so much about some sort of negative self-appraisal, how others might be judging you, or negative self-talk, then you would be perceived as confident. And that's what we notice in others when we think of them being confident. So we'll be exploring techniques in order to be able to maximize your sense of confidence and be able to anchor situations of the past where perhaps you were confident and bring that into the present so that you can use that in future scenarios. <v ->And then we're going to talk about healing.</v> You'll learn how to move to a healing way of being with yourself. How do we do this? We can become more compassionate and forgiving, not only of ourselves but others. We want to start with an empowering decision to be in the beginning of undoing the negative way of living and experiencing life so that we can move to healing. We're going to be focusing on empowered intention. And to me that's a very special tool to use when moving yourself to a healing state of being. The intention is to be the source of healing. And again, it's for yourself, and it's for others. We'll be talking about you a lot, but we can also talk a little bit about how you can be helpful to others. I guess one last thing I want to have you understand before you get into this lesson is that what the mind believes the body will help happen. That's a topic I'm going to put a lot of focus on in this session. And next we're going to talk about love, what people are seeking. At least it's what I believe is a connection and possibly even safety. We use the word love to label that cluster of feelings or those emotions, and we don't always understand what we're labeling. Now at Monroe, we consider love a totally different thing. It's more of a frequency, and it's something that we can attune to. It's like a vibration that we can attune to. And this helps us move beyond conditionalities, and it helps us move to being a evaluator more than a judger. I'm going to spend some time on that in this specific topic. The next topic we will be discussing is manifesting abundance. Manifesting is not about having control or getting everything we think we want. This is one of my favorite topics, and I got involved with it years ago when I first learned about the law of attraction. However, I'm going to ask that we look at this in a different way, and as a teaser, I'm going to tell you a little bit of what I think here. So when we desire something, when we put it out there that, that we just want this and we desire it, that is a definition of "It's over there. I don't have it. Will I ever have it?" It's fear-based. So that's putting an energetic block in front of you and what you want. And I'm going to be asking you to move from that space to a place of choice. I choose this for myself, or I choose this, and it's a totally different energy. So stay tuned because there's more to come on that topic. We're also going to talk about connecting with guidance. And this is one of my favorite subject areas. It's something I've been working on since my late twenties. We all have access to guidance from within and from beyond. It's not just the psychics and mediums who have this power. So we're going to learn techniques that help you master this where you're going from a one-way communication system to a two-way communication so that you actually are perceiving information that helps you lead a better life. Now, I do want to say this before signing off, you are the captain of your ship. So it's not about taking away your personal responsibility, and that'll be a big takeaway I hope you have after this session. <v ->And then we'll explore the out-of-body experience.</v> So the out-of-body experience is a very interesting state of consciousness where we know rather than just believe that we are more than our physical bodies. And that was kind of the cornerstone of what Bob Monroe was teaching when, when he built the Monroe Institute and wrote his books about the experience. So we'll be exploring techniques to, to be able to expand our consciousness beyond the physical limits, but also take that out-of-body insight so that we can better understand our position in this reality, so that we move away from seeing this as purely a physical survival game and move it to more of a thriving perspective. And then knowing how to integrate that into our daily lives so we get more out of our physical life experience. And then we'll explore sensuality and intimacy, which might not seem like an obvious topic, but we're doing a lot of energy work in this program. And as energy moves and as we connect more to our needs and as we move into more of connection with ourselves and others, then this becomes a really, really important topic for being able to get the most out of our physical experience. So we'll be using Monroe sound science tools to be able to better connect with ourselves energetically so that we can maximize the enjoyment that we can have in the physical dimension and also utilize that for energy work so that we can connect with that sensual energy and move it up the body for other ways of expression. So this Quest is designed in a modular way. It's a toolbox Quest, and that means that you can jump in at any point depending on what resonates with you. So if there's a particular skill set that you would like to build, then just jump straight into that. We would recommend however that you do start with the relaxation module because this will provide a solid foundation for everything else that follows. But feel free to explore and play around however you want. <v ->With each session,</v> you have several meditations to choose from, so you don't have to finish listening to all the meditations to move to the next one. And there is no set order. But instead, we recommend that you start with the topics that address your issues or problems or address your interests. You also can take a break and go work through the meditations. Some people will want to do all of them. Some people will do a few, and you might find that you'll bookmark some to use in the future if a situation or challenge comes again. <v ->So with all that said, let's get started.</v> <v ->We are looking forward to taking you on this journey</v> with us.

The Unbound Self

====================

LESSON 1: Mastering the Art of Deep Relaxation
--------------------
<v ->So Allyn, in this section</v> we're going to be talking about relaxation which is often a very misunderstood concept. And I was just reading a survey which showed that, on average, Americans spend only about 40 minutes a day relaxing. And of that, people had wildly different ideas of what relaxation actually means. And of those, 33% thought that flossing was adequate me time. <v ->Are you serious? - I'm</v> serious. That's what they said. So are we going to be teaching people about flossing? <v ->No. No. But it is misunderstood.</v> And most people don't know how to relax. They don't understand what it means to relax. Obviously, since 33% of Americans that think flossing is relaxing. So this lesson will be delving in deeply into what it means to relax, how to relax. And we'll be using the Monroe Sound Science tools to help us. What gets in the way of truly relaxing? This answer might surprise you. It's trying to relax. The more you force it, the less relaxed you'll tend to be. It's not a goal to relax. That's really the worst thing you can do. It's about embracing activities and techniques that help you relax. So I do highly recommend that you get a device like the Oura Ring or a smartwatch to help you monitor your body reactions throughout the day. This really helps because it helps you understand, when I'm in this situation, something is happening. When I'm in this situation, something else is happening here. I'm, I'm engaged versus stressed. So again, it helps you learn how your body responds. So it does help you get to the bottom of it, and it helps you gain a better understanding so that you can start changing your reaction. Awareness is the first key. One of the reasons we want to do this, and of course it's the obvious: relaxation allows us to recover from periods of effort. We've got to do this. If we're burning the candle at both ends, we are going to crash at some point. This is why relaxation is such a key part of our Quest. With practice, it can help you retain a more relaxed state no matter what is going on around you. And I have a few stories about that later. And to be relaxed doesn't mean everything is hunky dory. Discomfort has a purpose. We need to be given communication from our physical body, our mental body, and our emotional body so that we can understand what's happening and respond to it. Again, awareness is key, but then it's our reaction that causes the stress. And there are so many things you can do to help yourself relax and manage your stress levels. And you've heard all these before. I'm not giving you any new information here, but let's just do this one. You can take deep breaths, so when you're aware, like it feels like your blood pressure is going up, or when you just know your heart rate is just really fast, just stop and take in one deep breath and make the intention to calm down. "I am calm." You can take an Epsom salt bath if you have the opportunity. There are also supplements available that can help you relax. You can listen to Monroe Sound Science which to me is the key because it helps you understand what real relaxation is. And so many of you, you do not know. You think you know, like you might be sitting there going, "Yes, I'm relaxed and you're talking to me. Yes, Allyn, I'm so relaxed," and I'm looking at you and you're like, you know, like this. You know, hardly moving. And so physically, the indication that I'm seeing is, "Oh no, if you had a measuring device right now, we would see your stress levels off the charts." So in this particular session, we have meditations that are going to help you learn how to experience, understand, and feel what deep relaxation is for you. Ask yourself this question. It's an important question. Do I believe relaxing is being selfish? And so many of us do, especially women who have been of service to their families; they, they're just really tired, or they need a break, and they feel like if they do so, something's wrong with it. So what I'm asking you to do is really think about your views, your beliefs about relaxation, because if you don't do it, you're not going to be able to live your best life. So just get that notion out of your head. And there are so many things you can do, and they can be enjoyable activities; it just doesn't have to be quiet time or taking a nap. Just remember the bottom line is here: to take care of you, you need to reduce your stress; you need to do things that bring you joy and help you relax. And that's going to help you be better in your responsibilities and better in the service for others. So do you think being relaxed means that you're not doing anything or very little? Now, this is also a common mistake or misunderstanding about what relaxation is. I've already indicated that I'm expecting relaxation to include activities that you do. This is very important because the more practiced you are at engaging in life, even having maybe some conversations that are a little bit difficult, but just stepping into it in a more relaxed state, you're going to train yourself how to be more relaxed. Here's something I want you to think about. You do know that you are your own worst enemy, right? Just really think about that. You know what you say to yourself. You know how you get yourself worked up. There is so much extra weight we place on ourselves by the thoughts we have. "They think I'm stupid." "I'm so fat." "They hate me." That's an individual putting that in his or her head. And what do you think that's doing? That's causing you stress. How do you stop doing it? Well, it's not that easy. So awareness is the first step. And I want to tell you a story about how I first heard about this. I read a book, can't even tell you what the book was called, it was so many years ago. But the author said, "I want you to pick one day, and I want you to decide that you're going to be aware every time you say something negative to yourself. And when you do that, I want you to put a rubber band around your wrist and snap your wrist." Well, I chose not to put the rubber band and snap my wrist, but what I did do is pay attention. And at the end of the day, and I, I even hate to admit this, but I was very sad to know that I was saying mean things to myself every 30 seconds. Awareness is key. And that's how we change our behavior. So what do we do? We can use different sayings to ourselves. We can use different affirmations. So when we start saying these things that are negative, "I am so stupid." You say, "I am doing the best I can." You know, just find replacement statements that you can immediately put in once you become aware. Something else we do and we all do it. Have you heard of the term "awfulizing"? We tend to have this habit of worrying about the unknowns in the future. This means you could have an irrational belief that something bad or unfortunate is bound to occur. I mean, "The sky is falling," right? "It's about to happen." "What bad will happen next?" "He is going to be so mad at me because I'm doing..." whatever. "Everything is falling apart." "It's a mess." How do you stop that? How do you stop telling yourself these messages? Again, it's all back to awareness. And then you create affirmations you can use instead. "Everything is as it should be." "All is well; all is well." "Everything will be okay." And you can repeat those in your head. And it works. I promise you. Something else that it's important to think about. Did you know it's possible to be relaxed when you are stressed? It is. And this was a game changer for me. After I got a device to measure my stress, I would be in stressful situations, and after the end of the day, I would look at my device and the results, and it would show me that in some cases, that even though I thought I might be stressed, I was very relaxed. Not too long ago, I bought a house and was signing all these papers. And I thought, surely for the 30 minutes that I just signed my life away, I would have a high stress level on my device, my device would report that I had a high stress level. Well, that was not the case. So again, it's very interesting to use something to measure those stress levels because you'll be surprised at what causes you stress and what does not. As I did this work, and by work I mean as I started to meditate more, make that a regular practice, and I used the support of the sound technology, I had a byproduct. And the byproduct was that I was very relaxed in crazy, insane situations. And at that time, I didn't have a monitoring device, but I could tell that I was very calm; I felt safe; I felt always in order. I wasn't concerned about the outcome. One such example is when I was having surgery. You know, when you have surgery, there are presurgery things they do. So they sit me in a chair, and I look at the room, and I'm staring at the table that they're about to put me on. I'm staring at the equipment, all that stuff they're about to cut me with. And the nurse starts taking my pulse, and after a while she stops and she looks at me with a, she has a quizzical expression. And she says, "What did you do? You have the lowest pulse that I've ever taken before surgery." And I knew exactly what it was because again, as I've told you, this meditation practice with the support of the sound technology had a side benefit. Another example of this is when 30 tornadoes were in the state of Oklahoma. That's where I lived at the time. And one was in the area. So I did the regular thing where I grabbed the pillows, the child, the dogs, the radio, so we could keep up with what was going on. And we went into the interior room, which in this particular house was only one room, and it was the half bath. So we're sitting in there; they're, the radio guy's giving us play-by-play where the tornado is. And all of a sudden he says, "The tornado is right over the cross streets of..." and he named two roads. Guess where that was? It was my house. It was right over my house. So what was going to happen? It was either going to touch down, wipe me out, or it was going to move on. Well, you, you see how the story turned out. It did move on. But during that experience, all of a sudden I noticed, I was like, I am so calm; everything's okay. I just knew it was as it was supposed to be. And again, I believe it's the practice that has led me to live now in a state of well-being and of calmness and mostly in a relaxed state to responses of stressors. So for me, really it's as natural as breathing. Now, it doesn't mean I don't still hit stress markers, but if I do, I usually recover really quickly. It's not like I'm hanging out in the stress level for two to four hours. It's a spike, and then it drops right back down. So that's the goal. That's where you want to be. And a regular practice sets you up to have it if you need it. And the takeaway here is that if you don't need it, it's still there. The more you practice, the more you build that muscle, the more natural it becomes without taking any other actions to relax. Now, the Monroe Sound Science meditations that will support you in this process have been included. So you'll have an opportunity to listen to them and experience them. So one of the meditations that you're going to have in this grouping for this particular topic is an anchoring meditation. So what this means is it, it's giving you an anchor designed to give you a word or a phrase that you will use in your waking state. You know, so when that stress level hits or you know, "Hey, I'm in a high stress state," or you say, "Hmm, that's pretty bad coming at me, I need to relax." Then you've got a phrase or a word that you can bring to mind. You just take a deep breath; say it in your mind; take a very, release breath, and you're training your physical body to respond to a command. So your physical and emotional response to the anchoring will work with you to help relaxation take place. It, it starts becoming more automatic for you. So here's how it works. Listen to the meditation a few times, and that can be one time, or that can be up to three times, or it can be even more, until you feel like you've really learned what the anchoring technique is. Then all throughout your day, at any time as you're feeling yourself being stressed, knowing you need to relax, bring it to your attention, and you can take a deep breath. Then you'll see in your mind the word or phrase; then you release, and you're training your body to automatically relax when you give yourself that command. So what I recommend for you today, or as you work through this lesson, is to listen to any of the Monroe Sound Science tracks associated with this session. We've added a variety so that you can experience different aspects of relaxation, and especially one that's about deep relaxation. So many of us don't know how to get there and what it feels like. So the idea is we get you there; you experience it, and it's easier to get back. Feel free to take your time and experience the meditations at your own pace. And I have a tip for you: when listening to this section. It's highly recommended that you begin with a selection about deep relaxation for the very reason I just explained. And another good one to do sooner than later is the anchoring meditation. So you'll have your anchoring techniques ready to go all throughout your day.

LESSON 1: Meditation - Deep Relaxation With Monroe Sound Science

- This exercise is primarily designed to help you reach a deep state of relaxation. You may also find it useful when needing to reach a state of calmness to receive guidance and or discover solutions for yourself. You can use the free flow time that will follow. Let's begin by taking some time to follow your breath. Letting each breath you take help you expand gently and easily. More and more, resting a while in this expansion, feeling all thoughts, all worries, melt away completely as your mind is at peace and your heart leads the way you may wish to. Put aside any unwanted distractions that may get in the way of this exercise by putting them into some type of container such as a sack, a bag or box. Use your imagination to create the sack bag or box. Take some time to do this. Now. If these distracting thoughts or new ones come to mind, gently direct them to the place you selected they remain during this meditation. You can always return to those thoughts later. Begin relaxing by moving your awareness to your breath. Take a few deep relaxing breaths, and as you inhale, breathe in fresh, clean energy from the air around you. And as you exhale, release any tired, stagnant energy. Just let it go. Allow your spine to comfortably straighten as this helps your natural channels of energy open up and flow. Be aware of the inner waves of your personal energy that pass over and through you. Continue to relax more and more. Build the energy around your physical body. Feel it surrounding you and relax in its warmth. And now let's go deeper into a relaxed state. As we move through the body, focus your attention on each part of your body, starting with your feet, relaxing the muscles in your feet. Now up to your cows, your thighs, up through your hips, your pelvis, your torso. More and more relaxed, going deeper within. As you relax now, relax your hands, arms, and shoulders. Relax through your back, your neck, and finally, your head and face. Deeply. Relax deeply at peace. Continue to relax and focus your attention and desire so that you may open the door to guidance, exploration, or just simply rest and relax. I will let you know when it is time to return. It is now time to think about returning as you prepare to return, recall and review any information or guidance you may have received. Return now to full physical waking consciousness, bringing your awareness back to your physical body in the room you are in. And, and as you return to being fully awake, fully alert, you'll be totally refreshed in every way with all systems of the body, physical, mental, and emotional, operating wonderfully and efficiently. Welcome back.

====================

LESSON 1: Meditation - The Anchoring for Relaxation With Monroe Sound Science

If you have not selected the command, you'll use to help direct your total self. I recommend you stop this meditation and take time to do that before beginning again. I invite you to close your eyes, take a few deep breaths, and then breathe normally with each breath, relax more. With more relax, let go of any stress or strain on any part of your body. To help clear your mind, I'll invite you to place any worries and concerns that you have in a box or some type of bag or briefcase. Simply imagine a box, a briefcase, backpack or sack, whatever you might want to place your worries and concerns in. I'll give you some time to do this now.
Now, in a state of total relaxation, you'll open up your access channel. Just make this intention to open up your access channel and the frequencies will support you getting there. Focus on your intent to open your access channel. With your access channel open, all parts of you are opening to receive. All parts of you are moving in unison. All parts of your being from your conscious waking mind down to every living cell are open to understand and act upon the instructions you are about to receive and let them become the knowledge, the knowing of your entire total self.
Here is where you will create your own command, anchored by the word plus to help you navigate your day and improve your overall wellbeing. So I will be asking you to take in a deep breath, and as you do this, you say in your mind, plus, and while holding your breath, say your new command that you've specifically designed for you, and then release also saying the word plus. Let's do this together. Take in a deep breath, say in your mind. Plus, while holding your breath, say your new command that you have specifically designed for your needs.
When you're ready, release your breath saying the word plus as you do the word plus is used to serve as the anchor. You will be providing your own command, word or phrase to complete the process so that your total self is in complete harmony with your intention. Let's repeat this again. Take in a deep breath, say in your mind. Plus, while holding your breath, say your new command that you have specifically designed for your needs. And when you're ready, release your breath saying the word plus. As you do with your access channel still open and receptive, repeat in your mind the special command that you wish to install in your total consciousness. Picture in your mind the activity of the command just exactly as you desire it to operate. Repeat this process. Repeat it several times to be sure that it reaches your entire system to every part of you. Take some time to do this now. It is now time to close your access channel. Make the intention to close your access channel. Your access channel is closed for the remaining time. Use your imagination to see here. Feel and experience yourself using the new command to direct your senses, your emotions, and your in the way you sow desire. Use the power of your imagination to set a pattern of greatly enhanced ability.
It is now time to return to a normal waking consciousness. As you stretch your arms and legs, say to yourself, awake and alert, awake and alert. You are wide awake and full of new energy. Welcome back.

LESSON 1: Meditation - Peaceful Relaxation With Monroe Sound Science

N/A

====================

LESSON 1: Meditation - The House of Profound Relaxation With Monroe Sound Science

In this exercise, we will create a powerful resource that will allow us to access very deep levels of relaxation whenever we may need to do so. So just get comfortable and allow yourself to begin the process of noticing how you are now just noting the weight and shape of your body. You may want to do this exercise lying down or sitting up. If you're comfortable. It really doesn't matter. And as you do this, you may become aware of some part of your body that is less comfortable. And just for now, I would like you to do nothing more than notice that. 

Just relax with it, so to speak. And as you notice your body, its shape, its weight, its warmth. I invite you to just begin listening to the sounds around you. You can hear the music and my voice. And perhaps if you're very attentive, you can listen for the faintest sounds way off in the distance beyond the headphones. And if you haven't already, just take a nice, deep, easy breath. And as you exhale, allow those eyelids to close gently. And with your eyes closed, you can still be aware of the temperature of the air on your skin. 

And it becomes easier and easier to notice all those little sensations, thoughts, and feelings that lets you know more about letting go, allowing your body to take care of relaxing all by itself while your mind just drifts as if some part of your mind, the deeper part of your mind is calling you down to a place of ease, a place of quiet, calm, a place of rest where even the effort to tell which part of you is relaxing the most quickly or the most completely would be too much effort to even bother making. Almost as if comfort itself could flow through every part of you like a warm, soft, soothing liquid or light. Every muscle, every nerve soothed with every easy breath and every steady beat of your heart. Nothing to do, nothing to accomplish or make happen. Nobody needing or wanting anything from you, just time for you to let go a little more with every breath. And if that warm, soft, soothing comfort needs to linger on some part of your body that needs a little longer to unwind, well that's just fine, allowing your body and mind to find its own way in its own time. 

And now I invite you to use that part of your mind that you use when you dream, when you daydream, just to imagine that you're walking somewhere that you find really beautiful, maybe a forest trail or maybe some other kind of place, but somewhere outdoors where the sounds, the colors, the sense around you lets you know that you are safe. And as you walk easily, you may just begin to notice that you're carrying a small ruck sack, not uncomfortably heavy, just enough for you to notice. And for a while, you carry that quite happily. 

And now as you look up ahead, you notice something interesting. There is a house in the distance that just seems attractive to you in some way. Just in front of it, there is a bridge that crosses a small stream. In front of that, there is a figure waiting to greet you. The figure may appear as someone you know or someone you recognize from a story. Either way, they just feel very benign, very welcoming. They are smiling warmly. And somehow you begin to feel welcomed and drawn into the house beyond. And as you approach them, they take the ruck sack from you, and you instantly know that the bag contains all of the thoughts, feelings, and things that might distract you. 

They are taking them away. For now, you feel the relief of putting them down and cross the bridge. It may well seem to you that it's as if someone had built this house as a perfect retreat for you. Something about it just calls to you and soothes you. And as you open the door and step into the house, you feel a sense of rightness. Finding yourself in a light and airy hallway with a doorway on either side. Instinctively you choose the door that's right for you. Stepping inside, you see a large recliner and you take a seat realizing that you may never have felt so comfortable before every part of you begins to relax. As you begin to experience the settling of the weight of your body, feeling so supported by the chair, almost as if you were melting into the chair, every muscle beginning to let go at a pace that's just right for you. And with every breath in, it's as if you breathe in a little more comfort and ease. And with every breath out, it's as if you breathe out a little more discomfort. And you notice floating above you a ball of radiant energy that is the most calming color, just lazily floating. And as you take each breath in, it's as if you breathe this energy in. And every time you breathe out, you release a little more discomfort. 

And you can just imagine that energy filling every muscle, every nerve, every cell, allowing each and every one of them to relax. And it might feel as if this comfort was flowing directly from highest spirit. And you begin to notice that with every increase in relaxation, that you begin to feel a deeper and more vibrant energy. It's as if as you relax, every part of you is soothed and refreshed. And even those parts of you that are not quite ready to relax now are held and supported to carry this out at their own pace and in their own time. 

And now feeling refreshed and energized. You feel called to explore more of this wonderful space, this house of profound relaxation, which is yours to visit whenever you may need to. As you leave this wonderful room with its recliner and step into the hallway, you notice an open door in the distance with an entrancing sense of light in the sounds of nature, perhaps the scent of flowers coming through. And you decide to explore. As you step through the door, you enter into a beautiful walled garden. There is a seat in the full sun which you sit in. You feel almost as if you could absorb the energy of the gentle sunlight. The gentle breeze is soft and yet strangely soothing. And it may be that as you rest here in this sacred space, that new understandings, new energies and information, new guidance comes to you. This may be in words or it may just be a sense of knowing or a new feeling. This may turn up now, it may turn up later when you return maybe in a dream or a sudden thought, when you are relaxing. And as you come to look around the garden, you notice something that really captures your attention. This could be a particular flower or maybe a crystal or a stone. It could be almost anything that just calls to you, perhaps even a secret word, whispered on the breeze. 

And when you've heard this word or taken this object in your hands, you suddenly understand that this is a gift that you're going to take with you back to your everyday life. So if it's an object, you can just hold it to your heart and feel it, be absorbed. If it's a word, it can seem almost as if it sounds within your heart. And you know that when you return to normal waking awareness, you can just think of this word or imagine the presence of this object, and you will instantly reconnect with this sense of energy and relaxation here and allow that to flow into your daily life. And now it's time to return to normal waking awareness, bringing with you all the learnings and good feelings that you have gathered here. So you might want to take a few deeper breaths and feel yourself becoming refreshed, wide awake, alert and energized eyes, maybe just having a little stretch and wide awake now.

LESSON 2: Unlocking the Science of Sound Sleep
--------------------
<v ->Luigi, I want you to share what you shared</v> with me at breakfast the other morning about sleep opportunity time. It's an interesting concept that I don't think many people know about, and I surely didn't. My idea of a good night's sleep was eight hours, or is eight hours, so that means 11, I go to bed; 7, I wake up; there's my eight hours. But this concept says, oh, wait a minute, you might need more time because you're not fully utilizing that eight hours. So I just think there's so many people who don't really understand this concept. <v ->Yeah, and, and there's many concepts including that one</v> that we'll be exploring in this section. Sleep opportunity time is the amount of time that you spend in bed relative to the amount of time that you actually want to sleep because we don't fall asleep immediately. And in this section we're going to be exploring all different facets of sleep so that you can maximize your sleeping potential so you get that nice deep recovery rest in, in the night. And also to maximize your strategies in the daytime so that you can set up the night properly. And for about 50 years at the Monroe Institute, we've been helping people to get into deep restful states using our sound technology. So we're going to be using those tools as well. So dispelling myths about sleep and knowing how to maximize your sleeping potential is what we'll be exploring in this section. So let's talk about sleep. And if you fall asleep at any point in this session, then well done; give us a five star rating, and then come back to the video. I often work with people who have sleep problems, and it's very clear that most sleep problems have nothing at all to do with sleep. But lots of people experience sleep deprivation, and 40% of adults in the US report falling asleep during the day without intending to at least once a month. Do that behind the wheel in a microsleep, and you have a very permanent out-of-body experience. So giving yourself enough time to sleep and getting that deep rest is important. But oddly, whenever we try to sleep, we often struggle to do so. Why? Well, firstly, your body already knows how to fall asleep, and you don't need to try to sleep. Trying to sleep is a contradiction. What's the difference between a good sleeper and a bad sleeper? The bad sleeper will tell you everything they need to do to fall asleep, all the routines and issues, the temperature of the room, the candles that they have to light, whatever chamomile tea they were drinking, and so on. If you ask a good sleeper, they won't have a clue how they fell asleep. They just do it. And that's because sleep is an unconscious process driven by systems that don't need your conscious mind to engage in. You worked out how to do it while you were still in the womb. Just think of a pet going to sleep or an infant. They don't have to work out how they do it; they just do it. Often what causes sleep issues is that we take the busy mind from the day and then suddenly tell it to stop. And that isn't going to work for most people. It's an unconscious activity in which your body and mind reset, detoxify, and rejuvenate. You just need to trust the unconscious part of you and let it do the work for you. So don't micromanage your unconscious mind; delegate. Now, I do want to add that there's been a recent surge in interest and education about sleep, and I have to thank all of those authors who've written extensively about it for giving me much therapy business - because now everybody is extremely anxious about sleep and whether they're getting enough of it. And we know now that chronic shift workers are significantly more likely to die early, as are people who get less than six hours of sleep per night. So stressing about sleep is going to affect sleep and then your general quality of life. So instead in this session, we'll be using guided meditation to help you take your mind off the topic of trying to sleep. And at Monroe, we've been helping people to sleep for about 50 years. So we know that the audio mixes are very supportive of deep rest, using refreshing delta frequencies. And even when you don't completely fall asleep, you'll get that refreshing recharge. So let me say something about sleep in general. The amount or quality of sleep that we actually need for the brain and body to repair every night is different and is often overlooked by most people. There's a massive effect of getting good quality sleep on daily functioning, on memory, on mood, and just general energy activity levels. So while we're going to be doing meditations that take us into the night and doing some dream planning, it's also important to be able to get a good night's sleep so that you optimize the physical and mental recovery that sleep gives you since you spend a third of your life asleep. And this is where the brain gets most of its recovery. And the nighttime is sort of divided into two segments of sleeping styles. One is non-REM sleep which is often very delta rich, and the other is REM sleep which is predominantly theta. And the brain cycles between these two throughout the night, but it does so asynchronously. So at the beginning of the nighttime, you spend a lot of your time in non-REM or deeper delta sleep, and that's where most of the physical recovery takes place, where you, you, where your heart rate slows down, and the memories pass from the short term memory stores, mainly in the hippocampi, to longer term areas in the cortex. So starting from the front of the head and working its way backwards, a delta pulse ripples through the brain so that all your neurons are sort of singing in harmony, and it's passing the short term memories to the longer term memory stores in the cortex. So your brain is really clearing the day's debris and going through your memories of the day and saying, "Okay, what do I need to keep? What do I need to discard?" And then with what it keeps, it starts to build new connections, and then it starts to go into REM sleep. So when you go into REM sleep or rapid eye movement sleep which is usually at the end of every sleep cycle, then this is the bit where your brain really starts to do something interesting because this is the time when we're usually dreaming. So while that's taking place, the brain is also consolidating memory and building new connections, new interconnections between brain regions so that they can look at whatever memories or whatever issues or emotions you're working on during the day. And it starts to build new bridges, new connections, allowing different parts of the brain to have a look at those memories and do something with them, which makes it a very creative state. And we can actually access that for problem solving as well. But the main thing is that the first half of the night you get recovery sleep. The second half of the night you're getting this REM-rich memory and emotion processing, which is facilitating psychological recovery. Onto bodily recovery, first off, human growth hormone is released during delta sleep. So your nails grow, your hair grows, and the cuts and bruises repair themselves. Your body does a lot of clearing out and internal repair work, and it just flushes all things that it doesn't need out of the system. So that's happening in Delta. So when we're working with sleep, and especially when doing dream work, we don't want to interfere too much with the first half of the night because it's important that you get refreshing restorative sleep in the first half. So just to talk a little bit about sleep cycles. So when you start from waking, you go into this drowsy state, which we normally just fly right through, and we go into non-REM sleep, and the scientists who labeled these states weren't particularly imaginative. So when we talk about non-REM sleep, we're talking about stages one, two and, wait for it, three. Sometimes people talk about stage four, but now stages three and four have mostly been merged. And basically as you go up the numbers, it's harder to wake somebody up from this type of sleep. So stage one is very light, stage two, a little bit deeper, and then three and four, you're really starting to get into deeper restorative delta sleep. And it's pretty tricky to wake somebody up from stage three sleep. And if you wake them up during that time, they will definitely not thank you for it. So that's when the recovery takes place; in the first half of the night, you spend a significant portion of the first cycle in this deep delta stage, and that is where a lot of the recovery takes place. And then you start coming out of that cycle into REM sleep, and the proportion shifts throughout the night. So this is a typical 90-minute sleep cycle, and usually some people differ, but the typical pattern is 90 minutes. And then you go into this REM sleep very briefly in the first part of the night, and this is dream rich, but lasts only for a few minutes, five minutes or so in the first cycle, and then you drop back down. But throughout the night you don't drop as deeply. So as you go through these stages throughout the night, so stage one, two, and three, and then you come back into REM, and then you go back down again, this is going to change in proportion throughout the night. So you spend more time in the second half in REM. And in between sleep cycles you have micro-awakenings. And this is a brief period where you wake up after a sleep cycle, and most of the time we don't remember that. We just wake up; we just roll our eyes; we look around kind of disoriented, and we go back to sleep. And that tends to be the pattern. But when we're using these meditations to prepare for the night, you might start to notice the micro-awakenings a bit more because we're going to be working on building awareness during the daytime in some of these meditations in this Quest, and then we're going to be taking that into the night. So some parts of us are going to be a little bit more awake and alert. And so you might notice that your sleep is a little bit more fragmented, that you're consciously noticing how it's split up and divided a little bit more. And that doesn't take anything away from the quality of sleep. Quite the opposite. It actually means that you're building up brain areas that are typically very passive. You're still going to get very good restful sleep, but you might become more aware of those short periods while you're normally awake. And in the out-of-body section, harnessing the mind-awake, body- asleep state is a desired outcome for initiating those experiences. So people often ask, "How long should I sleep? What's a normal sleep time?" Well, the recommended time is about eight hours. That's what the WHO recommends, but everybody's different, and eight hours doesn't actually correspond to any sleep cycles which are around 90 minutes in length. So you should be looking at seven and a half hours or nine hours, and it's really how you feel when you wake up in the morning. So if you can't function in the morning unless you have a cup of coffee or a cup of tea, then that's a good sign that you're not getting enough sleep. So really start playing with that. If you start using caffeine to keep yourself awake in the morning and if you can't function after being awake for around three hours, then you are probably sleep deprived, and you're self-medicating with caffeine. Caffeine is not a food supplement, and I don't want to knock it. I love coffee. I have an Italian background. So when I was born, I was given breast milk followed by a shot of espresso. So just be aware that what you're doing here is taking away sleep pressure because caffeine blocks the neurotransmitter which actually puts you to sleep. So when you wake up, immediately upon waking a neurotransmitter called adenosine starts to build gradually in your brain, and it will continue to do that throughout the day until you start getting sort of into the late evening. And that starts to build up some pressure called sleep pressure that is so great that you start to feel sleepy, start to feel tired, and that's when you start going to sleep. And when you sleep, adenosine rushes into the binding sites in the brain, puts you to sleep, and those levels then drop. It resets the clock. So in the morning, adenosine levels are virtually nil or negligible, and then you start your day again, and it starts to build up again. Well, what caffeine does is that it blocks the receptor sites in the brain for adenosine. So just think of like a lock and key. If adenosine as a key wants to enter and open the door so that you can fall asleep, but caffeine has already put a key in the door, then it can't do that. So you don't have that sleep pressure. You might feel really tired but unable to actually initiate sleep. And that's a very typical thing. Since this session has the goal of raising your awareness of all aspects of yourself, I invite you to notice your patterns in your daily physical life so that you know how you function, and what you do in the day, how it influences how you function in the night. I'd also like to talk about boundaries which are really important for establishing good sleep routines. You might have heard about sleep hygiene, avoiding blue light and stimulating videos, games and substances before bed. Those are interesting but are mostly obvious to people who struggle to sleep. What I noticed as a therapist during the pandemic was that many more people were suffering from stress and anxiety that wasn't directly connected to fears about the virus. Instead, more people were working from home and especially from their places of rest. So people would reply to emails and be connected to work all day long. And this also included the bedroom. So the first thing that people did in the morning was check their devices, typically their phones, for messages, and the last thing they did at night was check their devices for messages. And this disrupted a boundary. It means that some people have no wind-down time in their homes, no clear boundary between work time and leisure time. And this makes its way into the night, resulting in disturbed sleep. So if there's one simple thing that you can do from this session, it's establish clear areas and times in your home for work and rest and avoid contaminating the bedroom which should only be used for sleep and sex and preferably not at the same time. If something work related pops into your head in bed and won't go away, get up; leave the room; go to your work area, and take care of the task there. As I've said, for sleep, you need to be down in those restorative delta frequencies, and thinking about a task is moving you up into beta which is in the opposite direction. And I'd just like to mention something about setting alarms in the morning. An alarm by its very definition is an anxious awareness of danger. So waking up alarmed is not particularly healthy for dream recall, for lucid dreaming, and just general sleep hygiene and daily functioning. It's absolutely fine to have an alarm, but set the alarm sound so that it's something that very gently ramps up so that you are waking up very slowly, very gently, in a peaceful state. We offer a meditation that you can use for this purpose. The invitation is to wake up gently and to take this attitude into the daytime so that you're going to function a bit better and have a better mood as well. So please enjoy a good night's rest, and feel free to try the meditations during the daytime because getting rest in the day is also very beneficial, especially when it's in the early afternoon. So this is a simple task that you can use to help establish good sleep routine. And it's called keeping a yawn journal. So note down the times in the day when you yawn in clusters, so a series of yawning. And you'll notice that they happen around every 90 minutes, and you can use this to time your bedtime. So for best effects, do this over four days, and as much as possible avoid stimulants. So if you've ever found yourself just nodding off in front of the TV, and then you think, "Okay, I'd better go to bed," but by the time you complete your bedtime routine and get into bed, you're no longer sleepy. Well, that's because what's actually happening is that you're coming out of your down and starting to move towards your peak activation - because every 90 minutes of the day we're either on the up or on the way down in our energy activation. And this is called the ultradian rhythm. And what you want to do is time it so that you're just coming out of your peak activation when you start your bedtime routine so that you can slip smoothly into sleep when you're in bed. If you are ever struggling with jet lag, you need to remember two simple principles to reset your body clock to the new time zone. The first is to receive light through your eyes at the time relative to your destination. In other words, if you're on a plane and it's nighttime at your destination, then block out the light in the plane using a good sleep mask. Conversely, let light in if it's morning at your destination. And when you get to your destination, try to grab as much morning light as possible. Secondly, eat relative to your destination. So if the plane food is brought to you at 2:00 AM relative to your destination, turn it away. Just don't eat it. Light, especially early in the day, and food help to reset your body clock. So for your actions of today, listen to the Monroe Sound Science audios associated with this session, and perhaps practice keeping that yawn journal. Please know that we have added a variety of meditations to help you improve sleep, improve your relationship to sleep, and to have more meaningful conscious connections to your dreams. Feel free to take your time to experience the meditations at your own pace. A good place to start is with the ones that are most relevant to you today.

====================

LESSON 2: Meditation - Profound Sleep With Monroe Sound Science

- Allow your eyes to close and be as lazy as you want to be in this exercise, make yourself comfortable by either sitting or lying down. Invite any distractions to just move into the background because whatever we pay attention to becomes the foreground. So simply pay attention to the gentle rhythm of your breathing and have the intention that you'll allow yourself to gently rest in this exercise because this is your time. And just notice the movements of your breath, and perhaps make the next easy breath. Move a little bit deeper than the last breath, and just think about the word, relax, and allow the word relax to move down from your head and deep into your lungs, and then to spread through all parts of your body as you breathe out. Just take a few more breaths in this way, and if your mind starts to wander, that's all right, because there's nothing that you have to do or accomplish right now if you lose track of what I'm saying or you fall asleep at any point during this exercise, that's also fine. Notice if you're holding your breath or forcing it, or if you're feeling like you're just trying too hard, soften your focus and remember that gentle breath, and allow the tones to wash over you and just become more curious about what kind of feeling you can create with your imagination. That will tell you more about letting go. So I'll stay quiet now while you rest and explore this place of ease and comfort.

====================

LESSON 2: Meditation - Returning to Deep Sleep With Monroe Sound Science

Allow yourself to be gently guided by the sound of my voice and by the soothing tones in the background as you ease yourself into a state of comfortable, of deep and restful sleep. As you settle into the bed, take a moment to simply listen to the sounds around you, whatever they may be, whether they're sweet melodies of bird song, where the distant hum of traffic or any other sounds that a household makes. Let them be without judgment. And as you do so, become aware of how your body rests effortlessly on the bed, giving your weight to the bed as you take a few slow deep breaths, feeling the weight and warmth of your eyes resting in their sockets and allowing everything to be exactly as it is without any effort to change it. Now I invite you to notice something perhaps a bit unusual. Can you identify which part of your body feels the most comfortable right now? And it might be a toe or your tummy or those hands were simply the rhythm of your breathing. And as you notice that, imagine discomfort as a gentle mist or a soothing light flowing effortlessly around your body, easing any discomfort it encounters. 

Feel the warmth of the covers embracing you with no demands or expectations from the outside world. In this moment, allow each part of your body to find its own space to relax. Gradually unwinding and releasing With every breath, and with your eyes closed, it's easier to tune into the subtle thoughts, feelings, and sensations. Thus signal the process of letting go. And using the same part of your mind that you use when daydreaming. Recall a time when you felt deeply relaxed. And if no specific memory comes to mind, just think about a tranquil place that brings you peace, whether real or imaginary. Whether you see this place vividly or simply sense its presence, let it envelop you in its serenity. You might feel the warmth of the sun on your skin, the gentle rustle of the wind or the fragrance of wild flowers. Whatever brings you comfort, allow yourself to drift further into relaxation. Notice how perceptions effortlessly emerge in your mind. Like fleeting glimpses before sleep takes over an apple on a plate, a car moving past you. Doesn't matter. As you continue to be cocooned in this state of tranquility, let my voice and the background sounds soothe you, guiding you gently into a peaceful slumber, relax, surrender, and allow sleep to guide you in its comforting, embrace. 

And you might think about specific things in your mind. Doesn't matter what they are, A cat lounging lazily in the sun is far gently illuminated by golden rays in the background. The steady hum of a plane as it floats overhead, blending seamlessly with a bubbling of a stream flowing nearby as you allow your mind to wander amidst these images and sounds, I'm reminded of a story about someone I knew once, but there's no need for conscious effort to follow along. Your unconscious mind is perfectly capable of absorbing every word effortlessly. This individual shared a valuable insight while helping the child drift off to sleep. Have you ever tried desperately not to think of something like a pink elephant? It's an exercise in futility for the mind cannot simply erase what it wishes to forget. Instead, they discovered the power of distraction, not by ignoring, but by redirecting attention to something captivating. And similarly, you can transport yourself to a memory of deep relaxation tuning into its soothing frequency like a tranquil radio station. Let the pleasant scene quiet your mind, allowing it to help you forget the need to be aware or unaware of anything at all. 

There's a part of your mind perhaps nestled in the back, gently beckoning you to ease into a state of rest where even the effort to discern which limb is the most relaxed may seem too trivial to bother with. So now with your mind drifting along without a specific destination, you can allow the rest of this meditation to help you surrender to sleep. Or perhaps you prefer to save that journey for later. Either way, knowing and trusting that all is perfectly fine, allow yourself now to drift into the embrace of sleep carried effortlessly by the currents of relaxation and tranquility.

====================

LESSON 2: Meditation - Mindful Dreaming

<silence> 

Move yourself into the most comfortable position for you on your back or on your side, whatever is best for you, free of any obvious points of strain. And with your eyes closed, take in a deep breath and then exhale slowly. Next, take in another deep breath, a bit deeper than the last one, and let it out a little bit more slowly than the last out breath. And just offering and surrendering your weight to the mattress, to the support beneath you. Allow it to support you and tuning into that sense of being fully supported right now. Now bring your awareness to the present moment, noticing any sounds in your environment, in the background without judgment. Just allowing them to simply come and go, like waves on the shore or clouds floating in the sky. And you might notice some thoughts or concerns about the day, or things that happened in the past, or there might be thoughts about the future. And you can just watch them. And when you are ready, just let them go. Let them drift away gently focusing on the sensation of your breath, moving in and out of your body. 

And with your next breath, imagine breathing in a sense of curiosity and openness within yourself. Because in this meditation, you are about to embark on a journey into the realm of dreams where anything and everything is possible. And perhaps you can begin to feel some of that wonder and excitement arising within you now, wondering what you will uncover and learn as you explore the inner landscapes of your mind. So let your mind simply float and drift, allowing your gaze to soften even behind your eyelids, to notice much more of the edges of your perception. To let the eyes rest gently in an open focus. And now begin to bring your attention to the space between waking and sleeping, known as the hypnogogic. State, the threshold where waking and dreaming consciousness meets. Notice. And be curious about any sensations or images that arise in this borderland space, observing them with a sense of calm, detachment, and gentle curiosity. As you witness whatever arises, allow yourself to remain present and aware. Notice the subtle transitions between waking and dreaming, observing the soft and gentle flow of your awareness as it moves between states. Allowing yourself to sink deeper into this state of relaxed awareness. Just letting go. 

Allow yourself to become fully immersed in the sensations of the present moment, surrendering to the ebb and flow of your own inner landscape. Not forcing or changing it, just observing. And if any vivid perceptions arise, any images or sounds, sensations, emotions, movement, just allow all of that to be there, acknowledging them lightly, and then allowing them to unfold naturally without resistance, all flow smoothly. In and out of your experience, in and out of your spacious open mind. And now setting a specific intention. Know that you are always in control of your own awareness and your own experience. You have the power to navigate dream states with awareness and intention, saying in your mind, saying to yourself, I trust the wisdom of my subconscious mind. I am open to this connection with my subconscious, and I ask for its help in consciously and safely navigating the landscapes of my dreams. Now, as you drift even deeper, even more into this state of hypnagogic, mindfulness, feel a sense of appreciation and admiration for the incredible gift of dreaming. Know that each dream is an opportunity for self-discovery and accelerated personal growth. Every dream opens you to a world of infinite possibilities. So when you are ready, set an intention for what you would like to explore in your dreams. A gentle offering to your subconscious. 

Allow yourself to surrender completely to sleep. Trust the wisdom and support of your subconscious mind as you journey deeper into the realm of dreaming. Be curious, explore, dream.

LESSON 3: Stellar Focus: Strategies for Clarity and Concentration
--------------------
<v ->So the next topic we're going to talk about is focus.</v> And I think it's so misunderstood because it's not like we live life in a vacuum. We are completely bombarded by stimuli. We are living an engaged life, and the definition of focus is so tightly defined that it almost makes it impossible to meet the definition. And I think that's an important thing people need to know about. <v ->Yeah, I think so too.</v> When people talk about focus, what they really bring to mind is this idea of having a laser focus absent from anything else that's going on in the background. But the Zen master Hakuin said that meditation in the midst of activity is a thousand times more powerful than meditation in solitude. And this is a facet of that, being able to bring out of the background something that you can focus on in the foreground that's supported by what's going on around you, so you don't have to isolate yourself. And we're going to be exploring a broader focus and a more narrow focus in this section so that you can maximize your ability to stay on a particular task. So in this session we'll be talking about focus. And I'd like to begin with a question. So focus on this. What is the enemy of focus? Forcefulness, trying too hard. The enemy of a naturally relaxed and sustainable focus is forcefulness. And there are several facets to what I mean by that. The first is that when you try to force yourself to focus on a particular object, task, or goal, you often create mental resistance. You're dragging your brainwaves into higher beta, and that's not a useful concentration band. And your mind might begin to push back against being compelled in a certain direction. It's not where it naturally wants to move, so it makes it harder to concentrate on the task at hand. And this resistance can result in distractions and decreased productivity. Also, focus is not static, but it's actually a process. So when you try to have hyperfocus, what you're really trying to do is learn how to reset your focus on a task as quickly as possible without grasping at it. And here we can take a principle from the martial art aikido which also involves helping you find your center. And Ueshiba was once asked by a student, "Master, how do you never lose your center?" And he replied, "I lose it all the time. I'm just faster at finding it again than you are." So it's about resetting your focus repeatedly, and you might relate to this, but when I used to focus on a task and my mind wandered, I used to beat myself up about it in some way because I became distracted. And yet that added a whole new level of distraction because then I was thinking about why I had become distracted and possibly trying to work out what was wrong with me. I created a narrative of some kind of personal failure. So this approach actually increases stress and anxiety which narrows focus in an unproductive way because now I'm also preoccupied with the pressure that I'm putting on myself. And it also makes me too focused on a specific outcome which I'm telling myself needs to be achieved in a specific way. And the brain is processing a vast amount of data, much more than we are consciously aware of. Some of that must sometimes breach into conscious awareness. And we often treat this as if it's a sign of weak focus rather than normal functioning. And what this does is that it reduces the creative potential of your mind to conjure unexpected insights and creative solutions to the task that you're focusing on. Many creative solutions, inventions, insights have come to people who've allowed their minds to wander after they've focused on a task. Think for example, of Kekule and his discovery of the structure of benzene when he was just gently dozing off by a fireplace. And pushing yourself to achieve a hard focus can actually lead to burnout or mental fatigue which has been shown to significantly reduce focus. So essentially your brain is hyperaroused with high beta frequencies, and this means that your thinking will become narrow and inflexible. And this in turn means that whatever you're trying to focus on just doesn't feel enjoyable. And if it's not enjoyable or fun in some particular way, then studies show that attention and focus drops off considerably. But instead, if your mind wanders and you keep resetting your focus in a relaxed, open way with gentle persistence, that frequency interval of drifting and coming back to the task or objects gets shorter because it's not a static thing. So you start to notice when your mind has drifted, and you gently return it to center, gently back on the task. And sustained focus of around 15 seconds starts to build momentum to the point where it becomes self-sustaining. So focus is something that you do rather than something that you have. And as such, it's a trainable skill. And that's what we'll be training in the meditations in this session. And being able to maintain our focus in a way that is sustainable is a life-changing skill. It actually brings more enjoyment in life because it leads to deeper appreciation of where we are, it helps us to make more centered and present decisions, and it enhances our learning potential. I want to say that culturally we are trained into a narrow and grasping object or pointed focus which produces those higher beta frequencies in the brain. And this switches on the sympathetic nervous system. And so the fight or flight and stress and anxiety response. So how can we do things differently? We need to understand that we develop our focus through applying the three aspects of mindfulness, and those are one, present moment awareness so that we know where we are, what physical and mental resources we have available in the here and now in this moment, and an awareness of the task or the object itself. Two, understanding of purpose. So you might want to explore the session on problem solving and do the first meditation before exploring these meditations. Because if we don't know why we're doing something, why we're trying to focus on something, then the task immediately becomes meaningless. So what I invite you to do here is consider if what you're trying to focus on aligns with a bigger picture view of how you want to be in your life right now. Are you focusing on a task because you want to or because you have to? Is the motivation of the task dependent on your own inner wants and needs, or is it based on receiving some external reward? Because again, countless studies have shown that focus drops off significantly when it's based on rewards that are extrinsic, so external, rather than intrinsic self-motivated or belonging to your true nature. And three, heedfulness, and heedfulness essentially means paying close attention to what you're doing. So it's essentially resetting our attention, and it is done by gentle persistence. And by doing that, we develop our focus. And in a typical breath awareness meditation, for instance, you start by noticing the breath and maybe you drop in a count before or after that breath, and then when the mind wanders, because that's what it does, that's what minds do, we might beat ourselves up and say, "Oh no, get back to the breath." But just notice what's happened. A part of you has noticed that you wandered, that your mind drifted, and this is the mental muscle that we want to train. So the more you do it, the faster you notice when you drifted, and you reset the focus back on the task. So when we are trying to focus our attention, we need to have reference to two dimensions of awareness. The first of these is breadth of awareness. The second is a central point of focus. So within our field of awareness, there are always these two dimensions, a central focus that occupies the foreground, so to speak, what we're paying attention to. And then there is also an awareness of the background. And in terms of brain functioning, the left hemisphere of the brain will focus on objects in the foreground, in the detail, in the concepts. And your right hemisphere will be more aware of the background, the periphery, the flow of experience. And as you listen to these meditations, you can become aware of my voice and the words I'm saying. And you'll also be aware of the sensations in the body, maybe aware of the music and the brainwave entrainment frequencies in the background. And maybe you can even become aware of the space around you, faint sounds from outside and in other parts of wherever you are, sounds from other parts of your environment. It could be traffic noise or whatever, but most of your awareness hopefully will be on what I'm saying. And to develop open focus is very beneficial in this way. It is a wonderful space to be in because open focus helps us to stimulate the parasympathetic nervous system, the rest and digest system. It helps us to relax and become much calmer and enter states of flow which carries a sense of effortlessness, enjoyment and deep concentration. It is much less reactive to whatever the content of our experience may be in the foreground so that we can view clearly what is in the foreground and not be triggered by that. If there is a thought or a sensation, we can choose how to respond to it, to go deeper into it or to just let it pass out of awareness on its own. And this is actually very easy to do and something that you've probably done before. People often do this when they're out in nature without really thinking about it. They just sit and listen to the sound of the sea or the forest, taking in the sunlight, whatever. And once we've explored this broad or open focus, we will apply this in establishing and strengthening a particular focus on an object. And the Monroe sound science frequencies will be there in the background to help support this more centered or pointed focus. So let's first establish the base and then laser in. So enjoy exploring and training your focus on something that you actually want to do. If you find your mind wandering, just know that a wandering mind is natural and actually part of a creative learning process. However, we want to train the mind to gently and repeatedly reset. So when you find that you're focusing on a task or an object and your mind drifts, notice that it drifted, and gently bring it back to the task or object without making an additional story about it having drifted. Returning to the task is the natural mental muscle that we want to train. And doing this repeatedly will build a self-sustaining momentum so that this resetting happens faster each time. So for your actions of today, listen to any of the Monroe sound science meditations associated with this session so that you develop your focus, and then you explore broadening your focus and then narrowing your focus. Please know that we've added a variety of meditations to help you improve your focus, and there are low beta frequencies, which are excellent for focusing, embedded in the signal mixes. Feel free to take your time and experience the meditations at your own pace. And a good place to start is with the ones that are most relevant to you today.

LESSON 3: Meditation - Exploring Pointed Focus

<silence> 

So now just set yourself up in a comfortable position, sitting reasonably upright If you need to, you can also lie down. But remember, the intention and invitation here is to stay wide awake. Take a moment now to just settle into your experience. The point here is to sense your experience rather than analyze or understand it. That work can more effectively be done outside of the meditation space. Notice the weight and shape of your body as you rest there. Listen to the sounds of the music as if you are trying to listen to the faintest sound in that space that you can find. So for the moment, just letting everything be as it is, and just notice how you are in this moment, whether your body is hot, cool, comfortable, or uncomfortable. And for now, just letting it be, noticing your general mood. Mad, bad, glad, or sad as they say, understanding you aren't doing anything wrong, just letting it be. For now. You may even get a sense of the space around you as you notice the temperature of the air on your skin. 

Now, just have the intention to soften any obvious tension, to do your best, to relax as much as you can right now. And as we go on, you can allow the meditation to just take care of relaxing and soothing you. Now it's time to set our intention, which is to connect with and explore our experience of the breath, to create a strong and flexible focus. The essence of this practice is to make resetting our intention to our object of focus. In this case, the breath, a natural and automatic action. You may just say to yourself in your mind, the breath, and notice whatever you first notice about the breath. 

This could be the feeling of the air entering the nose, or the rise and fall of the chest, or even the sound of your own breathing. Just placing our attention there. And we can mark each breath with a count just quietly in our mind, witnessing the breath. And just as we feel the end of each out breath, we can lightly drop in the count. So breathe in. Breathe out. Count one, breathe in. Breathe out. Count two, breathe in. Breathe out. Count three, continue in this way until you reach 10. Then start again at one. Don't worry if you find yourself at 300 or thinking about work or anything else. As soon as you notice this, you can just start again by going back to one. If your mind is very busy, you can just say in your mind with each breath, breathing in and breathing out. It doesn't matter how often this happens, just resetting with a kind and gentle persistence. I'll be quiet now for a while so that you can gently with the practice. As you continue to do this, you might begin to notice subtler aspects of your experience of breathing. And now just relax back into a more broadly based focus. Notice the sounds in the background. Notice your body, the temperature of the air. You may notice more relaxation and clarity. 

And now just strengthen your intention by just saying quietly in your mind, the breath and just reintroduce the count. And you may be surprised to notice how satisfying it can be to maintain this steady, aware focus. Watching the breath can feel like watching the waves roll up the shore and wash steadily back into the sea. Or like watching the steady flow of a river, letting your mind naturally become absorbed in the experience. And now it's time to bring the practice to a close so you can just include more awareness of your surroundings. Maybe take a few deeper breaths and gently roll your shoulders, open your eyes and stay still for a moment. Just letting the light flood you with energy and setting the practice down now and reengaging with whatever comes next for you.

====================

LESSON 3: Meditation - Exploring Open Focus

As you begin this meditation, move yourself into a comfortable position, preferably seated. But if you need to lie down, you certainly can just remember that the invitation here is to stay awake, do your best to ensure that you won't be interrupted. But if you are, that's all right. Just return to the guidance in a gentle way. So now I invite you to simply get comfortable and to have the attitude of allowing everything to be as it is. There's nothing to accomplish, nothing to achieve, just an open and curious awareness. And what I invite you to do is just listen very intently to the sounds in the background, listening as if you were trying to hear something very faint and far away. And as you do that now, include in the activity of attending to this moment, to the sensations of your body's weight and shape, noticing where it's comfortable and where not so comfortable. 

There's no need to try and relax anything in a conscious or willful way for the next few moments. You can just allow your body to tell you how it's feeling without reacting, just allowing that this is your experience now. And as you do that, you may become aware of the sense of faint light coming through your eyelids. Likewise, you can become aware of the temperature of the air on your skin. And even with your eyes closed, you may have a sense of the space around you. And of course, you can become aware of the breath flowing in and out of your body. And we are simply witnessing that breath, however it is not controlling it. Now, as you pay attention to all of these sensations, you may also notice how thoughts can flow through your mind. Thoughts about whether or not you're doing it right, thoughts about your day. Likewise, you can become aware of emotions as they rise and fall. And again, my invitation to you is to just let them be again, just let them be a part of the experience. Somewhere in the midst of all these elements of your experience, sense, impressions, feelings, and thoughts, there will be something that is naturally in the foreground of your experience. It could be a particular sound, or perhaps just the way one hand feels resting in your lap. 

It doesn't matter what it is. Just get that sense of where awareness wants to naturally rest. Just allow the foreground of your experience to include elements from the background, gently broadening that awareness, including any experience in the periphery. And if the foreground should change, that's fine. Just noticing that you are aware, just resting as awareness itself. And in a moment, there will be an extended period where I'll be quiet and you can just rest in awareness supported by the frequencies. If during this practice you find yourself distracted to the point where you forget what you're doing, that's fine. Begin again. Listen, sense, allow. And now it is time to return to normal awareness. Take a few deeper breaths, move gently and mindfully, bringing awareness back into your body, into the awareness of your broader environment. And maybe just wriggle a bit. And when you're ready, open your eyes as you explore the rest of your day.

====================

LESSON 3: Meditation - Stellar Focus With Sound Wave Frequencies

- In this exercise, we are going to use the very traditional subject of the breath to learn how to develop natural and sustainable focus. Everything that we learn here can be transferred and applied to any situation where we may be needing and effective and sustainable focus. The most common problem when it comes to focus is people being too forceful. And so the most important thing we need when developing a natural and sustainable focus is to relax. Trying to force the mind is always counterproductive. The other thing that can really help us is to be a little more deliberate. So let's break this process down into three phases. Phase one is preparation. Phase two is engagement, and phase three is release. So let's prepare making sure that you're comfortable and that you're not going to be disturbed. Make sure your head and hands are supported and then have the intention to be reasonably still. We need to welcome each new sensation and recognize it before we decide how to respond to it. So obviously, if your leg is cramping, then move, but don't just react. Move with a gentle deliberation. So now let's begin. I would suggest you have your eyes closed, but it really doesn't matter too much. If you choose to have your eyes open, then just pick an uninteresting spot somewhere in front of you and rest your gaze there. Now I would like you to make your awareness as broad as possible. And by that I mean notice as of your sensory inputs as possible. So start by listening to the sounds around you. And I'd invite you at first just to listen to the sounds around you, listening really, really intently. And as you listen, you can feel your weight and shape in the chair or bed. You can really just rest, just giving your weight to the chair or bed, allowing yourself to be supported. Just noticing how you are noticing if there's any tension, and just looking for an attitude of allowing everything to be as it is. Even that tension and perhaps noticing where you are most comfortable and just allowing ourselves to be however we are. So just resting in that comfort and that ease. Noticing if a particular sensation, like the weight and warmth of your hands or the breath or the hum of an air conditioning unit is the natural center to your experience. Just resting there for a moment And then we're just going to decide to use the breath. The breath is a great subject for meditation because it's always present. So you can just begin to notice the experience of breathing. Breathing in, breathing out, and noticing as much as you can about the quality of the experience or noticing whether your breath is shallow or deep. And it's fine. Whatever it is, is just fine. Just wherever you feel that breath coming in, where it ends. A sense of the exhalation coming to an end, noticing every sensation you can find that's connected. Breathing in, breathing out the way the tummy muscles move, the way your chest rises and falls the temperature of the air in the room. You can, if your mind's really busy, just say in as you're breathing, in and out, as you're breathing out, breathing in, breathing out. And you can allow the tones and the music in the background to support that so that everything just becomes part of the breath. So we started with a broad experience with, and we still have some of that. And in the very center of it, this very particular focus on breathing. So we're not trying to push anything away, just noticing how the muscles move with the breath. Now see where the breath is in the body. See how long or short the breaths are, and any time your mind wanders, just bringing it back to the breath, You can if you want, do this. It's a very traditional thing to do. Just drop in a count at the end of each breath, breathing in, breathing out, just as you feel that last exhalation, that last bit of air leaving you just dropping in the count of one. Breathing in, breathing out. Count two, breathe in, breathe out. Count three, breathe in, breathe out. You can carry on this way until you get to seven, and then just return to one. If at any point you lose count or you're thinking about anything else or fall asleep, it doesn't really matter, just begin again and say in your mind the breath, go back to one, breathe in, breathe out, count one. Now we can slightly change the focus and we can just count before the next breath, which might sound like it's exactly the same place, but it really isn't. Breathing in, breathing out. And then just as you notice the body calling for breath, count one, fully experience the breath, experiencing the out breath. Just as you notice the body about to call for air Count two and so on to a count of seven and back to one. And I will be quiet now to allow you to practice in this way for a little longer. Then you'll hear a bell to conclude the meditation. So now as you hear the final bell drop away, before you move, just take a moment to consciously and deliberately release the practice. Maybe take a few deep breaths and just softly roll your shoulders and gently move your body. Just reconnecting your awareness and then think about what you're going to do next and looking forward to being active again, getting very clear about what your task is. And if you have a question or problem that you'd like to place this focus on, then you can do so now, or you can just look forward to fully engaging with whatever comes next in your day. Welcome back.

====================

LESSON 3: Meditation - Flow State Meditation With Gamma Frequencies

- This meditation is designed to take you beyond the normal experience of the five senses. It is designed to allow your consciousness to expand. The tones in the music will really support you to reach new levels of experience. But to get the best from this, you need to set a clear intention. And generally speaking, the kind of intentions that work well for an exercise like this one are either an intention to explore some aspect of yourself or to be open to receive new knowledge from the deepest part of your true nature. So you might simply have the intention of setting a question and asking to be shown something. For example, you might set the intention of, show me what I most need to know for my highest good. Or you may wish to cultivate a particular quality. So you could have an intention to relax really deeply or to experience deep, calm, and vibrant energy. So you might want to take a few moments and pause the exercise now and just write down your intention or say it out loud. So this meditation will help you to go beyond the senses, not by withdrawing from them, but by bringing them alive with the aware sensitivity that is your real intelligence, your real nature, allowing that to bring you new information. In order to do that, you have to set aside your ideas of what you already know and be open to receive new information. And this exercise begins with what's called coming to your senses. And we use that to build on our normal range of sensory experience by connecting with a wonderful sense of energy in the body, which is the most vibrant part of our experience. And you can notice this by paying attention to your physical body. Often people think that the physical body has an energy body, but it's actually the other way around. Your being is primarily energy and awareness, and I would recommend that you do this exercise sitting up comfortably. But if you have back trouble or need to lie down, that's fine, but just remember the invitation here is to be awake. This is very much about being receptive and allowing the tones and your intention to guide the unfolding of your experience in the present moment. So now just taking time to get comfortable to make sure you're not going to be disturbed. So just feel your weight in the chair if you're sitting, if you're lying, just feeling the weight and shape of your body, getting a general sense, relaxed or not, there's no need to try to change anything just yet. Just allowing yourself to be exactly as you are. Noticing your mood, noticing whether your mind is clear and bright, or if it's dull and it doesn't really matter which of those it may be. Just listening really intently as if you're trying to hear the stars turn in the sky, listening to the tones and the sounds. Maybe even hearing sound beyond that, it doesn't matter whether you do or you don't intend to listen carefully. And as you do that, noticing again, the weight and the shape of your body, the sense of weight of isness in your body, allowing the weight to go down through your seat, perhaps being aware of where your hands are and how they feel, the warmth or coolness of your limbs, just allowing it to be just as it is. You may notice the breath coming in and going out, not trying to change it, just noticing however it is, allowing things to be as they are, offering no resistance to the experience that you're having. You may be aware of the air and the sense of energy in the room, the temperature of the air as it makes contact with the skin line. So there's the sounds, the feeling of warmth or coolness, the general sense of the weight and shape of that body. Maybe notice which part of you is the most comfortable, which part of your body is the most comfortable and relaxed. One of these points of focus will be the natural center of your experience, almost as if that is what awareness is interested in. It could be the breath, it could be the sounds in the background, or it could be the way your hands feel resting in your lap. And it doesn't matter what it is and it may change, and that's fine. If you can't find a natural center, then you can just use the breath or the tones, some central point where you just allow your awareness to rest there. And at this point, it may be a good time just to restate your intention, just to remind yourself if you're developing some other quality, you can just name that now. Or you could just restate your question. For instance, show me what I most need to know for my highest good. Then listening with your body, aware of all the various sensations. And if you need to, you can spend a moment cultivating some relaxation. And you may not need to. It's fine if you do or don't, or maybe just allow any tension to fade away or drain down into the floor. Notice noticing the most comfortable part of your body and imagining that comfort floating around you like a cloud of light, bringing ease. And I'll be quiet now. Just allow the tones to guide you.

====================

LESSON 3: Meditation - Advanced Flow State Meditation With Gamma Frequencies

Welcome to the second Gamma meditation, and as before, it's important to have an intention as you enter this exercise. So just take a moment to think about what you would like to cultivate within this session, and that can be as specific as you want it. It can be an attitude or quality. It can be exploration about a specific question or a problem before you begin to explore, you'll be guided to clear this intention in your mind, in your head, heart, and gut, and just let that intention move out of only being in your head, and then let it sink deeply into your heart, and then move it down into the core of your being into the gut. I'll give you some time to do this, and now let's bring those senses alive by really moving into them and just feeling your weight in the chair or bed feeling into those contact points with the support beneath you. Now, just get a general sense of where you are and how you are right now. Not trying to change, just noticing, and you may notice the breath. Its rhythm and flow again, not trying to change it, just observing. Be curious and allow things to be as they are, 

And then just finding that natural center of the experience you are having. It could be the breath or the tones or something else around you. You are invited to notice to move into that now. And now just remembering your intention and keeping that clear in your mind, in your head, heart, and gut. Just letting that intention move through you and notice it expanding out from you. Just allow it to radiate out all around you. Be curious about where this will take you.

====================

LESSON 4: Key Principles of Creative Problem-Solving
--------------------
<v ->So, Luigi, solving problems can be very difficult.</v> And the reason is we come from the logical and rational side which is very limited. And what I love about Monroe Sound Science is it's a tool that helps us tap into these spaces that opens us up to a broader perspective. <v ->Yeah, and it might come as a surprise,</v> but we actually have two brains, and they're both in your head. That's right. And so what I mean is we've got two hemispheres of the brain. So when you're talking about the logical side, what we're really talking about is what's a lot of frontal left brain processing. And then we also have a right hemisphere that we don't really tap into too much. And the beauty of the tools that we use at the Monroe Institute is that we allow these two worldviews, the left being very much in categories and things that have happened in the past but might not allow us to process new information so much. And then we can combine that with that flowing quality of the right brain where new information is constantly flowing in, and then we can organize it with the left brain. So the goal of this particular section is to make you more whole brain when working on a particular problem or situation and then being able to apply that in your daily lives. Okay, so in this next session, we're going to use the meditations to support you in developing a real skill when it comes to solving problems. In fact, it's more of a set of skills and understandings. One of the chief considerations that we sometimes forget to explore is why we should solve a particular problem. How does solving this problem help us create more of the life we want? How does solving this problem help us to align with our purpose? So the first skill is to connect with a purpose, and that will be the subject of the first meditation in this session. Now, our purpose can be both general and specific. We can have a sense of purpose that is deep and lifelong, and we can also have a specific purpose in the moment. So clarifying our purpose, both at the deeper life level and in the more immediate sense, is the first step to effectively gauging how urgent or important solving this problem is. And I want to provide a warning here that it's not particularly productive to frame life as a problem to fix or a series of problems to fix. So pace yourself with this bigger life question or questions, and enjoy being here as much as you can. You are perfect exactly as you are, and there's nothing to fix. However, we can appreciate where you are right now and also look forward to developing in some way so that you can look forward to what's to come. And once we have connected with this sense of purpose, then we need to learn how to connect with the inner resources that we all have. Often when we worry, we actively keep ourselves out of connection with our inner resources. We are fixated on a problem. We take ourselves out of resonance with the space where we can find the solution. And it's one of the reasons why, paraphrasing Einstein, he said we can't solve problems by using the same kind of thinking we used when we created them. So we're going to be connecting with inner sources of guidance. And this can take many forms. We may experience it as meeting our inner self or higher self or other nonphysical guides. We may just experience it as a deep inner knowing or intuition. Don't just stay with the brain in your head. It's not the only one that does the thinking. You might not know this, but there are 500 million neurons in the gut. So that's an incredible amount of intuitive intelligence. Just think about that. A cat's brain is around 300 million neurons. So there is no right or wrong way to experience this. The first meditation will guide you to find the right way for you. All you need to do is set a clear intention to do so. And the relaxing music, the guidance, and the frequencies will support you into the best kind of experience for you. And when we're solving problems from an expanded state of consciousness, which you'll experience in these meditations, this makes more of ourselves available to work on that problem. We gain a broader perspective on the problem and even on the solution and the options that we can choose in that moment. And we know that in these borderland states between waking and sleeping, our brains become much more active, and the regions are much more interconnected. And rather than just working things out in the frontal areas of the brain, specifically the left hemisphere, we have more areas working on the problem at once. So the solution can be very creative and hyperassociated, and the answers might actually come in the form of asking better questions. Thinking more creatively is often the case of learning to ask better questions whilst in a receptive state. The guidance in these meditations will help you to learn this skill initially by directing you to ask and then helping you to stay receptive. And the music and the frequencies will also support this process very effectively. It has been said that the quality of our life is the quality of your questions. So keep that in mind. Now, I want to say something about worry because problems and worry seem to go hand in hand. Worry is a kind of negative rehearsal, almost a kind of planning for precisely how things will go wrong. It's using your imagination against yourself, but it is useless to tell somebody who's a worrier not to worry. They will just worry about the negative effects of worrying. So there's a way of actually worrying better, of mobilizing your energy to solve the problem rather than procrastinating by chasing pointless questions. So for example, if you ask the question, "What's wrong with me?" Or "Why can't I do this?" There's no possible good answer to that question. You're just asking your mind and giving it the task to find a list of faults, which it probably will find quite easily. And if you stay with the question long enough, it'll find a few more. But if you can relax and ask a better question such as, "What do I need to do differently? How can I solve this problem differently? How can I break it down?" Then you can start to get much better at finding solutions. And then you can start by giving yourself empathy, by acknowledging your worries. Just recognizing that you have them and that you are uncomfortable is a start. So don't push them down. Your discomfort means that you're learning something new. You are exploring the cutting edge of your development, and it feels uncomfortable because you don't know it yet, and you don't know it yet because it's new. So you're in the learning or the growth zone. And then I invite you to write out your problem and say it out loud so that it's clear so that more of your brain actually hears the problem so that it's not just staying in the language centers of your brain. Do you actually want to know the answer to this? Is it meaningful to you? So be specific, and you might find that it's actually a cluster of questions that overlap. So writing it out or saying it out loud helps to define the problem. And then I invite you to complete this task. And you can do this now. Go get a pen or a pencil and some paper. And on the page draw a large circle and a smaller circle within it. And in the inner circle, I'd like you to write "Circle of control." These are the things that are within your control. And the outer circle, write "Outside of my control." And as you think about your problem or problems, I'd like you to place aspects that can help you to solve those problems within the appropriate circle. So for example, in the things I can control that relate directly to me, I can write my thoughts, emotions, and actions, how I talk to myself, the goals I set, how I spend my time. And outside of that I can write the thoughts, opinions, and actions of others, the future, what happens around me, how others take care of themselves, and so on. And just keep that page handy for when you're working on any problem so that you're clear about your personal boundary and the personal resources that you have and what you might need and what belongs to you and what belongs to somebody else. Is this my problem? Is it somebody else's or is it both? And with this, we can also define solvable and unsolvable worries. Is it something within or outside of your control? And you can use this to focus your energy on solvable worries. And lastly on worry, I suggest putting aside specific time in your day when to worry, preferably in the late afternoon or early evening. And in the session on sleep, I'll be talking about thoughts having momentum that can sometimes disturb a good night's sleep. So you don't want to worry just before getting into bed. And then staying present with your problem, we will teach you how to relax into this problem-solving capacity by teaching you how to recognize it as belonging to a particular frequency of awareness. Because problem solving is not a linear left hemisphere activity but a whole-brained process that we can do more effectively when we reach an open, receptive state of equilibrium. We have called it "elevated mindset" because as I've mentioned, we need to train ourselves to not try to solve the problem from the same level of awareness, the same frequency that we discovered or created it from. So learning how to access this space within ourselves in a regular and reliable way can be an extremely useful tool for life. And practicing with these meditations will help you to do just that. So for your actions of today, first of all, I would invite you to write out your question or problem, the situation, so that you're very specific and clear about what it is and whether it's something that you can directly influence, that you have direct control of, or not. Is this something that's important to you? Do you really want to know the answer? Do you really want to solve it? So being very clear is the first step. And secondly, listen to the meditations in sequence in this session because they will build on each other so that you can move into that broader whole-brain state that will help to bring more of yourself onto solving the problem. So feel free to take your time to experience and play with these meditations so that you can get a feel for what it's like to be moving from that left brain thinking to that right brain being as you solve these problems. Enjoy.

LESSON 4: Meditation - Connecting With Your Purpose

- This exercise is designed to help you clarify and discover your personal purpose. It's very important not to be overly influenced by ideas about what your purpose or your vision should be. This exercise will help you to guide past all of these cultural influences and find your sense of purpose, one that is deeply rooted in your personal values. When we come into this physical existence, we come for a number of reasons to learn to grow, but we also come for joy. And it's also possible to grow through joy. Not all growth has to come from suffering and sacrifice. So this exercise is designed to help you discover the purpose that best expresses who you are. Because your contribution to this world mainly comes from your consciousness, from the vibration that you are much more than from external activity. Of course, when you are clear about your purpose in this way, it is much easier to align outward activity to the service of this purpose, this vision. So I'd invite you now to just relax, to get calm and to allow my words to guide you, to allow the music and the tones to guide you into a state of focus and relaxation. Something that's very simple. There's nothing that you have to make happen. You can just listen to me and the music and the tones, and it will all take care of itself as I guide your attention now and help you engage your imagination to produce a state of calm, of confident relaxation. And you can do this exercise sitting up, or you can do it lying down. And you may want to have a notepad or a, or some way to note down the answers to the series of questions we will be exploring. And it's fine to just open your eyes and do this as long as you are fairly mindful when you do this, as it will enhance the process. So now just take a moment to notice your breathing, and you're not trying to control your breathing here, noticing it and noticing the weight and warmth of those hands resting by your sides or on your lap. And you can listen to my voice and the music and the sounds, and you can be aware of the warmth and the temperature of the air in the room. Even with your eyes closed, you can get a sense of the space around you, and you can just have an attitude of having nothing to do. So nothing to achieve, just allowing yourself and everything else to just be as it is. You might notice now the most comfortable part of your body, whether that's a hand or a finger, or your tummy, or just a sense of breathing. It doesn't matter. But you can imagine, only imagine that comfort now beginning to drift and float around the body like a soothing, easeful light, a deep, comforting, relaxing energy just floating and drifting from place to place. Maybe down through those eyelids and down through the muscles. See the side of the spine all the way down to the tips of your toes. And this is a process of easeful energy and comfort, just floating and drifting to wherever it's needed so that as we go on little by little and bit by bit, every muscle, every nerve can become that little bit more comfortable, letting go of any unnecessary tension and replacing it with comfort. With every out breath, just breathing out any discomfort or any kind of tension. And the rest of this exercise is really an opportunity for you to answer a series of questions from the deepest part of you. And we're going to invite you to pose a question and then listen with your body. And by that I mean not immediately talking to yourself about the question, but just feeling for sensing for new information, which may come as words, or it may come as a feeling or an image that you will need to make sense of later. And that's fine too. But for now, I'd just like you to think of the thing that's most important for you to move towards in your life. And this could be a quality or an achievement. It can be more confidence or a better job. But just notice what that is now. Now ask yourself, what will this give me? How will I feel? What would it make possible? And how does that make me feel? What does that do for me? What difference will that make? And of course, it's fine if you just want to open your eyes and note these ideas down, if that feels okay for you. So let's take another question. What's the next thing that's most important for you to move towards in your life, to have more of, to experience more of? What is it that excites you? What is it that inspires you that you want to move towards? Feel for that. And when you have that, what will it give you? How will you feel? What difference will it make? What will it enable you to do? And just checking that this isn't somebody else's voice or somebody else's idea of what you ought to do, rather something that inspires you, that you genuinely resonate with. And again, it's fine to take a moment to write it down. I invite you now to think of a third thing, the third thing that you would like to move towards most in your life, whether it's a quality or an achievement, whether it's being more compassionate or more wealthy, it really doesn't matter. Just whatever it is for you. How will that make you feel when you have it? How does that feel? And what does that enable for you? What does that make possible? And how does that make you feel? And just feel free to write it down if you want. And now I would like to ask you a different question. What's the thing that you most want to move away from in your life? And again, this could be a quality or an achievement or a circumstance. It really doesn't matter whether it's I want to move away from being grumpy, or I want to move away from dependent relationships. And just noticing now, how will that make you feel when that thing has gone from your life? How does that feel? What does that bring to you? What does that make possible? How does that change your life? How does that express you? And again, you can open your eyes if you wish, and write down any answers. So now thinking of the second thing that you would most like to move away from, and again, it can be a quality or a circumstance. What would you most like to be gone from your life? And imagine what it's like when it's gone from your life. How does that make you feel? What does that make possible? What does that change? How does that express you? And just feel free again to write it down if you want. Now, let's think of a third thing that you would like to move away from, whether it's equality or a circumstance, it doesn't matter. But just really feeling for that. What is it? And how will you feel when that's gone from your life? What's good about that? Notice why that's a good thing. And again, if you wish to open your eyes and make some notes, feel free to do so. And now just look at those three things you want to move towards, and those three things that you want to move away from now, just look at those three things you want to move towards and those three things you want to move away from. And just imagine what you might need to do to live this life while you're moving towards these three things that matter to you. And you're moving away from these three things that you don't want more and more every day. And you might even see that almost as if it were on a screen. And notice how there could be any scenarios in which you could express these values in which you could serve these values, these values and this sense of purpose become like a compass, allowing you to make new maps while staying true to yourself, allowing you to be flexible with integrity as you evolve your understanding of these things that you want to move towards and what you want to move away from. And over time, they will evolve, always moving to a deeper truer expression of you. And now it's time to return, bringing every learning with you, both conscious and unconscious. So as I count from five to one, let every number energize you and bring you closer to the physical waking state. Five. Nice deep breath in. Four, all unnecessary tension leaving you now three, aware of the room around you, everything becoming crisp and clear as you come back more and more. Now, two, nice deep breath, perhaps a little stretch, a little wriggle of your fingers and toes. Just coming back more and more, just feeling that vitality, returning on one all the way back, feeling refreshed and energized, sensing the room around you, really feeling that body, that connection to the body and the breath. Welcome back.

====================

LESSON 4: Meditation - Discovering What I Want With Monroe Sound Science

What if it is possible to discover and have everything you want? I invite you to let go of all of your conditioned ideas and self restricted aspirations. I invite you to discover the situations, the things and the people that could give you the greatest sense of joy and satisfaction, the greatest sense of fulfillment. Because living that life with those situations, people and objects around you expresses most clearly who you are. To accomplish this, we are going to connect with our deepest guidance. Connect with a part of yourself that loves you unconditionally, that has no idea of you as unlimited, the you who isn't allowed to want things. So now just get comfortable. Allow the frequencies to help you relax. Release any tensions that you notice. 

Just simply relax. And as you relax, you can just allow yourself to begin to connect with that part of you that rejoices in all aspects of your abundance, that part of yourself that wants and allows you to be physically well, vital and healthy, financially abundant and enriched with a source of abundance and generosity. That part of yourself who is mentally clear, flexible, and capable, spiritually abundant, focused, calm and creative. Now, I invite you to ask to be shown what this looks like for you. Make the intention to tap into your total self that's self, that knows and experiences the deepest and most true aspect of you. Affirm in your mind. I am open to receiving guidance from my total self, my true nature. I am willing to receive inspiration from my highest self that expresses who I fully am. And now you can just allow the background sounds to guide you into a deeper state of relaxation, a state of clarity and inspiration where you are able to receive your highest guidance. 

And as you relax, you might be able to get a sense of your own personal note, a tone, a sound that is beautiful and expresses you in some way. Maybe you experience it as a light, as shining from your heart. Either way, make it beautiful. This sound, this light that communicates your highest vibration. Picture this sound, this light radiating out from you in all directions. And you can follow this and allow yourself now to imagine what situations, what people, what objects fully resonate with your highest vibration. As you connect with this information, you may receive as images, words, feelings are simply just an inner knowing. Allow this to unfold for you. And now as we begin to draw this meditation to a close, you can begin to get a sense of the situations, the people, and the objects that are part of your life that also resonate with this sense of yourself. Even if more faintly or less completely, you can have a sense, a new appreciation for your current life, and a sure sense of confidence and patience for what is yet to come. Now it is time to return to a waking state of consciousness. Start to become aware of your surroundings as you take in some deeper breaths. 

Let those deeper breaths refresh fresh and energize you. When you are ready, open your eyes as you return to normal waking consciousness, fully awake and fully refreshed. Welcome back.

====================

LESSON 4: Meditation - Using Inner Guidance for Problem Solving

- So just getting settled and getting ready to begin. And I'll just invite you to notice what's happening right now, just noticing the sounds around you, the sound of my voice, obviously that you can hear, and the music. And just when you're ready, allowing your eyes to close or picking a spot on a wall, something that's not very interesting to look at. Just resting your eyes there. But if you want to close them, that's fine too. And just flowing with the music now. And I invite you to take in a nice easy breath. And then just taking another breath, maybe a little bit deeper than last time, and then just releasing it a little bit longer than the last hour breath. And breathing steadily in this way. Nice, easy in breath was just a little bit shorter than the outbreath. And there's nothing that you need to do, nothing that you need to achieve, and no one wanting anything from you. No one expecting anything from you. So just letting go in this moment And thoughts might arise in your mind, and you can observe them, you can follow them, but it's almost too much effort to work out which is more important than another. So just let that go. And allow yourself to notice that most of the time, your sense of self is located somewhere between your eyes because there's a clarity there, there's a shortness there. And you can follow that down and notice a lightness in your heart center, the strongest rhythm in the body, and just connecting with the heart and that deep sense of appreciation. And you can direct that appreciation to someone you know something you like, a memory. But I also invite you to direct that appreciation to yourself for taking the time to be here, to show up for yourself right now. And just feel the lightness of that with that delicious tingling that lets you know that you're in connection with yourself. And then moving your awareness down even further into the belly, into the gut, and just placing your awareness just a little bit below your belly button, below the navel, into that part, the core of your being, the midpoint of the body where our power sits, our strength, and really moving into that space, that deep connection with yourself. And just noticing the alignment between head, heart, and gut. Just thinking as one body, one brain, one mind. And then just asking a simple question, what do I really need right now in my development? And then just allowing whatever needs to come up to come up, not judging it in any way, just holding it lightly. Gentle curiosity. And setting an intention to connect deeply with all parts of your total self. And from this energy space, I invite you to ask a question. Just release a question or a problem that you are working on right now that you'd like the answer to right now. Ask your question a problem, and then just release it and allow whatever needs to come up to come up. And wherever you are now, just beginning to think about moving to a greater awareness of your physical body, a sense of connection between your body and whatever you're sitting or lying down on. And then the connection with the breath. Just maybe breathing a little more deeply now, and just feeling the sense of your fingers and toes, just giving them a wiggle. Just coming back a little bit more now to strengthening that connection to the body and the breath just coming back more and more. And that's it. And when you're ready, just opening your eyes and then just make some notes at the end of this exercise. Any impressions, anything that came to you? And welcome back.

====================

LESSON 5: Elevating Situational and Innate Confidence
--------------------
<v ->Our next topic is about confidence.</v> And it's such a complex concept to understand. I know that when we see people who are very uneasy in their skin or you can just tell something is just not quite matching up or lining up, it's an unease with themselves, and it's a focus on self-awareness. Like they can so disconnect from whom they're trying to engage with because of their self-focus, their self-awareness, and it's usually very negative. So I'd like you to talk more about that. <v ->Yeah. There's really two main components of confidence</v> that we'll be exploring: relaxation and the absence of self-concern. When we see people that are confident, we just look at them and we say, okay, well, they're actually just in the flow of what they're doing and they're not thinking so much-- I mean, they might be thinking-- but they're not thinking so much about how they're presenting themselves and what they might look like to you. And so this is something that we'll be exploring in this section, how to be relaxed and, and not so focused on your internal self-talk so that you can present yourself in the best light. So let's talk about confidence. Do you feel confident in yourself and your abilities? And just pause for a moment, and think about what it is that you associate with confidence. For me, confidence comprises two essential elements: relaxation, physical, mental and emotional relaxation and mental clarity. And when you observe someone who exudes confidence in their abilities and ask them about their secret, they often appear confused. They're nonchalant. They have no clue what you're talking about. They weren't preoccupied with self-assessment. They weren't concerned about others' opinions of themselves or mired in self-doubt. So their relaxed appearance is a testament to their relaxation. Their focus was firmly fixed on the task at hand. Consider the scenario of public speaking, a common source of anxiety that I encounter in the therapy room. While we as observers might speculate about the thoughts racing through the speaker's mind, the reality could be quite different. We don't have direct access to their internal state or resources. They may have rehearsed their presentation so thoroughly that they operate on autopilot, their entire attention dedicated to the task. So when we witness a person who appears calm and mentally clear, we perceive them as confident. Importantly, confidence is not contingent on possessing comprehensive knowledge. Individuals with limited expertise can still exhibit confidence, like the person in a room who poses a question that others were thinking about. Their self concern is minimal, allowing them to ask the question without worrying about being perceived as ignorant. Think about the times when you might have held back from asking that question because you weren't sure about how you'd be perceived by others or the expectations that you made about yourself in that moment, such as, "I should know this so I won't ask the question." Conversely, a lack of confidence is synonymous with not being fully present and clear and trapped within one's imagination. A confident person remains in control, not allowing their emotional impulses to overpower them. They can acknowledge discomfort without becoming entangled in it, in contrast to those who freeze when their thoughts go blank And they attempt to manage internal and external stimuli simultaneously. In the realm of confident public speaking, The secret lies in seamlessly shifting attention from formulating the next sentence to connecting with the audience. Each sentence becomes an improvisation, and discomfort is not seen as a hindrance but as a source of excitement, of co-creative play. And it's important to note that anxiety or discomfort doesn't negate confidence; it signifies a growth opportunity. So become comfortable being uncomfortable. You don't know it yet, so the situation might seem ambiguous. You're doing something new. And confident individuals interpret these sensations differently. They interpret these sensations positively, such as excitement rather than succumbing to stress or panic. In the following sections, we will explore three meditations to enhance your sense of confidence. These include pure confidence which entails achieving a state of relaxed presence and mental clarity. And then we'll explore connecting with past success which enables you to revisit and process past experiences where you felt confident and then anchor that ability in the present moment. And lastly, we'll explore connecting with the future where you apply this anchor of a resource state for future use so that you have the flexibility to adapt to unforeseen circumstances. Here we will be using our imagination constructively because a lack of confidence often arises from envisaging negative scenarios and then searching for evidence to confirm those fears. And this creates a self-fulfilling prophecy. Confidence can be categorized into two types, situational and innate. Situational confidence stems from familiarity with a skill or situation in a specific context. And innate is usually observed in young children who are unburdened by self-consciousness. They learn and adapt with enthusiasm even when they stumble. So I was told the story of a very skilled surgeon who had an incredibly steady hand under all kinds of pressure in the emergency room, and other medics were amazed at his ability to remain calm and confident in extreme circumstances. But he went to therapy for stress and anxiety. And the reason surprisingly was nothing to do with his work as a surgeon. It was however, related to his wife asking him a very serious question: "Where should we spend Christmas this year, with your parents or with my parents?" And now he's stressed. So that's what I mean by situational confidence. Confidence at work, but not at home. In meditation, we have the concept of beginner's mind which illustrates how individuals can be highly successful when they lack preconceived notions about their abilities. And we all have memories of innate confidence and curiosity from our past. And the meditations provided here aim to help us reconnect with this quality, this felt sense of what we term confidence, and apply an anchor in the present moment using an object for instant access to those feelings. So if you've ever looked at an object or a physical photograph, for instance, and had an immediate reaction or response, a flood of emotions, a memory perhaps, then that feeling was anchored on the object. That's what we mean by anchoring. And this would've been an unconscious process, but we can take the principles of that and apply it deliberately to help us access a targeted state of consciousness. And you don't have to do all of this verbally in your head. You have deep intuitive resources, which we come back to time and again in this Quest, because your brain isn't confined to your head and specifically to verbal language. There's a concept in psychotherapy which is that of the unthought known. And this means that there are things that you know but can't think about because typically people use verbal language to talk to themselves internally. But verbal language hits a time wall at around the age of three years old when we internalize verbal language. Before then you thought in ways that were nonverbal. And yet before the age of three, you made your biggest strides in learning about this reality. You learned to walk; you learned to talk. You divided a wall of sensory data into the different senses, and then you labeled everything. You learned to operate in this reality, making sense of a wall of data. And the concept of walking, when you really think about that, just think about what happened. You tried to stand, and you fell. You just couldn't get balanced. You tried, and you tried, and you failed repeatedly. And you might not remember your frustrations and your repeated attempts, but you did it. You didn't just fall over and think, "Ah, you know what? Forget this. Walking isn't for me. I'm just going to drag myself around on my knuckles." There was no failure, just feedback. So do you still do that now or do you stop after a first or a second attempt or don't attempt at all in case you fail? And a better question: how can you do things differently now? And when we release the constraints of how we should feel in specific situations and relax, we can rediscover this innate sense of ease and curiosity which is the essence of true confidence. And these meditations will guide you so that you can tap into this state in the present moment, so that you can draw from your past experiences and carry that into your new future. So for today, what I would like you to do is listen to these meditations in sequence. There are Monroe sound science exercises, which have frequencies that support your expanded self, so that you can sink into the deeper appreciation of being, so that you can tap into that relaxed, open focus that we term confidence. Play around with it; make it your own, and keep coming back to these sessions as you see fit.

====================

LESSON 5: Meditation - Pure Confidence With Monroe Sound Science

- Welcome to this meditation about developing more confidence. This meditation is designed to help you connect with the deep core of confidence that you may not have known you possessed. Very often the mistake that people make when considering confidence is to believe that confidence is a specific emotion, but that really isn't the case. So before you relax very deeply and allow the music and the tones to take you into a powerful, relaxed focus that will allow you to connect deeply with this inner reserve of confidence. I'll just say a few words about confidence. Really, confidence is relaxation. Specifically it's the absence of self concern. Any lack of confidence. When we experience it, we only know as some form of anxiety. This usually means that we must have made some kind of judgment of ourselves. We might be buying into some kind of negative comparison of ourselves that we've been taught by society, family, or even ourselves. This meditation will allow you to let go of that. When you let go, thoughts may wander in from time to time, and that's fine. You'll be able to connect deeply with your own inner reservoir of confidence so you can just listen to the sounds and music and follow the things I'm saying as best you can and all will be well. So now having said a little bit about confidence, as you begin to relax in a way that's just right for you, I want you to understand that it's okay to be a little uncomfortable, and then you can relax with that. So as you sink deeper into this experience, there is no need to push away less comfortable feelings. You can just allow them to be there exactly as they are, and this is actually exactly what confident people do. There's an assumption that confident people never feel anxiety, but that isn't really true. A confident person isn't really thinking about anything at all other than what they're doing. They're in flow, they're in focus, and through listening to this, you can learn more about trusting your inner flow. So now what I'd like you to do is to allow those eyes to close if they haven't already, and either sitting or lying comfortably. You could begin just by listening to the things I'm saying to the music and tones, and maybe there's even sounds beyond that that you can hear, and it's fine if you do, and it's fine if you don't. Just listening really intently.

- That's it.

- And one of the key skills, one of the chief components of the feeling of confidence is relaxation, physical relaxation. And so I invite you to just notice the weight of your body, the weight of your limbs, warmth or coolness of the air around you, the breaths, the rise and fall when you breathe in and out, and you might even imagine warm, soft, soothing, liquid, beginning to flow down from the top of your head through the scalp, down through the muscles of the scalp and down now through those eyes and forehead, muscles and the tiny muscles around the eyes beginning to relax and let go.

- That's right.

- Just imagine a soft, soothing liquid or light just flowing down through the jaw and through those neck muscles and down through those shoulders so that little by little and bit by bit, we relax every muscle, every nerve, every fiber, beginning to relax a little more with every easy breath And with your eyes closed as they are, it's so much easier to notice that little sensation, thoughts, and feelings that lets you know more about letting go and resting comfortably in awareness. There's so much, but you can just trust instinctively what your unconscious does, what you always trust, the way your body breathes. For example, the way your body balances, your blood gases, the way you digest a meal, the steady beat of your heart, things that so consistently and so perfectly take care of themselves. And you can imagine that warm, soft, soothing liquid would continue to flow down through the spinal muscles and down through the chest and all the way down to the pelvic bowl, down to the tips of those toes. Every steady beat of your heart, every gentle breath, every note, every sound, taking you deeper and deeper into comfort, into a sense of nobody wanting or needing anything from you. Of course, this can become easier and easier as time goes on. You can use that part of your mind. You use when you dream, when you daydream to create just a sense of the most perfect place for you to relax even deeper. Now, it might be your favorite beach or your favorite armchair. It doesn't matter whether it's inside or outside, somewhere safe that you've often visited or somewhere you just imagine. There's just something about the colors and the sounds and the smells with the feeling of warmth or coolness that lets you know you're safe. There's nobody wanting anything from you, nobody needing anything from you, nothing to achieve or accomplish. You can just be as you are now and know that you are enough. Know that things will work out perfectly. And often when people think about confidence, they make the mistake of thinking. It's about always knowing what to do or say when really it's about knowing how to relax, how to allow your mind to clear so that you know how to find out what to do or say. And obviously your limbic system will report things that could be considered a threat. And so there may sometimes be a little discomfort. You may notice your breathing change or your pulse increase or your muscles tension, and that's good because that's your signal to relax with that sensation. Just be aware, allowing those less comfortable sensations to be just as they are in this situation, paying them attention in a kind way.

- That's right,

- And I wonder if you could imagine some way in which you could see yourself, could be on a TV screen. Maybe you can just imagine that you could rest there in that perfect place of safety, seeing yourself from the outside, going through one of those situations where in the past you may have felt less than confident, But we can see something different this time. Now you know that it's fun to feel a little anxiety, a little limbic discomfort, but you notice how that becomes your cue to relax. Then we see that version of you over there breathing easily, looking calm, focused and relaxed, just moving through that situation with so much more comfort and ease than you would've done before. And allow yourself to see that really clearly. Then just float into there so that you're looking out of those eyes, thinking with that mind, feeling with that heart, enjoying that feeling of physical relaxation and mental clarity that others call confidence. And it's just fine. You can focus exactly on what you need to do, not needing to think about yourself or your problems, not worrying about what others might think. Just able to focus and flow instinctively navigating your way through that situation with real grace. And you trust your unconscious now, that deep instinctive flow, and you can manifest that now, that same instinctive confidence that allows birds to navigate through flight and salmon, to find their way back to the spawning ground, unerringly, powerful, instinctive ease. Just focusing on that relaxation and mental clarity that lets you know what's the next piece of information or step that I should take. It is being completely comfortable with taking the time, but not knowing exactly how this will turn out yet, but trusting that it will work out. Really enjoy that, but then we can be back looking at that screen just relaxing and allowing the experience of that can be completely healed. You may think of yet another situation that would've been challenging to you previously, but this time you can see yourself doing it differently, with much more grace and ease. You look relaxed as you observe yourself. You look calm and clear, and I don't know exactly what that will look like for you, but you do. And as you relax even deeper now, flowing into that, flowing to that and allowing yourself to be right inside that experience, looking out through those eyes again, thinking with that mind, feeling with that heart, with that sense of ease, that sense of composure,

- Enjoy

- It.

- That's right.

- Then you can allow that image to fade and just be relaxed in that special place knowing that you now have powerful new instructions to guide your becoming. So there's nothing you have to figure out. We can just be curious about all the little changes that you're going to notice in the coming days and coming weeks. You can just be curious about exactly what they're going to be. But you will notice in fact that every time you sit in a chair or walk through a door, you will be instantly reminded to focus on this moment with relaxation and clear intention. Now you can get ready to be active again, knowing that you can bring back with you learnings, conscious and unconscious. You can bring back feelings of ease and energy and relaxation. You can look forward to that. You may notice a pleasing sense of anticipation, perhaps a sweet, soft tingling in the muscles as you look forward now to being active and energized again, in a moment, not yet, but in a moment when you hear me count from five to one, that can be your signal to come all the way back to normal waking awareness, bringing all of these learnings conscious and unconscious back with you. So as I count five now, just taking some nice, deep, easy breaths, becoming a little bit more alert, and four, another nice, deep easy breath. Reorienting yourself out of this meditation now, just allowing all that deep relaxation to leave you feeling brighter and clearer. Three, much more aware of the room around you. You might want to gently move your body to and take some deeper breaths and then all the way back, and one, open your eyes emerging from meditation into the next period of activity. Taking all those learnings with you. And obviously the more you practice with it, the more you gain.

====================

LESSON 5: Meditation - Connecting With the Past Success Meditation

<silence> 

So just sitting in a comfortable position, you can also do this meditation lying down, but the intention is to be present throughout this meditation and following along as best you can to what I'm saying, what I'm suggesting here. And in this meditation, we're going to go on a journey to explore and reconnect with the essence of past success. And to begin with, let's start with connecting with the breath. Just really bringing all of our resources into the body and into the breath, gently withdrawing any attention from the outside world and really coming into the awareness of the rhythm of the in and the out breath, that gentle, natural rhythm that's always been there. And if your mind strays and flows and drifts, you can always gently bring it back to the body, into the breath, 

And just imagining that with that breath, you're pulling fresh energy into the body, pulling fresh energy into all parts of your body, not only through your nulls, but through all of your pores. And you could add a color and a sensation to that breathing. And you can imagine that now just allowing fresh, new energy to flow in and let it flow up into your head. And just bringing an awareness and aliveness of freshness there so that your mind is becoming even more clear, even more vibrant with every breath. And then just imagining that energy that you brought into your head, flowing out of the top of your head and down and around you forming a bubble or a balloon of energy just surrounding protecting healing. And it might have a color and it might have a particular shape, a movement or rotation, and just observing and becoming curious about that. And now just thinking about and imagining something a little more specific. I'd like you to think about being somewhere beautiful in nature. And the light is just right for you. The temperature is just right. The sky is clear, and you can perceive the play of light, just dancing through the leaves, creating beautiful shapes on the ground, and perhaps noticing the play of colors, just thinking about them as you rest there for a moment, and feeling that ground underneath your feet, feeling that energy and connection with that place in nature. 

And you might hear some birds or some other sounds in the background, some fresh smells. There's just something about this place, the colors, the sounds, the smells, the tastes that lets you know more about relaxing, being at ease, being at peace, and feeling that safety, that sensation of safety within that bubble. I just perceive in front of you a large oak tree with a very wide trunk so wide that it might take two or more people to reach around it and moving closer. You notice an opening. It's as if the trunk has folded in a particular way that you can move between and through it and beyond that, you notice an inviting tunnel leading down into the earth. And as you move inside that tree and enter that tunnel, you notice that the tunnel is far more spacious than you could have imagined from the outside. The walls of the tunnel are shimmering with crystal light, and it's almost as if bioluminescent beings are surrounding the walls of this tunnel. And just observing the beauty of that as you walk down the tunnel. And it's almost as if each step invites you into deeper relaxation, just walking you more and more into that relaxation and allowing yourself to be taken by this tunnel deep into the earth while feeling surrounded and protected safe within this earth. And just moving down slowly in your own time and in your own way. 

And as you walk further down this tunnel, you notice a faint trickling the impression of an underground stream. And as you continue to descend, it just becomes a little bit louder and more rhythmic, just noticing that trickling and just continuing on. 

And as you reach the bottom of the tunnel, it opens into a beautiful clearing. And it's almost as if it is lit by skylights, crystals of different sizes, letting light flow through every part of this, clearing a dance of colors. And in the middle is a small reflecting pool, and that stream is just flowing into that pool. And there's just something that lets you know this pool is special, that the waters of this pool contain information for you that is relevant to you and to your life experience. And as you approach that pool, I'd like you to just look into it and you might get lower to the ground. Just peek over and observe a reflection. And the first thing that this pool will show you is how you are right now, how you perceive yourself right now. And as you gaze deeper into the pool, you'll be made aware of something that's incredibly important for you to know right now, a memory of something that's important for you to know and understand at this time that will help your allow this deeper part of you to show you an experience, a memory, and a time when you felt happy and proud, just feeling really successful, a strong feeling of accomplishment or joy, feeling your connection to creativity, confidence, and success. Explore this memory, this connection, and I will join you again later. 

And now from wherever you are, just bringing your awareness again to the pool and to the edge of that pool, bringing back with you any new information, any insights and understandings, both conscious and unconscious. As you return to awareness of the edge of that pool 

And at the edge of the pool, just notice a small wooden bowl, a small wooden bowl that invite you to collect now. And with that bowl, scoop some of the water of the pool and something intuitively tells you from within that. By drinking this water, by taking a sip from the pool, you can connect with all of those feelings, sensations, and understandings from that time, from that memory, and bring them into your body and into all parts of your being. So if you are ready, I invite you to drink from that bowl. Take a sip and be open to whatever you receive, taking in more confidence, more feeling of success, and a deeper connection with yourself. And then allow that feeling to flow through your body, down your arms, and into that object that you have left nearby. Let it flow into that object now, anchoring this feeling, making it part of the object that you have nearby. And in the future, whenever you wish to reconnect with these feelings of confidence and success of a deeper connection with yourself, then all you need to do is hold that object and think about this pool, and all those feelings will immediately arise within you. So just feeling that connection now 

And now beginning to take leave of this clearing, retracing your steps, back up that tunnel, just making your way back easily and gently, nearly at the top and back through the trunk of the tree. Free and back outside, back outside. And just bathe in that light for a moment, just breathing in that fresh air and feeling the temperature of the outside. And with each breath, feeling even more grounded, even more connected with yourself. That's it. Use that feeling, that connection with the ground to strengthen the connection with your body. 

And then in a moment, we're going to take leave of this place, but knowing that you can easily return here. And the more you do this meditation, the easier that information will flow. But for now, just thinking of coming back into your body, more and more awareness of your physical body sitting there or lying down, becoming more aware of the breath, the strength returning to the breath, and becoming more aware of what you can hear in the room beyond the sounds, beyond my voice. And just following the breath back a little bit more each time, and maybe giving yourself a little stretch now sitting up a little bit more. And when you're ready, you can gently open those eyes. Take a nice satisfying breath, and look forward to the rest of your day. 

Welcome back.

LESSON 5: Meditation - Connecting With the Future Success Meditation

<silence> 

In this meditation, we are going to connect with the feeling of our own future fulfillment. So take a little time to get comfortable, making sure that you're not going to be disturbed by the outside because this is your time to focus inwards. And you can allow the tones in my voice to gently guide your attention and focus. And there's nothing that you need to make happen. This sense of your future success will arise quite naturally, and in a very real way. What we most need to facilitate this is a genuine sense of receptivity, of openness to new experience, a playful attitude that will allow everything to be just as it is. And it really doesn't matter if your mind is busy or dull, just allowing yourself to be as you are in this moment. And what I invite you to do is simply to make yourself comfortable. You could be sitting up or lying down, but my recommendation would be to do this sitting comfortably upright. But either is fine. And as you do that, I would like to ask you to listen very intently, very intently to the sounds in your headphones, and even beyond just listening as if you were trying to hear a very faint sound. 

And when we're listening, when we're really giving our awareness to listening, then we're not thinking so much. And as you do that, you may also be aware of the weight and warmth of your limbs, the shape of your body, perhaps faint impressions of light or color coming through your eyelids, the temperature of the room, just feeling the gentle contact of the air with your skin, aware in some way of the space within and around you, just allowing your body and mind to relax with every easy breath, relaxing more with every steady beat of your heart and noticing more and more, or those sensations that'll let you know about letting go. 

Perhaps a comfortable heaviness in your limbs or maybe a pleasant sense of lightness and energy drifting through any part of your body. Or perhaps you can begin to imagine what it would be like if your body were filled with the most deliciously relaxing color or the most texture. And as you do all of this, you can connect with a deep sense of the thing to achieve in life. And these could be material goals, or they could be qualities that you would like to develop in yourself, the kind of things that will bring you a real sense of joy, satisfaction and fulfillment. And I'll be quiet for a while now so that you can connect with this. And when you next hear my voice, it will be to guide you further on this journey. And now I invite you to imagine that somewhere in front of you, and perhaps you can see this, or just get a sense of this, there's a golden path or beam of light stretching infinitely into your future, as indeed you can sense it's stretching infinitely into your past. And just thinking about imagining floating above that line or beam of light, 

Drifting now noticing how you can get a sense of the events of your life unfolding beneath you. Some events are mundane, others challenging, some very successful and satisfying. And there may be one in particular that draws you towards it. And you can allow the essence of that object connected to your past success to be your guide, your compass, extending that past success into the direction of the future. It may be that you can see it below you, like a scene from a great movie, you enjoying the fulfillment of your goals, drawing real satisfaction from your achievements. And you can just drop down into that scene and experience looking out through those eyes and thinking and feeling as that new you that accomplished you. And as you look back down that gold path or that beam of light, you may even have a sense of the steps that you took to get here, really allowing yourself to connect with this experience now, knowing how success feels, and letting every cell become attuned to this feeling. And you can also know that from now on going forward, you will be guided by your deepest self, your unconscious mind, and your highest spirit unerringly in this direction. 

And now I will be quiet for a while as you just rest and deeply absorb this feeling and any insights, both conscious and unconscious. When you next hear my voice, it will be to guide you back. So now it is time to be active again, and you can look forward to that knowing that you've connected with that future success that you can bring back here in the present moment. Any feelings, any insights, any sensations, any memories will remain with you as you return to the physical waking state. So now returning to normal waking awareness easily and fully just following the breath back, every breath becoming stronger as you become aware of the room around you again, and feel a sense of refreshment and energy in the muscles of vibrancy coming into the body. Now mind feeling clear and sharp 

And all the way back now, wide awake now.

LESSON 6: Self-Healing: Reclaiming Your Well-Being
--------------------
<v ->So Allyn, in this section we're going</v> to be talking about healing. And one of the main concepts at the Monroe Institute is that we are more than our physical bodies, that we're energetic beings with a physical component. So can you say something about that? <v ->Yes, and you're right.</v> We are more than our physical bodies, and it's a key part of my healing energy work. And the reason it is, it's important to stay aware of the physical and focus on the physical aspects, the symptoms, you know what's going on here, but it's so much more than that. And just, for example, as a teaser, I'm going to be talking about that the mind is God to the body. And that's a significant point to understand and to work with, to work towards healing. There's something you'll hear us say over and over again at the Monroe Institute, and that is you are more than your physical body. I want to say that again. You are more than your physical body. So if we're more than our physical body, does that mean we have more control over what is happening with our physical body regarding disease, health, aging, et cetera? You might not like this answer because it's a yes and a no. Now, what do I mean by this? Well, yes, because I'll be introducing you to concepts that will help you better understand that we do have some direct control, but we also need to consider that what is unfolding in our lives right now might have other origins. Author David Hawkins believes that we are presented with the conditions-- and that's every one of us--that offer the highest potential for soul growth and development in this lifetime. Now, let's think about that a minute. Doesn't that seem interesting? And when you think about all the people all over the world, it might not seem fair, but again, it's important that we all have the right circumstances that help us be our best selves. Now, I'm hoping with what I already said, I'll let you off the hook a little bit because there's so many of us who believe that if someone has an illness or a disease, it's their fault. They caused it. They are not getting through their suppressed emotions. And I'm here to tell you it's simply not true. I want you to remove the idea. And if you have this idea, the guilt that of course is associated with it, that the only reason you are sick, if in fact you're sick, is because of a negative emotion, suppressed anger, or something you are not processing. Now, of course, that can be a reason, but like I've already said, there are many reasons. Now, if your condition is all about unresolved emotional pain or guilt, there are ways to work through it. And that's where Monroe Sound Science can come in and support the process. And we have some meditations that you can use that will be helpful, journaling, dream analysis. There's so many other techniques that you can use to help you gain more understanding about yourself. Those topics will be discussed throughout our Quest. So let's take a deep dive. You are an energy being with the power to heal on physical, mental, emotional, and spiritual levels. Okay, wait a minute, that's all well and good, but what really does that mean? Well, it means you actually can have two-way communication with the body. Now, this idea was first introduced to me when I was listening to Hay House Radio, and Venus Andrecht was the host. She had this crazy idea, well, it was crazy to me at the time, that I could ask my body what it wanted from me. What did my body want me to give it? So I thought, okay, next time I meditate, I'll try this. So I did. And as I'm preparing myself, in my head, my story is, well, I know what my body wants. It wants salad; it wants vegetables. I was always on a diet. So that's of course what the body needed. So I get all comfortable just into my meditation, and I say in my head, "Okay, body, what do you need from me today?" And what I heard was "Butterfinger." And I was like, what? Butterfinger? Well, first of all, that will ruin my diet. So I struggled a little bit with that, but I'd already promised my body that if it, whatever it asked for, I was going to give it to it. I mean, I like Butterfinger, but I'd rather have a Heath, you know? So it's not always going to be what you think it is, and you can receive information from the body. So key takeaway: yes, you can communicate with your body and one of our meditations will help you with that process or to develop it. So here's another one. And if you really pay attention to this, I think it can be a mind- blowing mindset shift. The mind is God to the body. I'll say that again so it sinks in: the mind is God to the body. So what does that mean? Well, that means that our minds calibrate vibrationally at a different level than our bodies. And interestingly enough, the body calibrates slower. So because of that, the mind can direct the body; the mind can command the body, and the body listens, and the body will make changes. I had a chronic foot condition for over 10 years, and the reason why I know it was over 10 years, 'cause I looked at my journals not too long ago, and I used this technique to get rid of it. David Hawkins, the one who taught about it, introduced it to me in a book, and he said he actually healed very serious conditions as well as minor conditions. So the idea is that you do this: so when you have a physical condition, you label it less and less. So think about this: when you know someone that's ill and you ask them how they're doing, they tend to go immediately to the condition, the illness, and they've put a whole story behind it. So the best thing to do is to remove the story, pull back more and more from the label. So let's just use arthritis in the knee as an example. So there's the title, the label, arthritis. There's a story that the individual creates around it, and you're really putting a lot of thinking into the condition, basically directing the body to keep it up. The idea is that you remove from labeling it, and you remove from identifying it with you. So start by just saying, "Hey, there's a pain in my knee." You know, get broader and broader and broader. Something else you can do that I found very effective is, again, about awareness. So when that pops up into your head, let's just say you've been diagnosed with cancer, all throughout your day, it's popping up in your head; your mind's thinking about it, that you have cancer, how scary it is, what are you going to do? So as soon as you become aware of that thought, then stop thinking about it that way. You know, switch it with the affirmations that you've created. "All is well. I'll be fine. Everything will be okay." But also release. Tell your body to release the condition. Tell your body the condition is not yours. It does not belong to you. So you can say, when you think about it or when that pain just makes you aware of it, whatever it is, you just say, "Cancel, cancel. I release this condition." And you're just continually directing your body to let it go and to release it. Another key part of this is that imagination is very important. Your brain doesn't know if you're imagining or not. It really is reality unfolding to the brain. And there's actually research out there that shows you you can increase muscle size using your imagination. I...I know. And it's crazy, right? Your imagination is driven by the mind. So the more vivid, the better. So you really want to step into what you're imagining happening or yourself do. So the mind literally can experience it as reality. There was a study done in 2004 that used three groups of subjects to demonstrate the power of the mind. One set used only their imagination. So that meant they used their imagination and lifted weights, didn't move a muscle. Another set used physical exercise only, and the third group did nothing. This is not the only research study that has indicated these results. The group of subjects who used only their imaginations saw a 35% increase in strength. That's pretty significant. While the group who used physical exercise, of course they're going to experience more. It was a 53% increase. And then as you might expect, the control group didn't change hardly any. It was neutral. Now, there are other studies where the neutral group actually lost conditioning. At the Monroe Institute, we use our imagination combined with our intention to impact our physical world. So I've just given you research to support it. And then I know from personal experience, so many of our participants know from personal experience that we can use our minds to impact our physical world. So it's not just the body; it also can be our environment. As an example, one of our most popular programs, MC Squared, we include demonstrations with random number generators. Yes, we can actually influence random number generators. We can influence dice; we can light fluorescent lights with our hands. We can actually help seeds grow better than the control group. And of course we can bend spoons. So we've had some pretty amazing outcomes and indications where you can make these changes in the physical world and with your physical body. So what I love about MC Squared and other programs like it is that it's helping you have the experience of that shift, not me just sitting here telling you about it. On those same lines, something that fascinates me is the multiple personality research. Just think about this a minute. You've got one human being, one body, and you have three personalities that dominate, at different times, this one body. So one personality might be right-handed; one personality might be allergic to wheat or dairy. Another personality needs medication for depression. Same body. Just think about this, how quickly one personality takes over the next, it's instantaneous that the body does something else because of the mind's direction. So to me, that's just mind-blowing. My takeaway is that our self-talk is an important contributor to our overall health and well-being. Something else you might not have thought about is a disturbance in the energetic field can manifest into the physical body. So what's out there hanging out in your energetic feel, especially if it's off balance, out of whack, it can certainly manifest into a physical condition. So this is something that we can help ourselves. We can regularly do check-ins with our energetic body. One of your meditations is designed to do just that. And I suggest you do it regularly so that you form a habit. And you can even, if you're like, I don't have time, you can at least while you're still in bed, right after you wake up, just you know, just pay attention and think about, hmm, how are things going with my energetic body? But with the meditation you're going to have access to, you'll actually be able to have more of a two-way communication so that you're getting feedback and understanding. Other suggestions are just tracking your energy throughout the day. That's where you can use a technique I call "heal and balance" where I just take my hand, and I run it down the central core of my being, of my center here. And that's over your energy centers which some people refer to as chakras. And then as you do it, you make the intention, and you state, and it can be in your mind; you don't have to say it out loud, "Heal, balance, heal, balance, heal, balance." And that's another way to just start your day off really well or do it throughout the day when you're feeling out of balance. Another way to do this, to help your energetic body be healthy is to release what no longer serves you. Just being a person, living out your day, there are always things happening that you really probably need to release at some point, whether it's interactions with others, whether it's self-criticism, whether it's about forgiveness, there are things that you need to release. So we have a very short meditation that you can incorporate, I even suggest, in your daily practice to help you release what no longer serves you. And I have a wonderful story about this. One time I had a participant tell me about her father. They were in Ireland. He was about to go into a nursing home. And the reason he was going into a nursing home was because he was no longer able to take care of himself. He was going to need home care or to move to an assisted living place. And so the daughter, 'cause they had to make arrangements, she decided, well, in the meantime, I'm going to help him out. She knew all about sound technology, and she had him listen to a daily meditation about releasing what no longer served you. He did it for a month, and at the end of the month, he had made so much progress that he didn't have to go into the assisted living home. And he actually packed his bag, jumped in his car, and traveled around the island to visit friends who he hadn't seen in a long time. Another interesting thing about this though, it did manifest into the physical. There were before and after pictures, and the after pictures showed a lot of his age spots had disappeared. There's one more tip I have for you. I highly recommend that you include a daily act of forgiveness that includes forgiveness of the self and others because it is so vital to your well-being to not hang on to those grievances. We'll talk more about this throughout the Quest. So here's what I recommend you do today. There's several meditations that you can use and experience, and I think they'll help you have a better grasp of the subject I've been talking about for this session. Enjoy.

====================

LESSON 6: Meditation - Knowing Yourself as Energy

So welcome to this meditation in which we will be exploring ourselves as energy beings who have a physical component. And we will do this by connecting with our three major energy centers and exploring how our energy can extend beyond the skin line of our physical body. And my invitation to you is to just sit reasonably upright, comfortably upright, if you will, just as you've probably done for other practices, just straight in a natural way, relaxed, alert, and probably if you're a beginner, or even if you are not, it's best to do this exercise with your eyes closed. 

However, if you are very tired, you can just find a spot in front of you, just somewhere to focus and just let your eyes rest in that focus on that spot, almost sort of looking through that spot so that your eyes are just resting. Now, I'm going to assume for this rest of this recording that indeed your eyes are closed, but it really doesn't matter. What I invite you to do is just to make sure that you are reasonably comfortable as you are sitting alert and relaxed. And just to begin by listening very intently to the sounds around you. You can hear my voice and sounds in your headphones, and you can maybe notice sounds outside of that, whether that's inside or out of the room, really doesn't matter whether it's a conversation or traffic noise or just the sound of an air conditioner. It's all the same for our purposes. So just attending and listening, beginning to sense, kind of comfortable, solidity perhaps in your body as you just rest very much an attitude of nothing to do, nothing to accomplish, nothing to achieve. And then taking that quality of listening, taking that quality of really attending maybe just for a moment or two, placing that on the breath. Now, I want you to observe the breath comfortably. There's no need to control the breath in any way. Rather allow it to guide you and to connect you to more than just air. 

Perhaps you can even begin to get a sense comfortably with the energy within the breath, allowing yourself to feel more connected to the energy of the universe and respecting however that experience turns out for you. 

And as you do that, it becomes easier and easier to become aware of the way your body feels, the weight and warmth of your limbs, the sense of space around you. And you may notice the temperature of your skin or the temperature of the air as it enters and leaves your body, noticing how the breath connects you to the space around you. And then all I invite you to do is just to become aware of your weight on the seat or wherever you are sitting, weight, going down through that seat to a point where you really feel that connection and your belly. 

You may even want to just place your hands gently, slightly below your belly button, two or three finger widths below, just imagining the breath coming into that part of you. That's right. So just following the breath down and becoming very aware of the sensation in this part of your body, feeling all the way down to the perineum, all the way down through the body. Now, if you're good at visualizing, that is to say, if you visualize well, you might want to imagine a ball of energy and you could make that whatever color you like and just imaginatively connecting the breath with that ball of energy in this space and just sensing into this warm light space. And this center very much has a quality, somewhat like a mysterious strength of a mounting cave, and letting all of our weight now flow through this space to the ground, really just resting, just allowing everything to be exactly as it is, watching sounds come and go, allowing sounds to move through this space, allowing sensations to come and go. Likewise, letting thoughts come and go whenever you need to, you can simply return your attention to what in some traditions they will call the one point. 

Now we can include the heart center. So bringing our awareness into the middle of that space in our chest, and just sensing into this part of this, again, you might visualize a ball of energy or ign of flower, a lotus made of light where you might just feel into this space, maybe even gently placing your hands over this area and feeling that sense of aliveness, feeling the aliveness of your heart. Maybe just taking a moment now to think of something that makes you smile. It makes you feel good or pleasant. Memory perhaps, or even a word like love or compassion or 

Care, 

Or perhaps just the image of a friend's face. It doesn't have to be anything grand, just something that connects you to a sense of lightness and responsiveness. And notice that sense of responsiveness as you bring that memory or thought or phrase or image to mind. Connecting easily with a positive emotion that you associate with that thought or memory or image. And still being aware of your weight. Going down into the pelvic bowl, feeling that center supporting this heart center, both centers aligned, one resting supported by the other. Now, you can also become aware of your head, aware of your eyes, maybe aware of the space in the middle of your head, just behind that classic third eye position. You might even want to gently touch your finger to the center of your forehead and to feel that inside to the middle of the head. Just sensing the awareness behind your eyes, noticing perhaps how the awareness behind your eyes is connected to your awareness of your heart and to your awareness of the one point. And within this center, we can notice a sense of expansion of clarity. In the meditation tradition, there is an old metaphor or phrase that I really like, and it goes like this body, like a mountain heart, like the ocean, mind, like the sky. And it can sometimes be useful just to imagine a clear blue sky extending in every direction, a warm 

Blue sky, 

Anything that comes through that sky, clouds of thought or emotion or sensation. It doesn't really matter that sky is never disturbed. And also you can call light to you. I think most of us have an instinctive sense of this just calling the light. Just imagine the clear light of this expansive space entering your body, filling your body with light, flowing in every cell, around every cell from the tips of your toes to the crown of your head so that every molecule, every nerve, every fiber filled with light, even the breath filled with light, and that light radiating naturally around you like a natural kind of shimmer. Once again, just being aware of this center resting over the heart, which is resting over the belly, and just allowing all of these three centers to compliment and support each other to a whole column of aliveness, to support you just resting in this, nothing to achieve, nothing to accomplish, just allowing everything to be as it is. 

Thanks, excellent. And as you do that, you can just prepare now to return to normal awareness, normal waking consciousness with an intention of bringing back every sense of groundedness, expansiveness that you may have discovered or reconnected with, maybe even bringing back a new sense of yourself. Because in this exercise, we certainly don't want to produce anything. We are just reconnecting. And so when you are ready, you can maybe take a few deep breaths gently, and you can maybe begin to gently just softly touching your face, having a little wriggle, just moving gently, giving yourself a moment just to fully reorientate. So you are all the way back now in normal waking awareness refreshed and energized, excellent. And the more often you do this particular practice, the more you will gain from it.

====================

LESSON 6: Meditation - Relax, Release and Transform

In this meditation we're going to meet with some aspect of ourselves or of our lives that we wish to transform. This may be something simple or something profound. It may be as simple as a habit that we have struggled to change, or it may be an aspect of ourselves that we struggle to love or to like. Whether it's something small or something deeper, Whatever you choose to work with, you can just rest assured that it's the right thing for you at this time. Whatever it is, it will be part of your idea of yourself. But you are not your idea of yourself. Just as a sword can never cut itself, so you can never know your true nature through these ideas and thoughts about yourself. So now... Simply allow yourself to relax as best you can, and pay gentle and kind attention to your breath. Just allowing your breath and everything else to be exactly as it is in this moment. And every out breath can release tension and stale energy, so that little by little, every muscle, every nerve can begin to let go. And as you relax, just allow my voice and the sounds to support you. Allow my voice to guide you deeper into that space of letting go. Because with your eyes closed as they are, it's just easier to begin to notice those thoughts and those feelings and sensations that let you know more about letting go. As if some part of you was calling you down to a place of stillness, a place of ease and spaciousness where even the effort it might take to notice which arm or which leg was relaxing the most completely or the most quickly might seem like it's just too much effort to even bother making and just resting and drifting comfortably in this space. And as you notice that and listen to the sounds, it becomes easier now to identify that thing that you wish to transform. Some aspect of your character or behavior that you are unhappy with. Perhaps you don't seem to be able to control or work with it. Or some situation that you wish you could turn up in differently. Maybe you want to stand up for yourself more. for someone else or perhaps there's someone you want to be a little softer with or maybe there's a habit that you just want to be rid of and I'll be quiet now for a short time so that you can discover what it is you wish to work with today and now that you have decided to work with some aspect of yourself in this way notice how this aspect feels just like a part of you, just the sort of thing where you might say, I am just whatever it is, or I always do whatever that is. But it isn't part of you, just a part of your idea of yourself. And as easy as it is to say, as easy as it can be to do, you can now just relax. that resistance to letting that part of you go and discovering what will take its place, discovering what it will be transformed into. And to help you with this you can begin now to sense getting in touch with your deeper guidance, your higher self and all the other beings from beyond the physical who are offering you that unconditional love and support. to imagine yourself surrounded by these beings in a beautiful place, where there's something about the light, the sounds, the smells and the feel of this place that lets you know you are completely safe. And as you receive their support and guidance, you can experience this in many different ways. Or maybe there will just be a sense of direct knowing, or an impression of a colour or sound. or a feeling that just seems very meaningful in some way even if you can't quite translate that into thoughts just yet stay with it stay connected to it it could also be an image or a picture that symbolizes this meaning in some way and as you receive this you can just relax all resistance to letting the problem whether it's a habit a part of your character, whatever it is, just letting it go out of you. right now, right out of you, now. You can feel that resistance leaving in some way. And as that becomes stronger in your experience, you can discover, begin to discover, a new sense of yourself beginning to arise now. And I don't know exactly how, just a sense. Being someone new, but somehow, truer to your real identity, to your individuality. Very much a sense of your own distinctiveness, a fresh sense of yourself, fresh and new. Now just imagine yourself in some situation where that old aspect of you would have been causing some discomfort. Take this new sense of yourself into that situation, learning to become gradually more and more comfortable with this new sense of yourself. Notice what changes in your behavior. Notice what changes in your communication to others and to yourself. Notice how different your energy feels. And you can be curious to discover more and more of the changes that living from this new sense of yourself will bring. Now it's time to return. So just reconnecting with the breath. with the body and beginning to feel yourself fully at home, bringing back with you this new sense of distinctiveness, allowing it to permeate every cell, every fibre, every nerve. As you take a few deeper breaths, the more you feel that lucid clarity, feeling energised. Gradually, but definitely now, bringing yourself back to normal waking awareness, normal everyday consciousness. Maybe taking a few deeper breaths, a little wriggle, gently moving, wiggling those toes, fully back in your body, with a fresh sense of yourself as you awaken now, into normal everyday consciousness, feeling refreshed, energized, and feeling really excellent, well done.

LESSON 7: Vibrating With Love: Finding Your Emotional Frequency
--------------------
<v ->So Allyn, let's talk about love.</v> <v ->Okay.</v> <v ->So I think sometimes people set themselves up</v> for failure when they're trying to connect with a loving connection, whether it's with somebody else or with themselves, because there's a mismatch between their ideas on love and what they actually find. So what can you say about that? What are we going to be covering in this section? <v ->Well, that's a really good point</v> because it is, love is about a flow. It's not about being able to grab something. A lot of us think we know what love should feel like, and we're usually wrong, and so it's more about focusing on the self, opening up the channels to receive and attune to that frequency of love. It's always there. It's always open, and we just get in our own way when we define it, when we seek things that we think will make us feel loved just for the seeking of it. So again, it's a...it's an energy. Then once you open up yourself, you're going to receive more, and we're all right as we are, like, it's not about fixing anything about ourselves to be loved and to experience love. So that's the main subject. Maybe it's time we rethink how we define the meaning of love. If you take the dictionary meaning, "an intense feeling of deep affection," then we are focused on the labeling of a cluster of emotions only. I feel affection towards you, so I must love you. I mean, that's basically what we're saying. Instead, let's broaden how we think of it. Love is a state of being. Love does not come from thinking, from the mind. It comes from the heart. And when you go through life living from a place of love and appreciation for others, love continually just flows back to you. At Monroe, we consider love as a frequency, and it's something that we can attune to. This helps us move beyond conditionalities and means it's something we need to cultivate; it's something we can attune to. And again, that connection is always there. It's always flowing to you. And if we think about this in a conditionality way, you might feel love is cut off. You might feel love is not always there, and that's just simply not the case. Author David Hawkins tells us, and I, I'm going to paraphrase this, love takes no position and therefore has no positionalities. Love is inclusive. Love focuses on the good in life, no matter the expression. That's a real important piece of this. Love dissolves negativity versus attacking or judging it. Again, if you're in the state of love, you can reposition things, look at them differently, and be more accepting. So let's get into the details. Love and fear are opposite and mutually exclusive. So what does that mean? Elizabeth Kubler-Ross was a longtime friend of Bob and Rose. She's famous for her work in grieving. She believed that emotion either comes in love or fear. So it's not two things that can be happening at the same time. As you experience your reactions to situations or, or people, you can run your emotional response by this question: is it fear? If you start doing this on a regular basis, again, I'm going back to awareness here. When you become aware of your questioning about love, just reflect and think about "Is the way I am feeling here fear-based, or is it from love?" And this can help you move more into that state of love as a frequency. Now, something you can try that can get you more toward that unconditional loving state is called unconditional friendliness. And this is a way to move yourself closer to that concept of unconditional love which is really hard for us to do. So here's the deal. If you step into this, that means you love without condition; you love without expectations. And again, take a second or two to think about this. Are you really able to love without conditions and without expectations? Again, it's not easy to do. How do you do this? You can cultivate conditional friendliness. This concept was introduced by Pema Chodron, a Buddhist nun, who introduced the concept to her readers in a book titled "How to Meditate." So what exactly is this? And you know, how do we do it? It's very similar to unconditional love, but it's an easier place to start. As I said before, unconditional friendliness means that no matter what the other person does, the unconditional friend will be there, will be there for that friend. Even when you disagree or you don't support what the person is doing, if you are an unconditional friend, you'll not walk away from your friend no matter what's happening. And no matter if you think they're making really bad choices, you're in there with them without expectations or conditions. Like I said before, it's very hard for most humans to actually tap into unconditional love for others. Although it's interesting because the total self does it all the time. Some people refer to the total self as the higher self. That's just a love fest going on all the time. You don't have to do anything to yourself. You don't have to change anything about yourself for your total self to love you. You're already perfect and wonderful, right as you are, right now. It's the individual self, the personality self, that has trouble with this type of love. So the carrot in front of you is to do the best you can to move in the direction of unconditional friendliness. So how can you grade it? There's no strings attached. You offer love openly and freely. It's not about getting a payoff in return, and your greatest desire for the person is their well-being. Nothing more, nothing less. Another key point to consider in this session is forgiving ourselves is a foundational step. You really need to do that to be able to step into that space of love in a more powerful way. The more you choose to forgive, the more this will become a natural state of being for you, meaning you're more likely to choose it again. There's a popular therapeutic model called "The 4 Rs of Self-Forgiveness," and I'll just go over those with you. And these could give you some kind of method or way to work through this idea of self-forgiveness. So number one, you take responsibility. You accept what has happened. I mean, we're humans. We're going to make mistakes; we're going to hurt people. We just need to take responsibility so we can move on to the next step which would be remorse. Now, remorse doesn't have to be this deep grieving, it's just "I'm, I'm sorry for what I did." You're saying this to yourself, and even though this particular therapeutic model says use the guilt to move you into position of better behavior, that's not how I look at it. How I look at it is just be remorseful, and then release it. And then you can step into restoration. You can make amends with whomever you're forgiving, even if it's yourself. Finally, step number four is renewal. You learn from the experience, and you grow as a person, and hopefully you're doing that all throughout your life. Another key piece in this session is that forgiving others is important. Now, it's not always an easy thing to do, especially if we've been physically, mentally, emotionally, or spiritually hurt or injured by the actions of others, or it's our perception that that has happened. So what can you do? This is when we go back again to awareness. I'll keep saying awareness, awareness, awareness. Because once we're made aware, again, we're more readily able to change our behaviors, our reactions, our thoughts. So what you can do is choose to recontextualize the way you are, understanding the way you are perceiving what happened. This will help you move your position to stop categorizing something as good, bad, right, or wrong. This also will move you away from criticizing yourself and others, and it can help move you beyond being angry about the situation as well. This is something I found interesting because I witnessed it in myself. As I turned more toward this loving energy, I realized that I was shifting from being a judger to an evaluator. I used to judge everyone and everything by my self- imposed measuring gauge. "Well, that person's weird." "That dress is ugly." "Can you believe what she just did?" I was always like looking at people's actions and behaviors and saying, "That's not right. I would've done that better. What's wrong with them?" And again, as you step more toward this frequency of love, as you attune to it, you find yourself being very accepting. You're not picking out individual characteristics or looking at actions that people do in a negative, critical way. But you still have that evaluator hat on because you want to evaluate: "Oh, I think I would enjoy spending more time with that person." It's an evaluation. It's not a judgment. So it's interesting how doing this can be a natural effect of moving you to the evaluator. I imagine a lot of you are very hard on yourselves. It's a, for some reason, I don't know why, it's a natural thing for us to do, and we tend to really focus on all the things we're doing wrong, all the things we think look bad, all the things that we are concerned about that most people aren't even paying attention. Over time, as you continue to focus on moving toward being more loving to yourself and to others, more forgiving, more accepting, then you will realize that you can move more and more away from wearing the judger hat, and you can become the evaluator. Now, of course, we need to evaluate and review. That's just common sense, keeps us out of danger for starters. But what I discovered is that I was able to move towards having a more loving attitude for others and myself. And I think that's the gift here, and that's the direction you want to go. Something else that happened was I noticed that I found myself surrounded by people who are more loving and kind to me, and this is why every heart in the place of safety opens up immediately. That is such a key piece here. When people feel safe, when they don't feel like they're being judged and criticized, they open up; their heart opens up immediately. Unconditional friendliness offers safety. How do I move towards a more loving state of being? Well, here's where it gets a little woo woo, maybe. I believe we can all step into a more loving vibration by actually making decisions and taking actions that are helping us raise our energetic vibrational rate. And I'm just going to give you some ideas about that. There's so many more things you can do, but I'm just picking a few. You can change what you say to yourself. So again, awareness: "I'm being critical." And turn your talk to positive or neutral. Stop gossiping. And I know that's so much fun, but that really keeps you in a negative space, a judger space. You got to, you've got to judge to gossip. Feeding birds and other creatures. That's another way to move you toward that loving state. Let people go ahead of you in traffic, and I know that's probably one of the hardest things to do. Watch funny movies that make you laugh out loud. I've always said if I ever had a serious diagnosis or illness, I would be watching over and over, serial watching funny things so that I could laugh my way to health. Be kind to people. You know what? I think that's the most important one. If you catch yourself not being kind, again, going back to awareness, then ask for forgiveness or apologize. And you don't have to do this using your words. You can just think of it in your head. You can think, "Cancel, cancel. Ooh, I didn't mean to have that thought. That thought was not intended." So just walk it back. Do your best to be kind, generous, and loving to all you meet. And I'm only naming a few. Another key point I want to make is with awareness comes power and impact. So something that comes with awareness, and what I mean by that, when you really step into awareness and understand what you're doing, then you also have the responsibility for your words and deeds. Now, I'm not trying to add guilt here or more stress, but it just means that now you know it's your responsibility to be more mindful. And like I said, back it up. Bring it back. Ask for forgiveness; send loving thoughts so that you are stepping more toward that loving energy. Something else to consider is love isn't a gushing emotion; rather it's an energy and a frequency. I've said that in other ways, but here I'm trying to make the point that it is an energy and a frequency. This isn't about putting on a show, "Oh, I love you! I love you!" Or, I'm giving you flowers so that you'll love me. Love is best received by the receiver if it's heart-focused and sent out with good intentions of support and appreciation. So it's more, again, about that flow of heart to others that's open, that's truly loving without condition. It's foolish to think that your judgments of others are not being perceived by the people you are judging. It is picked up on some level, and they will respond accordingly. They just know it. They don't know how they know it, but they know something's not right. Something else to think about is it's important to shift your criticism or hurt feelings to a loving perspective. This again is back to, I'm made aware of this, so I'm trying to change it to put it more in that positive loving place to take me out of loving with expectations. The reverse side of this is that when you know that you are on the receiving end of someone being upset with you, mad at you, et cetera, you can actually be the creator of an energetic shift with your loving thoughts whenever you are in that person's presence. Or when the person comes to mind, say in your head, I know that might sound silly, but just say in your head, "I love you. I love you, I love you." I actually was in a situation for an extended period of time where someone was very angry at me, and there was nothing I could do about it. There was not anything I could say that they would hear me say it, and I really just had to be quiet and listen. And as I was listening, I would just say, "I love you. I love you, I love you" in my head. I really do think that was key to helping the situation shift more quickly than it might have otherwise. So pivot your own criticism of their behavior, like what they're doing to you. It looks wrong; it feels wrong; it feels bad, but turn it towards understanding and empathy. Why is that person doing that? Why is that person projecting on me? Why can that person not hear me? Well, they have reasons and they're good reasons, good reasons for them. So I can accept and I can just say, "I love you. I love you. I love you." Another way to frame it is you can look at the person who's projecting again on you or upset with you, ignoring you, shunning you; there is something at play here I don't know or understand, versus I hate that blankety blank. You know, again, bring it back to love. So focus on sending love and gratitude to all you meet, despite what your logical mind is reporting to you about the person or the person's response to you. That's the biggest way to move forward. So let's move to what you can do now as you begin to investigate the meditations associated with this session. So there are several; like we've said before, you can just listen to the ones that are most appealing to you. Do them in the order that you want, and you don't have to finish them all before you go to the next lesson. Also, I invite you to journal and notice when you're applying conditions of worth to yourself and others.

====================

LESSON 7: Meditation - Enhance Relationships

<silence> 

So this exercise, this meditation is designed to help you deepen, create and relationships. And we're all relational beings. Without others, we couldn't know who we are. So in order to improve all relationships, the one that's most important to develop, to cultivate, to strengthen is our relationship with ourselves. And we need to relate to ourselves and others from a place of unconditional friendliness. And there's a part of us that does relate like this. And we're going to make contact with that part, that aspect of our true nature, so that we can find out how that part of us views all of our relationships, both positive and problematic. 

So in this meditation, we'll be learning to come from this place of unconditional friendliness in regard to four stages, firstly, ourselves and then a friend, and then a neutral person. And lastly, somebody we struggle with or find problematic in some way. Now, these can be external people or they can be aspects of ourselves, the part of us we really like, the part we're neutral about, and the aspects of ourselves that we don't like. And I recommend that you try both of these options at different times. And lastly, we'll connect with that natural expansiveness of this state and extend it to as many people as possible, as many beings as possible. The only limit is our imagination. So now I invite you to get comfortable, as comfortable as possible. This exercise is best done with your eyes closed, so just letting those eyelids gently close. Now, that's it. 

And just spend a few moments sensing your environment, feeling the weight, the shape of your body, noticing any obvious tensions. And there's no need to do anything about that just yet. Just simply and gently be aware. And I invite you to listen really intently to the music, to the tones, to the sound of my voice as if you were trying to listen beyond those sounds to another sound that was so faint, so soft, and listening even beyond that and seeing if you can notice the silence that all of these sounds are happening in noticing the silence from which sound arises 

Before you relax really deeply and focus in a profound and strong way. Let me repeat to you, a great exaltation of a great Tibetan meditation master do not force the mind. So sometimes your thoughts may wander, and that's okay. They can always wander back, and my voice is here to guide you. And you might just imagine a real sense of ease. You might just picture something in your mind that gives you that sense of ease, perhaps a beautiful scene in nature, or just thinking about how a cat looks when it's relaxed, and just getting a sense of resonance with that, really getting a feeling for the quality of ease and relaxation. That's it. If relaxation had a color, what would it be? If it had a texture, what would it be? 

Would it be smooth? Would it be soft? If it had a temperature, what would it be? Would it be warm or pleasantly cool? Whatever that is for you. Just imagine that floating and drifting around those arms, those legs, all the way through that body with every easy breath, as if every note, every sound, every tone just spreads that ease in its own time and in its own pace through your body in the most appropriate way for you. And we will begin by just journeying as it were, to find that peaceful heart, the friendly and kind part of ourselves. 

And sometimes people may make the mistake of thinking, they must experience some big gushing emotion. And it often is unlike that, although it can be a profoundly moving experience, it can also be subtle. And if you've ever just smiled at someone across the street for no good reason at all, just for the sheer joy of it, just think about that. That's the feeling you're looking for, and that's the feeling that is there. You don't have to produce it merely tune yourself to it. And one way you can begin to do that is perhaps to remember a time when you were by yourself feeling really good, and maybe you were looking out to see, or you were just relaxing, listen to music, just feeling really, really good, happy, excited, maybe be or just good, whatever that means to you. Because there are no conditions attached to your true nature's appreciation of you to your true nature's concern and love for you. You don't have to earn this affection. You don't have to think in a certain way or behave in a certain way. You are enough as you are right now. I, and you could also bring your attention to the area over your heart, if that feels helpful. And I'll be quiet for a while now while you just enjoy and get to know this space. 

Now, I'd like you to bring to mind a friend of yours, someone you find it easy to like to appreciate. Preferably someone who's a peer, not someone you look up to, someone you have no romantic or erotic feelings for. But the most important thing is someone you really enjoy spending time with, sharing their company. They make you feel good because they relate to you in the same way that your inner being, your true nature relates to you. You feel that sense of unconditional appreciation. Now you can return it to them. And you might just remember a time when you were together that felt really good, or you might just say the name in your mind and savor that we might just use a simple affirmation. I hope they're really happy. May they have everything they need. I hope they get everything they want for no good reason at all other than just being them. And find the part of you that agrees, that rejoices in them. And again, I'll be quiet just to allow you to get to know and recognize this space. 

Now, let's work with someone neutral. Somebody you just see at a bus stop or at the checkout at the store, someone you have no particular feelings for. Just thinking about that person, that being now and tuning into that part of you again, notice how your true nature wants them to be well, to be happy, recognizing them as a fellow human being. And for no other reason than that, may they be well. May they be really happy and have everything they want and need. May they be loved. And you can repeat these affirmations and you may get the feeling of them straight away, or they may turn up later. It really doesn't matter. But again, I'll leave you now in silence to explore this space. 

Now, let's choose someone who's a little more challenging, someone who we find it difficult to like maybe someone who's unpleasant towards us. And to begin with, choose someone where your slightly negative feeling is mild. And with practice you can choose someone more challenging. But for now, take a moment to think about this and now connect with that feeling for yourself with that unconditional friendliness and appreciation and just allowing yourself to flow back into that space and notice how this part of you feels about that person, how it still wants them to be. Well, even if it would like them to behave differently, still wants them to be happy, even if it's just in ways that don't annoy you. 

And now just doing your best to extend the unconditional friendliness. And if other emotions come up, if you find yourself getting agitated or angry or feeling hurt, that's just fine as well. You can just allow all those feelings to come and go or just go back to the first or second stage to reestablish yourself in this feeling. And it's about understanding that when you feel negative towards someone, it does nothing to them. The only person that feeling causes any pain to is you. So holding onto that is really adding insult to injury. And you don't have to like this person just finding the part of you that wants them to be happy, even if it's on another continent, the aspect of you that wants them to not suffer, may they have everything they want and need in ways that don't harm or annoy others. And I'll be quiet now to let you explore this space. 

And I invite you now to come back to that first stage and just reconnect with that feeling of unconditional kindness and friendliness for yourself. And then just imagine all four of you together, you, your friend, the neutral person and the person you don't like, that you have difficulty with. And just notice how an unconditional friendliness can flow equally to all of you. Just spend a little time here and now just imagine that radiating out beyond the four of you to everybody in your physical location just radiating out now throughout all time and space in whatever way that makes sense to you. 

Now it's time to return. In a moment, you'll hear me count from 10 to one. And when we get back to one, when you hear the count of one, you can be back all the way to normal waking awareness, feeling refreshed and energized and ready for the rest of your day. So as a count now, 10, just a nice deep breath in and gently, maybe a little movement, a little rocking of the body, just more aware of the room around you. Nine, another nice easy breath. That's it. Eight. All unnecessary relaxation beginning to leave you now seven, six. Another nice deep energizing breath. And you might want a little wriggle or a little stretch. And five, four, just coming all the way back. Now three. Another deep breath in, noticing everything around you becoming sharper and crisp and clearer. And two, just back more and more. Now one all the way back one. One just opening your eyes gently now and you'll get the most from this practice by repetition can be really transformative to all of your relationships. Just recommended that you practice with this regularly. Welcome back.

====================

LESSON 7: Meditation - Free Yourself With Forgiveness

As we begin, just take a moment to put yourself in a comfortable position and before you relax really deeply, I want to say a little bit about self-forgiveness. Forgiving yourself can often seem harder than forgiving another, yet it is every bit as important. Individuals who do not forgive themselves often repeat the behavior that causes them guilt. They tend to go through a cycle of continuously feeling guilty and struggling, maybe self punishing, and then being pulled back into the same behavior, then feeling shame and cycle after cycle goes on in this way. Most people tend to be much harsher in their judgment of their own behavior than they are about others. So learning to forgive yourself is an important part of fully taking responsibility for the things about ourselves that we would rather change. 

So now I'd like you to just have the intention to relax and just allow your eyes to close and take a moment to listen to the sounds around you, wherever you find yourself. And I'd like you to listen really intently as if you were trying to hear the softest sound, the faintest sound that you can imagine something very far away. Take that quality of attending intently and I invite you to begin to relax your body simply by allowing things to be as they are. There's nothing to accomplish, nothing to force those arms and those legs, that body already know how to relax perfectly well already know how to let go into deep relaxation and begin to notice those sensations, those thoughts, those feelings that let you know about letting go as you drift down and into comfort. 

And as you do, think about the idea that there's a wiser part of you. Some people might call it their true self, some their true nature or their higher self or their soul. There are many labels. Just know there's a part of you that's wise and that loves you unconditionally. The broader part of you, the deeper part of you. So as you enjoy this relaxed state of being, allow my voice to guide you to just the right state of relaxation, just the right state of receptivity to easily become aware of the presence of this truer inner herself. Just continue noticing how your body can relax even more, even deeper. As you contemplate that what you are doing for yourself is for the highest benefit for you. And as your higher self is always present, whether or not you're consciously aware of it, this part of yourself gives you everything you need. It supports you unconditionally without demand, allowing you to release or dissolve any uncomfortable feelings. 

And you may begin to sense that your body is being surrounded by a golden or white light, the radiance of that true self, that inner being. Some will experience this as a bright light off in the distance, a being of light, perhaps walking towards you, your inner being, your true self, coming to stand with you, to be with you, to merge with you. And others may just feel that radiance that is already here. You may feel that radiance grow within, sensing this glowing light or energy. And take some time to remember the wisdom of your true self to remember who you really are. And as you rest in this, you may notice that this light is full of wisdom, full of healing. Intelligence. Know that it is always surrounding you and always does. You're just not normally aware of it. But from now on, whenever you think about this, you can cause your experience of the presence of your true being, your higher self, to be so much more available to you, so easily available to you, so much richer and so much deeper as you learn to trust more and more in your own goodness. 

Notice how this aspect of you, this deeper part of you views the things you wish you could forgive yourself for with utter compassion and with love and seeing them for what they are. A mistake, a mistake in action, a mistake in thought that resulted because you were disconnected or separated from this deeper part of you. Now supporting you can allow that to help you replace guilt or shame with understanding and really deeply understanding now the sense of knowing how you want to behave in the future. If you're ever in a similar situation, if you remember an incident where you hurt someone else in some way, you could ask that someone silently, mentally for their forgiveness, being willing to receive in this inner world, in this inner plane, regardless of what happens in the outer, it's as if your true self is asking their true self. And shifts can occur. And you could take a moment now to think about all the things that this incident has taught you now that you can deeply lovingly understand. It makes it possible for you to now change. Change how you view it, change how you experience it. You can put that behavior behind you. I'll leave you for a moment of gentle reflection. And when you hear my voice come back, we can go deeper still into this journey. 

And now that you understand a little more about what you need to forgive, it was just a result of being disconnected from your deeper wisdom. You had different understandings at the time, and they're not the same anymore. Now. Feel the guidance of support of that part of you deeply, still strongly connected to the radiance of your true self, your higher self. And just rest in that feeling for a little while longer. 

And then you can just rest in the implications, not trying to make sense of everything you've experienced, just feeling the resonance and strongly connecting with a part of you that's unconditionally loving of others as well as yourself and a part of you that never judges you, never withdraws from you. It is always available to you. This part of you can help you see that behavior is just behavior and it is disconnected from this. And sometimes that unfortunately causes pain to you or others. And that's okay because we all make mistakes. So now it's time to return gently. Let go of this space while feeling your way back into your body, feeling your weight in the chair or on the bed, taking some deeper breaths. Begin to return, stretch your body, move your body while you slowly come back all the way. Take your time to step fully back into waking awareness and more you practice this exercise, the more you will benefit. So slowly, slowly open your eyes and welcome back.

LESSON 7: Meditation - A Journey to Inner Peace With Monroe Sound Science

<silence> 

Let's embark on a path of forgiveness, a journey towards inner peace and release. As we delve into the depths of our emotions, we uncover the wisdom that resides within. Take a moment to relax your body. Take a few deep breaths, and then begin to breathe Normally. Feel the weight of your body grounded and supported. Let go of any tension with each breath you take. In this meditation, we will look closely at the act of forgiveness. It's not about dismissing our hurt, but using it as a pathway to understanding it is okay to experience feelings of anger or resentment for they serve as guides to our inner truth. As we begin, bring awareness to your senses. Listen intently as if seeking the faintest whisper of guidance. Center your attention on the breath, the gentle rhythm of inhale and exhale. Let it guide you to the core of your being, to a space deep within yourself. Where energy resides from this place, shift your focus to the heart. Recall a moment of joy, of love, and let it fill you with warmth. Breathe into the sensation, allowing it to expand. With each inhale and exhale, bring awareness to the space between your eyes, a place of clarity and presence. Feel the interconnectedness of your body, heart, and mind. As thoughts and emotions flow like clouds across the vast sky of your consciousness. 

And now just call to mind a person who you think it is time to forgive. This can be an aspect of yourself. You can forgive that past self in exactly the same way as if it was an individual who you perceive has hurt you. So bring to mind that person or that aspect of yourself. Remember the incident clearly, and allow the difficult emotions to be there as part of your experience. Just accept that feeling for what it is. It might feel heavy, it might feel trapped. Just accept it as it is right now. Realize that the hurt or anger ties you to the person or to that aspect of yourself. It binds you together in a painful way. So it's time now to free yourself to let this connection go. And as you bring the person or the incident, or that aspect of yourself to your mind, notice any part of your body that tightens. Notice it, and now just relax it. Let the tension go. Let the energy of the hurt or anger flow out of you and be replaced with a fresh and new energy. As you navigate the landscape of forgiveness, allow any lingering emotions to find their release, whether they dissipate into the earth, or to solve into the ether. Trust in the wisdom of your inner knowing. Remember, forgiveness is not for the one who caused the hurt, but for your own liberation, embrace the power of letting go and allow peace to be your guide. I will leave you now to be quiet for a while so that you can rest in this process. And you're also invited to think of others you would like to forgive at this time. 

It is now time to move your attention to completely releasing. Just know that every time you do this meditation, you will release more and more. So now just continue to relax. As you fully let go of the feelings and the situation, take a few deep breaths and let them refresh you. As you come back to a waking state of awareness, bring back with you new understanding while leaving any difficult emotions behind. Notice how your surroundings are coming more sharply into focus. You might want to gently move your body by stretching, stretch your arms, and then your legs coming all the way back awake and alert. Welcome back.

====================

LESSON 7: Meditation - Dimensions of the Heart

In this meditation, we'll be exploring the four dimensions of the heart. It's not about creating something new, but rather uncovering and aligning with aspects inherit to your being. This exploration builds upon previous relationship meditations. I invite you to find a comfortable position, preferably sitting upright to avoid drifting off to sleep. Set an intention to remain reasonably still and to fully relax. Take a moment to experience your physical body. Become aware of your posture. Tune in to your current mood and mental state. Notice any discomfort and gently address it without resistance. Allow yourself to simply exist as you are in this moment. Continue to relax and I will join you shortly. Let's begin by delving into unconditional friendliness and important dimension of the heart. As we begin, let's take a moment to connect with the feeling of wishing ourselves well. Allow yourself to relax. Give permission for your muscles and bones to settle gradually. Feel yourself letting go bit by bit. You might find it helpful to bring your attention to your hands, resting in your lap or by your side. Take a moment to focus on the palms of your hands, allowing yourself to be present in this moment. 

Now, imagine a sense of profound comfort emanating from the palms of your hands, as if a warm, soothing light were gently flowing through your body. Feel this comforting energy flowing around you, easing any areas of tension or discomfort, providing support where needed. Allow yourself to be embraced by this comforting presence, trusting that it will continue to unwind any soreness or stiffness as we progress. This requires no effort on your part. Simply let yourself be held by the supportive energy as we move forward Now, as you continue to bask in this sense of relaxation, allow yourself to let go, to let go completely of any self concern. Now you are invited to choose someone you know, perhaps a friend, significant other or family member as the focal point of this meditation. As you do so, simply reflect on a time you spent together, a moment where you felt a genuine warmth and friendliness towards this person. Recall what it is about this person that you admired and enjoyed. Let these qualities and memories feel your mind. Immersing yourself in the feeling of appreciation as you hold their image in your mind. Direct your attention to your heart center. Feel it being supported by a point between your higher and lower abdomen. Allow yourself to deeply connect with this sensation. 

Allow yourself to immerse fully in the feeling of friendliness towards this person. I'll remain silent now, leaving you to dwell in this space. Extend that sense of unconditional friendliness towards this person wishing and wanting the experience of happiness simply because they exist now. Recall a moment when this individual faced a problem or experienced suffering. Notice how you feel a sense of compassion towards the individual you are focusing your attention on in this moment. Feel the natural inclination within you as you offer support and companionship. Feel how your sense of solidarity seamlessly merges and blends with the friendliness and kindness you feel. I will remain silent for a while to give you the space to fully immerse yourself in this experience. Now, continue to focus on this person and recall a time when they experienced great joy. Notice how the part of you that embodies unconditional friendliness responds with profound and sympathetic joy, a joy that arises purely from the individual's happiness without any specific reason other than the joy of witnessing the happiness. I invite you to rejoice in the happiness. Search within yourself for that part of you that feels happiness. Just to support the person you are thinking about. This feeling may be strong or subtle. It can vary each time you engage in this practice. I will leave you some time to hold this space. 

Now. Bring together all these feelings, your friendliness, the joy in this person's life, the suffering and your compassion. Rest with a renewed sense of clarity, allowing this person without judgment or interference. Just simply be present in this moment. Allow the various experiences of compassion to flow within you, encompassing both the suffering and rejoicing. Feel the genuine desire for all to be well and at ease in all aspects of the person's life. Just rest in this space, and I will call you when it is time to return. It is now time to return and reconnect with your body with a sense of the space around you. I invite you to come back more and more to awakening reality. Bring back with you as much of this feeling of love, joy, calmness, compassion as you need. This feeling will remain with you as you return. When you're ready, stretch your arms and your legs. Take a few deep breaths. Open your eyes and welcome back.

LESSON 8: Manifesting Abundance: The Power of Intention and Letting Go
--------------------
<v ->So Allyn, in this section</v> we're going to be talking about manifesting abundance. And I think when people think about manifesting abundance, they think of law of attraction, <v ->Right.</v> <v ->Because it's almost synonymous with</v> how it's often presented. But at the Monroe Institute, we think about it differently, don't we? <v ->Yes, we do. And the key in</v> that statement is we look at it as if I'm, if I'm desiring something, then I want something that I don't have. So when you take it from a perspective of I desire, you're actually putting energetic blocks in front of you, an obstacle that's in the way of you getting what you want to receive. So what I'll be talking to you about in this particular lesson, among many other things to help you manifest and bring things into your life, is let's look at it from a place of choice. What are we choosing? Not what are we desiring that we don't have. I think it's a great lesson, and I think people will really enjoy it. Abundance is not only about material things but rather a state of being. That can also include peace, love, and joy. So I want to help you understand what I believe manifesting is and what it's not. Manifesting is not about having control or getting everything we think we want. It's, it's just not. It's about receiving what is for your highest good and what is best for your self-evolution. I know that can be kind of frustrating, right? 'Cause we want what we want, but of course we can use some of these tools to help us bring in some of our short-term wants and needs that are more materialistic in nature. Manifesting is not magic; it's not wishful thinking. And I think that's where some people get derailed because really it's, you might not like this, but it's just about focus. It really is using focused attention to align your thoughts, your emotions, which would be your feelings, decisions, and actions. So I'm going to tell you a story. I was going through my divorce, and it was a very difficult time in my life. For about seven months, every day I was crying, and it wasn't just crying; it was sobbing. So I needed to help move myself out of that situation. And it's really hard to do when you're hanging around in guilt and shame and that you've, you know, here you are; you've messed up a perfectly good family from the eyes of others. You can use the ideas of manifesting to help pull you up and get you out of there. So what I did is I followed the advice of a good friend of mine who said, "You're in a situation right now. This is not where you're staying. You know, there's no way you can stay here. There's no way you can stay like this because it's just not going to last." So you've got to start thinking about your current situation, especially those of you who are in very challenging situations, that it's not permanent. So you can think of it as, I'm making a trip, I'm going from New York to Arizona, and as I make this road trip, there's so many different views I'm going to have. So as I pull myself out of this situation, there's so many different views that I will be having that look like they're there right now. That's what I'm doing, but that's not where you're staying. So if you can move yourself from this is it; I'll never get out; this is how life's going to be, and know that it's just a temporary place, and you're taking action, and you're focusing in a way that helps pull you to the next viewpoint and then to the next viewpoint. And as long as you're focused and putting your attention there, the viewpoint usually will get better. Another thing I did was, that same friend, she knew all about manifesting, and she told me to make my order to the cosmic waiter. Well, what does that mean? So her idea was, pretend you're in a restaurant, and then go through the motions of ordering your appetizer, your entree, and your dessert. Hand it over to the waiter who's then taking it to the chef, and then you just step back. So at the time, and going back to when I was sobbing all the time, all I wanted was peace. I just wanted peace. So I had to get to peace first, I thought, before I could really get into that bootstrap mode of changing my life. With appetizers, I had a glass of peace. With the entree, I had a glass of peace. With the dessert, I had a glass of peace. And I did this for 30 days. And at about the time that I was ending that, a lady came to our house to sell most of our furniture. We were splitting everything up. My ex-husband and I were still living in the same house with our daughter. And so we were there with her the whole week as she went through our belongings, as she put price tags on them, which is hard to do by the way. And as she was leaving, so she was there for a week, and as she was leaving, she turned around and she said to me, "This is the most peaceful house I've ever been in." Now she didn't know that we were going through a divorce. She didn't know I'd been drinking glasses of peace in my imagination for 30 days. So I am a true believer because I witnessed it firsthand. So here is the main message: you get what you focus on. I am going to say it again. You get what you focus on. There's really no magic. You have a dream or a vision for what you want, and you keep that attention and focus there so that you can move forward and get to that destination. You are choosing to align with what you want by taking action and moving forward. So manifesting doesn't mean you put it out there, and you just sit back. There is some action to take as you see the opportunities open up for you. I mean, the universe will greet you if you've got focused attention and there's a direction to go. What's interesting, and when I've worked with a lot of clients in the past, what I noticed was that so many don't have a plan or idea. They just live their lives, and they might find themselves in careers or jobs. They don't really know how they got there. It was just, opportunities opened up; they took them without rhyme or reason, without concern about their own gifts, skills, talents, their own interests, and they just live. So when we're living that type of life, we simply react to the circumstances going on in our lives without the roadmap. So as long as things are going smoothly, we continue to ride the ride. If we get challenges, upsets, frustrations, we tend to focus our attention there, and we're not actually moving forward in a direction. So guess what? That path is created for you. I have a few tips that I think can help you do this. I said this already, but I'm going to say it again. Focus; focus; focus. Do whatever you need to do to focus on your dream or want. I think it's important to stick to the vision or the original order. Just like when I gave my order to the universal waiter, I took it to the kitchen. I didn't keep calling the waiter back. Asking him to go tell the chef to change it. To fix it. Oh. Is he using this particular ingredient? I'd rather have this ingredient. I didn't do all that. And that's the way to look at it when you're thinking about creating a plan and a destination for your next move. So again, of course making adjustments and corrections is completely fine, but if you're all over the map, you know, if you're not just adjusting the path here and you're, one week, you're, "This is what I'm going to do; this is who I'm going to be; this is where I'm going the next week;" you're going in another direction, the next week in another, then that's not going to get you anywhere. So that's why there needs to be focused attention that's very directed. Here's the part that a lot of people have trouble with, and that is, it's not your job to figure out how, how this is going to happen. Instead, your job is to step into the law of resonance by setting your attention for what you want. So what does that mean? It means stepping in or connecting to the frequency, using your thoughts, emotions, and experiences that will attract you to similar things in the outside world so that you are bringing in through a vibrational energetic effort what you are wanting, needing, or dreaming about. Here's another piece of information that I think is misunderstood when we think about the law of attraction. It's important to shift from desiring something, especially when it turns to a strong desire like a craving. When you do that, when you set something up as "I desire that," that means "I don't have it." The word desire actually means that I do not have it, and it leads to fear. Maybe I'll never get it. So when you're thinking that way, you're actually putting in energetic obstacles for you to get from where you are to where you want to go. Instead, I want you to position your request as something you choose. Now, let's think about that. Why does that shift the energy? Because I'm making a choice that this is what I choose, this is what I'm going after, and it literally removes that energetic fear-based thought of "I may never get it." You've probably heard this quotation said by David Hawkins before: "What we hold in mind tends to manifest." So that brings us back to that idea of focus. Here's another tip. Detach from the outcome. Again, place the order, and let it go. And this is so hard for people to do because you're probably looking at it as a specific thing. "I want it to be this, this, this, and this." "I want it to be this person. I want to pull and bring in this person in my life." Well, that person might not want to be in your life. "I have to have that job. That is what I'm going to have. And if I don't have that, it's terrible." Hmm, well, you might not get that job, but it's really not about a target. What it's about is the essence of what you desire. So again, it's not specific key players; it's not a specific object; it's the essence. So how do we move ourselves to looking at the essence? So an example, instead of patterning for another specific person to be in a relationship, "I want that person and that, that's the only way I'm going to be happy." Instead, stop a minute. What is that person going to give you? What are you going to get from that relationship? Is it companionship? Is it love? Is it support? Is it a friend to hang out with? What is it? You get very clear on the essence of what you want, and that's how you bring it in to your life. And you're not going to know how it's going to show up, and you might not even recognize it for a while, but that's how it'll show up. Here's another tip. You have to take action, but you can also help yourself by getting into a vibrational match, gained through appreciation and the ability to step away from the emotion of desire when you're thinking about what you want. Now, what I love about Monroe sound science is that we have tools that can help you do this, help you get into those states, help you better understand these concepts. You have a set of meditations in this session that'll help you do just that. Okay? What I'm going to tell you now is important. I believe it's important. It was a the biggest game changer for me when it comes to manifesting abundance, when it comes to letting go, which is a key, remember. How do we do that? Really? "I really want that person. I want that person. I don't care." How do I let that go? Well, you can use this mantra, and I'm telling you, it's a big shift. And every time I want something, I'm looking at something with desire primarily. And I say this mantra: "What's mine is mine. What's not is not. What's mine is mine. What's not is not." That's all you need to say, and you will completely shift your viewpoint. Here's a manifesting strategy. If your desires have changed and you're getting feedback results, it is okay to pivot in terms of your wants and needs or what you're choosing. It really is okay. As more information comes in, as you move towards what you're focused on, it can make total sense that you're going to get new information. That means you do need to make changes. I mean, if you stick to that, that plan, and you're not paying attention to reality or what's happening around you, you're really not helping yourself either. So that's when it's a really good idea to be changing, making adjustments: "Oh, that's not exactly what I thought it was going to be. So I'm going to shift over here, but I'm still focused on the end goal." And that's the key here. Now, it's not to say that you lock into something and that's it; you can never focus on anything else. For example, I was going to get a PhD in psychology, and as I went through the beginning motions of that, I realized, Ooh, that's not what I want. And I focused on that for six years. Lot of focus, intense focus. And so I shifted and I got my MBA instead. It's not saying once you make a decision, you're locked in. It's just saying be mindful so that you're not all over the map. You've heard the old saying attributed to Albert Einstein: "Insanity is doing the same thing over and over and expecting different results." So that is why it's good to move and pivot and adjust. There will be times that you need to adjust, to keep moving towards the greater vision or the order that you have given the cosmic waiter. Remember my earlier tip: it's key to trust the process. How it unfolds is not your problem. Just put the order in, and let it cook. I have another manifesting strategy. A way to step more into resonance with what you're wanting is to also focus on cultivating your intuition. So you think about this; if you're tapping more into your total self, that's going to lead you to better understanding of what you really want. Tapping more into your total self, again, some people call it higher self, leads you to a better understanding of what you really want. You're going to get a lot more information about that in the session about connecting to guidance. So we've come to the end of the session. You've got some meditations that will be helping you master this subject. Another key step is to begin keeping track in your appreciation journal because the more we appreciate, the more it can grow.

====================

LESSON 8: Meditation - Abundance Alchemy I

- In this exercise, we are going to explore a couple of key ideas about abundance. And the first of these understandings is to know that your desire is real. Once you have imagined something and you really can't desire something without imagining it, it becomes a reality In the total field of potential. For it to become physically manifest in this space time reality of ours, you have to align up with it vibrationally. So how do you align? Well, one of the things you have to work with is your focus. You need to ensure that you're not focusing on lack on the absence of the thing you desire. Because if you are, then you'll likely get more of that. And people often don't realize that they are in fact focusing on the absence of the thing they desire. They may have a vision board, they may be very clear about what that which they desire looks like. But very often these things just serve to keep them focused on the absence of the thing that they want. And one thing we can do to work against this tendency is to begin by appreciating all that is good in your life. Now, really just take the time to answer these questions. What do I feel grateful for? What in my life do I enjoy most? Who do I love and who loves me? Who, what in my life am I proud of? And with these questions, we can provide a firm foundation of positivity from which to proceed. The only reason we ever really want anything is because of how we think it will make us feel and what it means to us or about us. So that car may mean that you are successful, potent, and free. So the question becomes, how does that feel? And just exploring exactly what you think your desired object or situation will bring to you. What would it really give you? And how does that feel? So now I invite you to just get comfortable and focus on the things that I'm saying while listening to the music and the tones and allowing them to support you. So it's not that there's any particular thing that you have to do, just feeling the weight and warmth of your body, resting in the chair or bed, maybe aware of your breathing, and just finding the most comfortable part of you. And just imagining, only imagining that comfort can drift and float around your body like a smooth and soothing energy drifting and floating around. So that as we go on, without you needing to do anything, you can just allow those muscles to let go a little more with every easy breath. And I invite you now to take one of the things that represents that sense of abundance, of radiance, of a joyful aliveness. And it can be anything at all without limit a material or spiritual goal or accomplishment. It can be that car or a paycheck or a really fun party. Or it could be having some quality that you perceive yourself to be missing. And just imagine the feeling of having already accomplished that when that object is in your possession or that situation, that quality has turned up in your life. How does it feel? What does it sound like and smell like and taste like? What does it look like and what's good about that? Enjoying that feeling, getting to know that feeling. So it becomes like a radio station that you can tune yourself to. And one question to ask that deepest part of you, will you allow this and just look for a heartfelt, a gut felt yes, a a part of you that agrees that it's fine for you to have this because you are worthy and there is nothing you have to do. There are no one else's standards that you have to conform to, no group. You need to be approved by no one else's judgment that you need to appease. You are wonderful just as you are. You are enough just as you are. You are worthy and deserving just as you are this joyful, exuberant, wonderful, abundant feeling can be yours, as can the physical object or situation that matches this feeling. So just look for that sense of yes and sink deeply into resonance with that feeling of abundance. And now you can know that this new request is already on its way and your job now is to allow to stay alert, to remain responsive and flexible and most of all, to stay in this feeling and spend as much time every day in this feeling as you can so that you're appreciative of where you are now. And now just take a moment to appreciate all the good things in your life at this moment, the things that are already excellent. And it's fine to feel that and be eager for what's to come. And just be confident, alert to every opportunity, to every nudge from synchronicity to take that inspired action. And this is why your mood matters, because it tells you how closely attuned to this sense of abundance you are or how far away you are. And it's fine if you're far away, sometimes other things happen and mood is affected, but you can easily tune your way back and reestablish that focus as often as you need to. So now just preparing to take this new energy and understanding into your waking reality. As I guide you, I will count from 10 to one and on the count of one, you will be wide awake, feeling and energized, relaxed and focused, ready for the rest of your day. So now as I count 10, nice deep breath in and starting to feel more energy in your system. And nine and eight, everything clearer and crisper, and seven and six, all unnecessary relaxation leaving you. Now five, another nice deep breath and really beginning to feel that vitality returning to your body.

- Four,

- Three, a little wriggle, a little stretch to feel the body. Really brighten and energize. And two, opening those eyes wide awake all the way back, one all the way back to physical waking reality.

====================

LESSON 8: Meditation - Abundance Alchemy II Advanced Meditation

- The purpose of this exercise is to build upon the last and help you to develop a method for allowing what you want to come to you. Part of this is developing your own language of imagery and symbolism, and before you allow the music and the tones to guide you into a state of deep relaxation and powerful focus, I would just like to draw your attention to something that often sabotages us, which is getting too fixed in our ideas about how this object or this situation or this feeling will turn up in our lives. The universe will bring this to you in its own way, and it's your job to be attentive and flexible and listen to your intuition and take the inspired action that flows from this feeling. This will lead you naturally and easily towards accomplishing what you want. So now take a moment to get comfortable, and it's probably best to do this exercise sitting comfortably sitting up, but if you need to lie down, that's fine too. And I invite you to take a moment to just set an intention to be reasonably still. Obviously if you feel any real discomfort, then move, but move with mindfulness and presence. And I'd also invite you to just listen to the sounds around you, my voice, the music, the tones, and any sounds you might hear from outside through the headphones and listening as if you are trying to hear something very faint and far away. And being aware of your breathing, not trying to control it, just allowing the breath and everything else to just be as it is and the weight and warmth of your body, your general mood, Whether your mind is busy or dull. And it really doesn't matter which it is. And perhaps just using the breath, using that breathing to create the center of this experience. Aware word of the breath coming in and flowing out much as the waves of the ocean roll up and down the beach. Nothing to do or accomplish, just flowing listening. And that in itself will be enough to facilitate the music and the tones in producing a profound relaxation as well as a comfortable, sustainable focus you might want to imagine. Now just think about creating the sense of a perfect place of safety and ease. Becoming curious about this space and this place. You might be something particularly interesting about the energy, the vibration or colors, sounds and smells. Just something that lets you know that it's the right place for you to just let go a little bit more, to go a little bit deeper And you can be or have or do anything you like and you don't have to justify that or explain it to anyone. So now just focusing even more on really becoming established in that feeling. And what I invite you to do now as you focus on that situation, that feeling, that object is just to create in your mind the image of a ball of energy. The ball of energy might just be in your lap, roughly level with the pelvic ball. And you might even imagine holding it in your hands, a beautiful ball of vibrant energy. It can be any color that feels right for you. And some will see this clearly shimmering beautifully. Some will just think about it or just have some sense of knowing that it's there and some will feel it. It really doesn't matter, just as long as you know in some way that it's there. And put all of that feeling into it, all of that feeling into that energy ball. All of the things that you want may be the specific thing that you're trying to achieve. Whatever that looks like, just seeing it go into that ball of energy in any way that makes sense to you now. And anything that you would like to let go of, any doubt or negativity about yourself or some character trait that you think might get in the way, whatever that looks like for you, you can just imagine that going into that ball of energy. And if there is a character trait that you'd like more of, that you think will be part of this journey to, to living in this abundance, well, you can just put that in there too, in whatever way makes sense to you. And you could just see that going through and into the ball. Or you could just know that it's in there Now, really make that ball of energy vibrate at the same frequency so that it feels like something that matches that feeling, that feeling of abundance, of exuberance, that that object, that that situation is merely an expression of that vibration. Just really feel that. And I'll leave you for a short while so that you can do that. Now that you've done that, I want you to bring that ball. Imagine picking it up in your hands, if you will, or rolling it up your body until it's over your heart area. Now imagine that energy going into your heart and imagine that from the heart. Now it's radiating out through all time and space, radiating out and connecting with the universal mind, with the universe, with all that is however you want to imagine the field of pure potential. And you can know that it is already on its way. And your job now is to just allow to stay alert, to stay responsive and flexible and most of all, to stay in the feeling, to spend as much time every day in that feeling as you can so that you are appreciative of where you are now. And just take a moment to appreciate all the good things in your life at the moment, the things that are already excellent. And it's fine to feel that and be eager for what's to come. And just confident, alert to every opportunity, to every nudge from synchronicity to take that inspired action. And so this is why your mood matters, because it tells you how closely or attuned you are to this sense of abundance or how far away you are. And it's fine if you're far away, sometimes other things happen and mood is affected, but you can easily tune your way back and reestablish that focus as often as you need to. So now really spending time appreciating what you have, what is to come. And then when you next hear my voice, it will be to guide you back to normal waking awareness. I will now count from 10 to one, and on the count of one, you'll be back in full physical waking reality, feeling refreshed and energized, relaxed and focused, ready for the rest of your day. So now as I count 10, nice deep breath in and starting to feel more energy in your system. And nine, eight, everything clearer and crisper. Seven, six, all unnecessary relaxation leaving you. Now five, another nice deep breath and really beginning to feel that vitality. Four, three, feeling that vitality coming back into your body a little bit more now, a little stretch already starting to feel really bright and energized. Two, opening those eyes coming back more and more now one wide awake, one all the way back. Now all the way back to full physical waking reality. And just take a few moments to make some notes, writing them down or vocalizing them. And knowing that the more you practice with this exercise to hold that vibration of abundance, the easier, the more effective it will be Become. Welcome back.

LESSON 9: Connecting With Guidance: Reclaiming Your Intuitive Wisdom
--------------------
<v ->In this section, we're going to be talking about guidance.</v> And people have different ideas about what guidance is and how they can receive guidance and attune to guidance, and at the Monroe Institute, it's pretty fundamental; we teach programs on that specifically. But I think it's important to really cover how we're actually receiving guidance. And if it doesn't come in the form of Gandalf, for instance, who's giving you a wise message, then it can come in other ways, right? <v ->Right. And that's what's so,</v> and you know this with participants, story after story, you'll be talking to someone who's had a meditation and they'll say to you, nothing happened. Nothing happened. You start asking questions, and you realize that they've self-selected how this advice or guidance is supposed to show up. It has a certain face; it has a certain look. And if that doesn't happen, they ignore the dude over here talking to them, you know, giving information. So it's, it's a very interesting idea that people have, that it has to come in a specific way. Also, we perceive in totally different ways. You know, you and I have talked about this before, but we are not really visual people. When we're having experiences, we don't see; we are more likely to perceive in other ways. And so that's another key concept that people have to understand so they're not skipping or missing the information. So that's one of the things we'll talk about in this lesson. So we all have access to guidance, from within and beyond the physical. This session will teach you how to connect with your own source of intuitive wisdom. Intuition is a sense; it can be developed and refined through experience. It really is about practice. The total self, the higher self perspective, is vast and very broad based. So it's important that you have your boots on the ground, that you're living and experiencing life. You know, having the experience of being human. Bob Monroe called the experience of living in this reality the Earth-life system. He believed that we continued to return so that we got smarter and wiser. So here's how you can think about it. What do I mean by broader and vast perspective? On a ship, you have a crow's nest. We're going to say that the crow's nest, which is at the top; it's an upper part of the main mast for sailors to use as a lookout point. So consider that the view of the total self. This view offers the widest field, and it helps the captain, that would be you, avoid hazards, ports, opportunities, other ships, you know, everything. The captain is steering the ship, but if the captain's steering the ship, he or she is not perched in the crow's nest. So what we need to understand is that we're not consciously in the crow's nest; that's our total self, but we can gain access through enhanced intuitive abilities through meditation and dream analysis. So that means we can gain information from the total self who's looking out at a broader picture. That way we're getting information on a conscious level that we can do something about. Here's something else I want you to consider. You must never forget that you are not alone. And the more we can step into this crow's nest view, this connection with our total self where it's actually two-way communication, the more we realize this, and we are absolutely sure that we are dearly loved, and we have support. And it's that support that wants to help us live this 3D experience or the earth-life experience as Bob called it. So here's some things to think about. Connecting with something equal to or greater than ourselves is about learning nonverbal communication. So this is a tip to help you be able to do that. Now, why do I say equal or greater to ourselves? That's something that's in an affirmation we use at the institute. And the idea is I'm not here to communicate with something that's not at least equal to me. And actually I don't even say that. Whenever I'm using the affirmation or saying a similar affirmation before I begin meditations, I say greater. I don't want anything equal. I want greater. I want to get really good information. So you start with learning nonverbal communication. At Monroe, we have a program called Gateway. It's our flagship program that helps you delve deeper into the idea. So let me give you an example of what I'm talking about. Nonverbal communication means just that: there's no verbiage, there's no words. It comes in a different form. So that could be a rose; maybe it's a yellow rose; that comes to you as a symbol. Now the way I help myself in this process, like how do you interpret nonverbal communication? That's really the key here for understanding, because if you get information in nonverbal code, it is an interpretation process that you need to go through to get the information. But there are two caveats here because I use dream analysis and dream dictionaries to help me create that nonverbal communication language. So you need to skip over any definition that is superstitious or fear-based. And these dream dictionaries have a lot of that. So just as you're using it as a guide, if you choose to do it, just remove those superstitious or fear-based definitions that are telling you there's doom and gloom in your future because you dreamed about a water hose. A second tip is the dream dictionary is not the be all, end all of unwrapping the meaning of nonverbal communication. You are the lead player here; you're the director; you're steering the ship. You need to rely on what you know about yourself. For example, over the years, I have dreamed many times about my teeth falling out based on the language I have created for myself. And my interpretation of this is: I understand it. My total self understands it. Any source of guidance coming to me understands it. And that's our common language. So let's go back to the teeth. My teeth falling out. What I have learned using a dream dictionary as a way to interpret was probably that means in the last few days before I had the dream, I was giving my personal power away. So you see how this can be helpful; you can use it to interpret in a way that makes sense to what's going on in your life, and it gives you guidance, and that's what you're seeking. Guidance comes to us in multisensory ways, and what I find so interesting, and I've witnessed it over and over again with participants who attend our programs, is that it's often ignored because it's not coming the way that they expected it. So the guidance is not coming in the way they expected it. So since we can get it from so many sources, it doesn't have to be Gandalf walking up to us and telling us what to do. It can come from the TV; it can come from a billboard; it can come from a friend; it can come from another type of guidance that you pick up in meditation. One of the things that surprised me as I've worked with participants over the years is how much is ruled out as not being beneficial because it wasn't delivered in the method or the way that they want it to. So here's where it gets interesting and also very different for each person. Everyone perceives differently. Now you might think that it's supposed to be this visual; it's supposed to be this vision. Like I said before, it's supposed to be Gandalf coming in and talking to you, sitting on a bench talking to you. You might think that that's the way it's supposed to be. Well, that's not really how it usually is. Now it can be; some people can experience it like that, but most of us are perceiving in different ways. We have different strengths. I'm not a visual person. I'm tending to get information either in a clear audio way, which is hearing, or a knowing or even a physical sensation. That's what helps me be guided. Here's another suggestion. You are going to have your own way. And as you start experiencing it, journaling about it, it's really a good idea to take a trial and error approach so you can teach yourself how to interpret, how to use the information coming to you more directly. One of the things I recommend to participants when I'm working with them in a program is that you find your hook. So what does that mean? What's your hook? Well, we all have ways that we perceive that are stronger than others. And so you start paying attention to the subtle ways that you receive information. So an example of that would be, do you get goosebumps? And if you say yes to that, start paying attention to when that happens, what's going on? And you might discover it's a guidance system to let you know something special is happening. Maybe something you just said helped another individual. Maybe what the other person is saying was really important and valuable, loving and kind, you know? So you can find your own ways. Find your own hook. Once you do that, you master that. You get it stronger, then you can step into other ways of perception more easily. Something else to think about is guidance is a jigsaw puzzle. It doesn't always just dump in your lap: there it is, ready to go; okay, I know what to do next. But it could be a "ROTE" as Bob Monroe called it. And a ROTE is something that you get the full download; you can go forward; you can go backward. It's all still there; it's all still retained in your memory. So that could fit that definition. But most of the time that's not what's happening here. You're getting bits and pieces; you're getting breadcrumbs to help you reach the place you're supposed to go. Now again, you're the driver. So this guidance is just guidance. It's just information for you to decipher and decide if it's helpful or if it's what you want to do. There is free will here, remember. So you can use those breadcrumbs to start putting together the puzzle. When you start working with this, and you start developing a language, and then you start developing connections with what you perceive as the higher self, the total self, or guidance, you can create a two-way communication system. That happens. Meaning you literally experience information going back and forth. You can put out a question; you can put out thoughts, and then you can get something back. You get enough, I think, to help you stay on course, to help you consider decisions that maybe you wouldn't have considered. Help you move maybe earlier than you would've moved or pivoted. So that's how that can be helpful. Even if you don't know exactly what it is for decades to come. Again, I think there are significant blind spots that you just don't get everything. And quite frankly, I don't want to know when and how I will die. I mean, I don't want to know that. So I'm glad that there are some blind spots because I also believe in free will. I'm the director here. I don't want to be spoonfed my next moves. I don't want it to be a destination I'm going to because I have to. If I had been able to clearly view into the future the year immediately following my divorce, or even the seven years immediately following that, I probably would've never moved in that direction. But now in hindsight, more than a decade removed, I see that it was a move I needed to make. I wouldn't be sitting here now if I had not made that move. I wouldn't be sitting here living the life I believe has been a part of my life path from the beginning. So as you go on this journey, collecting pieces of the jigsaw puzzle, stay open; be receptive, and try not to judge how it shows up. This is an important piece and something that's not that easy to do and that is to learn to trust the messages that come from your total self, come from your guidance. It really can be difficult to do because you think you're making it up. You think you misunderstood. Maybe there's static in that channel that's sending you information, but you can also take it as a piece of information. Write that in your journal. Then also get information from other sources, from friends, guides, astrologers, if you're into psychics, healers. And then also take in your own conscious self. And as you continue to do this, it'll be more input from your total self. Learning to trust the information you receive is challenging. And I even had that challenge myself. I remember when I was practicing as a reiki master, I did that for about two years. I would get information to help the clients, and that would mean from guidance, maybe from their guidance source or from mine, their total self or from mine. It didn't always happen for every client, but the times that it did, I would always try to share it. As I continued to practice reiki, an interesting thing happened to me, and I started being able to, what I was perceiving was talk to body parts, or they were talking to me. That was weird at first. I'd never had that happen. It just suddenly started happening, and I didn't trust it. So I would get information; I can picture it in my head right now, but I would have these arguments in my head with guidance. "I'm not going to say that. Uhuh. No; no, no; that's crazy. I'm not going to say that." I mean just literally back and forth, back and forth. What I started doing is saying, okay, you're getting this information. You're not going to get it verified if you don't say something. Don't interpret it. It's not my job to interpret it. I'm just going to tell you what I heard. So I started doing that even though I would have those arguments for about five minutes before I would actually do it. So in one particular client, I was standing at her, at her feet, working on her feet 'cause she had some foot stuff going on. She had asked me if I had some perception about a type of exercise that would be best for her with her foot condition. And so I'm concentrating on that. I'm thinking, you know, asking about that. And I hear "hammer," and I'm like, hammer? What kind of exercise is a hammer? And that's when I was going, no, I'm not going to tell her that. So I stored that away. So a little bit later I moved to her crown chakra, and all of a sudden, and I'm, I'm standing there for a little bit, and all of a sudden I hear this voice, and it is so sad, and it is so longing. And it said, "Please, please bring her back to me." And it, it was so sad and, and longing that it, it made me tear up. So at the end of the session, I decide to be brave, and I say, well, the exercise type that I was given was called hammer. I think I probably just said, "I heard the word hammer." And she goes, "Well, I have hammer toe." Hmm, okay. Then when I told her about what happened at the crown chakra, she said, and it obviously was upsetting to her, she said she had been disassociating lately in her waking life. And I didn't know that before. So do you see how that helped me build trust into the information I was receiving? So again, I recognize the challenge of trusting your guidance. I've worked with this for many years. The most effective way that I have found is to journal about it. And if it requires some type of action, act upon it, and then go back and review your journal regularly to see if something came from it. This is another key point of connecting with guidance. Following guidance means my life will be filled with roses and sunshine. Apologies, but I just pulled a switcheroo. Remove that idea forever. But I will say this: I do believe that you handle the vicissitudes of life better if you are on point with your life and your life's work. I also believe that guidance is what helps us get to where we're going in the best way, especially if we pay attention. I'm going to repeat something I alluded to earlier, and that is guidance is not our only director. It can play a significant role. It can be very important. But again, you are the one steering the ship. You have to take responsibility for your own life. Just remember, guidance is about growth of the soul. And growth requires all kind of experiences, the good ones, the bad ones, and the ugly ones. Our lives are designed to offer our souls the highest potential growth during this earth-life experience. And again, that's not always pleasant. And you know, from an external perspective, when you're looking at the world, looking at other individuals, it really doesn't seem fair. But I ask you to consider that on a soul level. It's all balanced; it's all in divine order, and it's the best situation, circumstances, for that individual's growth. Now to support what you've just learned about, you can listen to the meditations associated with this session. I also highly suggest that you have actions for today. Start journaling if you don't already. Note down those experiences of guidance you receive. Capture the emotion, the feeling behind it. Track the information you receive. Are you able to figure the jigsaw puzzle out? Act upon your positive, uplifting guidance, and then of course, journal about it and then return to it so you can help build trust in this two-way communication of guidance.

====================

LESSON 9: Meditation - Connecting With Your Guide

- So this exercise is designed to connect you with your guides. So I invite you to notice where you are right now and just coming into your senses, noticing what's happening in your hearing, in your touch, what you can see behind your eyelids, and coming into the breath where you can center. 'cause it's always with you. And indeed, breath awareness is one of the tools you can use to keep yourself more awake, more present. So if you find yourself drifting at any point during this exercise, then just returning to the centeredness of the breath and allowing that out breath to be a little longer than the in breath is. Working with nice, easy breaths in your own rhythm, at your own pace. And just breathing, just noticing the flow of that breath and just observing and allowing yourself to move into gratitude really of this activity. I am open to receive what I need right now and set an intention. So say in your mind and say to yourself, I connect deeply with my guides. I connect deeply with my guides. And now I invite you to take your thoughts on a journey. Just thinking about somewhere beautiful that you know could be a place in nature. And just be your bedroom. Doesn't matter really. You can receive guidance anywhere, can't you? And just noticing where you are and how you are and what makes this place so beautiful for you. And now move your awareness to your heart center and feel the loving connection that you have with this place. The sense of peace, and somewhere near you. I invite you to create a screen, like a big television screen and a cinema screen just floating in the air. It doesn't matter. And in the screen, in the scene, set the intention to meet with your guides, creating a meeting point of any kind. It could be a cafe with a few chairs around a table or somewhere in nature, surrounded by trees or inside a cave. Whatever you find most appropriate with this encounter, with your guides. And set a really strong intention. Really desire it. Will it to happen That you can act strongly with your guides, that you invite their assistance in this moment, the connection that you might have, something specific that you'd like to ask them about. Or just be open to receive whatever messages come. Whatever's important for you to receive and understand at this time in your development. And that you won't judge the information, and that you won't judge the guide. Whatever comes, comes. So flow into the scene and flow into the screen. Go and play. Go and have fun with your guides. And I'll call you when. So wherever you are now, just thanking any guidance you've received and just knowing that you can continue this connection, exploring it even more deeply. Next time in the next session. Explore it even more deeply during the night, during the days ahead. Setting an intention to continue to explore yourself in this way, to establish and strengthen your connection with your guides. But for now, just gently bringing yourself back into the awareness of your body, of your breath, more into the awareness of the room that you are in right now and the space that you are in. And just really giving your body a nice stretch, really feeling the physicality of that into that sensation. Just noticing whatever you're sitting or lying on, and taking a nice deep breath in. Just really feeling the energy coming back into the breath, into the body, and just wiggling those fingers and toes. And then when you're ready, just make a few notes of your experience, whatever came through in any of your senses, just noting that down as this exercise comes to an end. And welcome back.

====================

LESSON 9: Meditation - Meeting Your Guidance Council

- This exercise is designed to connect you with your guidance by changing your frequency. Sometimes we might feel disconnected from sources of guidance because we might be experiencing anxiety or fear, which can take us out of resonance with the deepest parts of our total selves. But guidance is always available if we can allow ourselves to turn the radio dial, so to speak, and tune into it. So begin by taking a moment to place yourself in a comfortable position. You can be sitting or lying down and just let the music and tones take you into a deeper state of being. And now just create in your mind a box with a lid. Simply think about a container which is large enough to hold any distracting thoughts, worries, or concerns that you might have, or anything else that can get in the way of you being fully present in this exercise. Those things may be important, just not right now. You can deal with them later, but now this is your time to be with yourself and to explore yourself more deeply. So enjoy using that box now. And when you're done, just close the box and let your gentle breathing and the tones guide you deeper still. And now think about, just imagine a soothing, vibrant wave of energy moving from the top of your head all the way down to the bottom of your feet and back again. Just letting that wave pulse up and down easily and comfortably, faster and faster, while keeping a steady rhythm with your breathing. That's it. Just pulsing it even faster. Now, easily and comfortably, faster and faster, just let your imagination and the sounds guide your vibration faster and faster. Higher and higher. Higher and higher. And now imagine yourself on a large walkway extending out in front of you. At the end, you notice several beings of light waiting for you to join them. Notice their presence, their vibration now and next to you, or just behind You might feel the supportive presence of one or more of these beings. Feel the familiarity of their presence, your guidance, your helpers, and observing your body, your hands. Notice that you too are a being of light. You too are part of this group, this gathering. Move closer now along the walkway towards where the others are gathered. Feel their welcoming love and support their non-judgmental acceptance and kindness towards you and to each other. One of these guides invites you to share what you've learned so far from your life. Experience, what understandings or insights you've gathered, what you enjoy, love, and appreciate what you're grateful for, and also what you find difficult or challenging. Observe how they receive this information with openness and curiosity. And now communicate with your guides on how they can best support your life experience. Remembering that guidance is here to support your development, but will never make decisions for you. Ask any questions that you may have and be open to receive any answers in whatever form they may arrive. Ask, explore and build a relationship with your guides. And I'll call you when it's time to return. Now. Wherever you are, just thank your guides for their loving support and for any information you've received. Knowing that you can return here to this frequency whenever you wish to deepen and more fully explore your relationship with your guides. But for now, allow your vibrational rate to slow down bit by bit as you were to turn easily and gently now toward the physical waking state. Coming back more and more now as I count you down from 10 to one. And when I reach the count of one, you'll be back in full physical waking consciousness, retaining your connection with your guidance, and remembering what you've experienced. So coming back now, 10 more and more, just feeling your frequency, becoming more and more dense. Nine and eight, slowly coming back now, feeling sensations returning to your body. Seven, six, and five. Notice your breathing. Notice the strength returning to each breath four and those arms and legs. Notice your hands, the air in the room on your face. Three. Another easy breath. Feeling the vitality, the strength returning to the breath and to the body. And two, feeling your hands, your feet, just giving your fingers and toes. A little wiggle, maybe giving yourself a nice stretch. And one eyes open, connecting with your body, with the room around you, with just taking your time now. And you might want to make some written or verbal notes about your experience. Welcome back.

====================

LESSON 9: Meditation - Deepening Intuition With Sound Wave Frequencies

- This exercise will allow you to develop a solid foundation for deepening and refining your intuition. With practice, you will be able to transform your intuition from something that is maybe vague from just a hunch into something that is much more stable and reliable, and an extra source of information that flows to your deeper inner being into your deepest wisdom. You will not be abandoning your logical mind, but adding to it with a more whole brain approach. To get the best results from this exercise, you will need to practice often. Also, you will find that you can increasingly have access to your intuition in your daily life activities in a natural and instinctive way. So now let's take the time to get comfortable. You can do this by sitting upright or lying down. The invitation here is to remain awake. Now, just allow the music and the tones to take you into a relaxed but focused state. Bring your senses alive by listening to the music. Feel the weight and warmth of your legs, your arms, and just allow yourself to begin to relax. With every easy breath, have an intention of allowing everything to be just as it is. And imagine as if comfort could simply float and drift around that body, almost as if it were a soothing light or color. Just allowing each muscle and nerve the space that it needs to unwind little by little and bit by bit. And you may want to engage the part of your mind you use when you read or when you daydream, to create a sense of a really safe place. This could be somewhere real or imaginary. It doesn't really matter. Just something about the way this place feels, the colors, the sounds, the smells, the feel of the wind or sun on your skin, or just warmth or a pleasant coolness if your place is inside. And I'll be silent now just to allow the music to take you deeper into this experience. And when it's time to begin to fully awaken your natural wisdom of intuition, I will return during this silent time. You can substitute any positive and well formulated question of your own choosing, or you can consider the question, which is a very good one to start with. And that question is just to ask to be shown what you need to know for your highest good at this point. So just say this question or the question you have in your mind and listen with your body. Resist the temptation to talk to yourself about this idea to stay open and receptive to whatever. And however the information comes just patiently waiting in receptive silence. Just as if you had asked the question of a friend and we're giving them the time they needed to answer you, be alert for how the information might turn up. It may come to you non-verbally as an image or a symbol, and at first it may not make much sense, and that's okay. Notice what you notice how it feels. Does your body tighten or relax? Do you hold your breath or let it flow freely? When we receive true intuition, there is usually a sense of openness of expansion, or it may just be a feeling or just a single word. It may take time to translate or understand this way of knowing into something that is a conceptual thought for you. For now, just let your intention be to stay alert and receptive. In a while, it will be time to return to a normal waking awareness, bringing back with you any new information, ideas, or guidance you have received. And even if you don't have a specific answer yet, you can have the sense of having turned over the question to a deeper part of you and be open and curious about when the answers may appear. Sometimes these answers will come to you outside of an exercise. An idea might pop into your head when you're having a cup of tea or coffee or just walking. So be alert. Be open to that. When the music fades away, you will come back to normal waking awareness in a moment or two. And when you do, just take some time to draw or write a few notes about your experience about anything that you have learned. I invite you to be patient and to engage in this practice regularly. Just taking your time to really explore a question, allowing it to unfold, grow, and flow to a new understanding or solution in its own time and in its own way. Because each answer will reformulate the same question or lead to a new one. With practice, you'll be able to do this without needing to be in a formal meditation. So for now, just orienting yourself back in your body, back into full awareness of your body in the chair or bed. Take some time to come back to us and then taking a deeper breath. Just give yourself a little stretch as you open your eyes and look forward to the rest of your day. Welcome back.

====================

LESSON 10: Exploring Consciousness: The Out-of-Body Insight
--------------------
<v ->So one of the things</v> that we teach at the Monroe Institute is the out-of-body experience, and we have a course called OB Spectrum. And what I find so interesting, and that's why I know this is a great topic for us to share, we can specifically talk about this program because we've had participants who've come, and they show up with these expectations. And the expectations are OBEs or out-of-body experiences happen in a certain way. It's called a traditional liftoff. And it's a formula. It's step-by-step-by-step-by-step. This must happen for you to be able to label it as such. So it's interesting because we know and we see the progression, as people go through the program, of their understanding. That's not necessarily how it works. It doesn't have to be a recipe to have the experience or get to the outcome. <v ->I mean, that's an interesting way</v> of your left brain trying to create a category to make sense of what that out-of-body experience is. But the out-of-body experience is actually a spectrum of experiences. And we can have that traditional classic lift out where we feel our energy body peeling away, lifting away from the physical, hitting the ceiling, turning around, seeing our body in the bed, and then we scream or fly out the window depending on how we feel at the time. But there are many, many ways of expanding your awareness within consciousness so that you can perceive beyond your physical system. And as you get that greater overview, that broader perspective of who and what you are, then we will take those lessons and integrate them, apply them in our physical reality. So that's what this section is about. I'd like to take you on an exciting journey into the fascinating realm of out-of- body experiences, the sense of being outside of your physical body and maybe floating somewhere nearby and possibly perceiving your physical body in bed. And this might seem like a peculiar concept, but the truth is most of us are bound to encounter it at some point in our lives. We will either have direct experience of it ourselves or know someone very close to us who will have had the experience. When I first began giving talks on the subject, I would shy away from discussing out-of-body experiences directly because I thought people would think that the topic was weird or that I was weird or something else that I hadn't thought about. So I would just focus my discussions on neuroscience, on brainwave entrainment and audio technology subjects that we combine and use to inform our meditations at the Monroe Institute. However, when I now ask a crowd to raise their hands if they've ever had an out-of-body experience, more than half of the hands go up. And that's in line with the most recent survey studies, and it shows that the majority of people around 55%, will have had such an experience within their lifetime, sometimes multiple times. And usually the first experience will have taken place by around the age of seven. And because culturally we're not used to talking about these states, children experiencing unexplained things usually shut down quite quickly so that they don't scare or confuse their parents or people around them. I'm pretty certain that some of you hearing this will know that this has happened to you. It's something we come across repeatedly at Monroe, which is why it's so refreshing to be with groups of people who can talk openly about these subjects. And just to give you an idea, when we gave a talk at Mindvalley Paris, more than half of the hands went up. So that's your crowd as well. Now let's dive deeper into the out-of-body experience. While the prevailing idea suggests that our energy or soul leaves the physical body to explore elsewhere, this is merely one facet of a diverse range of experiences that we call the OBE spectrum, that Bob Monroe referred to within his phasing model of consciousness. Within this model of consciousness, different states of consciousness are like radio stations, none better than another, but operating on a different frequency band. It spans from being fully grounded in physical reality to entering daydream like states, mind awake/ body asleep states, deeper conscious dreams, and beyond. Robert Monroe called this fascinating process phase shifting, likening it to changing radio stations to access different channels of existence. And you can use your brain as the tuner to recognize and explore these different states of being. In this session, we explore two such channels. One is the classic out-of-body experience, and the other is the state of flow. But what exactly does the out-of-body experience offer that we don't already possess? Some people have the idea that once they have an out-of-body experience, once they're able to separate their consciousness from their physical body, that they'll gain instant wisdom and spiritual insight. That's not quite true. The potential, yes, but nothing is automatic. You see, it's merely a means to an end and not the end itself. Instead of fixating on the how of the experience, we should focus on the why. Monroe understood that we are more than our physical bodies, but he didn't stop there. He asked, "Now what? What can we gain from this realization?" Now that you know and not just believe that your mind, the essence of who and what you are, can exist beyond the limitations of your physical body, then how can you use that understanding to enrich your life both physically and beyond? These are the questions that should guide us as we navigate this extraordinary journey. Your why is your compass, your driving force, and perhaps you are embarking on this journey with a sense of curiosity, hoping that by exploring the nonphysical, you'll discover your purpose or the solution to a challenging life problem or situation. That's perfectly valid. But acknowledge it as your strategy. Remember that the out- of-body experience is not your only path to profound insights and information. And we cover that in some of the other sessions, like problem solving. So take a moment to jot down your aspirations. Write them down, whether they are lofty goals like experiencing oneness or nirvana or simply connecting with a departed loved one. The out-of-body experience can be your vehicle to achieve these objectives. However, don't forget to contemplate what you'll do once you're out of body. Many individuals find their first out-of-body experiences fleeting, often due to excitement and the lack of planning. It's not guaranteed that this experience will automatically provide spiritual insights or accelerate your personal growth. And I just want to give an example. When I first started having consistent out-of-body experiences at university, I had the motivation because I was pretty bored. And then I found out about this state, and I was curious to explore it. So I would lie there in my bed meditating and just watching my body going to sleep and trying to keep my mind awake. And I would fail many, many times. However, my first out-of-body experience out of this was a classic lift out. I peeled out of my body. I saw an energy duplicate, and I floated to the ceiling. I turned around, saw my body in the bed, and I floated to a landing position. And as exciting as that was, I then ran out of my room down the halls of residence, and no one was awake. It was three in the morning; everybody was in bed. So while it was interesting to begin with, there was nobody to connect with; there was nobody to celebrate with. There was nothing else to check. And I repeated that, and it would always be round about the same sort of time. So I actually kind of got bored of the state. I remember one time finding it really exciting that I heard some commotion outside. And as I went to check out what was going on, there was a fox rummaging in some bins. And then I went back to my body, went to the window, and sure enough there was a fox rummaging bins. And I was like, yes! But there was nobody around. So I thought, okay, this is a bit nerdy; I'll just go back to bed. So it's not going to bring an immediate spurt in your spiritual awakening. And I'd just like you to just consider the why a little bit more. And one of the most significant barriers to personal growth is fear. Much of what we acquire in our early years, long before we develop verbal language, is still with us now. And the ultimate fear, of course, is the fear of death. The out-of-body experience can be a powerful tool in confronting and diminishing this fear because it's illogical that the fear of death, the fear of annihilation, persists when you know that you can exist beyond your physical body. But it can also be employed to conquer other fears that hinder our personal growth. And in upcoming meditations, the first one in this session, we will gently guide you through the process of releasing fears and limiting beliefs without requiring you to fully comprehend the cognitive mechanism of how it works. Ultimately, you are an energy being with a physical component, impervious to harm or destruction. You cannot be destroyed. You'll truly appreciate this profound self and build trust in your deeper being by consciously exploring it in this session. This process can be playful and eye-opening, allowing you to expand your self-concept and have fun along the way. And we will explore a technique for distancing your mind away from your physical body and navigating the nonphysical space. While this may take some practice, you'll find that with patience and gentle persistence, it's well within your reach. Trust your inner guidance; embrace your deeper self, and enjoy the exhilarating exploration of your true self, far beyond the confines of the physical and mental limitations. So for your actions in this session, begin by becoming very clear as to why you want to explore the out-of-body state, what you would like to do once you find yourself out of body. Because it's a bit like getting into a car, and I don't know about you, but I don't just like to sit in a car with the engine on and find how wonderful that is. I like to go somewhere. So now that you're in this vehicle, this new vehicle, an out of body, an energy body that you're exploring, where would you like to go? So that's the first step. And then start with the session on releasing fears. You might not think that you have any, but there's always something in the background. It's usually the fear of the unknown as well as the one of the annihilation. But the fear of the unknown can be very, very subtle and can hold us back when we explore new territories like this. And then we'll develop techniques for going out of body and also tapping into those oneness flow states. So that's all guided. So enjoy the process.

LESSON 10: Meditation - Releasing Fear With Monroe Sound Science

<silence> 

The purpose of this exercise is to gently reclaim energy that is locked away or held by holding onto unnecessary fears. And we know that there are only a few innate fears, such as the fear of loud noises and the fear of falling. And the rest are required mostly through early life experiences and observations of those closest to us. And fear can be a useful signal that we need to take some form of protective action, but sometimes that signal persists beyond its usefulness, and we can get stuck in loops of unhelpful thinking and acting. And it's very possible to release fears and reevaluate your thoughts around them. 

Some people, for example, take that fear of falling and turn it into the excitement of deliberately jumping out of a plane or enjoying a rollercoaster ride or a bungee jump. So it's very possible to transform the energy of fear into excitement, curiosity, and creative play. And another advantage that we have in this exercise is that most of those early fears were acquired. Their patterns created when our brains were still developing. And this took place mostly in a delta frequency. So these tones embedded in the background sounds will help to regress your brain so that you can reprogram yourself. 

And lastly, once we've gently released a fear, we can pull fresh energy into that space that was occupied by that frozen energy so that we can use it for being and living in the way that we want, that we choose. So begin by putting yourself in a comfortable position and setting the intention to remain reasonably still throughout this exercise, and also to remain reasonably present throughout this process. And just allow these tones to softly guide you into a deeper state of being, allowing yourself, inviting yourself to experience more ease and comfort, perhaps taking a few deliberately deeper breaths and just letting them go as you float and sink deeper into this relaxation. And the next time you hear my voice, I'll be guiding you through the releasing process. So just resting there softly. Let's now begin the process of releasing those thoughts, patterns, and emotions that no longer serve you. To begin with, just scan your body, getting a general sense of the feeling, the outline, and shape the weight of your body from head to toe. And as you scan that body, just invite the first sensation of fear to attract your attention. You might notice a part of your body really wanting your attention right now. And with that, there could be a sensation, a warmth or coolness, a tightness or tingling, a particular color or shape somewhere in or on your body. And just noticing where that is now 

And now, inviting that sensation to just move without forcing it. Noticing where that sensation would like to flow. How would it like to leave your body? Does it want to move upwards, perhaps out the top of your head or down your arms and out through your fingertips? Or does it drain down easily and gently through the bottoms of your feet and into the ground beneath you? Just invite that flow Now as you observe. Now, imagine yourself surrounded by bright, sparkling, vibrant energy. Just think about and feel that energy around you now, and as if you're breathing it in through all your pores, through all of your being. Bring that energy into your body, physical, mental, and emotional body, and draw it into that area where the sensation used to be. Observe yourself. Feel yourself filling with this strong, vibrant energy. Reclaiming that energy that was previously frozen with that old unhelpful sensation. And now, repeat the process again. Just scanning your body and noticing where there might be another more subtle sensation, another fear which is ready to be released. Another fear that wishes to move out of your body in some way. Just noticing that sensation now 

And again, gently inviting that sensation to just move and paying attention to how that sensation would like to flow out of your body. Where would it like to go? Does it want to move upwards or does it drain down? Invite that flow. Now as you observe that sensation leaving your body and remembering that bright, sparkling, vibrant energy, just reconnecting with that strong energy field around you now. Now, breathe it in through all of your being. Bring that energy into your body, physical, mental, and emotional body, and draw it into that area where the sensation used to be. Observe yourself. Feel yourself filling with this vibrant energy, reclaiming that energy that belongs to you. We will now repeat the process once more. Just noticing where in your body there might be another yet more subtle sensation, another fear which is grateful for your attention and is ready to be released. Another fear that wishes to move out your body in some way. And again, gently inviting that sensation to just move and paying attention to how that sensation would like to flow out of your body. Where would it like to release upwards or downwards? Perhaps there's a new way to exit the body. Invite that flow now as you observe that sensation leaving your body, all traces of that sensation, leaving you now without effort, just watching and allowing that to happen 

Once more. Remembering that strong, bright, vibrant energy, just reconnecting with that energy now and breathe it in through all parts of your being, feeling your whole self, becoming stronger, richer and more vibrant. Let this energy flow through you now and just resting for a few moments, noticing any differences in the energy of your body. Just noting how you feel now, just resting in that awareness a while longer. 

Now it's time to make our way back to the waking state and knowing that you've begun a process of reclaiming your energy from past habits that no longer serve you. And the more you engage with this process, the easier and more effective it'll become. But for now, just starting to orient yourself back into greater and greater awareness of your physical body. Just noticing the vitality, returning to your breath, to your hands and feet and all other parts of your body. Noticing the contact points of your body supported by the chair or bed beneath you. And becoming more aware of the sounds in the room, the sound of my voice, the sounds in the background, the sensation of the air in your room, on your face, the feeling of your breath, and just letting each breath bring you back more and more all the way back to waking awareness. That's it all the way back now. Just opening those eyes and giving yourself a little stretch perhaps. And take a moment now to make some written or verbal notes about anything that you've experienced in this session. Welcome back.

====================

LESSON 10: Meditation - Out of Body Experience

- The purpose of this exercise is to become familiar with your second body or energy body state, so that you can initiate movement into non-physical realities. Start by softly closing your eyes and sitting or lying down, free from distractions, taking in some easy breaths, and you might want to make the next breath in just a little bit deeper than the last one. And the next breath out just a little bit longer than the previous breath out, so that the out breath is slightly longer than the in breath. Just continue in this way for a few moments and inviting more calm and relaxation into the breath, into the body, And noticing where in your body you might be carrying any tension or discomfort, and noticing which part of your body is the most calm and comfortable. And just inviting that calm, ease and comfort to spread through your entire body as you continue to breathe easily and gently. Not forcing anything, just observing, inviting, allowing. And if that tension wants to move somewhere else in the body, perhaps to move down through your legs and into your feet and into the ground below you. Just watching that, allowing that to happen almost as if a drain is open at the bottom of your feet. And any remaining tension can just flow out without any effort on your part. And now I invite you to imagine, just think about being surrounded by a vibrant sparkling energy or shimmering light. And it can have a color or not, it really doesn't matter. But just knowing that with each breath in, you can imagine taking in this vibrant sparkling energy through all parts of your body. And of course, the air may be coming in through your nose, but just imagine that this vibrant sparkling energy or light is flowing into you through all the pores of your body just filling you up, massaging, refreshing, and invigorating every part of your body. And as you breathe out, just imagining any spent disused energy flowing out of you, and that might be as a gray cloud, or it might have some other sound or texture. So breathing fresh energy in stale energy out and just imagining and breathing in this way for a few moments. And now I invite you to take that fresh, vibrant energy and imagine it extending beyond the boundary of your physical body, beyond your skin line, and surrounding and supporting you almost as if you're floating inside a cloud of vibrant, sparkling energy. It's all around you. And just imagining what that would be like for you right now, just held in the safety of this protective cloud and allowing everything else to move into the background as you focus on that cloud of energy, that supportive energy field around you. And now noticing that as you relax more and more, your body can drift and rest. While your mind can remain refreshed and ready for deeper exploration, a deeper understanding of your whole being, allowing yourself to sense your boundary, expanding all around you in all directions. Invite your awareness and energy to move and drift further out into the room, inviting this expansion gently, willing it to happen, and expanding out more and more as that cloud of energy just takes you upwards, little by little bit by bit, just floating easily and gently safe and protected within this cloud of energy. As you continue expanding and floating, drifting more and more, more and more. And you might now want to think about where you would like to explore when your mind is free to go anywhere, do anything perceive in new ways. So set a clear intention. And that might be to just know more about this expansion and where it can take you when you allow yourself to be taken. So go and explore, and I will call you when time to return. So now, wherever you are, just thinking about returning to full physical waking consciousness and knowing that you can easily repeat this process in the future and explore those greater parts of you more deeply, and the more you do this kind of exercise, the easier it becomes. But for now, preparing to look forward to the rest of your day or night as you think about returning to your physical body and becoming more aware of your arms and legs, your fingers and toes, your breath, and bringing in a slightly deeper breath, feeling the strength returning to your body, feeling more refreshed, vibrant and awake. Aware of the contact points of your body with a chair or bed. And then giving yourself a nice, gentle stretch and opening your eyes as you return to the physical waking state. Welcome back.

====================

LESSON 10: Meditation - Advanced Flow State Meditation With Gamma Frequencies

Welcome to the second Gamma meditation, and as before, it's important to have an intention as you enter this exercise. So just take a moment to think about what you would like to cultivate within this session, and that can be as specific as you want it. It can be an attitude or quality. It can be exploration about a specific question or a problem before you begin to explore, you'll be guided to clear this intention in your mind, in your head, heart, and gut, and just let that intention move out of only being in your head, and then let it sink deeply into your heart, and then move it down into the core of your being into the gut. I'll give you some time to do this, and now let's bring those senses alive by really moving into them and just feeling your weight in the chair or bed feeling into those contact points with the support beneath you. Now, just get a general sense of where you are and how you are right now. Not trying to change, just noticing, and you may notice the breath. Its rhythm and flow again, not trying to change it, just observing. Be curious and allow things to be as they are, 

And then just finding that natural center of the experience you are having. It could be the breath or the tones or something else around you. You are invited to notice to move into that now. And now just remembering your intention and keeping that clear in your mind, in your head, heart, and gut. Just letting that intention move through you and notice it expanding out from you. Just allow it to radiate out all around you. Be curious about where this will take you.

LESSON 11: Sensuality and Intimacy: Pathways to Deeper Connection
--------------------
<v ->So this next session we're talking about sensuality.</v> And it's interesting concept because, you know, we do talk about this Met Monroe more than the physical body, and, and we talk about it a lot. Well, we also really need to be embracing our physicality and experiencing life. That's part of what Bob Monroe called Living in the Earth Life system. What we want to do or what is suggested that we do to really enjoy this experience, or it doesn't even have to be enjoyable of course, but this is what we're talking about in this particular topic to actually live within the body. Let's fill it, let's do it, let's act it. Let's really step into that, which involves also sensuality. The other night at dinner, we were eating dinner with someone and she commented about how you were so sensual with your food, like you enjoyed every moment of it, and you were just sitting there in your physicality munching on that hamburger. That's that's right. And that, I mean, that's the kind of thing we need to understand better. How do we enjoy these things that are happening? And it involves a lot of things. It's not just intimacy. It's not just sex. It, it could be food, it could be people that we're enjoying <v ->It's connection.</v> Yeah, ultimately, that's what it comes down to. The physical part is also an energetic part. It's not that we have this physical and then a non-physical, but actually it's just frequency. And this is just a denser vibration. So the physical is an energy system, and what we're going to be talking about in this section as we're discussing sensuality and intimacy, is how to actually connect very deeply with whatever's going on in your physical experience and possibly using that then for your spiritual development as well. But it's, it's mostly about connection and how to do that more deeply without being in a story in your head about what it actually means to make that sort of connection. So whether it is about eating food or really being in connection with that, or whether it's something to do with sex with a partner, for instance, that requires an awareness of that partner and your own physical body. And so we'll be asking those sorts of questions of how can I actually enjoy being here? How can I enjoy being with my body? How can I enjoy being with somebody else's, for instance? And what can emerge out of that when we're in that kind of connection? So often spirituality tends to kind of push aside these physical things as being limiters in some way, but that's, that's not what we're we're talking about here. In fact, it's quite the opposite. If you can really be here and enjoy being here, then that leads to a different kind of growth, one that's a lot more enjoyable. So we'll be exploring those features as well. In this section. Sensuality and intimacy are profoundly important aspects of human relationships contributing to our emotional equilibrium, the depth of our connections and our overall life satisfaction. In this session, we will explore some of the reasons behind their importance and how you can enhance both for a richer experience of connecting with yourself and others. Now, sometimes in spirituality, there's this idea that we should ignore the physical body and the cravings of the physical body. And I think that that's a mistake. You are an energy being, having a physical experience. And so embrace all of that, and the tools in this session will help you to do just that. So one of the first things that sensuality and intimacy do is they help us to deepen emotional connection. They are the adhesive that strengthens the emotional connection between individuals through the language of verbal and nonverbal communication, such as physical touch, affectionate words, and unspoken, often nonverbal cues. We convey our love, our desire, and care for another. This in turn binds and builds trust. It nurtures a sense of empathy and emotional security in a relationship. So I want to give an example of this. I had a client come to therapy with weight issues. And usually when I hear a guy, particularly a guy say that they have weight issues, I'm normally thinking, okay, what's the real issue behind that? And that's changed over the years, but this, this is what was going on in this situation. So he came into the therapy room and towards the end of the session after we've been discussing weight, he said, there's actually something else that I'd like to explore and maybe we can pick that up in the next session. And the issue was that he had erectile dysfunction. He was struggling to connect with his partner in a sexual way. Now we explored that in the next session, and one of the things that I asked him was a bit of a strange question, but it's kind of awkward for most people to be talking to somebody else about these sorts of issues. So I asked a strange question, which was, who's in the room with you? And he looked at me funny and he said, my partner. And I said, just your partner. Now he thought I was suggesting that maybe there might be a camera crew. And he was filming kind of weird stuff. And, and and I, I said, no. I said, why are you focusing on anything else other than your partner? And then the penny dropped and, and he understood my question. So as we explored that, what I realized very quickly was that it wasn't just his partner who was in the room physically, yes, mentally far from it in the room was the idea of them trying for a baby. So unborn babies in the room. And then her parents who are putting pressure are in the room. His parents are putting pressure in the room. He in his own head because he is saying times ticking is in the room. His partners at time ticking self is in the room. And anybody else, friends, family, anybody else with kids, anybody else who's putting pressure on them to be able to produce something in that bedroom is in the room with them. So you can see how quickly you can disconnect when you're in a story of your own head. So when we help to eliminate all those other people and bring the connection back to that one person in the room, then the issue started to dissolve. So being present with somebody, being present in your own body and being present with a body of somebody else can be a very, very powerful experience. And that's what we can also do in the centering meditations that accompany this session. So the other thing is that you can gain a holistic health boost. Physical affection, including embraces and kisses, triggers the release of positive mood enhancing neurochemicals such as oxytocin and endorphins, bringing about feelings of joy and reducing stress and anxiety. It kickstart the parasympathetic response. Also, the presence of intimate relationships is closely linked to improved mental health and an elevated sense of life contentment. Now, I've spoken about in other sessions, non-verbal communication and how not everything has to be logical. Intimacy isn't necessarily a logical act through non-verbal expressions such as eye contact and physical contact, we convey emotions and messages that go beyond words. This deeper level of connection enhances our comprehension of each other's desires, needs, and boundaries. And that can extend far beyond just a sexual act. The other benefit is enhanced relationship satisfaction. People who give priority to sensuality and intimacy consistently report higher relationship satisfaction. These experiences help maintain the spark and passion within a partnership, rendering it more resilient in the face of challenges and conflicts. We can also explore self-discovery. Intimacy provides a platform for individuals who explore their own bodies and desires as well as those of their partner. This self-awareness leads to improve sexual and emotional wellbeing, thereby boosting self-esteem and assurance. And this is how we can use it for personal growth. Because healthy sensuality and intimacy promotes personal and self development. Learning to express desires to set boundaries, to communicate needs and avoid the judgment of the self and others within a relationship is vital for self-awareness and self-improvement. And lastly, if that wasn't enough, the longevity factor. Couples who maintain an intimate connection throughout their relationship often enjoy longer-lasting unions, as well as extended life expectancy with significantly lower heart attacks, strokes, and other health related diseases. The meditations in this session will help you to explore and connect with yourself and significant others more effectively. And thankfully, you don't have to be listening to me in these meditations while you're making sweet love. This is purely something that you will listen to before or afterwards or in preparation throughout the day to raise your awareness of yourself, to connect with your body, to connect with your energy body as well, and that of somebody else.

====================

LESSON 11: Meditation - Deep Connection Meditation

<silence> 

As we begin this meditation, sit opposite and close to your partner, and then begin by making yourself a little bit more comfortable, where you're sitting feet on the floor and hands in your lap, just comfortably resting. And I invite you to relax your body, and you can begin by closing your eyes. Just letting your eyes and the muscles around your eyes rest gently allowing those muscles to soften. As you release any tension, now shift your attention to your breath. Notice the gentle rise and fall of your chest as you inhale and exhale, not changing the breath, just letting it be soft and gentle. 

Feel the sensuality of breathing, the rhythmic flow of air, nourishing your body with each breath its gentle rhythm and flow. Allow yourself to sink into this pleasurable sensation letting go of any distractions as you become fully present in the moment. As you continue to breathe, bring your awareness to the sounds around you. Listen intently to the textures of these sounds, embracing both the noises and the silence between them. Notice how the sounds arise from and dissolve back into the vast stillness within you. Becoming really attuned to the awareness of having a body and being connected with your physical senses. Now, turn your attention inward, sinking into the depths of your being, placing your awareness on that part of you observing all of this physical sensation. Feel the spaciousness within connecting with that broadest part of you, your spirit, your essence, your total self experience, the deep stillness that resides within you. Sink into it. Anchoring yourself in this moment of presence. From this place of inner stillness. Reach out with your energy, connecting with your partner. Feel the subtle currents of energy intertwining and merging. Creating a bond that transcends physical form. Energy being, connecting with energy, being 

Allow yourself to connect soul to soul. Acknowledging the shared journey of joy, suffering memories, dreams, hopes and fears, and acknowledging that we're here now together. And if other thoughts and memories enter this space, thoughts of other people and situations, then just observe them for a moment and then release them. Let them go. Nothing and no one else's presence and ideas are important right now. And so now I invite you to open your eyes and meet your partner's gaze. Observe the unique features and expressions that define them, the unique shape, features, outlines of their face, their eyes, all the features that define a completely individual face and body. Just observing like it's the first time you've ever encountered them. Move out of that story that you might have about them and connect with whoever is in front of you right now. Play with your senses as you invite an open curiosity and discovery. Now, recognize the deep connection that exists between you, not just on a physical level, but on a soul level as well. Perceive beyond the surface form, connecting with the conscious being that resides within each of you. Deeper being, connecting with deeper being through the physical senses. 

Close your eyes once more, feeling the continued connection between your souls even in the absence of visual contact. Experience the oneness that underlies all separateness, recognizing the unity of consciousness that binds you. Together now, gradually return your awareness to your body. Feeling the sensation of form and physicality. Gently move your body, acknowledging the contact points with the seat beneath you. Take an easy breath in fully embracing the physicality of being back in your body. And as you open your eyes and reconnect with the world around you, carry with you the awareness of the deep connection you share with your partner. Nurture this connection in your daily interactions knowing that you are united, not just in body, but in spirit as well. Welcome back.
