Intro 1: Welcome to the Quest
--------------------
Hi, my name is Agapi Stassinopoulos, and I'm so happy and thrilled to be bringing to all of you at Mindvalley this Quest of connecting and creating with God and Spirit as your guide. Our inner guidance is like a wireless network; it's invisible, but it's available everywhere where we are. To tap into your inner knowing, you just need to enter the password, and the password is prayer. Prayer is our invisible support system, and it reminds us that we are never, never alone. This Quest is about learning how to partner with your Spirit, the God within, and actually become a cocreator with that life force. It'll help you incorporate your spiritual self with your physical reality, so that everything you do will be connected to God through the unshakeable bond of prayer. Now, we know that God can be a loaded word. It means something different to different people. It means so many things to so many people, and it means nothing to a lot of people. Let me tell you what I mean when I say God. I never think of God as a being. I think of God as a state of being. To enter that state, we have to dare to go beyond our limited sense of ourselves, our minds, our emotions, and our finite perspective. When I say God, I'm referring to a transcendent power beyond what words can possibly describe. If you connect to that spiritual cosmic larger-than-life presence in whatever way resonates with you, your life will be transformed. Whatever word you want to use, whether it is God, the Light, Spirit, the Higher self, Divine intelligence, the One, the I Am, Universal love, a Higher power, or anything else, please use it. Whatever connects you to that power is your entryway. It doesn't matter what you call it as long as when you call it, you remember that you are calling upon a power that lives in every cell of your body and in your own breath. And how do we get to that presence? Prayer. Prayer is the bridge that we use to connect to that power. I don't know about you, but if I spend one second considering the vastness of the universe, I feel reverence, gratitude, safety, protection, and ultimately, a sense of awe and joy. I don't presume to know how, but I have a profound feeling that the miraculous energy that created the universe is that which created me. When we pray, we're not praying to someone, but to something inside of us, a deeply wiser, higher, and more intelligent part of ourselves that is connected to the whole and is always here. We pray to the awakened part of us that is the God within us. All we are asked to do is gently turn towards it and listen. In prayer, you begin moving beyond the confines of the self that is preoccupied with so many things. Whoever you think you are, my friends, you're not. Because our thinking is finite. We cannot conceive with our minds the soul of who we are which is infinite and invisible. The power in the process of prayer is that you can go beyond your thoughts and your restricted mind, and you start to touch upon the unseen reality of who you really are. It is as if the curtain is slowly being lifted, and there you are, and from that place, you can ask, you can listen, and you can commune. It's like, you know, the story of the monk who kept continuously asking, "God, what can I do to serve you?" "What can I do to serve you more?" And one day, his inner voice said, "Shut up, and let me love you." So when you are in that presence, you might realize that you are indeed very loved, and you need nothing. The loving presence in you knows your yearnings, your longings, your wants, and they're being answered. As Rumi said, the wonderful Sufi poet, "You are not a drop in the ocean; you are the entire ocean in a drop." We have low levels of consciousness and higher levels of consciousness. It doesn't mean that the lower levels of consciousness are bad. They're just a lower vibration. And wouldn't you rather live in a higher elevated state of consciousness? It would be like you are living in a mansion. And in the mansion, there is the basement where it's dark. And the first floor, and the second floor, and there is a little more light there. They're not bad, but if you go into the higher floors or on the rooftop, you can get a greater view, a greater vista, filled with light. In the same way as we elevate our consciousness, we can choose to live in a higher state of being. Where you are calmer, you are more centered; you have greater clarity, greater focus; you have joy; you have the ability to see solutions; you are of greater service; you are kinder; you are more compassionate; you are more loving to yourself, more accepting, and basically, you have a greater flow in your life. That to me, is the spiritual essence that we can bring to this level. How we can move from the lower levels of consciousness to the higher levels is prayer. Prayer is like your elevator to go to the higher floors of your mansion. When you are in the basement, you get in the elevator; you push the button, and you say, "I want to go to the sixth floor or the ninth floor or the seventh floor. I want to see clearly, to be in more light." The whole thing is very practical as well as it is mystical. You move out of the debris of your life to the nectar of your life. It is possible. It just takes willingness to know that at every moment in your life, you have a choice to get in the elevator by coming into prayer, to lift yourself to the other floors of your consciousness. As you go through this Quest with me, you'll begin to trust in the Spirit. You will learn to listen to it, choose it, and merge your human and spiritual self and walk hand in hand with your Spirit. So how did I get here? Let me tell you just a little bit about myself. I was brought up in Athens, Greece. The sun-kissed land of the magical Aegean, where life is celebrated every day. My mother, Elli, was my first spiritual teacher, and she infused us, me and my sister, with a complete trust of life. She believed in something larger than herself. That was her guiding light. She always used to say to me and my sister, "Life is for you; trust your life force." And she demonstrated that every day in the midst of all her adversities. As a young girl in Athens, I remember seeing my mother sitting in our living room, drinking her tea, eating her favorite biscuits in contemplation. It looked like she was doing nothing. But over time, I realized this was her time of spiritual communion. In quiet reflection, she seemed to be drawing upon something deep within herself. She was listening for guidance and direction, and she orchestrated various aspects of our lives. This was her form of prayer. She never really went to church, yet she prayed all the time. In our family, other than weddings, funerals, and Greek Easter, we never really went to church. So at a very early age, I realized that prayer had nothing to do with going to a house of worship, a building dedicated to God. Our own home was our church. And sitting in silence and contemplation, making yourself a cup of tea, taking a walk in the park, appreciating nature, this all could be your form of prayer. I realized that prayer was not really about kneeling down and asking God for help. It had everything to do with coming into heart and mind and connecting with something that is larger than your personal life. In this Quest, I encourage you to allow yourself to discover your own form of prayer. Through prayer, my mother always trusted that help would come her way, and it did. She made miracles happen for me and my sister, taking us from Athens to London, finding us the best schools and teachers, and making a home for us in a foreign country. Support showed up in countless of ways in her life, and therefore, in ours. She had an unshakeable confidence that she was not alone in the world. She gave me the name Agapi which, in Greek, means unconditional love, and that, my friends, set the ground for my life's work. Because when we learn to love ourselves, others, and our life unconditionally, we transcend the conditions, and we become liberated. The unconditionality of love, my friends, is the most liberating thing you can experience. It is the foundation of spirituality. It is exactly what we are going to learn in this Quest. In London, I studied acting and graduated from the Royal Academy of Dramatic Arts and moved to Los Angeles where I was hired to play a leading role in a movie. But a few months after being there, the movie fell through, and I had a choice to return to London or stay in LA. I made the major decision in my life to stay in LA and to see what was in store for me. And then I embarked on a spiritual Quest. I read endless spiritual books, did hours of yoga, because I was yearning to awaken to something in me that was more than just a Greek young girl seeking an acting career. I wanted to know deep down who I was. How did I fit in this world? What was my purpose? And that's when I had a spiritual awakening. I was 23 years old, and I was reading the book, "Autobiography of a Yogi" by Paramahansa Yogananda. I remember, I was reading about how the yogis living in the Himalayas leave their bodies, travel into other realms, and return back to their bodies, for hundreds of years, essentially transcending their physical body. I remember falling asleep while I was reading that in the book. And in the morning, I was awakened early, like about 5:30 in the morning, and the light was coming in through the window of my hotel room, and an inner light that shook me awake. I remember falling on my knees crying, and I felt this energy. I felt this awakening of my soul when I just saw and knew that I was a soul, connected to the whole, that I was more than my body, more than my mind and my emotions, that I was part of the creation of what we call God. So I started to pray and asked for a spiritual teacher to guide me through this path that I had just awakened. And I met my spiritual teacher, John-Roger, in Los Angeles, who was an enlightened being on our planet. And I started to follow the path of soul awakening and soul transcendence. And one day, as I was meditating on the mountaintop, I was bathed in the light. I felt the light started to embrace me, and as if a veil was lifted from my outer self, and it revealed my inner self. After that experience, I think I say, after that experience, I remember going home and feeling and saying to myself, "I will never be alone again." And my life started to take a very different course. It became all about deeply grounding that experience and finding out more of who I was and integrating little by little my spiritual self into my life. It was not at all: "And then she lived happily ever after." No, not at all. It was about taking leaps of faith, to keep going, to finding ways to express my gifts, to make my life happen. And the best practice that I found to do that and to keep connecting to my inner guidance was prayer. Through prayer, I was always asking. I was always listening, being very quiet, learning to calm the part of me that was afraid, that had self-doubt, that didn't know, always returning to that inner guidance that was so solid that I could absolutely and irrevocably tell you that God, whatever you call God, was my partner. What was interesting in my journey is that the world wasn't really giving me what I wanted. I wasn't getting the parts I wanted. I wasn't getting the man I wanted, but underneath it all, what I really, really wanted was Agapi. I wanted me. And then, I got me. And I got to my heart. And everything opened up. Oh, it was so beautiful. I found me. I started to create. I produced a one-woman show called "Conversations with the Goddesses" where I acted all the seven goddesses myself and all the monologues from the theater, from all the plays that I loved; it became extremely successful. I was asked to do a PBS Special after that. I was asked to write books about the Greek gods and goddesses. I taught everywhere about the Greek archetypes, and it became such a big part of my life. I was the initiator and the creator of my creativity, and I was then offering it to the world. Later in my life, I decided to write a book, how to find my creativity, how I found my spirituality, and the book was called "Unbinding the Heart: A Dose of Greek Wisdom, Generosity, Unconditional Love." And I told my story to large audiences and hundreds of people fell in my arms and cried and said, "Agapi, my heart burst open when you spoke." "My heart burst open," or "I let go of this old pain." And I realized that that's what we all really want. We want our hearts to burst open. We want to know the Spirit because the Spirit is in us, in our heart. God lives in the human heart. So, cut to many years later; after a few more books, many more talks, I was asked to write the book that would become "Speaking with Spirit: 52 Prayers to Guide, Inspire, and Uplift You." I was about to start writing the book- I was so excited-when the global pandemic happened, lockdown; and what happened to me, at that very difficult time that I know everyone went through, especially because I'm an extrovert, and I'm a Greek extrovert which makes me a triple extrovert. So I was in lockdown, unable to see my friends, even go to the supermarket or to the coffee shop. There were no events. Everything stopped, no more speaking engagements, and I love speaking to people; that was my joy. So I now had to write which is a much more solitary expression. So I cried and I prayed. I cried and I prayed. And I started to find a deeper place of that Spirit. I found that in my solitude, in my silence, in my aloneness, in my upsetness, in my despairing moments, Spirit would come to me and say, "But I'm still here, my beloved. I'm not just when you are out at events speaking. I'm not just when life is all happening around you. I'm here." And my heart cracked open even deeper, and the veils kept lifting, and I was able to really find that core and know it and write about it and convey to others and now conveying it to you. This Quest is a byproduct of this body of work of myself. One reason that I wrote my books and created this Quest is that people often write to me and tell me how they feel disassociated with God and find it difficult to get back to themselves, to find their heart. They're losing the meaning of life. They might be very successful in their work, but there is a deeper longing in them. This longing to connect with something larger than ourselves is always in us, but it's often buried. In times of crisis, it rises to the surface. If everything you do in your life is led by that invisible connection, by that invisible force, by your connection to God, to your Spirit, to that light, then everything is going to open up for you, and everything is going to have a deeper meaning and make sense to you. And what I ask you is to keep an open heart, an open mind; release the judgments. This is not a Quest that you have to work at it. This is a catch-the-Spirit Quest, and you can catch the Spirit at any time, at any moment. You can catch it right now... as you listen to me. And it can blow your mind away which is a very good thing. Or it can blow your heart open which is a marvelous thing. Your willingness to get out of your head is what is going to make this possibility, what is going to make the possibility for you to go deeper and to know your path, to unlock your blueprint, your true self which is unique to each one of you. My blueprint is unique to me; and yours is yours,because it has been in you since the day you were born, in your soul. What I really want you to find through this Quest is the way you're going to communicate with your Spirit on a daily basis. Because often, we lose our connection with our higher power. We do not trust it. And we go around in daily life in our whole life thinking we're alone which is such a shame because we are really connected all the time. So we need to learn and return to that connection which is innate and natural and so embedded in us that it's actually in our very own breath. And like our breath, it's so simple. And because it's so simple, we tend to miss it. We think it should be more complicated. We've all had those times where we feel totally alone, where we felt stuck, where we felt disappointed, and we couldn't move past the disappointment. When we felt blocked about something that we wanted, but we didn't know how to get it, like there was something bigger in us than this life that we couldn't get to. We feel this way because the world isn't designed to remind us of who we are. The way the world is shaped is to remind us to be recognized, to produce more, to become more successful, to accomplish more. The world does not give us triggers to our spirituality. There is no sign that says, "Remember your spiritual nature." "Remember your soul." No. What it'll remind you is to accomplish more, get a bigger house, accumulate more stuff, make more money, and so on and so on. It only reminds you of your physical endeavors. But what I want to remind you through this Quest is to bring the spotlight in your spiritual nature first which then will affect all your physical endeavors. It will spiritualize them; it will energize them: your relationships, your projects, your career. And once you spiritualize everything, everything is going to take meaning. Because as the famous French philosopher, Pierre Teilhard de Chardin, said, "We are not human beings having a spiritual experience; we are spiritual beings having a human experience." So, let's talk about this Quest for a moment. I have divided this Quest into six parts: Living, Creating, Becoming, Overcoming, Loving, and Transforming. These represent the different phases that we all go through on the path to connecting with our spiritual nature. In this first part, Living, we'll discuss how you can move past the first hurdle which is belief. You'll get familiar with the concept of prayer and how you can start living in prayer. The next part, Creating, is where you will learn how to find your purpose by connecting through Spirit. Becoming is where you will learn how to embody this reality and help you ground and integrate the spiritual connection into your everyday life. In Overcoming, you'll learn to be bigger than your blocks that come your way and how to look at them as diving words into deeper spirituality. In Loving, you learn how to see yourself and others through the eyes of love and to further enhance the richness of your life, which brings us finally to Transforming. Which is when everything in your life starts to take the vibrancy of Spirit and the light. So how can you prepare to take this journey with me? Well, first, as I said earlier, I want you to let go of any preconceived thoughts you may have about the words "prayer" or "God." Come with an open mind. Prepare to receive a connection with your own soul and spirituality. To pray, you don't have to belong to anything or anyone but your own Spirit. A lot of people don't pray because they say, "I don't know who to pray to," or they feel self-conscious. Let go of all that. And I want you to make an intention about the person you will be at the end of the Quest. Sit down and think about it. Visualize who you are. Write it down. Are you feeling freer? Are you feeling more joy? Are you being more loving to yourself? Are you feeling a little less worried, more fearless? How would your life feel if you were free? Like, you are not missing anything, feeling full within yourself. Sit down and think about it. How would you like to feel that you are not missing out on anything? How would you like to wake up every morning feeling full in the fullness of you? How would you like to feel that, when you have difficult and challenging times, difficult and challenging things that come your way, that you are not alone? Wouldn't that be wonderful, to know that on your right shoulder sits the guiding light, and on your left shoulder sits your mighty heart? You're feeling that you can smile because you know you are so connected. How would you like to feel this incredible, solid connection to yourself? And then, I want you to download the workbook which will help you follow along with the Quest and will contain all the prayers in the Quest. You can also get a journal to write your thoughts, your reflections, your own prayers. And set aside some time each day which is dedicated to this Quest, maybe about 20 minutes each day which will be dedicated to this journey of opening up a stronger connection with your Spirit. And finally, join the Tribe and introduce yourself to the Mindvalley Community. While prayer can be an intensely personal thing, you'll benefit from having a community of travelers who will support you in your journey and hold you accountable to your goals. They say that this life is a blink in the eye of God, but we go through so much suffering and pain and tormenting ourselves, and we put all these barriers around ourselves. What I wish for you in this Quest is that you will release them and you'll be able to see that you can actually live in this life really feeling a sense of freedom and joy and gratitude and reverence. Come aboard this ship with me. Prayer will be our sails; Spirit will be our wind, and we will arrive home to our soul. I welcome you with all my heart, and I'm so looking forward to going through this Quest with all of you.

Part 1: Living

====================

LESSON 1: Find the Extraordinary in the Ordinary
--------------------
Welcome to the first lesson of our Quest. First of all, I want to congratulate all of you for the courage to embark on this journey with me. By starting in this Quest, you are already moving to a deeper connection and commitment, and I am thrilled to go there with you. The beautiful thing about Spirit is that we don't need to wait for special occasions to access our connection. We tend to put our lives into boxes. This is a spiritual time; this is my working time; this is my social time; this is my me time, and it denies the incredible ability of humans to access the Spirit all the time, no matter what we're doing. It is easy for all of us to take things for granted and to stop looking at the awe and miracles of life every day. Our human patterns are locked in our brains and in our emotions so often that they block us in seeing the extraordinary and the miraculous in everything and in everyone. What most of us want to experience is intimacy. This is why we like falling in love. This is why breakups hurt so much. Intimacy is what we all long for, and you know what intimacy stands for? Into me, see. What I want to teach you today is that you can have this intimacy with your Spirit every day, on command. I was very inspired by the movie "Chariots of Fire;" have you all seen it? If not, do yourself a favor and see that movie where the protagonist, Eric Liddell, is an Olympic athlete as well as a missionary. So his sister, who is also a missionary, admonishes him for not following God's will and says to him, "Eric, you have to throw away this little running thing of yours and do this really important thing, this work we are all doing for God, God's work." Eric looks at her and says, "But when I run, I feel his pleasure." That statement made such an impact for me in my spiritual path. See, I was always looking for God outside my everyday life. So I would say to myself, "Oh, I'll connect with my Spirit when I meditate, when I pray, when I'm doing seminars or retreats." It was like separate from my life, and I would think, "Well, here's my life, and here's where I will find God." But then it dawned on me that I could bring this awareness of Spirit into everything I did. I could bring this feeling into even cleaning up my desk and my papers. Doing the things that brought me joy is how I connected to the Spirit daily. It could be dancing in a Greek taverna, sharing a meal with a friend, being on a boat in the Aegean, walking in a park, and maybe that's where God was. So now I want to ask all of you, when do you feel God's pleasure? When do you feel your Spirit coming alive? And can we make a pact that all of us will do more of what makes us come alive daily? Doesn't matter what it is. It could be dancing; it could be singing; it could be cooking, designing a beautiful graphic, organizing your home, reading to your child, holding a baby, walking up a mountain, or for some of your athletes, it might be climbing up a mountain, playing a sport, playing an instrument, gardening. My mother experienced it on the beach while feeding the seagulls. They would all come into her presence when she was feeding them breadcrumbs. It was magical to witness. As Rumi says, "There are a thousand ways to kneel and kiss the ground." There are thousands of ways to connect to your Spirit. We so often forget what makes us feel joyful and alive and focus more on achieving, and we get so caught up in the hustle and the bustle and our ambitions of career and life. We get so focused on our agenda. "I must get things done. I must make my mark and success, engage more in social media." More and more, more of this, and more of that and more, and we lose touch with the miracle of life in the simplicity of the moment. So earlier, remember I told you to release your preconceptions of God? This is what I mean. All the examples I've given you are ordinary, yet we can see the extraordinary in all these experiences, and that is where you find your connection to the formless, to Spirit, to God, as we suspend all judgments. So if we incorporate and give ourselves permission to know that connecting to that joy, that aliveness, that God in us, becomes on the front burner, we will find that everything else falls into place like a perfect tapestry. For me, I found the joy when I was performing. I accessed that tremendous fulfillment as I went around the country speaking, inspiring, and sharing the message of the open heart. And the joy, that is innate in all of us, I always experience the joy of our oneness when I speak at each event. Strangers and I bond heart to heart. I go beyond the words of the page into the experience of being in the moment, speaking spontaneously from my heart and wisdom. I leave every event feeling fulfilled, blissful, of awe of the expansion of the human heart. It is beyond anything I can describe. When I speak, I feel His pleasure. And now that I'm speaking to you, I feel His pleasure. So cut to the pandemic and quarantine when there were no events but endless Zoom calls; for me, it felt like I had been pushed out of my paradise. I was back in the basement, deprived of the very things I love the most. I meditated; I prayed, and I tried to find ways to recreate the feelings I have when I'm speaking and connecting with people in my life. Those feelings never left me. I just needed to find ways to keep igniting the connection. I tend to find it through dancing, through moving, through laughing, through cooking, walking on the beach, and connecting with friends via FaceTime. I did all that, but most of all, I found it through gratitude, through reverence of the ordinary things in life. So here's the key that I describe when you can't access your favorite way to feel His pleasure: you are called to go deeper. So how did I go deeper? Without judging, in the most loving and tender way, I would say to myself, "I'm here for you. I am here for you." So I started to find the connection in the stillness that sees into the soul of who I am and who others are. I started to find His pleasure in the deep quiet beyond my restless and impatient mind. And my personality that would ask, "When would this end?" I started to find His pleasure in the ordinary things, like the breeze and the roses and cooking meals, feeling the sun on my skin, hearing the voice of my family in the other room, and magnifying the gratitude in every moment with the Spirit that lives in me and all of us, regardless of the conditions. It takes a tremendous surrender and moving past the mind and the desires and the ego and the personality into the stillness to hear the subtle whisper of the voice of the Spirit that says, "I am still here. I never left. I'm never going anywhere. You can feel me; you can find me as you stop looking back to what was and, instead, open up your heart and experience what is now." When we go beyond what we feel we're missing or lacking and focus on what we have, the only response is awe. Everything settles. We settle. When we are in awe, we then can feel His pleasure and every breath and every moment as we bear witness in our aliveness that connects us all to life everywhere. When you live your life from that place, you step inside the extraordinary nature of your soul, and you start to find the extraordinary in the ordinary everyday life. So, let's do a prayer. Take a deep breath; exhale; come into present; come into your heart, and, as we say, receive your breath, because remember, we don't take the breath; receive the breath. Open up your heart. Dear beloved, I ask that I may remove the limitation and stubbornness of wanting things to be a certain way. I ask that I may again find the magic of the ordinary, and no matter what I am going through, I ask that I may awaken and know that the part of me, the God in me, is beloved and alive and is connected. Let me express my gratitude and awe of life by doing the things that bring me joy and see all the things around me that are so extraordinary. I'm able to walk on this earth through the law of gravity, and that is a miracle. The earth moves around the sun in perfect motion, and how amazing is that? There are invisible worlds of stars and planets that are moving in perfect relation to one another and don't collide. The ocean meets the shore in perfect rhythm, even when stormy. Let me wrap my mind around that and know that I too am part of all the majesty of the miracle of life, and that in itself moves me into my gratitude and awe, and so be it. So your practice for today is to start writing in your journal what awakens in you His pleasure in your life. What brings you joy? And start doing those thing that awaken your joy because that's where your Spirit is. No holding back. Just give yourself permission to spark and awaken that part of you that is alive and joyful and connected. Share it with your community, and as you do that, you ground it. Write about it. And whenever you can, find the joy in the deeper stillness, in the letting go of your preconceived ideas. Surprise yourself, and ask for that intimacy of you and your Spirit in your prayers, and then be spontaneous. Drop your agendas; ask yourself over and over again, "What makes me come alive? What expands my heart?" And go do that. You promise? I let you go with one thought. As a composer, an actor, Lin-Manuel Miranda- you know, he wrote "Hamilton"- said, "Tomorrow is not promised; that's why I live for today." So let your Spirit come alive today, now.

====================

LESSON 1: Meditation - Agapi's Prayer #1

Take a deep breath, exhale, come into presence, come into your heart, and as we say, receive your breath. Because remember, we don't take the breath, receive the breath. Open up your heart, the beloved it. I ask that I may remove the limitation and stubbornness of wanting things to be a certain way. I ask that I may again find the magic of the ordinary, and no matter what I am going through, I ask that I may awaken and know that the part of me, that God in me is beloved and alive and is connected. Let me express my gratitude and all of life by doing the things that bring me joy and see all the things around me that are so extraordinary. I'm able to walk on this earth through the love of gravity, and that is a miracle. The earth moves around the sun in perfect motion, and how amazing is that there are invisible worlds of stars and planets that are moving in perfect relation to one another. And don't collide. The ocean meets the shore in perfect rhythm. Even when Stormy, let me wrap my mind around that and know that I too am part of all the majesty of the miracle of life, and that in itself moves me into my gratitude and awe and so be it.

====================

LESSON 2: Make Your Life an Offering
--------------------
Welcome back. So I hope you've all experienced some extraordinary insights while doing ordinary things. I want to tell you a story. My mother, Ellie, who by now you all know, was at a cocktail party in London, and a woman that she just met admired her pearl necklace and said to her, "Oh these are the most beautiful pearls I've ever seen." And my mother, without missing a beat, took off the pearls and gave them to her and said, "Now they're yours, my dear, since you love them that much." And the woman stunned, said to her, "Oh my God, how can you do that? I don't even know you. And what can I possibly give you back?" And my mother turned to her and said, "It's an offering, darling. It's not a trade." I never forgot that statement. If you think about our lives, all our interactions are always mostly transactional. Wouldn't you say? We do things for others always expecting they will do things for us. Well, think about your own life, even with your best friends or your closest family. Most of our lives are focused around advancing ourselves in some way. I want a better career. I want more social status. I want more recognition. I would like more income. I want a bigger house. I want to travel. And the focus is what we want. And there's nothing wrong with that because a lot of the things we create in our lives are with that kind of driving force. But I want to ask you right now to start switching your mindset into focusing on whatever you do as an offering. Rumi has a great quote that says, "And after all this time the sun has never said to the earth, 'You owe me.' Look what happens with love like that. It lights up the whole sky." And I want to ask you to switch from "I need to have" to "What can I give?" To, "What can I offer? What can I contribute?" And really, if you think about it, life has already given us so much. Life has given us life. It's an unconditional gift. And life never demands from us other than to be embraced by life. When we forget to live in this unconditionality, we start to take life for granted. And this transactional outlook robs us of our capacity to expand and to see the larger picture. So when you do things for yourself, but your focus and your mind sight is expanded in the oneness of our human spirit and in the Spirit that lives in all of us, you allow yourself to be guided, and you feel that you are really starting to contribute for the upliftment of others. This concept really hit home during the pandemic for me. We were on lockdown in our home in LA with my family, and it was my birthday, and the party that I had organized to have in New York with my friends and spent a lot of time putting together was of course canceled. So I was going to be with my family, celebrating my birthday at home, which was wonderful on one hand. But on the other hand, I was really letting go of the festivities and how I wanted my birthday to be celebrated. So I asked myself, "Agapi, what is your true birthday wish?" And it dawned on me that if I made my life an offering to life, to God, that I would be able to transcend my agendas of how things should be and the deprivation I started to experience because of the pandemic. So I started to pray to make my life an offering to the Spirit and to become more attuned to how I can become more of service to the good of all, to be less worldly driven and more Spirit driven. Not to focus on my lack, what I don't have, what I want, my ambitions, but to really focus on the heartfelt connections to the soulfulness of life that has always been with me. And of course, it's activated in a new way on my upcoming birthday. So that morning of my birthday, I woke up with a prayer so deep inside my heart saying, "I want more of you God and less of me." All of us on some levels suffer from feelings of deficiency and lack and scarcity, and we're always seeking validation from the outside. But we are holding the key to the door for which we can find that inner validation. That validation is directly connected to us realizing we are connected to the essence of Spirit. When we tune into that, really we will automatically feel validated because we will understand who we really are and who is our source. You might be a mess in your physical reality. You might not have what you need to be happy and fulfilled. You might be going through a very hard time of a breakup, of a loss of a job, of a project that didn't work out. But there is always a loving soul inside of you comforting you and supporting you. The soul doesn't wait until you have it all together to love you. The soul wants to love you right now just as you are. If you come into prayer for access to that soul, trust me, it will overflow into the rest of your life. It doesn't have to be your birthday. You can make this wish anytime to become more aware of the beauty and the light and the inner mastery, that is the birthright of each one of us, waiting to be revealed. You stop being a beggar, begging that life will give you more of that or this to feel complete and whole and happy. I believe that the power of your transformation is not in the big things, but in the small ways we can let go and open ourselves to the presence within us. It takes courage to take the first step towards the unknown presence, to start communing with it, not knowing, when we ask for anything, will it be there to meet us, or will we be left hanging alone? Go to work as the bearer of gifts, and ask Spirit, "How can I bring more of my goodness today?" That kind of shift from what can I get from this to what can I give to this is so profound that it changes your whole life. You're going to start to feel so wealthy, so rich, and it's not something easy. It's something that you have to go deep into your heart, into your mind, into your soul. Tap into your spiritual essence which is about giving. Because our bodies grow by feeding them. Our emotions grow by taking in, our minds grow by taking in, our Spirit grows by giving. Pray about that transformation if you want it. So here's the invitation. From today onwards, I'm inviting you to look at your life as, opposed to "What can I get or achieve?" change it to, "What can I offer? What can I give? How can I be an asset to life?" So our prayer for today will help you with a reflection of your life and deepening into a closer connection with your spiritual nature. So let us do a prayer. Again, receive your breath. Exhale anything you do not need; allow your breath to come in; fill your lungs; fill your heart. Fill your body. Slow down your breath; activate your heart. And today, together we pray, and we ask, dear beloved, when my heart shifts my eyes to your gaze, my whole agenda releases and feels the calm parts of your Spirit flow in me. Today I ask that I may know what it is like to make my life an offering to you. What could life be like if I gave my life back to you? I make my life an offering to you. I give my life back to you. If I now let go of my ambition, my desire to become something more important than I am, my insecurity, and my angst, I release them to your grace. I'm like the most divine circus ringmaster, taming my lesser parts that want more of this and more of that. And I open my arms and say to you, I want more of you. I now breathe you in, and I'm letting you in. And I kneel in the altar of love and immerse myself in the Spirit of oneness. I open my arms and say to you, "I want more of you." I'm breathing you in. I'm letting you in. My life belongs to you. Because in fact, it was never mine. It was freely given to me. Now it is yours again, even more blossomed and fuller than before. And I fill myself with awe and gratitude that my life is a gift, and I give of myself unconditionally as I allow myself to be a giver. Thank you for this newfound liberation that comes with knowing that love can flow in me and from me again so I may touch the hearts of others and be of joyful service. So be it. So for your practice today, my friends, every day for the rest of this Quest, give gifts to people that are not necessarily material, but randomly every day, make your intention to do whatever you do for you personally, for your work, the way you dress, the way you interact with your coworkers, the way you go after your client meetings, the way you are with your children, your family, that the driving force behind what you do is a gentler offering to yourself and is an offering to life as you meet people in your day and interact with people. Allow yourself to do the little things that contribute to somebody else's upliftment. It can be silently walking in the street and sending loving energy to the people in the street. It'll be standing in the coffee shop waiting for your coffee and telling the cashier to cover the person's cost behind you. Make it a gift to be sending flowers to somebody that you feel can use some upliftment. Sending help to someone in need without waiting to be asked. It can be listening to a client in a deeper way when you say, "How are you?" Asking how they are and really listening beyond the transactional interaction, go beyond yourself. Go beyond your ego. Go beyond you as you know you and break the boundaries to your unconditionality. I promise you, if you have that intention in your day, you'll find that your day changes. It becomes richer, alive. You'll be less stressed. You'll be more joyful to know that there are millions of ways to contribute to life. Be creative. It is really the greatest thank you to life, who gave you life, to pass on your energy to others, and remember to first fill your cup up so when you pass it on, you are full. Remember, this is your Quest to your inner connection, to your soul connection. Live it; breathe it; own it; evoke it; embody it; relish it. I look forward to seeing you in the next lesson as you, my friends, become an offering to life. And let's see what happens.

LESSON 2: Meditation - Agapi's Prayer #2

Receive your breath. Exhale, anything you do not need, allow your breath to come in. Feel your lungs. Feel your heart. Feel your body. Slow down. Your breath, activate your heart. And today, together, we pray and we ask Dear, beloved, when my heart shifts my eyes to your gaze, my whole agenda releases and feels the calm parts of your spirit flow in me. Today, I ask that I may know what it is like to make my life an offering to you. What would life be like if I gave my life back to you? I make my life an offering to you. I give my life back to you. If I now let go of my ambition, my desire to become something more important than I am, my insecurity and my angst, I release them to your grace. I'm like the most divine circus ringmaster, taming my lesser parts that want more of this and more of that. And I open my arms and say to you, I want more of you.

Thank you for this newfound liberation that comes with knowing that love can flow in me and from me again, so I may touch the heart of others and be of joyful service. So be it.

LESSON 3: Ask Your Spirit for Direction
--------------------
Welcome back to our Quest. So we are moving forward on our journey, and I hope you have had the opportunity to experience some of the gifts of offering unconditionally and moving from traditional relationships to unconditional relationships. This next lesson, I must say, is one of the most grounding and soothing tools I'm going to share with you. Think of it as having a direct dial to your higher, wiser self. Every day we are all faced with endless decisions, from health to finances, relationships, our homes, our work, kids, even what we are having for dinner or where we should go for dinner. And often we are conflicted, not knowing what is the right choice, and it leaves us in limbo or struggling to find the right direction. This is such a great opportunity to remind yourself that you can reach for your lifeline and dial the Spirit for direction. There is nothing too small to bring to the light. Don't wait for the big decisions to call in the Spirit for direction. You want to make it a habit in your life. I want to tell you a story about how I used this tool. I remember when I was living with my family in Santa Barbara. My sister and her family decided to move to Washington, D.C. I knew it was time for me to leave as well, but I wasn't clear about my direction or what was next for me. I had very little income, and I had interest from publishers to write a book about the Greek goddesses. I kept being nudged to move to New York. I had lived there before. I was dating a man actually in New York and had a lots of friends, and it was also where I participated in my spiritual community and different classes. There was plenty for me to do there, and I would be close to my family in Washington, D.C., but I still felt very scared. It felt like a big change and a big decision to make. So one night before I went to sleep, I prayed and asked for direction. I asked for inner guidance. Well, I had a dream so vivid that I can still remember every detail. I was in a beautiful bedroom, and the man I was dating showed up and said to me, "My name is Baruch," which in Hebrew means blessings. "And I have come to take you to New York with me. You can come by boat or by plane." And I woke up that morning smiling. It was clear as a bell to me: I was going to move to New York. The Spirit just directed me. I felt energized, full of life to make this decision. I packed my things from Santa Barbara with a joyful heart, trusting that the path forward would be revealed to me. Two months later after I moved, I broke up with the man I was dating. I realized he served the purpose of bringing me to New York where my journey was really about learning to express and trust my creativity, finding my inner confidence and strength, and starting a whole new chapter in my life on my own. I found so many new ways to spread my wings, and I realized there were plenty of opportunities available as I kept discovering my connection to God in my daily life in practical ways. Cut. Six years later when I left New York to return to California, I was a different woman. I had written a book. I had built a whole body of work based on the Greek goddesses and explored so many new territories of myself that under the canopy of my family I could not have discovered. So often when we are asked to embark on new adventures, we are terrified of the unknown. But a new calling can be a golden opportunity to step into the fullness of who we truly are. Our tendency is to stay safe and resist change, but life pushes us towards change, and prayer can guide us outside of the harbor to start sailing when we can't predict the weather. Similarly, when I moved out of New York, a lot had changed. Both my parents had passed away, and my sister had been living in Los Angeles, divorced, with her two daughters, and she had asked me to return and live with her in L.A. I was so conflicted. So during one of my spiritual classes, we took a field up to a church in New York that had a labyrinth. There's a beautiful ancient tradition where you imagine an intention and walk the labyrinth. I highly recommend it if you've never done it. It is a metaphor for the journey to the center of your deepest self and back out into the world with a broader understanding of what you need to do and who you are. So as I walked the labyrinth, I was asking for clarity, and an image of a trapeze appeared, and I realized if I could let go of what I have now become accustomed to, that I like, there would be a whole new experience on the other side to catch me. I laughed at how graphic and specific it was at that moment. My direction was clear to me. I knew I had the willingness and the know-how to take the leap. I remember feeling the joy as I was now packing my bags and would be united with my family that I so loved. The terrified girl who had left L.A. six years earlier thinking she found her dream man was returning as a woman recommitting to her purpose and knowing more of who she was. So at every point in my life, I was always shown direction and have been helped in very specific ways as I kept asking. Here is our prayer to assist you to connect to yourself, to your Spirit, at any point you wish to. Come into your heart again; receive your breath. Feel the joy of yourself being breathed; exhale anything you don't want, any tension; release the stress. Come present. And as we receive our next breath, we say, dear Beloved, I quiet myself. I ask that I may move into clarity and receptivity so I may hear the voice of my wisdom in choosing the proper and right decision for the situation. I am presented with various options, and as I consider these options, please guide me to make the right decision that is the perfect choice for me and my family's well-being. As I move forward, I ask to keep the highest good of all concerned in my mind. Allow me to see what is most beneficial for me and not to be distracted by my wishful thinking or the red flags and the pitfalls in my way. I ask to see clearly where there is a greater opportunity for more joy, more peace, less stress. And as I move forward, I ask that I may not let my fear stop me, but that I may be guided by the hand of my higher protective power that is for me. Let that guidance now give me a sense of strength and security and a solid foundation to see the choice that will bring me greater productivity, greater alignment, greater cooperation. Always moving hand in hand with my higher self in this decision. I want to trust myself and my intuition, move away from self-doubt and second-guessing, and let my divine presence be part of this choice. May I move into my fullness and choose what is right for me. I breathe in my patience. I exhale my impatience. I remember that there is no urgency in Spirit. I now thank you for supporting me and helping me move past my own limitations, my ego, and any parts of me that hold me back from knowing that I'm always guided. I always do know what is best for me and my life. I now give this decision over to the light within, and I go free. So be it. So my friends, for your practice today, I want you to think of something where you have to make a choice. It could be anything. It could be about your career, moving cities, a new relationship, or saying goodbye to an old relationship, and to tune in to your Spirit and absolutely see your Spirit guiding you very clearly on how to take this decision and how to move ahead with confidence and clarity. You might put that in the light before you go to sleep. You might write in your journal and might have one quiet time of contemplation and see the images that come to mind. Or you might feel the Spirit is telling you to pause for a little, to just stop, that it's not time to decide and act right now. Learn to trust that there is no urgency in the Spirit. Your Spirit might say, "Hold off on that. Be patient." Be willing to listen to yourself to stop the noise and go beyond the fear. To move towards an expanded sense of trust. There is a wise voice in us that will always counsel us if we can just make room for it to speak. Map it out. See yourself going the distance to see the various outcomes. For example, you might be coming up on a decision to move on. You want to know that moving on is the right decision. It can be a very emotionally turbulent time, and you can't decide from your head or your emotions. Here's what I would do. I would come into prayer. I would come into presence. I would come into silence. Take your time and say, "I give this decision to the light within, and I go free." You offer it. You do your offering to the higher power, and in that freedom you might find yourself packing your bags, putting all your things together, and it all falls into place. Not lip service, but from the depths of your heart and Spirit that says, "You are not alone." You're feeling the energy of Spirit, and you're walking together out of this situation. Isn't that nice? So now, start living your life like that, grounding that energy, grounding that clarity, grounding that power, step by step. See you next time.

====================

LESSON 4: Give Voice to Every Aspect of Yourself
--------------------
Welcome back. I hope you have felt more connected to the direction of your Spirit, accessing your guidance, and you have gained value from knowing the gift of unconditional giving. So today we're going to focus on what it is like to give all parts of ourselves expression and voice. So often in our lives, we operate from familiar patterns of going on autopilot, from one thing to the next, while part of us stay unexpressed, feel disconnected, and maybe even suppressed. Especially during our spiritual path, it is very easy to judge the parts of you that feel fearful, disappointed, upset, jealous, angry, or not good enough. And we might hide those parts from ourselves, thinking we should be perfect, and present an image of having it all together. And what happens when we don't express those parts of ourselves is we're holding energy from our true self. When you're in a company meeting, for example, and somebody cuts you off, you might feel dismayed and unimportant and rejected, hurt. Or something happens at home, and you're walking around with hurt feelings; you know that feeling, right? For example, your significant other didn't take your feelings into consideration. What happens then is that that part of you needs to be acknowledged by you, that it was important and was disregarded. It's important that you allow that part of you the expression that it deserves. Give it a voice; speak it out loud if you need to, but forgive it any judgments that you might have on yourself for feeling that way. Forgiving the other person who made you feel that way, and that energy then starts to be unblocked. It's a very powerful thing that you acknowledge that. That vulnerability is very powerful because you're opening up your consciousness to the other human part of you, and on the other side of that is freedom. The other part of you will say, "Oh, I see I have a friend in me." So you see, when we allow those parts of ourselves to speak, and we really listen to them, you start to feel your heart opens up to all parts of you and understand and bring compassion to those parts of yourself and reassure those parts by saying, "I'm here for you, to stand by you, to protect you, and to love you." And then you realize you're connected to your inner family and have your inner family intact, and that's how you build that inner trust. In order to have a trusting relationship with God in you, you have to first have a trusting relationship in yourself with all parts of you. The child, the adult, the ego, the discouraged person, the reluctant person, the shy person, and all the others. And let's open up the conversation with all these parts without judging them. Start from building a foundation with your inner family instead of pushing them aside. You see, in Greece, we have no word like "fine." There is no such thing, "How are you?" "Fine." We will always have some kind of emotional life going on. And then we will find our consciousness starts to align because we're not withholding or judging any energy from ourselves. You might have a therapist, a coach, a counselor, or a loving friend, but the most loving voice is available inside of us, and it takes courage. When you might feel vulnerable, when your guard comes down and you reach that raw part of yourself that have no defenses, that's okay. You may resist it because the ego likes to feel in control, and thrives on, and pretending it knows everything. So this is where prayer can be totally uplifting and comforting because in prayer we bring all these parts of ourselves to the table and give them compassion and love and permission to be so very human and heal the unhealed places in us. That's the beauty of prayer. The Spirit meets us in our most human parts. Come as you are; nothing to hide. That is your entry point, just as you are, all of you. So let us come into a prayer. Again, focus on your heart; soften your heart. Feel the breath coming in; as you exhale, release the tensions; release the constrictions, and open up to receive. Dear beloved, I am feeling frazzled and out of balance. Something has set me off and removed me from my center, and I would like to take a few moments to refocus on my true sense of being. I ask that I come into acceptance of what just happened and be able to forgive, to look at the deeper issue that might surface for me and then let it go. I ask that any judgment that I have towards myself or the other person of the situation be forgiven. I ask that I may not take everything personally right now, and that I may restore my love and acceptance for myself and recognize that what just happened doesn't mean there is anything wrong with me. In this healing process, I ask and I permit that I may be able to transform from the experience of being out of balance to bringing the Spirit in to restore me. Let it go, and come into my own fullness. I breathe in this balance. I breathe in my centeredness and let go. I allow my feelings to surface, to restore myself into my own balance by not denying how I feel, but knowing that there is me beyond my feelings. And that's the part that I want to connect with more right now. And exhale and receive and come present, and so be it. So my friends, for our practice today, I want you to get your journal or your workbook and ask yourself some questions that can make you aware of what is working and not working and allow you to listen to the deeper voices within you. So ask yourself these questions: What worked today? Sometimes the answers are very simple; sometimes they're bigger things. For example, it can be just that you took a walk in the morning and put down your devices a few hours before bed. Then ask, what would I like to bring more of in my life today? This is an opportunity to hear all the parts of yourself. Maybe you're yearning to have more playfulness in your life. Maybe you need the courage to hear something that has been buried inside of you for some time. And just as a loving mother doesn't say to a child, "Shut up; we don't have time for that." Listen to yourself with love, and give each need an expression and a safe place. And finally, ask yourself, what does Spirit have to say to me? "The Spirit says..." and start to write that down. Do not censor it. Maybe it says, "Shut up, and let me love you." If you make a habit of asking these questions in your mind or writing them down, you could be in the middle of a difficult situation, and you can ask those questions, and you will hear what Spirit advises you in the moment. "Oh, take time to meditate." "You need to let go of this experience." "You need to be more around this person and not be around this person." As you ask yourself these questions, you will start to hear the loving voice of the Spirit which will direct you to be more loving, more attentive, more kind, and compassionate to yourself. And you'll end up feeling way more connected, more safe, more trusting, and you'll walk everywhere with yourself intact and your Godself anchored in you. Isn't that wonderful? What a wonderful day you'll have. So go practice, my friends. Build that inner muscle; build that inner connection. It's yours for your life.

====================

LESSON 4: Meditation - Agapi's Prayer #4

Focus on your heart. Soften your heart. Feel the breath coming in as you exhale, release the tensions, release the constrictions, and open up to receive. Dear Beloved, I am feeling frazzled and out of balance. Something has set me off and removed me from my center, and I would like to take a few moments to refocus on my true sense of being. I ask that I come into acceptance of what just happened and be able to forgive, to look at the deeper issue that might surface for me, and then let it go. I ask that any judgment that I have towards myself or the other person of the situation be forgiven. I ask that I may not take everything personally right now, and that I may restore my love and acceptance for myself and recognize that what just happened doesn't mean there is anything wrong with me. 

In this healing process, I ask and I permit that I may be able to transform from the experience of being out of balance, to bringing the spirit in, to restore me, let it go and come into my own fullness. I breathe in this balance. I breathe in my centeredness and let go. I allow my feelings to surface, to restore myself into my own balance by not denying how I feel, but knowing that there is me beyond my feelings, and that's the part that I want to connect with more right now and exhale and receive and come present and so be it.

Part 2: Creating

====================

LESSON 5: Unleash Your Creativity
--------------------
Welcome to Part Two of our Quest, Creating. So before we start on our lesson today, let's just call in the light and get into the habit of bringing the light forward. So everybody just take a deep breath or receive your breath as we say; exhale anything you do not need; come present in your heart; receive the breath. And we ask just now for the light of the Spirit that lives in all of us to fill us, surround us, and protect us, and we ask that we may release and let go of anything that we do not need to hold in our consciousness, and we may return into the fullness of our heart, at peace, serene, confident, calm, and connected. Thank you. So today's lesson is going to be about creativity, and I hope you've all been able to give parts of yourself a voice that you might have been judging or might have been dormant. So remember, this Quest is about awakening to your inner connection with your mighty Spirit. We continue to awaken parts of ourselves that we bring into the light to integrate in the path of our spiritual connection. So today, we are going to address a very important part of our Quest, and in this lesson, we will explore our creative nature. If you think about it, everything in the universe is creation, right? Just think about nature, the thousands of animals, the plants, the ocean, the planets, the stars, the moon, the sun, ourselves. Some transcendent intelligence created this awesome, mind-blowing universe. The same power of creation created us. How amazing is that? And in each one of us, creativity is embedded. As children, we are unabashed and unafraid and uninhibited as we embark in our own creative journey, whatever it is. But as we grow into adults, we start to judge it. We start to feel it's not good enough or that other people are doing it better, or we compare ourselves, and we try to control our own creativity. A lot of it is our ego and preserving ourselves as we know ourselves. We don't want to get out of our comfort zone. We don't want to seem awkward or silly or vulnerable. So the ego will often stop us from moving forward because it doesn't want its image to be cracked. It's trying to keep us safe, and there is nothing safe about creativity. When we create, we enter unknown territories that form as we go along. In a way, we have to release control over what the result will be. We have to be willing to attempt something that, if we don't like the outcome, we have to start again. But you can't get there by thinking about it or analyzing it. You have to roll up your sleeves and dive in it. For me I'll never forget the first time that I decided to put a one-woman show together, and I assembled all the stories of the Greek goddesses and their myths and started to build a kaleidoscope about their main archetypes. I remember listening to my inner guidance as I was directed to finding material that related to my subject. I kept piecing things together and putting all my favorite monologues and matching them with the Greek archetypes. It ended up being an extraordinarily original piece of work that was recognized by museums, by theaters, by different organizations as I performed it. It was a complete inspiration from my creative nature, and it sparked it off. But I walked past the fear and the self-doubt of what the piece was going to be about. And then at some point, I was asked to write a book, and that was one of the most terrifying, scary experiences, I can tell you for sure. I had said yes, but I had no idea what to write and how to fill blank pages. I'll never forget, a dear friend of mine came to my apartment in New York to stay with me, and she woke me up one early morning and said to me, "Agapi, get up. Spirit has a message for you." I got up and I thought to myself, God help me. It's six o'clock in the morning. What does this woman have to say to me? So what she said to me was life-changing. She said, "Spirit wants you to know you have everything you need to write this book, but you lack one thing, confidence." Hello...of course I did. "Because you think you're going to do it alone, and that's your downfall. You don't do it alone. You have inner guides, Agapi. You have the very goddesses, the archetypes, that are real, that are helping you. You have your Spirit. You have to access it every time you're about to write." Wow. I remember writing it all with bold red letters over a big notepad. To this day, I have saved the papers, and it shifted my approach forever about everything. You don't do it alone. Every day I got up, I called forward the light, the power of my creative nature, my creative Spirit, and it started to flood through me. I wrote in napkins at Starbucks. I dictated on my iPhone while I was walking. I went to bookstores and browsed books on goddesses and mythology, and the perfect paragraphs would jump out. It was like someone invisible was holding my hand, moving me from page to page, from chapter to chapter. I got so high. I remember going to spinning classes, and poems for these goddesses would just flood out of me, and I would go home and write them. I opened the lid, and that tsunami of creativity came out. It was an awesome experience. Opening to your creativity is a form of prayer. You allow yourself to go beyond your personality, beyond your ego and your judgements, and you crack the door open to your creative, soulful nature. So go for it. Whatever it is inside of you that you've been wanting to do, you crave to do, but you think, "Oh no, not me, not now." What do you have to lose? Except maybe protecting your self-image. Do you want to go through your life living in this limited image, or do you want to find the expanded version of yourself? You never know what is hidden in there. The expanded version of yourself meets you when you dare to open the door. So here's a prayer for today that will help you open up to your creativity. Allow your breath to come in; center yourself to yourself. Evoke your heartfelt energy, your Spirit, your light. Dear, beloved, I ask now that I may allow my expression to flow freely. I ask that I may trust myself to bring forth whatever I hear inside, to follow my creative pulse, to withhold nothing, and to trust that I will be given the guidance to bring forth what is mine to bring forth. I ask to suspend all judgments and all criticisms and not second guess myself, to allow my process. I give myself permission to not know the whole picture or the whole outcome. I give myself permission to take every step as it is present in the day and to trust that the pieces will unfold and will be revealed to me. I ask that I may be connected to my source, know that I'm a creative being, and not compare my expression to anyone else's. I may receive inspiration from others, and I may see others' extraordinary expressions, but that does not mean that mine aren't as good. I ask that I may know the depths of my being, that I'm a creator, that I am part of the creator, and therefore, I too have been given the gift to create. It is my God-given gift. I release myself from any self-imposed pressure, and I allow my own rhythm to unfold. I do this as an offering back to the life that is given to me and to the uniqueness that is mine to live by and express. I allow divine inspiration. No matter how small my contribution is, I do not judge it as insignificant because in every garden and in every orchard, it's the tiny little flowers that make up the whole. I'm excited to see what unfolds and experience the gift of my own creativity. So be it. So my friends, for your practice today, here's what I want to ask you to do. I'm going to guide you through a visualization exercise. So do it with me right now, and I encourage you to do it every day. Start to do it every day throughout the day to support yourself to get clear on what you want to create. So right now, take a moment; come into a place of quiet, and ask yourself, "What is it that I would like to create?" Get this image in your mind's eye, and bring it forth in a dynamic way. What would it look like if you're creating this thing you want to create? What would you feel like? Excited, joyful, anticipating something wonderful? A little scared, maybe? What did it make you feel when you put it all together? What would it feel like to create that idea out of nothing? And start to see yourself moving step-by-step. What comes up for you as you are imagining this creative experience? Do you want to hold back? Is it fear, apprehension, not trusting yourself, being judgmental of yourself? Is it that you have to move out of your comfort zone, that you might experience more aliveness and stepping into more of the unknown creative territory? Just scan through your consciousness, and just look at everything objectively. No judgments. Start to conjure up moving past your fear and your discomfort, allowing Spirit to usher you forward, connected to your creative nature, connected to your heart. Bring this vision right now to this present moment. See yourself feeling elated, joyful, like an excited child. And now let's ask for the Spirit of your creative expression to support you a hundred percent as you support yourself and have fun creating it. Now write down in detail, as if it's already happened, in a way as if you were telling a friend looking back of how you did it. Remember, your creative expression is a gift, and you have a responsibility to nurture it, fertilize it, tend to it. And as you would with a garden, weeding out the judgments, the comparisons, the thoughts of unworthiness and self-doubt. So go for it. The expanded version of yourself will be there to meet you when you dare to open the door.

LESSON 5: Meditation - Agapi's Prayer #5

Allow your breath to come in, center yourself to yourself, evoke your heartfelt energy, your spirit, your light. Dear Beloved, I ask now that I may allow my expression to flow freely. I ask that I may trust myself to bring forth whatever I hear inside, to follow my creative pulse, to withhold nothing and to trust that I will be given the guidance to bring forth what is mine to bring forth. I ask to suspend all judgments and all criticisms and not second guess myself to allow my process. I give myself permission to not know the whole picture or the whole outcome. I give myself permission to take every step as it is present in the day, and to trust that the pieces will unfold and will be revealed to me. I ask that I may be connected to my source, know that I'm a creative being and not compare my expression to anyone else's. 

I may receive inspiration from others, and I may see others' extraordinary expressions, but that does not mean that mine aren't as good. I ask that I may know the depths of my being, that I'm a creator, that I am part of the creator, and therefore I too have been given the gift to create. It is my God-given gift. I release myself from any self-imposed pressure and I allow my own rhythm to unfold. I do this as an offering back to the life that is given to me and to the uniqueness that is mine to live by and express. I allow divine inspiration. No matter how small my contribution is. I do not judge it as a significant, because in every garden and in every orchard, it's the tiny little flowers that make up the hall. I'm excited to see what unfolds and experience the gift of my own creativity, so be it.

LESSON 6: You Hold the Keys to Your Purpose
--------------------
Welcome back to our Quest, and I hope that you keep giving yourself permission to be creative and tap into the joy of your own creativity. So today, I want to address a question that so many people ask me which is, "How do I find my purpose?" Young people, older people, it seems that we are all looking to find the meaning of our lives. In psychology, Maslow's Hierarchy of Human Needs places finding your purpose, which it calls self-actualization, at the very top of the pyramid, where you find the realization of your potential, self-fulfillment, seeking personal growth, and peak experiences. Maslow describes this level as the desire to accomplish everything that one can to become the most that one can be, what we call your purpose. I want to make something very clear. There is a difference between what you do and what your purpose is. And I believe we all have a purpose on this earth, and I feel that our purpose is to awaken to who we truly are, to the authentic part of ourselves that is embedded in us. In this Quest, I really hope that all of you will realize that your purpose is to awaken to yourself, and you'll feel a sense of peace, and you'll have a sense of rootedness and connection to your source, to your spiritual nature, to the whole. Everything that happens or doesn't happen in your life is a way to redirect you back inside yourself. So although, if you look around, everything seems to be geared towards the outer world and what we do-our profession, our careers, our relationships, our challenges, our finances- our way to open up the pathways to our soul, to our Spirit, to our divinity, is our purpose. So here are some fundamental questions to start asking yourself that can help you open up to discovering your purpose. What am I here to learn? What am I here to overcome? What am I here to complete? What am I here to share? And am I enjoying my life? And if not now, when? This is where prayer can be helpful to you because with your prayer, you can start connecting to your higher self which can reveal your purpose and your calling. Through prayer, you can find fulfillment while you are in the process of growing. You can have more compassion and love for yourself and everything in your life can start becoming more purposeful. You'll be more patient with yourself; you'll start to be more of a human being rather than a human doing. So whatever you do, you'll start to do from a place of connection. So the simplest thing, like washing your car, baking a pie, paying your bills, teaching a class, volunteering, you'll start to feel a sense of purpose because you are alive inside yourself, and everything in your life has more of a spirit of contributing, of being of service to yourself and others. So there'll be a softening inside of you rather than a pushing. For a long time, I thought my acting career was my purpose, but because it wasn't really happening for many years, I felt purposeless, and I thought I was drifting, and I had a sense of unfulfillment, and I had to go deeper and discover that what I really wanted was the ability to freely express myself and my heart, my loving. So I embarked into a deeper exploration of myself to study psychology and spirituality. I started pursuing projects that allowed me to fully express my creativity, to be more proactive, instead of relying on the world to give me what I wanted, which wasn't happening. You have the blueprint to your soul. What is your blueprint? Don't confuse purpose with ego recognition. A lot of us focus on external validation; you think to yourself, "No one is recognizing me. I want to feel needed, but no one needs me." We have it backwards, we need to go inside first, do some inner work, do some excavation, accept who you are, find out who you are, and then that will guide you to your purpose. Then you start living in your true nature and awakening to who you are. I became proactive in giving the world what I had inside of me, and that was my biggest mindset shift. That's what made me feel really happy and fulfilled. I was no longer dependent on the external world for accepting me, giving me the roles that I wanted, recognizing me as a talented actress. I used my own creative source to create my own outlets. I got empowered in order to do what I had to do to find out what I had to offer. In my experience, it took guts, prayer, and attunement and listening to jump off the diving board. There are many times I questioned myself, what if I fail? I had to keep moving past my fears, past my doubts. Shakespeare said it best, "Our doubts are traitors and make us lose the good we often might win, by fearing to attempt." Let me read that one more time for all of you, "Our doubts are traitors and make us lose the good we often might win, by fearing to attempt," isn't that wonderful? What a great saying. Sometimes when the universe doesn't give us what we want, it instead offers us the greatest gift, forcing us to look within and realize that we truly want ourselves, and we've got it in us to get to what we want. That was my experience. I didn't get the acting roles I thought I wanted, but I got Agapi. The opportunity to play myself fully on the greatest stage of the world. Spirit is about commitment, devotion, but you have to be committed to your true north star. Learn to trust; learn to listen to your inner voice; it's so waiting there for you. This is how you make God your partner; it's sacred; it's you and your inner Spirit, bonding. And the more you make God your partner, which is my favorite affirmation ever, and the more you anchor that in your very cells and become a vortex or a magnet of the good coming to you, the more the universe will respond to you. Your purpose will find you; the opportunities will find you; the doors will open, and you'll find that you are living in your own portable paradise, walking this earth as a free human conduit of the divine. And how marvelous is that? Funnily enough, there are hundreds of books written about the pursuit of happiness. But where are we ever taught the pursuit of our awakening our Spirit, the pursuit of our soul's awakening? Happiness is a byproduct of that. When you spiritually awaken, you are going to be ecstatic. So here's a beautiful prayer for us today which will make you more receptive to seeing the purpose of your life. Allow your breath to fill you; soften your heart. Let go of anything that doesn't belong to you. Let us come into the presence of our heart. Dear Beloved, thank you for this moment, thank you for being there and shining a light on me, on my life and my purpose. As I'm embarking on this journey of my work, my life, my relationships, I ask that I receive assistance to understand what I'm here to do on this earth. When I feel alone and disconnected in the world, please show me that I'm always connected to you. I open myself to this shift in my awareness. I ask that I may know that I was born with a purpose embedded in my heart so that I may experience love, express my creativity, feel connected to myself and others, and know joy. I open the gates for you to show me the purpose in my everyday life. Allow me to experience who I am; allow me to see that my purpose doesn't have to come with fanfare; it can gently glide into my heart and give me peace of mind and a steadiness of direction that will capture my heart and bring me a sense of calm. Let me hear the whisper in my ear that I am here for a reason. I came to learn, grow, share, give, receive and experience; this I know. How wondrous it is to fill the empty spaces with your love, trusting that I will find the courage and feel the confidence that I never walk alone. So be it. So your practice today is quite simple; every day, from this day forward, please affirm the following statement, "My purpose on this earth is to fully awaken to who I already am, connected to my source." Write it down, if you will; display it somewhere where you can see it every day as you are reminded of your purpose. And next, answer these questions in your journal, and let yourself free flow as you express yourself. I want you to ask yourself right now the questions, what am I here to learn? What am I here to teach? What am I here to overcome? What am I here to complete? What am I here to express and to share? And am I enjoying my life? And if not now, when? What is stopping me from fully enjoying my life? What qualities do I need to bring forward in my life to appreciate myself and my life as it is so that I can fully awaken to deeper parts of myself? Answer these questions; every day, they might be different, you know, different answers might come to you; allow them to show up. It might be while you are driving or you might be walking that you might have an awakening; you might just catch the Spirit, as we say, and you might say, "Oh, that's what I'm learning now at this phase of my life." "Oh, that's what I'm here to teach; I'm here to teach love or kindness. I'm here to teach how to listen; I'm here to teach compassion." You don't know what's going to show up, so keep the doors open of your mind, your perceptions, and I will see you at the next lesson where we'll explore greater possibilities of opening up to your amazing Spirit.

LESSON 6: Meditation - Agapi's Prayer #6

Allow your breath to feel you soften your heart. Let go of anything that doesn't belong to you. Let us come into the presence of our heart. Dear Beloved, thank you for this moment. Thank you for being there and shining a light on me, on my life and my purpose. As I'm embarking on this journey of my work, my life, my relationships, I ask that I receive assistance to understand what I'm here to do on this earth. When I feel alone and disconnected in the world. Please show me that I'm always connected to you. I open myself to this shift in my awareness. I ask that I may know that I was born with a purpose embedded in my heart, so that I may experience love, express my creativity, feel connected to myself and others, and know joy. I open the gates for you to show me the purpose in my everyday life. 

Allow me to experience who I am. Allow me to see that my purpose doesn't have to come with fanfare. It can gently glide into my heart and give me peace of mind and a steadiness of direction that will capture my heart and bring me a sense of calm. Let me hear the whisper in my ear that I am here for a reason. I came to learn, grow, share, give, receive, and experience this. I know how wondrous it is to feel the empty spaces with your love. Trusting that I will find the courage and feel the confidence that I never walk alone. So be it.

Part 3: Becoming

====================

LESSON 7: Becoming You Is Your Greatest Accomplishment
--------------------
Welcome to part three of our Quest, Becoming. Let's evoke the light. You can close your eyes; come present in your heart; take a deep, long, slow breath, and we ask for the light of the Spirit that lives in all of us to fill us, surround us, and protect us. And we ask just now that anything that we do not need in our consciousness be released into the nothingness, and we may return to a place of peace, of calm, rekindling our enthusiasm for our life. I hope that you've all had an opportunity to explore your purpose and found the connection with a sense of peace, knowing that your purpose can change from day to day as you evolve and grow and discover what matters to you. I remember one time a dear friend of mine was diagnosed with cancer. Before that, her mission in life had been to care for other people, women and children, and she run an organization that did just that. But when she was diagnosed, she called me and said, "Agapi, my purpose in my life right now is to look after myself and take excellent care of myself and pass the center into other people." That awareness of how things can shift and that there doesn't need to be an illness to shift is what I want to talk about today on the subject of becoming yourself. First of all, what do we mean by yourself? Becoming yourself is an ever-growing, alive consciousness that is never stagnant. It is the true expression of who you are as a person. That never stops as long as you are alive. So you can never really say, "Oh, good, I'm done." When you say I'm done, you die inside. Part of becoming yourself is really embracing all aspects of yourself. It has nothing to do with your goals. We're not talking about building your career or relationship; we're talking about how everything in your life is a guidepost to becoming more self-soul-aware. Everyone talks about mindfulness or self-awareness. We need to focus on your soul awareness. How are you going to commit to your larger Spirit, to your life force? Something that leads you to be more connected with yourself. The amazing thing with your self is that it is not set in stone. You're always evolving. You're always being pulled into this inner journey, and that's how you become you. You get more and more connected to this inner you by calling in the light, everything you do, so that the light in your soul becomes more present in your everyday life, in everything you do. The purpose in our lives is to become ourselves fully by embodying our gifts, our magnificence, our heart and our human and spiritual nature. The wonderful thing is that all of us have the seed of what we are to become embedded in us. Like the seeds of a fruit tree or a flower. If you plant the seed, it's going to become a tree. It's the miracle of a seed. Fruit trees or flowers or vegetables, everything starts with seeds, and then it becomes fully blossomed. This is what's known as entelechy, from the Greek word entelecheia in philosophy. That which realizes or makes actual what is otherwise merely potential: entelechy. In each one of us, there are the seeds of our potential. So we don't have to go on a search; we just have to keep on living our lives, exploring and keeping in mind that who we are is already whole and complete and perfect. I remember I was doing a podcast one day and sharing a lot about spiritual awareness and about my books and the power of prayer, and someone asked me, "How did you become you?" I thought that was such a wonderful, interesting question. I've already told you a bit about my story, how I was raised in Greece, educated in the Royal Academy of Dramatic Arts as an actress, and through a series of synchronicities, I went to Los Angeles, and ultimately, I awakened to the fact that I was a soul in a human body, and I had embarked on the search to fully awaken. So although I didn't have the script of what my life might look like, I had the thread that connected me to my inner knowing. That is always so powerful and always in us. I had unlocked my blueprint. And from that moment in my life, when I met my spiritual teacher, John-Roger, I started to do many classes and seminars and go on to exploration of my soul-awakening consciousness. It took me years to find my work in the world and how I could express my gifts, my loving, my heart. Nothing that I did was futile. Nothing of my struggles and my challenges was futile. Everything that I worked for, everything that didn't happen, everything that did happen, all the things I didn't get, the projects that fell through, the relationships that didn't work, everything was part of becoming myself. And that's what I want to bring home to you, that we often judge the times of our lives that we don't know what to do next or things are not going our way, or we feel uncertain or relationships fall apart. Everything, absolutely everything, is grist for the mill. We judge ourselves on these, what I call the in-between times. In between work, in between relationships, and we question ourselves. And these times can be the most potent, times when we are birthing new experiences. We need to make presence and space for the soul to come in. It can feel a bit amorphous, but if we keep the prayer going, the connection going, we can bring more presence, more peace, more acceptance in our life. What happens when you bring more presence into your life? You start to build character, resilience. You start to find your abilities to create, your abilities to discern, to start to learn what's for you and what's not for you. And exploring, realizing that everything is here to lead you to the journey inward, all the miles and the values and peaks are worth the effort, to know that you are returning to your true home within yourself. So often in this path, we forget that the only way to use the outer world is to pull through open inner doors and crush our inner barriers to our Spirit. I cannot tell you how many times on my journey to becoming myself I went after things, raising money for projects, wanting to produce major miniseries, and I remember raising money and being rejected over and over and over again. And yet, all these rejections that I got led me to go deeper and deeper into myself. It's such a setup. And when you realize that you will be liberated to do the outer world with joy and with curiosity and with exploration, and with absolutely no judgment of where you should be at any time. So for any of you who are going through these in-between times, or you might be judging yourself for where you are, where you are not, where you should be, let us do a prayer to come into the peace of our heart. Dear Beloved, I ask for the light to help me transform every day of my life. I ask to be able to understand that every day, every event, and everything that does and does not happen to me is part of my understanding of the soul of who I am, the being of who I am, and the joy of who I am. I ask that the parts of me that doubt, that feel a sense of hopelessness or despair, be transmuted into the light. And in their place, I ask to find joy, hope, love, and expansion. Even in my most uncertain moments, I ask to know that I am taken care of, and there is a path carved out for me even if I cannot see it. I ask that love be embedded in my heart, my mind and self because I am love made manifest. My very cells right now are kept alive and together by the vibration and consciousness of love. I'm so grateful to know the light. I'm so grateful to know that there is more to me than this physical body and the reality of my life. And whatever parts of me don't know this, please allow me to see them. I am open. I receive, and I celebrate the miracle of my life as I watch myself become. So be it. Here's a practice that will help you in your journey to be becoming you, to revealing the true expression of yourself. Today, I want you to write a short story about yourself or what has led you to this point in your life. Write it from the third person as if you were writing a novel. For example, if I was writing a short story for myself, I would say, "Agapi left London and moved to LA to do a movie and was treated like a star and felt like the world had opened up and her dream was coming true. But one day the producer called her and said that the movie was not going forward, and she had to return to London. And at that point, she was faced with a decision to go back to her family or stay in LA facing the unknown. Whatever led her to say yes and to stay was the mighty Spirit that she didn't yet know that she was about to discover." That's what I would say if I was writing my story. And write it like you are writing a novel, describing the attributes that you found on the way of becoming you. And then continue writing it and start from where you are now, to your future self, and the next year of your life, reinforcing the positive and all the qualities that you want to embrace and to awaken. And for example, it would be like, "And at that point in her life, Agapi became so masterful about doing the things that brought her joy. She knew she was contributing to the world. She knew she was in alignment, and from that moment on, she decided to come fully present with herself. For herself, there was a shift in the perception that her joy only came from contributing to others." And then when you have that story in your novel, please name your story and put as many details as possible, and then please share it with someone else in your community. Amazing work today. I'm going to leave you with a short blessing in your workbook, which you can read and print any time you need a reminder. I love you. I'll see you in the next lesson. I'm so excited for you.

====================

LESSON 7: Meditation - Agapi's Prayer #7

Dear Beloved, I ask for the light to help me transform every day of my life. I ask to be able to understand that every day, every event, and everything that does and does not happen to me is part of my understanding of the soul, of who I am, the being of who I am and the joy of who I am. I ask that the parts of me that doubt, that feel a sense of hopelessness or despair, be transmuted into the light and in their place. I ask to find joy, hope, love, and expansion. Even in my most uncertain moments, I ask to know that I am taken care of and there is a path carved out for me even if I cannot see it. I ask that love be embedded in my heart, my mind, and self, because I am love made manifest. My very selves right now are kept alive and together by the vibration and consciousness of love. I'm so grateful to know the light. I'm so grateful to know that there is more to me than this physical body and the reality of my life. And whatever parts of me don't know this, please allow me to see them. I am open, I receive, and I celebrate the miracle of my life as I watch myself become. So be it.

====================

LESSON 8: Break Free From the Chains of Perfectionism and Self-Doubt
--------------------
Welcome back. In our last lesson, we touched on the power of the journey of becoming you, and today I want to address something that stops us and inhibits us of becoming fully ourselves. The pressure we put on ourselves, that we should be perfect. When you put the pressure on yourself to becoming your true self, every so often, you might find that you create an ideal you in your mind, either due to your own expectations of yourself or what you perceive as the expectations of others have for you. The pressure can grow to a point where you're putting yourself in the straitjacket of who you should be, and at some point, we start to feel unsafe in this world. Everyone has an image they're projecting, so if you are putting yourself in a straitjacket of all you think you should be, you are never going to feel you're becoming you. And at some point, if you look back in your life, you'll realize that you start adopting certain images, and you put a block on your true expressions. And on top of that, we might feel very vulnerable, very uncomfortable in our vulnerability, and we cover it; we suffer the consequences of feeling the lack of spontaneity. It's like the feeling of walking around in an empty house; you start to feel like an imposter. We then start to adjust, and we put on this image of perfection, which goes against our hearts because you know what? Our hearts are perfect just the way they are; they don't need adjustment. I remember that as a young girl, barely a teenager, my parents separated, and my mother took my sister Arianna and I away. I suffered endlessly because I missed my father. And my idea of perfection was that people being good to one another, getting along with one another, and living happily ever after in my ideal Greek village. As a response, I created a fictional character, named Anna, who could do no wrong. She was perfect, Anna. She would say the perfect things and act in the perfect manner and knew exactly how to interact with boys, and she even ate all the right things. This was my way of coping, of trying to figure out how to exist in a world in which my parents were separated, and in so much pain, as a result, I was going through. I felt such uncertainty in my life, that I was extremely insecure and vulnerable. Anna, was my little friend who always knew what to do, and I relied on her perfection for a sense of security. And that, my friends, is where perfection comes from, our ego. When we try to control our environment to be perfect, it gives us a sense of feeling grounded. But when we focus on being perfect, we miss the incredible opportunity to connect with God in our most vulnerable and raw parts. I remember a dear friend of mine who was a highly neurotic perfectionist in every single way, the kind of woman who had to hang her clothes in the same direction on the hangers. She said to me, "It took the birth of my child to throw away every idea of perfection, and raising him every day, my perfection is crushed. In the eyes of that child, in his unbridled energy, I found perfect harmony in life's imperfections." In the face of having a little child that cries when it wants, poops when it wants to, sleeps when it wants to, there is a sense of protecting this child that totally relies on you. You realize that the birth of a child to every mother involves surrendering control. Birthing, raising, growing up, running around the house, breaking a lamp, spilling the milk on the couch, pooping on a new outfit, there is no controlling this being who doesn't have control over themselves. This baby became a mirror of herself, showing how she could not control everything. When she got it, she realized that she had to completely let go. She had to sit back, and upon that realization, she loosened up the tight knot inside herself. Up until that point, everything inside of her had been like a straitjacket, and suddenly, things opened up for her; she could breathe. When I was writing my books, I had to learn that a lot of writing was just throwing out ideas, and texts, and editing, and out of that would come pearls. I had to accept that a lot of things were coming out, and I had to suspend judgments of how things were going, and a lot of it was recalculating, reediting. It's an exercise in letting go of perfectionism. Anybody who has been in the creative process- writing books, producing a play, creating artwork-will understand this. So how does perfectionism affect our spirituality? People who go on a spiritual path tend to feel that they should now be perfect. They go on a retreat, and then they put this image that, "Now I should be perfect and should not feel anything that's negative because now I'm spiritual," they say. They think they should not get jealous or angry or upset or sad, and when they step out of the spiritual path and they force themselves not to feel real feelings, not to say the thing they need to say, they start to do what I call a spiritual bypass. It's a powerful pressure to put on yourself which is to deny the essence of your humanity and who you are. If we reject ourselves, we never really get to experience the magnificent joy of our spiritual nature. So in our spiritual nature, it's loving and accepting all parts of ourselves, and this is such a big battle. Basically, however you decide to live, this is just to remind you that you're making up your own rules. You're making up your own norms, and if you deny yourself the inherited freedom inside of you in your struggle for perfectionism, you're going to find yourself feeling very small and deny the Spirit in you that is very large and very free. In our spiritual nature, we are free. In our human nature, we put so many barriers around us that it's very hard to experience our freedom. So, I want to encourage you to look at the areas in your life where you hold yourself hostage, through the idea of perfectionism. There is nothing like birth and illness to really teach us this. COVID showed that we have no control, and we were all brought to our knees. You can fold napkins perfectly, but if a hurricane comes through, it's going to mess up your napkins. We should aim to be like children when it comes to perfection. Children have no sense of perfectionism and they're so alive: they ride bikes, and they fall, and they get up, and they keep doing it. They don't censor themselves; they're fully alive. The price we pay for perfection is losing our sense of aliveness. What leads to perfectionism is the critical judgmental voice. It tells us not to do something if we can't execute it perfectly, and it manifests in procrastination. For example, we feel like we can't exercise, even though we feel so much better after we exercise; we become judgmental about ourselves, about our bodies. People shut themselves down when they come to meetings because they feel that the people around them somehow have more authority, and they are the chosen ones. And because of social media, this part of ourselves can really beat us bloody. "Oh, I'm not doing as much as the other people. I'm not as popular, et cetera, et cetera." Some time ago, I was attending a woman's conference where I ran into a dear young friend of mine. We were having coffee together during a break, and she said to me, "Oh, Agapi, I feel very unimportant in this kind of environment." I asked her, "How so?" She said, "Well, everybody is somebody; people have careers; they have books, credentials, and I feel I am only at the starting point in my life. I feel like I'm nobody to these people." I chuckled, and I said, "Well, you're definitely somebody to me because I care for you and think you are just the most wonderful girl." But she still felt small and contracted. I said, "Well, now look; imagine that we are all in a boat and the boat was sinking. We were all alerted to get into the life rafts filled with young people, older people, the crew, captain, and everybody else on board. How would you feel?" "Oh, I would feel scared," she said. "Of course," I said. "But would you feel less important than the crew or the bestselling author behind you?" "No, I would feel like we're all in it together," she replied. Well, that's exactly the point. Our ego and the hierarchy of the world makes us feel like there are more important people and less important people, and nothing could be further from the truth because we are all the same. Some people might have achieved more than others, might have greater accomplishments, but that doesn't make you any less than anyone else. This hierarchy that we play in our world can create such a sense of separation, and ultimately, loneliness. So let us release that belief that we are less important while other people are more important. Let us come into a prayer. Come into your heart; call forward your light; enhance the sense of your belovedness, and let's pray. Dear Beloved, I see how my desire for things to be perfect and harmonious is costing me my well-being, my freedom, and my peace. I ask for a deeper and higher sense of presence, calm, divine perfection of each situation, so that I may make unconditional love more important than anything. In truth, I don't know how to do this. The most I can do is admit that my perfectionism is preventing me from living fully in my joy. I ask now to let go of how I think things should be so I may elevate my consciousness and see the perfection in how things are. I exhale...ah...and I experience the unbinding of the ties that have closed me in. Now I can let myself really breathe, be in my perfect divine expression. I'm so grateful. So be it. So my friends, for your practice today, I want you to look into your life and see where have you censored yourself. Where does your critical voice rob you of yourself? Let's just give it a voice; what does it say? "You can't do it; you'll just mess it up. Other people have already done it. They've done it better than you. You're not as popular; you're not as creative. You're not as beautiful, as sexy, as funny; you are not as loved as other people." Take this voice, and let it go. Write it down; burn it. Tear it up. Send it to the Aegean; put it on a rocket to Mars. Be ruthless with yourself, and say, "You no longer have access to my consciousness." Close those doors, and put a lock on the door. And then here are some good affirmations. "I give myself permission to take my space and my place in this world." "I claim my gifts, and what I have, and see what I want to create for myself, and I create it." "From that place of knowing my value, I can reach out and ask for help, learn from people, connect with mentors." But always remember, that your value does not depend upon your accomplishments. "I give myself permission to know my fullness. I write the script of my life and the way I want to do it. So be it."

LESSON 8: Meditation - Agapi's Prayer #8

Come into your heart, call forward your light, enhance the sense of your belovedness, and let's pray. Dear Beloved, I see how my desire for things to be perfect and harmonious is costing me my wellbeing, my freedom, and my peace. I ask for a deeper and higher sense of presence, calm, divine perfection of each situation, so that I may make unconditional love. More important than anything, in truth, I don't know how to do this. The most I can do is admit that my perfectionism is preventing me from living fully in my joy. I ask now to let go of how I think things should be, so I may elevate my consciousness and see the perfection in how things are. I exhale, ah, and I experience the unbinding of the ties that have closed me in. Now I can let myself really breathe, be in my perfect divine expression. I'm so grateful, so be it.

Part 4: Overcoming

====================

LESSON 9: Get Bigger Than Your Fear
--------------------
Welcome back to our Quest. Today we're embarking on Part Four of our Quest, which is about overcoming. So before we start, let's just evoke the light. Come present in your heart; allow your breath to come in, and let the breath go out. Come into coherence with the raising and the falling of your breath. And we ask just now for the light of the Spirit that lives in all of us to be present, to surround us, protect us, and fill us. And we ask that we may let go of anything that we do not need to hold in our consciousness. And we are grateful. Thank you. So I hope by now you've all had a chance to release your ideas and your perceptions of perfectionism and that you're feeling more accepting and loving to yourself just the way you are. I know that I love that song by Bruno Mars, and I hope you play it a lot. "I Love You Just the Way You Are." That's it. I love you just the way you are. Through that lesson, you got a sense that this hierarchy of who is important, who is not important is very worldly way of looking in our lives. It really has nothing to do with the spiritual reality of who we all are, and that's where we are shifting our perception today, to look at our lives and the world and each other through the lens of an elevated spiritual vision and perception. So today we are going to address something that is inherited in every human being that I know, and this is the energy of fear. Now, have you ever met anybody who said, "Oh, I don't know what fear is." If you have met somebody like that, can you please introduce them to me because I would love to know a human being who has never experienced fear. You see, fear is part of the human condition, and it shows up in our lives as an anticipation of something bad happening. My favorite acronym of the word fear is False Expectations Appearing Real. Science tells us that fear starts from the primitive part of our brain called the amygdala where it triggers what is called a fight-or-flight response. It is a reaction of the body to preserve itself even if the perceived threat is not physical or real. You could be going to work on the subway or getting on a flight or having a meeting, and your body produces adrenaline to prepare you for that fight-or-flight response. It tries to protect you in the anticipation that something could go very wrong, and you have to watch out for yourself. I would like you all to understand how we can all go past that and move into a spiritual, calm-centered energy and presence of our soul and Spirit. And as we talked before, elevate our consciousness. That we can teach ourselves that when we are in that fear anxious mode, first of all, we do not judge it. The key to all this is not judging it because if you judge it, you deny yourself and you rob yourself of the opportunity to shift it. Is that clear? That's a very powerful thing to understand. Instead of judging it, you can acknowledge it; you can name it, and once you name it as we say, you can tame it. You have authority over it. So the minute you find yourself in fear, if we have the mindset at that moment to say, "Okay, you know, I can feel this fear showing up; it's bubbling up inside of me. On the one hand I have this fear, and it's okay; it's normal; it's human. On the other hand, I have my God; I have my presence. I have my connection to my inner power, and I can embrace that fear, and I know what to do in the face of fear." See how that is way more empowering? You start to feel that you are in control. You start to claim your power. You start to claim the power of your spiritual self. Let me tell you a story. My mother, Ellie, fought the Second World War as a nurse and was confronted by Nazis, and one day she was in the mountains where they were treating patients. So the Nazis burst in through the door, marched in and started to shoot with their machine guns. At that moment, as they were shooting with their machine guns, my mother got up, and, in perfect German because she spoke perfect German, said "Put down the guns; you have no right to shoot. We are Red Cross." And she said at that moment, she saw three machine guns go down. Now that's what I call Greek chutzpah. She told me that through all the adversities which she had faced in her life with finances, with my father who was unfaithful to her, and she had to make ends meet so many times to raise me and my sister, she always remembered that this was her life force that saved her life and all the people she was with. That energy that got the machine guns to go down because she told them so was her life force. And that life force was a reminder for her at all the other times in her life. It's a quality that I have tried to emulate in my own life by knowing and trusting and accessing my life force. I remember I was putting together a television series for PBS on the Greek goddesses, and I was actually writing the script, and I was the only person performing. I had raised part of the money; I had found the venue. Basically I was the executive producer as well as the actress, as well as the writer. And it would be presented in front of a live audience of about 200 people. I had to memorize all the scripts, and I remember being terrified and very anxious. The closer I got to it, the more I felt anxious about performing it in a live audience. It was bringing up such anxiety and fear inside of me. On the day of the performance, I had one of my best friends who teaches breathing come to give me a session. So she was working on my diaphragm and releasing the ribcage and the diaphragm and getting my breath to finally flow in a nice easy way. When we are afraid, what do you think we do? We shut off our breath, and we shut off the oxygen to our brain. So my friend was relaxing my chest and my ribcage, releasing the diaphragm, and I got very relaxed with my breath. My breath got longer and deeper and slower, and I started to come and be more present in my body. So she said to me this magical phrase, "Darling, let yourself be breathed." Wow, let myself be breathed. That was it. As I moved into that energy, I have to tell you I started to feel I was gliding. The fear disappeared; the anxiety disappeared, and I use this as a reference point, remembering that when I relax and I let myself be breathed, I am present in the Spirit. So I was performing in front of 200 people in the garden. It was up absolutely transcendent. It was seamless. I look at that video now, and I get this incredible higher level of energy that comes in through me that I was able to ride the current. So prayer in this case is an amazing way to let yourself be breathed. Because remember-we've talked about this before- we actually don't take our breath. Our breath is freely given to us. So if you stop trying to control it to do and allow yourself to be, you are going to be receptive. You're going to move into that energy. When you really think about it, it is so powerful to know that every moment we can return to the power of receiving our breath. So we are being breathed. And that's a very powerful because throughout our daily lives we always try to control things. And when we try to make things happen, we are not in a receptive mode. We are more pushing. So if we were in a receptive mode, we would be in a greater flow. So it's interesting how we allow fear in our lives to interfere with our flow because we really haven't learned to master it. We haven't really learned to release it to the light, the higher energy. Because all that fear really is is an energy that has a thought behind it and an emotion behind it. And then the body follows it. It interferes with our truth and the presence of who we are. And the truth is that we are bigger than our fear. My mother taught us and implanted in us that phrase. Whenever we were afraid, she would say, "You are bigger than your fear." What does that mean? How do we get bigger than our fear? First, we have to understand that fear is your educator. It's just just a tool. Our body's attempt to self-preservation, so we shouldn't let it control us; rather we need to learn from it. Secondly, we need to let ourselves be breathed, and we can do that through the power and the tool of prayer. So right now, take a pause; access your connection with Spirit; come into receptivity, and allow yourself to be breathed. Allow yourself to feel how powerful it is that your breath is given to you. So if you're experiencing fear in your life about anything, you can start evoking the Spirit of all the extraordinary people in the world who have broken barriers, overcome hardships, and access that place from within which you can see and act beyond the fear. You can think of well-known people, but you can also find people around you in your everyday life that move past the fear. In anything. In wanting a job, in your relationships, where you have to address someone, where you have to say something, or my God, in giving birth. I mean how scary that can be because you never know what's going to happen when you are in labor and you're giving birth. It all takes courage. It's an amazing process. So our prayer for today will help us move past our fear, get bigger than it, and see the fear dissipating. So let us come into our heart. Let us again evoke the light. And come into the presence of the Spirit and the beloved. Dear beloved, as I move forward in my journey, I ask to find the courage to move past my fear, knowing that the mighty Spirit that lives in me is so much bigger than my fear. Show me how to transform my fear into trust and my insecurity into confidence. Show me how to transform my scared voice into my sacred voice. Let me walk this path step by step, holding your invisible hand, hearing the inner guidance in me. Although I might not feel it fully or comprehend it, I'm willing to let my higher power take the lead. Show me where the opportunities are, and lead me to the support I need, so I can see my vision clearly and draw strength from it. I understand that the fear I'm experiencing is produced by the primitive part of my brain that is driven to survive. When I turn to prayer, to meditation, I become quiet and still, and in that space I feel the presence of love, compassion, joy because I remember that I don't have to give in to my fear. And as I say these words right now, I feel a release of what binds me and keeps me from moving ahead. I feel a wave of happiness in knowing that I don't have to live in wishful thinking, that I can live in my fearless action. I move from "I can't" to "I am." So as I move forward in taking the next steps, I see the sort of strength that clears my pathway as I move with determination, with trust, with positive energy which are always available to me. And as I speak these words, I release the illusion that I am walking alone, and I receive the support that shows me in practical, small little ways that I can expand beyond my fear. So my friends, today for your practice, I want you to do some deep introspection and ask yourself, "What am I really afraid of?" Write it down. Ask yourself as you move forward in your life, what actually stops you? What is the fear, and what is underneath it? Name it. Whatever it is, take authority over it, and I want you to find your role models, a friend, a colleague, anyone you admire or even teach you or even reach out to your Tribe. Be an investigative journalist. Be curious. Ask the question. Observe your fear. How do you deal with it? Take notes. Finally, if you are inspired, imagine if you were to write the manual of overcoming fear. We're giving you the assignment to teach the rest of us how to overcome fear. How would you teach your child to overcome fear? Spirit will be with you as you seek to transform your own circumstances and discover the courage to expand beyond your fear and create a fearless life. Wouldn't that be wonderful? And experience what it would really be like to walk this life as a fearless human being? When you become fearless, you expand into an invisible power of spiritual energy. Conjure it up. I'm so excited for you to see you become a fearless human being.

LESSON 10: Escape the Discouragement Trap
--------------------
Welcome back. So, I hope you've all had a chance to interview your fear and find out more about yourself, your psyche and learn whether fear interferes with your flow, or if fear is a good teacher for you. Today, I want to move on to something else that challenges all of us as human beings, and that's something that I call the discouragement trap. You know that one? It's an interesting word, isn't it? Discourage. The root of the word courage is the French, cœur, meaning heart. So, if we look at all of us, we all have courage embedded in us. We are all full of heart. Courage is inbuilt. When we embark on something, we have the courage, and then we get tested, and we feel like we are not going to make it. How many of you have gone after something you've wanted to create in your life, and midway you start to feel it wasn't quite going your way? You started to get this overwhelming feeling of being discouraged. The voice of discouragement starts to whisper in us. "Oh, this is not going to work out. It's never going to work out." If you feel it grabbing at you, and you start to feeling deflated, you start to feel a wave of doubt closing in on you causing you to shut off your heart, your creativity, your fun. Discouragement is the enemy of the human spirit. Because, my friends, it can actually paralyze you. I personally know discouragement intimately, and it has visited me on many occasions. I would start on a project, like writing a book, and not feel the creative flow or the inspiration. And instead of accepting that as a natural part of the creative process, I would get discouraged and be down on myself, and it would become very challenging to keep going. Or I would try to raise funding for a project, and everyone I would ask would say, "No, we can't help you." And of course, I would feel rejected and discouraged from continuing to keep asking people. If you want to avoid getting this feeling of being paralyzed by discouragement, it's very important to stay ahead of it, outsmart it. At that moment of defeat, the challenge is not to identify with that feeling of discouragement, but instead create distance; observe it. That's the time we can expand a sense of ourselves and learn that something bigger than you, than your discouragement, is driving your life. Like everything in life, you can use discouragement to build your resilience muscle, your creativity, and your innovation muscle. So many of my projects that I went after did not happen, but they led me to myself. When my acting career wasn't happening, I was continuously tested and discouraged. I remember I auditioned for a six hours of an adaptation of a Greek play in New York City. I'll never forget when the director called me afterwards and said-he had a very big Greek accent thicker than mine- and he said, "My dear girl, you are so brilliant, and you're such a talented actress, but I cannot use you." It was a Greek play of six hours! And I thought, if I can't even get a part in a Greek play, what am I going to do in acting career? I could not see my value beyond that. I was in a complete discouragement trap. After that news, I got on a bus in New York City to go to a singing lesson I had, and I met and started speaking to this woman sitting next to me who was a nurse but used to be an actress. So we started to talk about theater, and I told her I didn't get the part. She asked me, "What did you audition with?" I said, "Joan of Arc." She said, "Oh my God, I love that part. I love that role." And I said, "Would you like me to do my monologue for you?" So, I did my monologue for her just like that. A lot of Greek chutzpah in a New York City bus. The woman held my hand, looked at me, and said, "My dear girl, you are so talented." Which I knew, but I wasn't getting the parts. So she said, "Go do your own thing." Can you believe it? That advice from that woman that I didn't know broke my spell from my discouragement trap. People want to go out and achieve their dreams, but when they encounter discouragement, they stop. Only those who don't stop eventually discover something bigger in themselves and inevitably find their success. Look around you, the people who eventually win at the game of life are the people who have the ability to persevere and keep going, because they stay ahead of discouragement. Michael Jordan was cut from his high school basketball team, but then he went on to become one of the greatest basketball players in the history of the game. J. K. Rowling: first Harry Potter book was rejected by 12 different publishers. Even the publishing house that finally bought her manuscript told her to get a day job. Now, she's one of the most successful female writers on the planet. So, I would look at your discouragement as an ally, a chance to empower yourself by calling in the light which is far more powerful than your negative emotions. So, this is where prayer can come in, and through prayer you can tap into that mighty Spirit. My friends, if you try to fight discouragement with your ego, with your head, with your thoughts, "Oh, I shouldn't feel discouraged. I know better." If you are judging it, it's not going to work. You'll be ruminating, going on circles. But if you can summon up your power, look it in the face, and say, "You have no room here." Let the light come in, fill you up, anchor you. So when you hear that voice of discouragement and you start to collapse on yourself, you've got to know how to pray. Remember? If you're in the basement where discouragement is, get into that elevator. Acknowledge that, "Okay, you're being discouraged." But instead you are going to push the button and go up to the higher floors. Here's a little guided meditation and a prayer to help you give yourself some grace. So, come into your heart. Fill your heart with acceptance and love for yourself, with compassion. And look at your life, and see where is the area where you are blocked with discouragement. Just see it. Okay. As you are looking at it, start to create distance between you and that block of discouragement. Start to bring your breath, your light, your presence, and start to elevate. If there are judgments there about yourself, just tell yourself, "I forgive myself for judging myself, for feeling discouraged. I forgive myself for judging myself, for letting myself be sucked in into discouragement." And see it dissipating. And now affirm and say, "I have the courage. I have the confidence. I have the know-how to move on in my life. Persevering and letting the Spirit be my partner in moving forward to the next step in my life." And see what that is. And anchor your confidence like an energy, like a strong energy that comes in, fills your whole body, your emotions, your mind; you feel it in your feet. And start to move into your heart, your strength. Come into your peace. Come into your calmness. Feel the energy of enthusiasm which is the energy of God within you. Feel it coming up, supporting you, elevating you. And start to hear the voice of encouragement. "You can do this. You can go forward. You can make this happen. I'm right here with you. I'm right here with you." Feel that power, the force that's coming in right now. Bond with it. Embrace it. Embody it. Claim it. Beautiful. And partner with it. Feel it in your heart. Exhale. And come present again. And remember, you can come back to this place over and over again. You are in charge. You and your God is in charge. So, my friends, practice moving past your discouragement over and over again, and find a visual that your discouragement has, and do whatever it takes to come out of it. You can dance it; you can sing it; you can walk away from it, to get rid of the discouragement before it blocks you in. But most of all, remember that at that moment that it comes, you are in charge. You can call in the partnership with God. You can name it; you can tame it; you can let it go. Okay? I'll see you next time.

LESSON 11: Find Wisdom in Your Disappointment & Kick the Worry Habit
--------------------
Welcome back to our Quest. I hope you've all had some awakenings and some new awarenesses about how fear and discouragement can actually stop you from being fully alive and present in your life. Another thing in our lives that can block our awareness of our connection with our Spirit is disappointment. The clue in the word disappointment is when there is actually a missed appointment. When we look at the areas in our lives where we get disappointed, you'll find that most of the times, it's when we miss our own expectations of how things should be, right? So, we all set ourselves up, and we get disappointed, and then we have to deal with a downward spiral energy. And again, you have to catch it before we get really sucked down into the basement. So, imagine you're dating someone. And initially you could be saying to yourself, "Oh, I am sure he or she's the one." So then you get to know them, and you know this person is not the one, and you realize that you set yourself up. And then you feel this loss, this disappointment because you have moved ahead in your expectations. Or you hire someone to work for you that you think is the perfect team member. And after a few weeks, you realize that working with them that they really don't have it. So how can we protect ourselves from setting ourselves up for disappointment? We've already spoken about listening to all parts of ourselves and learning to access the Spirit within. If we start making it into a habit to listen to our inner wisdom or calling in the light, we will start to notice the signs and start listening to our intuition. So we need to use our wisdom to know that we are setting ourselves up and moving ahead in our lives without projecting the scenario of how we want things to be. Now, there's a difference between being a positive creator and being a fantasy creator where you set yourself up by imagining the most amazing scenarios despite all signs pointing to the opposite. Instead, we need to become positive creators where we put the intention to have a wonderful experience, but we also allow the space for it to be what it will be. As my spiritual teacher always used to say, "We'll see." Leaving room for it to be what it's going to be is very liberating; it's very wise; it's very freeing. Let me give you an example from my own life. I was invited to attend an event where my sister Arianna was being honored. I had invited someone to come with me as an escort that I had just met. I was very excited because I liked him. Well, three hours before the event, this gentleman called me up, was terribly apologetic, and said to me, "Agapi, I'm so sorry. There's horrible traffic from LA to Santa Barbara, and I won't be able to make it on time." I remember feeling absolutely devastated about going to this event by myself, and I very quickly started to think of other people I could invite at the last minute. So I called a dear friend of mine and asked him to come with me to escort me. But the disappointment was really stuck in there. Later, the next day, I was with my spiritual teacher and I mentioned to him the incident. He said to me, "You have disappointment running in your life's theme, and you have to change the track so that things can start working out for you. You have to find the beginning of that thread or when did it start. When did that pattern start?" Well, when I really looked back, I was very disappointed to witness the discord and the separation of my parents. They couldn't be happy together. My father was unfaithful to my mother, and he hurt her very deeply, and I couldn't do anything about it. I was very disappointed. And throughout my life, I kept attracting relationships that I would experience that disappointment again because in the beginning, I was very disappointed in what I thought was and is an ideal relationship. So, it was a real belief that relationships don't really work and men disappoint you. So I kept creating that over and over again. But it wasn't until that experience brought it home to me that I started to look back and work with my divine spiritual nature to release that from my psyche, to release this embedded experience that relationships were going to lead to disappointment. I had to do a lot of forgiveness. Forgiving myself for judging myself. Forgiving myself for judging my father for his incredible unfaithfulness and the way he behaved and treated my mother. Forgiving God and life for setting it up in a way that it was hurtful. And as I got more into peace about what was my desirable event and my desirable outcome, I started to set my compass towards things that worked in my life. Now, it took me some time because, my friends, patterns like that are so embedded in us, and they keep coming back till we clear them. But every time it came, it would be like recognizing an old friend and saying, "Oh, yes I know that part. I'm setting it up again." So I started to outsmart it. I would literally yank myself and say to myself before my experience, "Agapi, keep your eyes open. Keep your eyes open here that you can create this in a very successful way rather than creating disappointment." So before I embarked into something, as you remember, I shared with you the story about the goddesses, how I was rehearsing negatively in my head. In the same way, I would say, "Rehearse it positively." That's not wishful thinking, and that's not fantasy. That's being a creator of summoning up your energy, your power, to not collapse on yourself, to not set yourself up for disappointment. So, you have to be very aware. Start to bring your light, your awareness, your consciousness, to everything in your life that you're doing. If you have a pattern like this disappointment like I did, you have to really become masterful at recognizing the signs. Let's say you are about to go for an interview for a new job, and you might have such a expectation, and you say, "Oh, this is it. I want this job so much. It's the perfect job for me. I'm going to get this job." And you don't get the job. You've just, again, set yourself up instead of saying, "This is a really good job, and I would like that if it is for my highest good." Because in a way, there might be even something better, something that is even more appropriate and beneficial for you. I have found that the best key for letting go of disappointment is the courage to look at it straight in the face and take ownership and responsibility. Do you have this pattern where you project what you want to see in other people? I certainly did. In my experience with my flaky date, I learned that I'm too quick to project what I want to see with other people. It's a certain lack of discernment and wisdom. Instead of stepping back, seeing people and situations as they are, we tend to live in wishful thinking. We put people on pedestals, and we project qualities into people, especially in romantic relationships, my friends. We can project the prince into the frog, and they might never turn into a prince. I wish this man to be so and so; therefore, I will project the qualities into him that would make him so and so. But if we look at our disappointment from a higher perspective, they can become opportunities to learn how to make choices that can work for us. Aside from disappointment, another way in which we create patterns that don't serve us is by worrying. And worrying block us from the light, from that connection to Spirit. We Greeks have a terrible habit. We worry a lot. As a matter of fact, we're so connected to worry that we actually have worry beads. We worry just a habit. We worry about everything. We worry that we're going to run out of money, running out of time, that our plans aren't going to be successful, we're going to miss our plane. Worry robs you of your joy because you can never be present with what is. You can never positively create because worry is like a rumination. It's a hamster wheel going over and over and over again. When my mother saw us worrying, she would say, "Darling, change the channel. You have the remote in your hand." But it's easier said than done. So, fortunately, there is a practice I want to share with you that I love that helps me deal with worry. So, if you are one of those people that have a worry habit, here's what to do. Every three days, or every day if you have a big worry habit, take 10 minutes in your day, take a piece of paper and a pen, and write down everything that you're worried about. Then look at it, and see what needs to be addressed. You can then identify what is a legitimate worry and what is not. For example, if you're worried about an event you're going to host that would not be well attended because you haven't sent out invitations and it's two weeks out, then that's a legitimate worry, and you know what you have to do. If you're worried about missing a flight, that's also a legitimate worry. So you can plan to leave three hours earlier so you're not caught in traffic. So address your worry. And if you address it, do what you have to do. But if it is a rumination and a bad habit about something that you can do nothing about or it's useless, let it go. And instead, start to program things going in the direction you want them to go. Move them from that lower energy of worry by, again, calling in your Spirit, calling in the light, and move into an intentional positive direction. Bring in more light. I hope you are catching the Spirit. So here's how it works. I give myself the mental direction to be steadier, to take mental dominion of that lower energy. I ask to bring in more light. I never tell myself to stop worrying. Instead, I give myself a substitute for the worry and evoke a different space of calmness. It's really about moving from the sympathetic to the parasympathetic nervous system. The sympathetic nervous system puts us into a fight-or-flight mode and prepares our systems for defense, whereas the parasympathetic nervous system relaxes our body and invites more breath, more spaciousness. Another component to this that is very overlooked is that we are all susceptible to each other's energies. So, you could be feeling really great, and then you go somewhere, and you're sitting next to someone, having a meeting with somebody that you are with, and then you're sitting next to somebody, or you might be with your significant other or your kid, and they're anxious about something, or they're worried about something, and then you start to feel anxious because we are all so superconnected. I'm sure you've all experienced that. So I would really encourage you to learn to discern what is yours and what is theirs. Am I anxious because of something in my life, or am I anxious for what they are going through? So, let us come into a prayer where we can become more attuned again to a deeper calmness. Dear beloved, let me attune myself to the deeper calmness and peace, to the higher vibration that is present in the universe, the cosmos, and everything that moves. I ask to know that beyond the storms, the hurricanes, the turbulence of the sea, there is a stillness and a calmness that is always present. Show me that so much of my anxiety and worry comes from my personal and the humanness of this physical world. May I please know that I am rooted in the Spirit and experience its presence. I see my roots being grounded on this earth and connecting to the heavens so that there is convergence between my earthly self and my divine self. Although I may not know it or I feel it, I claim it, and I'll allow it to be present and transform any conditions that I have placed between my soul and my worldly self, and I have caused worry and anxiety to myself. I feel an invisible presence of steadiness, walking with me every step of the way, and I start to feel the energy of peace so deeply. I hear the voice of wisdom inside of me, whispering words of safety, trust, and direction, and I allow myself to attune my being to this frequency of calmness. Anytime I bring worry upon myself, I remember that it's a product of the false self, and my true self only knows peace, calm, and serenity. In serenity, there are solutions. Motivation, creativity, joy, and possibilities. I do not give over to this worry. I do not give over to the anxiety and restlessness. I return to the invisible force inside of me that is enveloping me, embracing me, and cheering me on right now. So be it. So, my friends, here's your practice for today. To kick the worry habit you may have and release your disappointments, take 10 minutes every day, every other day, just start to make a habit; take a piece of paper and a pen, and write down everything that you are worried about. Then look at it, see what needs to be addressed, then identify what is legitimate worry and what is not. Regardless of whether you start acting upon it or not, it's important to name it. Then you take authority over it. And then think of a situation that disappointed you in your life. Try to explore where is it rooted and go into forgiveness of where the pattern originated. Know that you are not that pattern. That pattern is not you, and you can clear it. Then remember, clear, cut, disconnect any negative energies into the light. Always remember, be gentle with yourself; be compassionate in your process; be loving to yourself because you are very, very lovable. And I'll see you next time.

====================

LESSON 11: Hu-Mantra Shifting Practice

- You can make the shift with your breath, with calming music, or by intoning a mantra like Hu, H-U, which means God in Sanskrit. So let's just do a few Hus together. Take the breath; fill your lungs. Fill your brain. Fill your heart with oxygen. And let's just say, Hu. Exhale all the way. Let the breath come in; receive the breath. And again, let's do it all together, Hu. Exhale all the way. Receive the breath. And one more time, Hu. The sound of your voice, my friends, has healing energy. It's very important that you learn to use mantras loud; speak them, and intone them. Your diaphragm releases; you breathe more oxygen into your body. So as you practice that steadying, that slowing, and deepening your breath with the sound, you are entering into a space that is calmer, elevated, and connected.

====================

LESSON 11: Clear-Cut-Disconnect Technique

- I want to show you a very simple technique that you can use. So let's say you have picked up somebody's energy that you don't really want, obviously, because it's not yours, and it's more of a negative energy. So take your middle finger; you run it up and down your third eye, your nose to your third eye. That's where your third eye is. You take the palm of your hand; you put it on your forehead, and you say, "Clear, cut, disconnect any energies that I connected of this person." You say the person's name and "Clear these energies, and I let them go into the light." And you wait, and you feel the light coming in, releasing the energy. You exhale, and you go, "And I go free." And you can do this as many times as you want. Take your time. And you literally see a light that comes in, running through your chakras, your third eye, and it releases the anxiety that you might have picked up from someone else.

Part 5: Loving

====================

LESSON 12: Find Your Tribe
--------------------
Hi, everyone. So we are moving forward with our Quest on Part Five, Loving. Isn't that the most wonderful quality we can all embody? Let's call in the light for a minute. We ask for the light of the Spirit that lives in all of us to be fully present. We ask to come into our heart, evoke a greater loving, a greater openness of our heart, to fill our hearts with gratitude, with love, compassion, and anything that we do not need in our consciousness, we ask that it be lifted from us, and return into a centered, loving space inside of us. Thank you. So I hope you've all been practicing your tools to help you get out of your worry, and you have really looked at your patterns of disappointment. Wouldn't you agree with me that a part of our fulfillment of life in this world lies in our connection with community? Connecting and finding people that you can build rapport with, people you love and who love you, but also people with whom you share mutual interests. For me, the wonderful thing about the Mindvalley community is that there is a plethora of like-minded people. There are events going on all the time, online and in person, and if you are a seeker who is passionate about your growth, this is an amazing community to be in and to make wonderful friends. So I want to address this issue of where you might be feeling separate or isolated, not understood, not seen, and might have a pattern of creating a sense of isolation and loneliness in your life. Very often, we don't know how to share ourselves authentically, and we are afraid to really show who we are because we don't know if we're going to be accepted. Sharing yourself authentically is the greatest way to finding who your people are. The more we open up to ourselves, the more committed we become to knowing who we truly are, what makes us happy, and what makes us feel alive and joyful. As you get to know yourself better, you'll get better at finding other people who you can authentically connect with. Just know, no matter where you are, and no matter how you're feeling, the greatest key to finding your people is knowing how much you can add value to people's lives. You need to affirm your value and risk being open. If you're closed off, always expecting other people to first reach out to you, it's going to be very hard to find your people. Personally for me, it was when I got closer to myself, closer to my creative expression and a sense of confidence of who I was, that I was able to go out without always thinking and second-guessing myself. But it took me a while to get to that place. Because for a while, I was always expecting to be given permission by the world to make an entrance. This all changed once I realized that in order to reach out to people and make authentic connections, I had to first create an inner environment of connection which then extended to an outer environment of connection, and then I anchored that. A lot of time, people walk around feeling like they're second-class citizens, and we second-guess ourselves. So be very mindful in how you are not affirming yourself in who you are and your value in the world. And as you further affirm that, regardless of what you do but in terms of who you are, really ask your Spirit to help you continually open up to the field of seeing because we often don't see the opportunities. We don't even see the people that are there. So let's answer this question. How do you find your people? Here is what I like to call, "Agapi's Five Steps to Finding Your People." Be generous. Give of yourself when you meet people; ask them about themselves; share genuinely with them about your life, and be generous with your time. For me, one of the things I love is sharing this warm feeling I have for other people. I love feeling my warmth towards other people because I think the human heart thrives in warmth. So don't be stingy with your heart. Share your heart. It's amazing, the wealth that I found in connections when I started to share my heart authentically. Number two, be discerning. Watch and listen to your inner guidance. When you meet new people, watch for the red flags. Listen to your intuition. Is this the person for me? Are they who they say they are? There is this wonderful quality that we all have in our spiritual essence of really seeing and really knowing. If you allow yourself to see and be real transparent, you will always know. The third step is be open. The more we open up to ourselves, the more committed we become to knowing who we truly are. What makes you happy, and what makes you feel alive and joyful? As you get to know yourself, you get to finding other people who you can authentically connect with. The fourth step, put up your friendship antenna, so you will attract the people who are right for you. Every time I go to an event, I always ask, "Spirit, help me find the people that I'm supposed to connect with, people that I have something to offer to, and they have something to offer to me." Because you go to an event, let's say, of 300 people, and maybe there are three people you're supposed to connect with. These are your people, and they're there. So before you go out into any kind of gathering, set your intention. You can set that intention even on the plane and say, "God, help me connect with someone that is part of my tribe." You may be sitting even next to them. The fifth step is trust that you can and deserve to have amazing friendships. With connections with people that care for you, and you care for them. See your value as you see the value in others. And always remember that the most fulfilling relationship is the one you can cultivate, develop, and nurture with your own self. Let's come into our heart. Let's come into our presence. Dear beloved, I ask that I may become more aware of my Spirit's aliveness within me. My human part feels separate, disconnected from the people I meet, and I long for the connection of friendship. I want to find my tribe, the people I resonate with, so I can experience sharing the joys of life with them in an authentic and open way with no pretense but a light heart. I ask that I may open myself to receiving these people into my life and that I may be shown how to find them. I ask that the sweetness and tenderness that I crave in real companionship find me. Let me open the door to any new possibilities. I now see that happening in all parts of my life. At work, at the coffee shop, in a class, at the gym, at an event where I don't know many people. I see myself creating deep friendships, intimate relationships, and I allow myself to share more of who I am as I meet people, good people that come through from grace. I see this as a positive way to experience my fullness and aliveness. I see this happening in the perfect way and in the perfect time. I let go of any old beliefs and limitations that keep me separate from others. Guide me to the ways that I can be my own best friend. Guide me to know that I can enjoy my own company, know more of who I am, and deepen my connection with myself. May I know that you're always with me, loving me, and that the spiritual beings that work with me in the invisible world are assisting me in every part of my life. As I create a warm sense of home inside of me, I see that reflected in my physical world. I receive the magic of that feeling of belonging within myself and then meet my people who I can enjoy sharing my life with. So be it. So your practice, my friends, for this lesson is to make your intention very clear. You don't have to work at it. Just ask and open and start to attract your people. I can't wait until you share with us your experience of how magical this can be. Start exercising your friendship antenna, and Spirit will help you to find the people you would love to connect with. You can start in the Mindvalley Tribe right now. Reach out; be generous; be open, and trust that Spirit will guide you to have the amazing friendships and connections that you absolutely deserve. I love you. I am sending you so much light and seeing you blossoming with incredible friendships. I'm excited for you.

LESSON 13: Love Yourself the Way You Want to Be Loved
--------------------
Welcome back to our Quest. There was a time in my life that I was really looking for a partner. I had this deep longing, and to tell you the truth, I really didn't know how to make it happen. The whole area in that part of my life was very murky. Now, at the time, I was taking a course in spiritual psychology at the University of Santa Monica, and there was a deep process which we did about learning to connect with our inner child. I saw how a part of me had really been exiled and abandoned and very wounded since my parents' separation and had become a part of me that I never really healed. And so I was always looking for that intimacy with a man, and that intimacy would come and go because that's the nature of relationships. And when it was there, I would get extremely attached to it because I didn't really have that inner bonding with myself. So I started to do my inner work and bring more healing and loving and embracing that part of myself. I always had this dream that I'm going to meet a man, fall in love, and he is going to ask me to marry him and give me a ring. And there was a ring that I really, really loved. And one day I decided that I was going to buy this ring for myself and marry myself. I bought it. I took a friend of mine to the theater to watch Swan Lake, which is one of my favorite ballets. And during the intermission I said, "We are going to do a little ceremony." It was magical; it was a magical moment as we said a blessing, and I took that ring, and I wore it while committing to myself. This is the ring, my friends, actually. It's a pearl and three diamonds. What was remarkable is that I never then after that went out into the world without wearing this symbol of myself to bonding with myself. And I would say to myself, "I got you, baby; I got you." I don't have to wait for someone to propose to me. I don't have to wait for someone to want to be intimate with me. If that happens, hallelujah. But it's me with me. I have to tell you that that became part of my foundation. That inner bonding, that knowing how to love Agapi and all parts of me, that it was not just lip service; it was really dialoguing with that part of me, communicating, asking that part of myself over and over again, "How are you feeling now? How do you feel about this?" "I'm good. How are you?" And I listened, and it opened that inner family. It opened a conversation and a deeper relationship with myself. And we all have these expectations about how people should love us. We want people to love us the way we want to be loved. But often people love us the way they know how to love us. We cannot give people a script of what we want them to do or say. We can't say, well, this is how I want you to respond. This is how I want you to reach out. This is how I like to be interacted with. So if we have a close open relationship with someone, we can explain to them how we would like to be treated. But by no means can we put the burden on someone else to meet our expectations. So it's important to express how you would like to be loved but to also make room for and be accepting of how other people are going to love you. Part of it is really seeing that love is expressed in many different forms. Every human being is really doing the best they can with what they know. And if we really look beyond that, if people are having a hard time expressing love, it is also because they really have a hard time expressing love for themselves. Maybe they have barricaded themselves, and that should make you so compassionate about other people's expressions. So instead of judging them, you learn to become compassionate, understanding, and accepting and see where you can do adjustments. It's basically the loving between you, your heart, your Spirit; the loving between you, your soul; and loving between you, your inner child, and all parts of your inner family. It's learning to open your heart to your love and letting it fill all parts of yourself. Your spiritual nature is loving, period. Your human nature wants the things the way your human nature wants them. But if you make the shift to your spiritual nature, you will find unconditional love the way it is. Then you are not forcing human demands into that love. You basically accept the love where you find it. We all long to be seen and loved as we are. And when people don't read us and when people don't react to us the way we would like them to, we can start to feel we don't matter and are feeling discounted. So we first need to bring our spiritual nature up front and fully learn what is it to love ourselves as we are and connect with our true nature. If somebody doesn't appreciate you, you should ask, are you appreciating yourself? We have the power to take full responsibility for our own care. In intimate relationships, it's important to express how you would like to be treated, to be loved, to be communicated with. We can educate people and guide them to the way we want to be treated, but this requires us to be vulnerable with those people with whom we have intimate relationships. However, you can't have the same openness with coworkers, with clients, with acquaintances, or social friends. You can only open this line of communication with those people who you value and who are very close to you. This prayer we're going to do is going to help you reverse the paradigm and fill yourself to capacity. When others don't love you or act the way you would like them to, you are okay with it. So let us come into our heart. Fill our heart with the Spirit and the light. Dear beloved, I ask for the Spirit to fill me, protect me, and surround me. I ask that I may open my heart to the fullness of myself, to be more receptive, to hear my inner guidance. I bring now into the light my areas in my life that I have abandoned, neglected, or ignored. I now ask that any parts of me that feel disconnected, unloved, separated from myself, be bridged by delighting in my own being and my own self. In those areas in which I feel lacking, insecure, unfulfilled, I ask to not look to others to fulfill them but instead open up a dialogue with myself to know what the deeper parts of me need and how I can meet those needs. When I reach out to others to ask for what I want or need, I ask to do it from a place of freedom, honoring myself by knowing that I have the right to ask for what I want. I ask to be okay when others don't give me what I need. I look with the eyes of love and understanding, knowing that others too have their own process, and how they are or are not with me has nothing to do with me but is more about their own process and themselves. I now release into the light my expectations of how others should be with me, and I go free. I fill myself with the joy of my being and the deepest acceptance of my relationship with others just how they are. I am grateful for who I am and for my willingness to bring the Spirit into my everyday life. So be it. So, my friends, for your practice today, I want you to make a commitment to yourself. Create real intimacy with yourself. Make this commitment before Spirit, before God. Truly mean it. Create a ritual, a sacrament. You could write down or design something for yourself. Buy something for yourself you really want. Have a special celebration. Buy yourself something special, and make a vow with yourself. Get a witness if you need it. It can be anything, not necessarily a ring, but make that commitment of love to yourself. The unconscious loves symbols. So go there, and bond with that part of yourself. And as a final thought, I want to remind you that when we don't get from others the reactions we want to, it causes friction or unhappiness. And what we are really saying is this: when you learn to bring more of your spiritual nature and your own loving in your present, then you are free. Others are going to do what they're going to do. Sometimes people are going to behave like you want them, wonderful, but many times they don't. And if you have a demand on how others should be for you to feel good about yourself, it's mostly going to lead to disappointment. It's extremely important that you learn to love yourself the way you want to be loved. The foundation of this lesson is your freedom. And if you don't always depend on other people's reactions or expressions towards you, you are always going to be dependent. And you want a sense of freedom and well-being regardless. So start by making your spiritual nature upfront. Loving yourself requires vulnerability. What is amazing is that as you become more loving and connected to yourself, other people can actually shift and become more loving towards you. So practice that. Be gentle; be tender with yourself. Open up your kindness door, your creativity, and your compassion to yourself. And I look forward to seeing you at our next lesson. Have a beautiful loving time, you with you, and see what the universe brings to you as an added bonus.

LESSON 14: Navigate Through Loss
--------------------
Welcome back everybody. So today we are going to talk about something we all deal with: loss and grief. But before we start to talk about that, let's just always evoke the light. So take a long deep breath. You can actually connect with your heart and your belly. In your belly is where the solar plexus is, where all the emotional upheaval of our lives resides. So let us call in the light and ask that the light fill us, surround us, protect us, uplift us. Just feel the light coming in and settle. Settle inside your heart, and as we exhale, let go of anything you do not need to hold onto. As you exhale, let go of the tension. As you inhale, bring more loving, more expansion, and more peace to yourself. So I have found that loss basically awakens us to a deeper part of ourselves and awakens us to a more of our Spirit. Loss leads you to unknown new territories about yourself. Teaches us that there is nothing permanent. It's hard to go through the change, but if you look back in your life, every change you experienced, it could be a loss of a relationship or a loss of a job; it could be a loss of something that you really loved that went away. And if you look back, you'll see that it did lead you to unknown new territories about yourself. You see, our identity is wrapped up around what we have, what our relationships are, our sense of security, and any loss shakes that identity. And the shaking of our identity is not a negative thing. Yes, it can be very painful, very difficult, but it's actually teaching us how to identify with who we truly are, with a Spirit, with a soul, with a spiritual consciousness. Any identification with what we do, what we have, our bodies, our circumstances, our homes, is very legitimate that we, as human beings, we identify and we cling to those things. I had a friend of mine who lost her house in Hurricane Katrina. She had also lost a lot of friends. Then three years later, her husband died of cancer. And at some point, she was also diagnosed with cancer and left her job. I mean, she really went through the dark night of the soul. It was very hard for her to find her happiness and her balance again in her life. So she decided to create a company called Life's About Change which provides a platform of support, encouragement, and optimism to people who are going through change. She created this platform to celebrate change in a way that was transformative because she dismantled so much in her life that she was able to still find and have her joy. So we are all not strangers to loss. Within that loss, I promise you, there is growth. Growth unfortunately, is often thrown upon us through loss. It's great if we grow from seminars of Mindvalley Quests or reading books or relationships or having all the positive growth; that's fantastic. But often we judge the other kind of growth, the growth through loss, we judge it as negative. I know for me, I suffered grief when my parents died three and a half months apart. I was very, very attached to my parents, and I felt for about a year like I was walking around with no arms. I felt like I had had surgery. It was very painful. I was grief-stricken. I felt it on a cellular level. I had so much grief that I completely lost my joy. And it was only after a year that I felt I started to get my wings back. My love for my parents and their love for me was such a big part of my identity that I had over-identified with what I had lost. I had lost that physical affection and connection to my parents. There are many instances where I faced loss. I had many projects that I attempted to do, and I remember spending tremendous amounts of energy raising money, trying to make them happen, only for there to be no green light. I was very attached to making them happen, and it's extraordinary, when I look back now in hindsight, I can see how attached I was to them succeeding. I realized that it was the attachment that was causing me stress and pressure and causing me to lose my joy. "If this happens, I will be happy," I would say. "If I get a green light on this project, I will be so happy. If I don't get it, I'm going to be miserable." Of course, when we love someone, the hardest thing is losing them because it's so final, and it shakes us to our core. So don't underestimate how hard it is to go through loss, but what I want to show you and teach you is to become aware that as hard as it is-it's like carving a cement wall for the light to come in-it's hard. But as you keep carving and carving and chipping away and doing everything you can, and the wall will break, and you'll suddenly see a new vista. You'll see that attachment was creating a lack of awareness of your true Spirit. So my friends, every loss that we experience in our lives and that we go through can potentially lead to a deeper spiritual awakening. Here is where I want to talk about expansion. You see, when your identity is tied to something or someone that is now causing you grief when you lose them, rather than trying to suppress it and cover it and smother it, we need to expand and allow the Spirit to fill us and to help us grow. We need to find the space inside ourselves where we actually expand, where we actually embrace this loss. We need to really open up so that your Spirit can come and shower you with comfort, love, tenderness, and embrace you. Grief is like a soil that is untilled, and if you allow it to, Spirit can come in and plant new seeds, and then those new seeds will start to sprout, and they become the fruits of your life if you let it. But if you are attached to your grief and if your judgment that this should've never happened to you, then you will not expand to make new room for the new to come in. I want to lead you through a short guided meditation to release any sense of grief or loss that you might be carrying. And if you have any lack of peace about experiencing a loss, just take a deep breath right now and exhale with the sound, ahhhh, and take another deep, long breath, and exhale with the sound and hear yourself exhaling, ahhhh. Now allow the light to come in through your breath; breathe in the light, and exhale the love. Exhale any fear, any constriction in your heart. And with every breath, just move deeper into your heart. Allow the light to come in and to release any pain that you might be feeling. Any deep grief, any feelings of how bad this is and how awful this is and how despairing you might be feeling. And just bring it all to the surface; there's nothing wrong with it. If you feel like crying, let the tears come out. The tears are healing. The tears can bathe you and help you clear the grief. Let the light come in deeply into your heart. Let the breath come into your heart, and allow this light to start transmuting those feelings, not fix them, but transmuting them, and in their place bring loving; bring more acceptance; bring more relaxation; bring more space. And now gently see your heart opening up; it might feel very vulnerable in there as if there is an angel of comfort and compassion, an angel of sweetness, an angel of grace. And let this presence that is so large, so much bigger than your grief, bigger than your fear, let this presence come in and love you and hold you, so you have love all around you. And take a deep breath again, and keep exhaling, and now wherever you are, allow yourself to go into this deep acceptance and presence and see if that ease whatever loss you have left. Just ease whatever loss you are feeling; anything that you have felt bereft about, just experience it, and start to see it dissipate. When you're ready, open your eyes, and keep connecting to your breath, and let's seal this with a blessing and a prayer. And every day, you'll come into greater peace and acceptance and sweetness, more love in yourself, in whatever Spirit has in store for you, in the Spirit, travel, and you might be able to release the patterns of what you've been holding back, the tears, the sadness, the anger or the resentment or feel or fear, feeling sorry for yourself. Whatever it is, just allow it to release, and come more into your connection with your spiritual essence. So let us come into a prayer. Dear beloved, I open my heart to you so I can find comfort in the pain of what I have lost. I ask that you may touch where all my tears, my sadness, and my pain sit. I feel at a loss as to how to ask for what I need for I don't know what that is. So I ask for whatever relief, insight, awareness can be given to help me get through this loss, this sadness, and grief with grace. Help me reach out to others that love me, and allow their love to also heal me. Allow me to know that your love for me is there right now. For the part of me that is hurting, I ask to give myself permission to release the pain and let my tears flow to their fullest. In all this, I ask for your grace; I ask for patience, tenderness with myself. And in this process, I ask to let go as much as I can. I trust that this prayer is heard. In silence, I lift my heart to be at peace and comforted by you. So be it. So my friends, here's how you can find the space inside of you. First, it's very important to acknowledge that there is nothing to fix. It is our instinct; we always try to fix it. Instead, go into the deep acceptance; go into the surrender; go into the partnership with your Spirit, and this will lead us to a deeper part of ourselves beyond what we have identified with. Then remember; be gentle with yourself. Meet yourself with compassion, and look at it as a way to open up your heart to yourself. Then next, go from the physical light reality, and expand to go into the spiritual reality. And the way to go there is to look through the eyes of love. Call in the Spirit for yourself, to help you expand your perception. Ask yourself, "How would a masterful being look at the situation?" That is a wonderful question to bring more answers and solutions to yourself. And finally, don't count down to the finish line. No matter what you're going through, the light is really with you in the tunnel where you are because you are the light. And if you say, "Oh, we'll go through that and then find the light." No, the light is with you right now in whatever you're going through. So that's the thing to remember. It's not, "I'm going to go through this, and then I'll see the light and I'll feel better." Whatever you're going through now, you are in the light; you're not alone going through it. And that awareness will start to expand you into the awareness that you are the light. You are the spiritual consciousness. Pema Chodron, the wonderful teacher, has a beautiful saying; "You are the sky. Everything else is just the weather." Don't go into it with an anticipation that there is a finish line, and you're racing towards, and all your grief will immediately disappear once you cross it. There is no light at the end of the tunnel; you are the light. What happens then will be an immersion into your presence. You expand; you let go. Ahhhh, and you exhale. So your practice for today will be to look at your life and write in your workbook or your journal; ask yourself, "What loss have I suffered, and where is the area where I can bring more love to myself?" And if there is anyone around you who is suffering loss, maybe the way to expand is to extend your love and your heart to them and see how that process will start to make you feel more grounded, more peaceful, more connected and more accepting. And I will see you next time. God bless you.

And with every breath, just move deeper into your heart. Allow the light to come in and to release any pain that you might be feeling, any deep grief, any feelings of how bad this is, and how awful this is, and how despairing you might be feeling. And just bring it all to the surface. There's nothing wrong with it. If you feel like crying, let the tears come out. The tears are healing. The tears can bathe you and help you clear the grief.

Part 6: Transforming

====================

LESSON 15: Unlock the Gift of Forgiveness
--------------------
Welcome back. So now we are at Part Six of our Quest, towards the end, called Transforming. And as we are approaching the end, and we're going to be putting the icing on the cake of your connection with yourself and your Spirit, we have just a few more lessons to complete our process. So first of all, I want to congratulate all of you for staying the course, for taking the steps, for your commitment to yourself, and realizing that you matter more than anything else. You matter, and that you've got to give yourself permission to really, really love yourself. And I want to let you know that there is never, never, never a good enough reason to withhold love from yourself. The biggest fear we all have is the fear that we are not loved, that we don't matter, so we keep going, doing things to make us feel loved and feel that we matter. And that fear is deeply rooted in our psyche; it is with us every day. We seek to find people around us that love us and remind us that we are loved and that we do matter. But often the human love we feel is conditional. It has its ups and downs, and so it's very important that we find that love inside of us, and we learn to anchor it every day. And we dig deeper, going into a place where we can really be led to know what it is to forgive ourselves for the separation that we have felt from our heart, our Spirit, and the whole of creation. You see, love is always there because we're actually made out of love. We matter to our creator; we matter to the one who made us because we are part of that consciousness of creation. Look, of course our parents did something too, but who took the sperm and the egg and created you? It's extraordinary; you are a living miracle of life. So often we miss that incredible opportunity in our lives to know that if we open our hearts to receive the love that is already there and release the blocks and go beyond our personality and our ego, and go to the part of us that, yes, it's vulnerable and open, but it is connected to loving. We all know that no matter what we go through, no matter what we are in our lives, no matter what we have, what we don't have, we are loved. Forgiveness can be this incredible, powerful tool to release the negative energy and the judgments and the guilt that we feel. So today, we will put the spotlight on forgiveness, to know that to release the judgments that we hold against ourselves and other people and the conditions in our lives. I want to share with you a really profound story about my parents. My father had come to visit us in Los Angeles and to see some doctors because he had been diagnosed with macular degeneration which is a disease caused by diabetes. So he had practically lost his eyesight. As you might remember from my life story, my father, throughout his life had been unfaithful to my mother, but he had also done a lot of things that had hurt her very deeply. So after being with us for a few months, with my mother and my sister and my nieces, he was ready to return to Greece. On his final day, his bags were packed; the car waited in the driveway to take him to the airport. He hugged each one of us and said his goodbyes. Just before he got in the car, he turned and reached for my mother's hands. He looked at her for what he knew would be the last time he saw her. He held her hand and began to weep. He said to her... which translates to "Forgive me, Alimu; forgive me." I have to tell you, it was one of the most powerful moments in my life, to witness my frail father feel the pain he had caused my mother and ask her for forgiveness. My mother stood silent, allowing him the gift of asking her for her forgiveness. It was clear to me she was moved to the core of her being. I felt as if the pain, the separation of the years was melting away, and the love between them was returning. It was such a sacred moment to witness. What a gift my father was giving to both of them. Asking for forgiveness not just from my mother but from himself as well so he would not carry that pain into his death. My sister and I just stood in awe of what we were witnessing. The tenderness was so palpable that I felt as if the stone of the house was melting from the tenderness. We kissed our father again. I promised him that I would visit him in Greece, and we watched him drive away. As we walked my mother back into the house, I looked at her, and she seemed radiant, peaceful, as if the hand of love had touched her face. I realized at that moment, the powerful gift of forgiveness could be not just for the forgiven but the forgiver as well. Love releases our bodies from the harsh and tight restrictions we place upon ourselves and our heart. You see, when we judge ourselves for our actions, forgiveness releases within us the love we have been keeping and withholding from others and ourselves. It releases us from the prison of our hearts. If we want to feel more love in our lives, forgiveness is the surest way. To me, this was a big thing; it was a whole life of pain that was released in that moment. But forgiveness applies to all sorts of little things that happen throughout the day: when you lose your temper, when you mess up in a conversation, when you are running late for getting an appointment, being left out of a meeting, having a disagreement with a friend; countless situations arise every day for which we have to forgive both others and ourselves. So learn; learn to practice forgiveness; practice it daily. Forgive yourself for what you do, for what you don't do, for things that happen that you don't like, for things that you want that haven't happened yet, for how people are, how people are not with you; forgive yourself for any little judgment you make of others and of yourself. And then extend this grace and this graciousness to the people in your life, to everyone you meet. Do this over and over again because the loving Spirit is constantly nurturing and devoted to us. So here's the thing: Spirit is neutral. Spirit judges nothing. Spirit is a loving energy that's forever present. So all you have to do when you move into forgiveness is to move into that place of clear energy, absolutely crystalclear energy, which is your Spirit that lives inside of you. The negative part of us is going to try to contract and tell us differently, and this is where we have to reply with forgiveness. Because forgiveness is coming in and saying, "I forgive myself for this contraction that I feel, this separation with myself." "I forgive myself for judging myself for this separation I feel with this other person." "I forgive myself for this judgment that I have placed and I expand to my Spirit." A friend of mine who was diagnosed with cancer said to me the other day that she judged herself very harshly that she brought cancer to herself. And it wasn't until she really forgave herself for her suffering and brought that to herself that she was able to open her heart to herself, have compassion, that actually started to help her healing. And acknowledging that immediately expands you to your Spirit because your Spirit is indeed right here with you, not judging anything. So your human part embraces that and starts to release the judgment. That's what forgiveness is, is your willingness to go to the other place of love and be nonjudgmental. It's the golden key, my friends, to a life of freedom, fulfillment, and really happiness. Practice it; build the muscle of forgiveness. You would love it. So our prayer for today: dear beloved, I want to move forward. The past events that disturbed me are still in my thoughts and sitting in my belly, circulating in my consciousness. I want to let go of what happened with this person, but I can't seem to move forward. It's like a rope pulling me into the deep water, but I want to be in the shore, clear and free. So I now come into my heart, and I ask that I may move into the presence and bring the present to the parts of me that hurt and are ruminating in the old. I ask that I bring forgiveness to judgments of the person and judgments of myself, for my inability to control this person or the situation. I ask that I forgive myself for being triggered and have compassion for myself as I let go, and I accept that this person is who they are, and I cannot change them in any way. I do not make myself wrong or make the other person wrong. Let me find the neutral balance and extend a ray of loving to myself and to them. The ray of loving I know in my heart, the ray of peace, the ray of the uplifting Spirit that exists to make all things fall into place. I let my ego be set aside. If there's any other wisdom that may be added here, I allow it; I'll allow it to enter into my heart so that I may hear the subtle guidance, instead of the noise of my hurt, my opinions, my thoughts, and my personal limitations. So now I breathe in; I exhale; I expand, and I give myself permission to be free, to let go of the resonance of the disagreement. I extend kindness to myself. I give myself grace. I wipe the slate clean. I forgive and I forget. So be it. Your forgiveness practice, my friends, for this week is something you should keep with you every day of your life, for the big and small things. So every night, for example, before you go to sleep, put your hands on your heart, and look at the things that happened in your day that you might have judged. It could be small little things you have judged about yourself, things you have judged in the news, the world crisis; you could be judging the people around you without even knowing it. Judging yourself when you got impatient or irritated or made a mistake about something. You could be judging your kids, your significant other. You can write it down, but you don't have to; by the simple act of bringing them in your consciousness and going through a stream of consciousness of forgiveness, you can just say silently inside, or you can say it loud if that works better for you, "I forgive myself for judging myself for this." "I forgive myself for judging myself, for judging so and so for that." "I forgive myself;" you see what I'm saying? It's just you keep rolling it, you feel irritation when the person who said that would call me and they didn't, "I forgive myself for that." "I forgive myself for yelling at my husband." "I forgive myself for judging myself for yelling at my children." "I forgive myself for judging myself for feeling tired." How many of us judge ourselves when we feel tired? For not exercising when I said I would? You get the idea? Really go there, and start to release these energies that constrict you. It's not the words; it's also the energy of loving that comes back to you. And then finish it all by saying, "I forgive myself for forgetting that I am divine and that I am a living miracle of life." And come back to your spiritual essence, to your core, and then you can go to sleep, and you're going to sleep so much better. And ask yourself, is there someone from your past maybe that you have been holding a grudge with? Is it someone in your life where you've been judging them, and you might want to give yourself the opportunity to let go? And maybe, maybe you can even write them a letter and go through the depths of letting go so you, my friends, can be free. The more you practice forgiveness, the more you affirm your goodness, your lovability, your value, that you matter, no matter what you are going through, the more you will experience the connection, the love, and the peace in your life.

Dear Beloved, I wanna move forward. The past events that disturbed me are still in my thoughts and sitting in my belly, circulating in my consciousness.

I do not make myself wrong or make the other person wrong. Let me find the neutral balance and extend array of loving to myself and to them. The array of loving I know in my heart, the array of peace, the array of the uplifting spirit that exists to make all things fall into place. I let my ego be set aside if there's any other wisdom that may be added here. I allow it.

LESSON 16: Harness the Magic of Gratitude
--------------------
Welcome back, and I hope, my friends, that you've all opened up a little more to your heart, more to yourself and the love that is inside your heart, and you have made forgiveness a daily practice. So today, first of all, let's always remember to bring in the light, to fill us, protect us, surround us, and uplift us. And just see yourself being bathed in this light. Take a moment; breathe in the light. Exhale any tensions, any feelings you don't want to have. Come present in your heart. And remember to smile. Smile inside and smile outside. Because when we smile, we give a message to our nervous system that everything is okay. Today we're going to focus in one of my favorite, most powerful qualities in our lives, the golden key to happiness and fulfillment. What do you think it is? Gratitude. When I look back in my life at the hard and challenging times that I had, I know that if I knew how to ground my gratitude, my life would've been much easier. I can't say enough of how true and powerful gratitude anchors us in our lives, and it changes everything. I love this Hasidic saying that says, "Just as the hand held before the eye can hide the tallest mountain, so can the routine of everyday life can keep us from seeing the vast radiance and secret wonders that fill the world." The worst enemy of gratitude is our daily routine that makes us take so many things for granted. The simple thing of a daily shower, for example, can become mundane and ordinary. And yet, if you ever had a problem where the water was shut down, and wouldn't you freak out? Or the hot water was not working? But how many of us give thanks for the water every day when millions and millions of people in the world are without water or even clean water? So when things are working, it's so easy to take everything for granted. So take a moment right now, and think about the universe we live in. We'll start right here, right now, from exactly where you are, sitting here, and just think of this planet, and just zoom out all the way past the moon, the sun, the solar system, and past the Milky Way galaxy. Think about the galaxy, the vast grouping of stars, and realize there are 200 billion galaxies in the universe. There are approximately one septillion, that's 24 zeros, planets in the universe, and something like 100 billion trillion stars. There are more stars than grains of sand on the beach. We are living in an awe-inspiring and unimaginably large universe. Contemplating the immensity of our cosmos can make you feel very small and insignificant. However, think about this. Do you know how many cells your body has? Guess. You have 37.2 trillion cells in your body that are making you and me and everyone around you alive right now. There is a vastness outside of you and a vastness inside of you. You are connected to the mystery, and gratitude bestows reverence, allowing us to encounter everyday epiphanies, those transcendent moments of awe that change forever how we experience life and the world. You my friends, are a microcosm of the universe, and every aspect of your life benefits from the universe's provisions. I don't often tune into the cosmos. I leave that to the scientists. However, when I do think about these things, it fills me with such an extraordinary feeling of reverence, gratitude, and oh my God. It shifts me from taking things for granted to the profound awareness that I get to enjoy and participate in this miraculous experience of life, that I didn't create any of this. So I might as well marvel at the wonder and be humbled by it. There is a scientific evidence that points to the fact and the benefits of gratitude practice. In one such study, psychologists from U of C Davis and University of Miami did a study on gratitude where one group wrote about things they were grateful for during the week and the other group wrote about things that irritated them. And the third group wrote about things without either emphasis. After 10 weeks, those that wrote about gratitude reported feeling more optimistic about their lives, happier, more joyful, and generally more fulfilled. They were motivated to exercise more, their health improved, and they had greater health and greater well-being. As you can see, gratitude is something that we should all be practicing daily in our lives. So here's what I'm grateful for right now. I'm grateful for bringing this Quest to you, for the Mindvalley community, and for all the people who helped me put this course together. I'm grateful for all of you who are taking this Quest with me, who decided to embark on this journey with me. I'm grateful for my health, my breath, the new baby my niece Christina had, Alexander, whom I miss so much. I'm grateful that I get to hold him, see him grow. I'm grateful for my beautiful family, my friends, my spiritual community. I'm grateful for my Greek heritage, for contact lenses, running water, soap, cappuccinos, elevators that work, bridges, being able to hear amazing music, from Mozart to Pharrell to Bruno Mars to Greek dancing to amazing different musicians who brings so much joy. When was the last time that you said, "Today I will just walk around my life, and today, whatever happens or doesn't happen, I'll just say thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you." You may not feel it a hundred percent, but if you start to make it a habit, you'll start to think of all the people who have contributed to your life. You start to open up to your consciousness and realize that we are the beneficiaries of freedom, creativity, ingenuity, and you can enjoy what our predecessors have done. Let me tell you a short story. Some time ago I was taking a flight back to New York after a speaking engagement in Montana. There was an unexpected snowstorm, so the pilot informed us that we would be landing in Salt Lake City late in the evening and staying there overnight. I was going to be stuck in the airport all night, so I started complaining, or shall we say, I started bitching. "I can't believe this is happening to me. What am I going to do now? This is horrible." I was spiraling down. Suddenly I heard a little voice inside of me saying, "Start thanking everything." I realized it was a command from my Spirit. I complied and I said, "Okay, I'm going to start thanking everything. Let's start with the fact that the plane didn't crash and we landed safely. Thank you that my phone is still charged and I can call people. Thank you for all the people I touched in Montana when I spoke. Thank you for all the people I met and connected during my talk. Thank you that my carry-on is still with me. Thank you that I have a chair to sit on and I can think of what to do next. Thank you that I'm not in a wheelchair or crutches," like the man next to me was. You get it? So as I started to flood myself with thankfulness, suddenly the phone rang. I picked it up. I said, "Hello." And it was a dear friend of mine, and he said to me, "Where are you?" I said, "Oh, you're not going to be believe this. I'm in Salt Lake City, stuck at the airport." He said, "Oh my God, I can't believe that because I'm arriving into Salt Lake City in three hours. Why don't you go and stay in my hotel suite? I'll happily sleep on the couch and bring you to the airport the next morning." Wow. Wow. Three minutes of gratitude turned everything around. I never forgot that experience. And after that experience, I decided to regularly, internally, silently practice thankfulness. So now on my way back to New York, I gave thanks to the pilots, flight attendants, the snacks they served, the terrible coffee. At least it was hot. I was just thanking everyone. I was so filled with gratitude. What a wonderful way to go through life. I found myself smiling as if I had been handed a magical key to happiness. My friends, live in gratitude. It will transform everything in your life, the magical ingredient to make everything magical. So you see what happened? The practice of gratitude, of actually naming the things I was grateful for and thankful for, was a profound prayer at that time. At my frustrated point, I found a way to connect, and the results were immediate. Gratitude is the highest form of prayer because at that time, you are opening the floodgates to connect with your Spirit. The experience stayed with me as a reference of how other times in my life when I start complaining, when I shut down, that I can just instantly move into gratitude, and then the Spirit opens up and takes care of the rest. So today, practice to spend the whole day running a thank you as a mantra in your heart and mind. Start to notice all of the things you take for granted. Look, first of all, up in the sky. It's so rare that we look up in the sky. And wander just for a second into the magnificent, awe-striking universe and other things around you. Find a book, any book, and think, "Oh my God, what did it take for that object to get to me?" I look at this lemon. What did it take for these lemons to get here? The seed. Who, who, who made this? If you cut it, it has juice that is also healing. So be appreciative. Thank yourself; thank others. Give thanks for all the little things around you, the opportunities that you have come your way, the relationships in your life. Don't take anything or anyone for granted. Start to focus on the abundance, not the scarcity, because so often we focus on lack. I don't have this, and I don't have that. I'm not good enough. Stop it. Stop it. You have everything right now in your life to be happy and fulfilled because you're a creator. You can go create other things. And at the end of your day, write down in your journal how shifting to gratitude changed the flow of your energy and your day. My mother, by the way, loved lemons. She never threw them away. The peels, she would always take them and boil water. And she said the smell of the lemons around the kitchen. She loved lemons. When she died, and we asked her before she died how she wanted to be buried, she said, "I don't want any graves. I don't want churches. I want you to plant a lemon tree in the garden." And indeed, in our home in Los Angeles we have an amazing lemon tree. And let me tell you something: it is always full of lemons, always, winter, fall, summer, spring, lemons. There is such abundance because I always feel my mother had that consciousness of abundance. So I look at that lemon tree and always remember the consciousness of gratitude, the consciousness of abundance. Make it a habit. Evoke it every day. So my friends, I have provided you with a guided meditation that you can listen in the morning to start your day or at the end of your day as you reflect on your day and set the intention for the coming day. Listen to it. Share it with your friends. It's a meditation that always takes me out of the limited self to the unlimited, more infinite, more transcendent, more grounded heartfelt energy that lives in us, that lives and is alive in the universe. It's transcendent. Grateful to all of you. Live in gratitude.

LESSON 16: Meditation: Agapi's Heart & Soul Meditation

Guided meditation. Find a comfortable position and take a few moments to center in your heart. This can be done anytime throughout your day. It can even be done at work in a public place or at your home. We are going to access the power of your heart. Take a deep breath and relax into your heart. Take another deep breath and slowly exhale. Allow your whole energy to feel your heart, not just your physical heart, but your emotional and your spiritual heart. If you would like, you can take both your hands and gently place them on your heart. 

As you take your next breath, allow your heart to open. Imagine a beautiful rose, a full in bloom, rose, any color you want in the center of your heart. Every time you take a breath, a pedal opens. You have moved all your stress from your mind and emotions and returned to the clarity of your heart. Think of things that awaken your love. Is it your child, a friend, a family member, your partner, your pet, or perhaps it is a photograph of a sunrise or sunset. Bring them present to you right now. Let this sweetness of that thought fill you up and tell yourself, this is love. 

This love lives inside of me. If you notice any pain, disappointment, separation, anxiety or grief, acknowledge them. Notice the energy of your heart. Awakening and embracing all of your sadness, and gently and lovingly transmuting any energies that you don't need. Thoughts of worry of future outcomes are transformed right now in the presence of the power of your heart. Repeat this statement in your mind. I am safe to keep my heart open, protected in the knowing of my heart. I listen to my heart. I listen to the quiet whisper that my heart tells me. I listen to it. Wisdom, tenderness, kindness and compassion, and I respond to the calling of my heart. 

Take that love and amplify right now. Let yourself be embraced by it. Breathe it into your lungs all the way. Let the love rise up through your body and comfort you. If there are tears that come, let them come. It's the willingness to surrender to the love of who you are that ultimately will open your heart. The rose in your heart is opened its pedals and released its fragrance now from that centered place contained and yet expanded. Send love out like beams of sunlight out into your family, into your work, into your home, into every area of your life. 

This ray of sun will connect you within and thread your life with love. Even send love to the situations that disturb you and see how they change. This is you. This love is who you are. Return to this place often it is the home of your heart living it. It has wisdom, direction, and guidance for you. Fill it with sunlight. You have the choice to come back to the home of your heart. When the world pulls you, your heart is your sanctuary. Take a deep breath, raise your arms and extend them out. Taking in all of this energy, give yourself a big hug. Tilt your head to the left and to the right. Let your heart energy move through you. Take a deep breath and exhale with a sigh. Ah, be happy. You know your heart. It's so simple. It's your very breath, smile. Drink a sip of water. Write down something that connected you back to you. When you stand, feel your heart throughout your body. When you go out into the world, know that you are protected and surrounded by that love. Let it radiate out. You are going to have an amazing day.

LESSON 17: Live With a Sense of Timelessness
--------------------
Welcome back. Can you believe it? We're in the final lesson of our Quest, which I love. And let us evoke the light. Let us tune into the amazing Spirit that we all have come into contact with through this Quest. Take a deep breath. Fill your lungs with oxygen, your brain, your heart, your whole body. Fill it all the way down to your feet. Let the light, the invisible light, bathe you. Let it come through your eyes, your breath. And as you exhale, exhale anything you do not need, any impatience, any irritability, any tension. Come like a beacon of light into your heart. There you go. Bring it all present. Connect to the invisible Spirit in you. Evoke it. Conjure it up. And we ask just now that this light be sent to everyone here who is listening. And we ask that our hearts can be full and we may listen to the whisper of the Spirit. And we are so grateful. Amen. So, congratulations, my friends, for your courage to embark on this journey with me. You have taken a very important step by having it in your heart to make this deeper connection to your invisible, but so present Spirit. We all have an opportunity to live our lives this way, but choosing this Quest, you are already moving to this deeper connection because you made the commitment to really love, know yourself, and know your Spirit. So, I'm thrilled to go there with you. I would like to begin this new lesson with a quote by William Blake. "To see a world in a grain of sand and a heaven in a wildflower, hold infinity in the palm of your hand, an eternity in an hour." So, what is that to do with our Quest? Timelessness. Timelessness. Time is something that is so man-made, but the universe operates in timelessness. Wouldn't you love to know about timelessness? Think of times in your life where you felt time stopped. One of the reasons I love performing is that time does stop. Ever since I was a young girl in drama school, when I was on stage acting a part, I felt so fully present and so alive. Nothing else mattered. When there's no other thought in my mind when I'm acting, performing, or even speaking, because it requires me to be so present. It's the most exhilarating thing. Have you ever been in love? Remember when you are with the person you're in love with, and you suddenly forget the time? Where did the time go? Or you're having a good time with your friends, or you're enjoying yourself, and time stops because you are fully present. Or have you ever waited at the airport or waited for a bus or a train, and time just drags on? So, time is definitely relative. There's something about time that changes according to where we are, what we are feeling, what we are experiencing. When I was writing my book during the pandemic, it was a very strange feeling that I felt sometimes that the days were as long, and they would feel endless. And then, other times, I felt how quickly they moved from one thing to the next. But at the same time, we didn't know when this period would end or how we would come out of it. More than any other time in my life, I realized the only solution to deal with the impatience and the frustration of time going too fast or to slow was to completely connect with my breath which is completely connected to Spirit which is completely connected to my heart which is completely connected to my body. So, I would be present. And in the presence of my breath, time expanded, and I would glide into timelessness. I'm going to repeat to you what was mentioned previously in the Quest, if you remember, when my friend came to do a session with me when I was preparing to do the goddesses. "Darling, let yourself be breathed." And at that moment, I realized the incredible power of the breath of life through you. So, right now, let us together, let yourself be breathed, okay? To surrender, suspend any thoughts. Just whatever thoughts come, just observe them. Suspend thoughts about time, and let yourself breathe. Feel your breath, and come fully present right now. And it's the greatest gift you can give yourself just to feel your breath. That's where the Spirit is, very soft, like a breeze. Feel your breath. Exhale your breath. Open your heart. As my mother used to say, "Darling, I live in the rhythm of eternity." And she did. You could never rush my mother to go anywhere. She was constantly surrendered to the moment because in the moment, the soul is present, the Spirit is present, and you are present. You can live above time. Wouldn't that be wonderful? Wouldn't it be a wonderful way to live? So, together right now, let us come into the consciousness of timelessness, and let us do a prayer and give ourselves this opportunity to elevate. Let's take the elevator to the rooftop, and just look at the vista; look at the view; look at the perspective, and let us come into a reverence of prayer. Everything inside is silent, quiet, settled. Dear beloved, I feel the pressure and the panic of time going by. I feel that I don't even have time to have a moment with you. Inside my head, I hear these words all the time. I don't have enough time. There is no time. Where did the time go? But my heart longs to experience a sense of timelessness, to be above time, to know that in the constraints of my mind and my physical world, I can still attune to the universe, to the universal clock that has a rhythm, a pace like the river of life that flows and knows its direction. I ask now that I may open my mind to know the timelessness of my existence. In the midst of my doings, my actions, my to-do lists, and all the demands of my life, I feel that I move into the rhythm that the universe has so brilliantly and intelligently constructed. And just as the planets turn on their axis in their own time, may I become connected to the divine timing of my life. Like my cells that have their own life force, in constant motion, yet never hectic. I ask too that I tap into the source of knowing that as I slow down, I will move into the perfect pace of my life, letting go of the pressure, the overwhelming feelings that deplete me, and the uncertainty. I ask that the peace that reigns over all things be reinstated in me right now, and I breathe in that peace, and I breathe in that reality. I call it forward. And I allow it to supersede my thoughts, my emotions, and overtake me as I become more of an observer and less of a worrier. I am grateful for allowing this in my life. I am grateful to know that there is another way. I ask that, day by day, I am redirected to move into the natural flow of my Spirit. I thank you, and so be it. Oh, so my wonderful friends, look at your journey, and look at it in your heart, and ask yourself, how beloved do you feel? Where can you open up more your heart to yourself? Where do you feel at one with yourself? Celebrate yourself. Do you have more of your presence with you? Of course you do. We all do. There is no end to this journey. You have given yourself this Quest as a way to start opening your self to these multidimensional vistas, opening the doors to your mansion, opening the windows to your mansion. Endless floors, endless floors, endless vistas. You are more than just flesh and blood body that is the history of you and your physical world. If you just say, "Through this Quest, you know, Agapi, I caught a glimpse of my Spirit. I caught a glimpse of my soul. I caught a glimpse of unconditional loving." Oh, then I celebrate you. I celebrate you. You have penetrated the dense materiality. That's so hard to do. You have pierced through into the life force. It's like the Leonard Cohen quote. "There is a crack in everything. That's how the light gets in." We've made a lot of cracks here. So, through those little cracks you've opened, continue to let the light come in through you in your life. Call it; evoke it as much as you want. Trust that you've got that opening now. Trust. And you can come back to this place if you need anything; come back to this Quest. Come back to each other; come back to loving; come back to forgiving; come back to gratitude over and over again. We are not done 'til we're done, 'til we're gone. Your practice today is to write your prayers for yourself, giving yourself the greatest gift of being fully present. No matter what you're doing or what's going on around you, I want you to celebrate yourself and share your wins with your Tribe as we celebrate you as well and share your gifts with others who don't even know how to begin. This Quest is not a destination. It's a journey, right? Remember that. And I will leave you with one last affirmation, one last thought. More than anything, you are never alone. God is your partner. God. God. That's huge. Is your partner. God is by your side. How can he not or she or it not be? Because it's in you. It's you. So, own it. Claim it. Claim you and your God-given power. Celebrate you, and please share you. Your humanity, share it. Human beings need what you have. Trust me. Let us make this earth a little happier, a little more heaven on this earth. And you are part of that puzzle. You are part of that tapestry of love. Be unconditional. You can change people's lives. You can affect people every day with your presence, with your smile, with your vibration. Elevate it. Pick up your elevator, and go to the rooftop. Live there. And when you forget, come back to this Quest. I love you with all my heart. We are all really part of the brotherhood and sisterhood of man, and we're all in it together. God bless you. I love you.

LESSON 17: Meditation - Agapi's Prayer #16

Dear Beloved, I feel the pressure and the panic of time going by. I feel that I don't even have time to have a moment with you inside my head. I hear these words all the time. I don't have enough time. That is no time. Where did the time go? But my heart longs to experience a sense of timelessness, to be above time to know that in the constraints of my mind and my physical world, I can still attune to the universe, to the universal clock that has a rhythm, a pace like the river of life that flows and knows its direction. I ask now that I may open my mind the know that timelessness of my existence, in the midst of my doings, my actions, my to-do lists, and all the demands of my life. I feel that I move into the rhythm that the universe has so brilliantly and intelligently constructed. 

And just as the planets turn all their axis in their own time, may I become connected to the divine timing of my life, like myself, that have their own life force in constant motion, yet never hectic. I ask too that I tap into the source of knowing that as I slow down, I will move into the perfect pace of my life. Letting go of the pressure, the overwhelming feelings that deplete me, and the uncertainty I ask that the peace that reigns over all things be reinstated in me right now, and I breathe in that peace and I breathe in that reality. I call it forward, and I'll allow it to supersede my thoughts, my emotions, and overtake me as I become more of an observer and less of a warrior. I am grateful for allowing this in my life. I'm grateful to know that there is another way. I ask that day by day I am redirected to move into the natural flow of my spirit. I thank you and so be it.
