Preparation 1 – Welcome to Feng Shui for Life
--------------------
Do you feel stuck in your life? Do you feel like the energy is just not moving in the right direction? That goals that you have are just not manifesting easily and effortless and fast? It is possible you are single and you want romance. Or you have tried everything to create money flow, and still it is not happening. It's also possible you have goals for success and want to promote and start your own business, but you just feel the wind is against you and things have a hard time manifesting. It's because you have not activated your environment. I'm sure you have been working on your mindset, on your gratitude, perhaps you have been releasing all your blockages energetically and spiritual. But, you haven't checked out your environment. Your environment is responsible for one third of your good luck and the results of your manifestation. And I'm sure you haven't paid attention to it. Or you don't understand yet, that the four major areas of your life are impacted by your home and your office. Success and money flow held, your personal and professional relationships, your connection with heaven, your spiritual growth, your wisdom. It all is affected by your home, where you live, sleep and work. And that is exactly what you need to work on. Now some of you I'm sure, have worked very hard already with amazing teachers and great techniques on changing your manifestation potential. But your environment you have not paid attention to. If you want to live more effortless and with more ease, this is exactly where you need to focus on. I'm sure you have worked very hard on your mindset, but your home has a mindset of it's own, it's telling a different story. And perhaps it has been sabotaging you, instead of supporting you in manifesting your goals. After going through this program, you will be able to unblock all these four aspects of your life. Because your home will start supporting you and you will de-blocked all the energies in your home that did not manifest what you desired. This program is structured in eight weeks. Every week, you get one chapter and you receive one hour video to understand what this chapter is about. So every week, you will receive exercises and homework. So be prepared to do some self-work. Make sure you set aside some time for it. We welcome you to join the community of like minded individuals from all over the world, that will go with you through this program. Feel free to share your learning experiences and support other members in the community. Before you start this program, it is important to set your intentions. You want to know what you want to get out of it. I invite you to set an intention for your success and your money flow. What is going on in your life right now that you want to change? That is your intention. Perhaps you also have an intention to change your health and well-being, something that is not going well in that area of your life. Write that down as your intention. I am sure there are some personal and professional relationships that can definitely be doing better. Write down what these relationships are and what do you want as an outcome. And also for your own spiritual wisdom, what is the intention for your spiritual journey? Write that down. So you will have definitely four intentions you want to manifest with this program. So, write these intentions down in your journal, so that you know what your focus is for the next eight weeks. In the four major areas of your life. Success and money flow, health, your personal and professional relationship, and your wisdom. Set aside some time and space for you to keep following the program. So you keep being motivated to manifest your goals. When you feel you start having lack of time or you're feeling demotivated, go back to your original intentions and goals, and know why you are actually doing this program. So you will feel more motivated and active again to manifest your intentions. I'm looking forward to start with you in Chapter One.

Week 1: Introduction to Feng Shui

====================

LESSON 1 – What is Feng Shui?
--------------------
<v ->Welcome to Chapter One.</v> In this chapter, I'm going to introduce you to Feng shui. I want to first of all share with you how did I get to start working with Feng shui. As a child, I always could see energy of chakras, of a home of the aura field. When I was seven, I actually connected with my spiritual teacher. He was what we call an immortal, an ascended master. He came to me and start sharing with me how to work with energy, how to work with meditation. I practiced this until I was about 15 years old and then, something major happened in my life. I was hit by a truck as I was driving home with a bike from school. When the ambulance came, they declared me dead, but I was having a near death experience. I went to the other side and I was in front of all beings of light. Amongst them was my teacher and he said to me, you have to go back because you're here to enlighten more than 500 million people. I came back into my body and I started really focusing every day, how could I enlighten more than 500 million people? I was a teenager, I was 15, I was living in Belgium and I didn't really have a great life. I was a good student, but I had no friends. Even the people from my school, they were bullying me and sometimes beating me up. After the accident, things worsened and I lost about 80% of my short-term memory. From being a straight A student that loved mathematics, I actually became a straight F student and lost one year of my school. About six months after the accident, I was very depressed, did not know what to do in my life anymore, I was lonely and now, even my intelligence was not working anymore. My spiritual master appeared again and I asked him, what did I do wrong? I said, I've been a good girl. I've been meditating and praying, I've been really nice to people and now I have all these accidents and the last one, I almost lost my life. He said to me, Marie, you have bad Feng shui. I remember saying, what is that? I never heard of such a thing. He started explaining to me that my environment, the place where I was sleeping, was really not good energy for me. I agreed with that. I hated that place. It was a bedroom that was passed on to me from my older sister and still, the wallpaper and the images that were hanging out were all connected with her. In that time, people would not redesign the place. They just would pass it on to the younger sister. He shared with me what were the colors that were successful for me, he also would share my personal energy number and what were the directions that were strong for me for success and for relationships. I asked my parents if I could move into the room of my older brothers that already were out of the house. They were much older than me. I painted the whole room a beautiful peach orange, I painted the furniture white because it's one of my favorite colors, I placed images around me that would activate my friendship and my romance. I took paper and I put images on the paper and then I traced them and then I filled them up with colors. I made sure I was sitting in the right direction also for studying, facing one of my good directions. Now I was in a new place and that place before from my brothers always created a lot of joy and fun and a lot of friends came over. Indeed, the same thing started happening for me. Within a few weeks, I had my first boyfriend and he was a hot guy from town. He was actually driving the red motorcycle and all those bullying girls from my school wanted to hang around me, or at least, hang around my boyfriend, but something shifted and I started having more people to connect with in school and the bullying and the beatings stopped and I became more appreciated by the other girls. The only thing I really changed was my environment. I was still the same person, I was still having a positive mindset, I was still praying and meditating, but my environment had changed around and created almost immediately a huge change in my life. After this experience, I kept doing the same thing with Feng shui. Wherever at home, I would go in, or wherever place I would stay, I would make sure my personal directions were activated and I had the right colors around me and I started studying law because I wanted to really impact the world and I thought if I know how to do law, I can become a diplomat or a politician. After finishing my law studies, I started working for the Belgium and the European government in creating law, but after a few years, I really felt this was not the best fate for me to really connect in with millions of people, and I started a consulting company, teaching people how to meditate, how to reach enlightenment. I was coaching people, but the more I was working with them, the more I saw there was something they were missing out on. They wanted to change their mindset and align themself with their soul, but each time they would go home, they would end up in an environment that was just not supporting their spiritual growth, so I started teaching basic steps of Feng shui, the steps I knew at that time, but then my master came back and said, the first book in your language, which was Dutch, is actually out. Go and buy it. I started reading about Feng shui. Within a few weeks, I ended up going to London to be with 100 practitioners of Feng shui and the seven grandmasters. One of these masters was somebody that I felt very attracted to. He was a tycoon, he had become a billionaire. He also was a black belt in Kung Fu and for me, a very enlightened man. He actually started teaching Feng shui when he already retired. I felt like this is a practical man, a businessman that also connects in with energy, so I felt a great combination. My grandmaster Yap Cheng Hai was there, but I was not ready for him yet. A few months later, I had this dream that he came to see me and he looked at my body and he was like . He looked at my energy field. At the time, I was in Santa Barbara on a holiday and I found out he was teaching the next day in Los Angeles. His team said, he only allows 30 people and they have been waiting three years, even to 10 years to start studying with him. I told them, no, you have to tell him he already approved me, he came in a dream. Indeed, I got an email back saying he just confirmed, you are the 31st student that he allows in. The first time I came to the Feng shui course, he started telling me about what Feng shui was and how it actually affects your law of attraction. That first day, I will never forget. He shared with me that the law of attraction and the results of our life are affected by three aspects. The first aspect is called your heavenly luck. It's your destiny, it is your karma, it's when your soul came out of the multidimensional field into this three-dimensional experience and start experiencing some gifts, some challenges, and some arrangements and agreements that you have with other people. One third of your results of your life are connected with that field. You can change it, but it's not easy. Of course, if you're born in a certain country and you move to another country, you actually change your destiny and you can change it by praying and meditating, but it's a long process and not easy. It is the second third is actually when you are focusing on your mindset, on how you feel, how you're grateful, and how you take action in your life. That is called your human luck. It's also responsible for one third of your law of attraction. I see that most people in the self-help development world are actually focusing on that one third and 99% of people in the movie "The Secret" were focusing on that field, but you can hit a ceiling because you only have one third that is affected by that. Then he shared this last third that most people are not focusing on, and it's how your environment is affecting your subconscious mind. Your environment is bigger than you. Your home and your office is affecting you 24 hours a day if you are in it or not. All the images, the colors, your furniture, the positioning of yourself in that space affects your mindset and brings you from beta state into alpha state. I was hooked. I was like this is amazing, so I started teaching this to my clients and to my students and I saw that this huge shift was happening in their life. They aligned better with their soul, they manifested easier success and prosperity. After becoming very successful in what I did in Europe, I also knew if I wanted to reach more than 500 million people, I had to let go of my country. I started putting images around me connected with the United States. I even had this little weld ship that was sailing in at my entrance. It was called Americana and I put some Chinese coins in it, but also a lot of quarters from America. Indeed, I started going to America and started teaching my work and more and more income stream came from America 'til at the certain moment, I was teaching in San Francisco and one morning, I woke up with the voice of my master and he said, within three weeks, you have to be here. I called my husband and said, start packing, we're moving to America. Three weeks later, I was in America and I created a Feng shui of my office. I put a vision board up in my personal success direction and I did hang a small yellow post-it note on it that said I'm going to be in a movie seen by millions of people that will transform the world. I thought, I'm quite close to Hollywood, so I bought myself a fake Oscar statue, put it in my success direction, put my name on it, Marie Diamond, and I said I need a few years, so I put in 2005. Within a few weeks, I started attracting the first people that ultimately led me to be in the movie called "The Secret". Within a month, I had my first Oscar-winning client. Feng shui brought me also to become one of the top speakers and teachers in America about the law of attraction and after "The Secret", in the world. What is Feng shui and why should you learn about it? Feng shui means wind and water. It's about the flow of energy, the flow of chi. When you work, for example, with Tai Chi or Qigong or acupuncture, you work with the chi and the flow of energy in the body. Feng shui works with the chi and the flow of a bigger body called your home, or your space, around you. Where did that start? I believe that the first Feng shui masters were shamans and they were perhaps able to see the energy as I saw the energy when I was young. When I was a child, I would come into a place and saw the aura field of spaces and I could see where there was more light, more prana, and less light, and then it was darker. I could see when somebody was sitting there, how their aura changed and if they would sit somewhere else, how their aura changed in a better way. I believed the Chinese shamans saw the same thing. They actually could see the flow of energy in a space and even around a space. The first Feng shui started really happening when people started looking for a house and looked at what was the impact of the wind because Feng shui means wind and water. The wind around us and the water around us affects who we are and how we feel in the world. If you, for example, think about a tornado, would you like to live where there's a tornado? No, it is dangerous, but would you like to live where there's no wind, where there's no harvest that can grow? That's not a good thing either, but living in a place where there's this nice little breeze, or you can stay in that area for a long time because it's positive and it affects you and makes you happy. Water has the same impact. Of course, think about the wind, it's also your breathing. When we breathe in, we're actually connecting with the air, the wind around us and when we breathe out, we actually gently create wind. Shui means water and we know that the body of an adult human being is made out of about 60% of water. When you would live at an area where there's a lot of water, think about living close to a waterfall, that would not be so positive because it's just constantly water energy around you, but you also don't want to live in a desert where there is a lack of water because nothing can grow there. You would die even in the desert. You want to live with just a nice amount of water, like at the river or at a lake, so that the water also will bring you food and nutrition. The original Feng shui masters, they were looking for the place where the wind and the water was positive for somebody to build a building. The first thing they wanted to check out is to make sure that there was no impact from the cold Northern winds and they wanted to protect themself from that and they protected it with for example, having a building placed with the back to a mountain so that the Northern colder winds would not affect the people living in the house and also the harvest around the house. They also would make sure that the front of the house would be open to the sunshine so that when the windows and the doors were open, the sunshine would be able to come in. We all know, when you are sitting in the sunshine, you have more Vitamin D and you feel more happy. They wanted to explain that to the common Chinese people and they taught them how to relate with symbols. The mountain was like the shell of a tortoise, to protect you, and a tortoise was also a symbol of longevity. When you're connecting yourself with a mountain behind you and you're protected from the Northern colder winds, you actually would have a longer life. In the front of you towards the South, you want to connect in with the sun and you want to fly into the sun and they taught them to connect in with the feelings. The bird then could fly into the sun. These were the first steps that people thought about landscape Feng shui, how the wind and water around the house would affect the happiness, the longevity, and also the harvest of the farmers. They also wanted to make sure that the East area was protected. You wanted to have the sunshine come through in the early morning, but the early morning wind is still crisp and cold, so they told if you would have a mountain area or a hill area on the left side of the house towards the East that's kind of meandering like the back of a dragon and they said you need to have a dragon on the left side of the house when you're looking out of your house. On the right side, you want to have the wind as long as possible and the warm sunshine, so they said if you have a little hill there like a sleeping White Tiger, then that would be also positive 'cause you want the sunshine as long as possible from the East to the West and in the North, there is no sunshine, so you will feel protected from the cold night. These are the first Feng shui rules that started being applied. As the shamans evolved, they also started understanding that there is a chi of flow connected with the birche and they started working with a compass. The moment they started working with a compass energy and the birche and understanding that each direction has a different vibration, different purpose, a different element, a different form, a different material, and how that all related to create prosperity, success and power, longevity, and relationships both personally and professionally and it could impact not just one person, but a whole nation. They started sharing the Feng shui rules and principles with the rulers, the emperor, and the Mandarin, the court around the emperor. At this certain moment, the emperors knew that they didn't want to share this with all the community because they wanted to stay prosperous, they wanted to be in power and so they actually decided that the Feng shui masters could not share their principles with the common people and in case they did, they lost their life. Feng shui was considered sacred. Only the few ones that had the power could work with it. Because of that, it became secret for thousands of years. In the '50s, something shifted. At that time, there was a Communist regime in China and the intellectuals and the strong families left China when there was a culture revolution. They moved to Taiwan, to Singapore, to Malaysia, and they took with them their Feng shui masters. The story even tells that the most successful Feng shui master was not allowed to leave China and had to work for Mao Zedong. From that time on, the Chinese families started connecting in with the Western world, for example, they would build a skyscraper in Hong Kong, or they would set up offices, they would bring in the Feng shui master. The English and American companies started connecting in with that information and in the early '70s and '80s, that information started being spread more towards the Western world. There was already another time in the 15th and 16th century that some of the Feng shui principles was shared in Europe. It was said that Louie The XIV, the sun king from France, already knew some of this information and brought Feng shui experts in to build the palace of Versailles and especially all the fountains in his garden. He again had the longest rain in history and he was a king that lived a very long time. Still, his art and culture impacts us today. It is also shared that Peter 1st The Great used Feng shui for his winter palace in Saint Petersburg. Now today, Feng shui has a worldwide reach, not just for the Chinese culture, but worldwide, people start understanding that their environment is impacting them. Today, you're going to start learning Feng shui to impact your success, health, relationships, money flow, and your wisdom. In the early '90s, Feng shui was starting to be spread in North America and they called that the Bagua Feng shui. They actually used the nine compass directions to activate them in their home. Diamond Feng shui is different with Bagua Feng shui as we're not just using the compass directions that are general, we're also focusing how your birche is affected by your space and you have four important directions to activate your success, money flow, health, relationships, and wisdom. In Diamond Feng shui, I also work with time Feng shui in a more advanced level. In Diamond Feng shui, I also focus how your space is affecting your quantum physic field and your mindset and your law of attraction and when you really want to work with your Earth log, that last third, that missing link that most of you have, there are two aspects to Feng shui. We call it space Feng shui and time Feng shui. Space Feng shui is really focused on how your environment, everything that's around you, is affecting your mindset. There are general rules that you're going to focus on in this program, but we also have something called your personal energy number, how based on your birthday, there are areas in your home that will affect you more and constantly from the beginning of your birth 'til the end of your life. We'll definitely also add a time activation for the current year. If you want to meet someone, you have agreed and said I'm going to meet you there at that time, a space and a time. That is why your personal energy number is so powerful because we're adding already the time energy to the Feng shui. When your soul came in from a multidimensional quantum field, it actually came in through a portal of energy into this three-dimensional world and that portal is your success direction, and that your soul also connected with other areas where your health, your relationships, and your wisdom will become stronger. It's like these areas are portals towards the universe. Whatever you have placed there will actively 24 hours a day will send a constant message to the universe so that even if you are not thinking about what you want to accomplish, that you will actually manifest faster and easier. Changing your mindset is of course possible, but it takes a lot of discipline. I don't know about you, but being positive 24 hours a day, that is a big task. Also, having always a good feeling and being happy and being grateful, it is something you have to work on daily, and also to take action nonstop in a positive sense to make your purpose come true, that is not always a given. That is why your human luck is something you work on. You go to seminars, you have tools and techniques, you work with a coach, a mentor to keep moving forward on that human luck. Earth luck is something that is easy to change. When you activate your personal energy number, in the four best directions when you hang the right images, you add some colors, that is an easy thing to do. In a few days, your whole home is changed around. That is why changing your environment changes your brain state within three seconds from beta to alpha. The results of changing your space, you can actually experience them within nine days, there's a little shift happening, and definitely within nine weeks. It's an easy thing to do and once you have done that, you don't have to repeat yourself day after day, week after week. Feng shui is not a religion or a philosophy. Feng shui is an art and I believe it is a science. It's like the quantum physics of your environment. It has principles, it has formulas, and when you really go deeper into Feng shui, you need to know how numbers work. Whatever religion or philosophy you have, you can use Feng shui. I have clients and students from all over the world and they have all kinds of religions and philosophies. Because in Feng shui, we will actually honor and respect and activate even your religious or philosophical beliefs. A few years ago, Jack Canfield asked me to do the Feng shui of his office. I came in and he was sitting with his back to the door. He had this beautiful view on Santa Barbara, but to see me, he had to turn himself around. Everywhere were books, bookcases, books on the ground. I mean, you could barely walk to get to him. He was also facing the wrong direction for him, but he was for sure not sitting in a power position. A power position is that you are sitting in such a way that you can see the people come in. I asked him, how are things with you? He said, could be better. I said, I can imagine because you don't see the opportunities. The opportunities are happening behind you. Prosperity does come with the people through the door, prosperity does not come through the windows. He said, I really would like to shift from being an author, and he was a famous author for the "Chicken Soup for the Soul", and I want to shift that to become a global teacher in the self-help movement. I asked him first of all to pick up all the books and to let go of the books he did not longer need anymore. We activated his personal success direction and put there all the awards and certificates he had as a teacher. I said to him, if you want to go global, we need to get a globe, so we put a globe in his personal relationship direction and I asked him to spin the globe every day. His wife called me and said, Marie, can we stop spinning the globe? He is booked for the next year. He won't be home anymore. I also believe as we activated his office that he became one of the greatest teachers in "The Secret". An Emmy award-winning musician called me one day and said, Marie, things are not happening anymore. I made good fortune when I was in LA and I moved to New Mexico. He said, it's like they have forgotten about me. No one is calling me again to make music, to produce music. I said, let me check your office. I walked in and the first thing I saw was on his computer screen, a desert, and all around him were images from New Mexico with deserts and cactus. I said, that is interesting. He said, I love it. I said, this is great when you're in the sand business. I said, is that what you want to focus on? He started laughing and said, of course not. I want to create music. I said, do you have golden records, do you have awards, do you have certificates, do you have pictures of famous people with you? He said, of course I have. They're in the basement. I said, let's get them out and hang them all around you. He was also sitting with his back to the door, so I suggested he would turn his desk around and see the flow coming in. He was stunned. Within a few days, people started calling him and said, you know, I started thinking about you, where are you, can we do something together, and the year after, he won another Emmy. All the images that are around you are affecting you. They alter your mindset. There was this woman and she came to me and said, Marie, I really want to find my husband and I meet wonderful men, but nothing happens. She showed me around her house and everywhere I saw were angels. Even above her bed, even above her headboard was this beautiful image of two carols kind of kissing each other. It's great to have angels around you. Angels are love, they do not make love. I suggested to her to take all the images, figurines and statues, put it in a big box and start giving out. I said, watch what's going to happen with the last angel. She was giving everything, I even got an angel from her, and she was in a sports club and a new man had entered as a member and she gave him the last angel and she married him and they got two beautiful children. Instead of having angels around her, she found her angel. The images that hang around you do affect your subconscious mind 24 hours a day. When your mind looks at things, it doesn't see the difference between an image and reality. Your subconscious mind cannot make the difference, so when you have things around you and you look at them, your mind thinks it is real. For example, if you have a home, let's say you have in your bedroom a huge image of a horse. Your subconscious mind cannot see the difference between this image of a horse and a real horse. It will react as the horse is really there, so when you have this image hanging next to your bed, you will not feel safe because when a horse is around you, you better take care and be careful. Also, the colors around you do affect you. Think about the color of prosperity, it is gold, so having golden items and golden frames around you, it will affect you. Think about people going to a palace. A palace of a queen or a king, there will be a lot of golden items and images in golden frames and paintings in golden frames. It does set a mindset of prosperity being surrounded by gold.

LESSON 2 – Assess Your Environment With the Muscle Test
--------------------
<v ->In this upcoming video clip, we're going to show you how</v> to do the muscle testing. In the practical video clip, you do not only learn how to muscle test with someone else, but also how to muscle test when you are alone. <v ->Lauren, welcome we are actually going to check out</v> the space that you live in, how is it affecting you. Right. I want you to become conscious of this, and so we're going to actually learn how to muscle test you. To see the effect that the energy of your house, the Feng shui of your house has actually on your mindset. <v ->Alright, okay.</v> <v ->When a house is positive Feng shui, you actually will</v> go very easily and effortlessly into an alpha brain wave set. When your house is not positive, you actually go into beta brain waves. And we can actually test this with muscle testing. may I have your arm? <v ->Of course.</v> <v ->Okay, when you muscle test, your muscles react</v> actually towards your brain, so when I ask a message your brain is saying yes or no, and if its yes, your arm will become strong if I push it down. And if your brain is not reacting positive to the message, it will actual go down. It becomes weak, yep. How to do muscle testing, the best way is to just put your arm on somebody's shoulder so the shoulder relaxes, and to put the hand just above the wrist, not on the wrist not here that's too far just above it. So we ask a question first, and we're going to do first general question, questions we already have an answer to. So first of all, the question is are you a woman? Right, so. <v ->Yes I am.</v> Let's see. <v ->So let's see right, so you push up as hard as you can,</v> push up, right, see you can resist me, you feel that? Okay so, think about if you are a man, right, now just use one finger because normally you should be able to resist one finger. Yeah because you know, you are not a man. But let's see, okay. Are you a man? <v ->I'm not.</v> <v ->You're not thank God, right?</v> The message is right, so we can also test it with your name, yeah, so your name is and you say my name is. <v ->My name is Lauren.</v> <v ->Okay push up as hard as you can,</v> Okay, see? I can keep pushing. <v ->That's my real name.</v> <v ->That is your real name.</v> And we're going to use now a name that is a male name, so for sure that is not your name. Think about my name is Peter. <v ->My name is Peter.</v> <v ->Okay see, you're weak.</v> <v ->Wow.</v> <v ->Okay, so this is actually how somebody else can test you</v> through muscle testing, to see if the environment is actually affecting in a positive or negative way. It's always better to do it with by somebody else because they're more observative they're more, you know witnessing the situation, but you can do it yourself. So I'm going to teach you how, right. So you take your fingers like this, right like this, and you take your other two fingers from the other hand and you pull on it. Okay, you feel? <v ->Yes I do.</v> <v ->So you say for example, I'm a woman.</v> <v ->I'm a woman.</v> <v ->Okay you see you cannot open your hands, you can keep</v> pushing your two fingers together. Say I'm a man. <v ->I'm a man.</v> <v ->Yeah, so it's like your fingers cannot stay together.</v> <v ->So it's kind of cool, right?</v> <v ->Yeah it is!</v> <v ->You can actually do that also with your name, so my</v> name is Lauren. <v ->My name is Lauren.</v> <v ->I don't have strength because my name is not Lauren.</v> But you say my name is Marie. <v ->My name is Marie.</v> <v ->And you see I am strong.</v> <v ->Yeah</v> <v ->Right because, yeah, I am Marie, right.</v> Yeah it is. This is actually how you can test your environment yourself if you have nobody to help you with. <v ->Okay.</v> <v ->So, one of the things I want you to see is look</v> around this place and just take it in and you know, around you, also behind you. We're going to just check first how this area is for you, if this is a positive area or not. <v ->I've always feel restless in this room.</v> <v ->Oh, you feel restless.</v> <v ->I do.</v> <v ->Okay so, it already doesn't show-</v> <v ->Yeah I know.</v> <v ->That is a good sign, right?</v> So, let's just check, okay so, you push up right and think about this place and how is the energy here. Push up as hard as you can. See, you're weak. <v ->Yeah, exactly.</v> <v ->Right, so, we'll see what is actually affecting you.</v> Right, one of the things I noticed the moment I walked in was actually this bookcase. <v ->Yep.</v> <v ->Right.</v> <v ->Just clean up a little bit.</v> <v ->Yes, so all around it's quite in harmony, right, but this</v> is quite a dark place, also there is you know darker books, plus there's a lot of things there that are really decluttering, like you know a bag is here. Items that I'm sure you misplaced. Definitely, a brush that's for your bathroom. So, a bookcase is all about books and things connected with that, and also you'll see some of the books are out of order. Some of the books are weighed down. Yeah so, one of the things in a book case you need to have is making sure that books are straight, yeah. The books are straight and you always pull the books towards the front, so always to the front because what the bookcase does if all the books are to the back, it actually creates a cutting energy, these are like knives. Like cut, cut, cut, cut, so when people are in this room, they actually will be cut by the energy and that's why you feel restless. <v ->Okay, yeah makes sense.</v> <v ->And just, you know organizing this even certain items,</v> pull them to the front as much as you can. And of course, you know, empty water bottles, they don't have a place here, so I know it's like you have space here and you're thinking, oh you put it there and you forget about it, right. So, the best would be to have the most books in here so that there's no cutting, or otherwise to make sure that there's an item in the middle, so and that the books are to the side, so that there's an order, it's an organization. You immediately start feeling much calmer in this room. <v ->Right.</v> <v ->So, let's do a little muscle testing because even if this</v> is not organized yet, you can imagine that is organized. Because if the mind gets the message that is organized, the body can react right away. So, you don't have to just do it right away, you can already imagine what it would be like. <v ->Understand.</v> <v ->And then your body reacts immediately to it.</v> <v ->Okay, let's try.</v> <v ->So, remember the bookcase as it was.</v> <v ->Yes.</v> <v ->Well, it's still a bit like this.</v> Okay so, how is your energy and just do one finger, so push as hard as you can. You see? It's weak. Can you just imagine it's all organized, close your eyes. The books are out to the front, there's no cutting energy anymore, all the lost items or the items that are not in the right place here they're gone, it's all cleaned up, perfectly in order. You can see that. Your mind sees the picture? How do you feel here? Push up as hard as you can, whoa wow. Can you feel the difference? <v ->Very strong, yeah.</v> <v ->So, think about you said you were restless before, so,</v> before we did decluttering, think about peace. Yeah okay so, how do you feel now, is there peace here? No. So just imagine this is organized, yeah, close your eyes. When you check something that is not there yet, close your eyes because then it's much stronger <v ->Easier to imagine.</v> <v ->It's all organized, do you feel peaceful here?</v> Push up as hard as you can. You see you're much stronger, yeah. <v ->I know what to do.</v> <v ->You know what to do and so this is everywhere in the house</v> you know you become conscious of what it is, you check it out with muscle testing before and after, you can even have the mindset, okay, I'm visualizing the image. <v ->You check it again, and then will give you much more,</v> I would say invitation to go and do it. Because you already have felt it. <v ->True.</v> <v ->That's very true.</v> <v ->So, 'cause now you have felt it in your body like wow,</v> this is really affecting me so much that I feel restless. Now I'm sure when I leave you will organize this. <v ->Perfect I know what to do, thank you.</v> <v ->You're welcome.</v> So, Lauren there are other things you can use muscle testing for. For example, you can look if an image is right for you, so I'm sure going through the house, we're going to test out some of the images in your directions. But you also, when the go and shop for a new image. <v ->All right.</v> <v ->Even on the internet, right, you can actually say well</v> is this a good image for my home? you can actually muscle test that, yeah. <v ->So, you don't have to return for me anymore, right?</v> <v ->Yes, that's the whole thing right, and you also can check</v> if these are the right colors for you, let's look around here. <v ->You know you have-</v> <v ->Gray and white.</v> <v ->Grays and whites, and there's a darker color here, so we</v> can a little muscle testing on that, so look at everything. Is this area, you know colorful enough for you? Does it give you the good energy? So, push up as hard as you can, you know it's kind of weak, right? So, it's wonderful to have neutral colors, but neutral colors- <v ->Too plain, perhaps.</v> <v ->It's too plain and your life will become neutral.</v> <v ->Wow okay, I don't want that, for sure.</v> <v ->You want a life that is happy and joyful and passionate.</v> Right so, this can't be too neutral. <v ->Okay.</v> <v ->Right so, also one of the things here is this is an open</v> space, so you have here a sitting area, but you also have the kitchen that you see from here. Does that kitchen affect you? Yeah so, also the location of the kitchen, we can muscle test, but also, is that perhaps one of the reasons that you're restless? That there is that open space. <v ->Could be, yeah.</v> <v ->Because, let's be honest in a kitchen we don't</v> always clean up very well. <v ->That's true.</v> I'm guilty of that. <v ->We leave a lot of things out.</v> So, when there's an open space, it's definitely important that you always clean everything up the moment you have had your dinner or lunch. You know, and organize everything. Let us just test, okay, how this kitchen is influencing you here. Okay push up as hard as you can. See there's a weakness. <v ->Too much open space.</v> <v ->So, you know there's definitely some things</v> that you can affect. What you can always do in a kitchen to make the energy better is to put some plants up there or some candles or some crystals. <v ->Life plants, as well.</v> <v ->Yeah, life plants you can definitely have life plants</v> in the kitchen, like if you have an island you can put it in the middle. <v ->Right, that'd be nice.</v> <v ->So, there's a nice touch for that.</v> So, and definitely, if it's an open space make sure that the knives are not visible, put the knives away. And just organize it in a very clean way. <v ->Right.</v> <v ->Everything, everything that you have</v> and that we're going to work with in this course, you can always muscle test if it's good energy for you. Or you can test for your loved one or for your children. You can always test is this image, is this direction, is this item, is this positive for me? 'Cause when's it positive for you, it will actually affect you in a positive way for success, for health, for relationships, and for wisdom. So, you can use muscle testing, so it's not just thinking, oh, it perhaps will work for me. <v ->Test it-</v> <v ->You know for sure.</v> <v ->You know for sure, your body will love it or not.</v> <v ->Right, right.</v> <v ->So, let's use muscle testing, during our</v> conversation today. <v ->Okay.</v> So, this is the master bedroom in the house. <v ->Wow, it's very spacious, I love it.</v> <v ->Beautiful.</v> <v ->So, we are going to see how that really affects</v> your energy here. <v ->All right.</v> <v ->Everything that is right here, so the first thing I</v> noticed is you have this- <v ->My-</v> <v ->Beautiful-</v> <v ->Big horse on the wall.</v> <v ->Horse on the wall.</v> So, you have actually this beautiful horse on the wall. Now, I always say to people be aware what ever is there, your subconscious mind accepts this as a reality. So, let's say if you would be sleeping here and that horse would be really here, would feel safe? Would you sleep? <v ->Now that you mention it, it would not be</v> the best I have in my bedroom. I wouldn't feel safe. <v ->I want to do a little muscle testing on that, right so,</v> I just want you to look at it right now. Think about, sleeping here, would that give you good rest? Having this horse in your bedroom? So push up as hard as you can. Push up as hard as you can. <v ->Not such a good sleep I'm getting here.</v> <v ->It's also romantically, you know I would say, I don't</v> know if you would be so close and intimate when there would be a horse- <v ->A horse next to us.</v> You're right, I never thought of that before. <v ->So, that is definitely, a horse some,</v> having a horse walking or running is something I would never do in a bedroom. So, that's something you want to do in an active place, like a living room or a family room, but never in a place where you need to be quiet and calm and romantic. <v ->So, I would bring this one downstairs?</v> <v ->So, that would be really good.</v> <v ->All right.</v> <v ->So, another thing that I want to point out is actually</v> this area here. Right, again it's a lonely horse, right, so this means you already have two horses. And they're both alone so imagine there's two people in this room, there's like a horse is there, horse is there. It's like there's no connection, plus they're actually pointing towards each other. They're running into each other, so this is actually an image where it shows communication will not be so easy between the people in this room. And also you have this beautiful ballet performance, but again, it's quite far you don't really see. <v ->Lonely, again.</v> <v ->It's quite lonely again, right, so it's not really</v> simulating, I would say, harmony, and relationship and romance in this area. So, I would actually replace that, also. And then really interesting here you have, a mirror left, mirror right from your bedroom, and you have a third mirror and that is actually your television. <v ->Yeah, true there's a reflection.</v> <v ->If you look into it you will see actually</v> your bed being reflected. <v ->I do.</v> <v ->Yeah?</v> <v ->So, having mirrors reflect your bed it always actually</v> creates communication problems between the people in the bed. I would say it's like you tell the universe there's more than one person in the bed, so if you're alone in the bed, it doubles the loneliness. So, it's not good for finding and attracting romance. If you're two in the bed, it actually tells let's invite some more people in. <v ->They're four.</v> <v ->You don't do that, right?</v> So, I would definitely, what you can do is, or get a television that is matte, so there's matte glass, so it doesn't reflect, or cover it at night. With a fabric over it, so and then do a fabric in the same color as your wall, so it kind of feels like it's a wall space. So, you actually have two mirrors also, one left and one right of your bed. And but, you know, you can keep them there because they're actually not reflecting you at all. So, there's two things you have to be aware of with mirrors. First you cannot see yourself in the mirror, but you also have to see if the mirror doesn't see you. <v ->Right, so-</v> <v ->In that case, you know I don't think this mirror sees</v> anyone of the people in the bed right. So, that's actually a good position for the mirrors to have. So, that's fine, but that television is really a problem. <v ->If I cover the television, I can keep the two-</v> <v ->You can keep the two mirrors, you'll be fine with that.</v> So, there's actually another image that really concerns me. <v ->I knew that you were going to say that.</v> <v ->So, we have this image there,</v> and it's very beautiful picture, right? But if you look at it and see what the meaning of that is, right. So, let's do some muscle testing on this painting, okay. <v ->I'm very Curious.</v> <v ->So, if you look at this painting and think about how you</v> feel with that image here. How do you feel? Push, push up as hard as you can, you know, oops. <v ->Wow did you hear that?</v> <v ->Yeah</v> <v ->Not very good.</v> <v ->And if you look at it, it's like you know this tree's are</v> strong, but same time they're not stable. Yeah, so you see the roots, so we look at the meaning of that image in for this room. First for health, it means like they're not stable. <v ->You see the roots, yeah.</v> <v ->You see the roots, um, also for romantic level, it's like</v> you know I'm not sure this relationship will last if you have this image here. So, that is definitely something I would rather suggest not even in a living room because it doesn't give stability. This is an image like for a hallway or something, not the entrance for sure. Right, but like in a hallway it doesn't affect you because you're not living, sleeping or working there. <v ->Right?</v> <v ->Okay.</v> <v ->I would definitely work on that, and then, it's really</v> interesting you have a lot of windows. <v ->I do, I was wondering if that's the problem in any way.</v> <v ->Well, you know it always is a problem if you see</v> what it sees, what you see outside of the window. For example, what I don't like is if you look out there, they have this driveway, and it's like coming right at you. Right, and it actually will affect- <v ->The bed.</v> <v ->The bed.</v> <v ->Straight at it, you're right.</v> <v ->Straight at you, so for sure when you're asleep, make sure</v> the blinds are down from that one because the chi, the energy of that is actually hitting. <v ->Pointing, yeah.</v> <v ->Subconsciously, the whole night.</v> So, that's actually a problem, another one that I don't like so much is this part because it has a lot of big cactuses over there. Again, when you wake up or especially when you walk in, you know you follow the flow of the walk in from the energy you actually see this cactus. <v ->That's the first thing you see</v> when you walk into the room. <v ->You do, so again, that is something, I would try to avoid.</v> <v ->Okay.</v> <v ->Because you cannot have perfect Feng shui.</v> <v ->That's true.</v> <v ->Right.</v> <v ->'Cause these are my neighbors plants.</v> <v ->Yes, you cannot do anything about,</v> if they would be your plants I would actually move them. Right, but I think that driveway coming at you is worst energy than the cactuses. So, definitely at night make sure the if you want some light coming in, that you will cover there two and the others you can keep open. <v ->Okay, okay.</v> <v ->If we kind of look at the overall energy now of this</v> room, so can let's do one last muscle testing. The way it is now, okay, think about your romance, push up as hard as you can. So it's weak. <v ->Not that great.</v> Think about health. Yeah. <v ->So, it's weak.</v> <v ->Wow.</v> <v ->So, we just imagine we taking away everything</v> that is not working. The horses, that other image, we cover the mirror, we're actually removing this, we put the blinds down. Just imagine, close your eyes, you're asleep. How would you feel health wise? Push up as hard as you can. Push up. Okay, very strong. <v ->Wow, yeah.</v> <v ->And a romantic level.</v> Push up as hard as you can. Yep, see very strong I can keep pushing. So this are the first things I really would work on. <v ->First thing I'll be doing for sure.</v> <v ->Stronger bedroom.</v> <v ->Thank you so much.</v> <v ->You're so welcome.</v>

LESSON 3 – Start Your Feng Shui Journey: Meditation & Exercises

- The first exercise of today is called the Tubes of Light Meditation. Before you start looking at the feng shui of your home, it is good to be aligned between your heavenly, your human, and your Earth luck. So we're going to first do a little bit of an inner feng shui meditation to make sure that you are open to receive the information that's around you, but to also be protected from the negative vibrations of your home. I invite you to the Tubes of Light meditation. Please sit in a relaxed position and close your eyes. And take a deep breath in and take a deep breath out . And as you're breathing in, visualize crystal white lights from the universe coming into your body from your head to your feet, and from your skin to deep into yourselves. And as you breathe out, let go of all the negative energy, the toxins, the stress and tensions you might feel in your body. Then imagine this crystal white light coming from the universe and filling your whole aura fields. An arm linked around you, above and under you. And any tension that you feel in the energy around you is showered down to the Earth. And you clear your whole aura field. Take a deep breath in and take a deep breath out . Imagine now the color royal blue. Royal blue is the color for success, power, and protection. And imagine that you place this royal blue energy all around this tube of white light, and under your feet. And it goes up this tube of royal blue energy as high as your arms can reach. It helps you to protect yourself from all negative vibrations from situations, from your home, and from people around you. Only good vibrations, positive energy can come into your aura field and into your body. You can even say out loud or in yourself, "I am the power of the universe, within me and around me." And accept that you're a powerful creator for your future. Then, and then imagine the color rose. The rose stands for unconditional love and support. Imagine this rose comes from the universe and creates a tube of light all around the royal blue energy, and it even goes under your feet. This is a good moment to be grateful to everyone that loves and supports you, not just people in your life, but also the spiritual beings, your spiritual teachers, God and the universe. You can say out loud or in yourself, "I am the love and support of the universe "within me and around me." Then visualize the color violet. Imagine it coming from the ground up, moving clockwise through your physical body and your aura field till above your head, into the universe. The color violet is a color for forgiveness, letting go of the past. So as the violet light as a violet fire goes through your whole body and your aura field, it's time to let go and forgive yourself for all your limited beliefs, thoughts, feelings, and actions. Now take a deep breath in , And take a deep breath out . Now imagine you have a magical hat on, and the top of your magical hat is an arm length above your physical head. On top of that magical hat is a bright white light. It's your access to your soul energy to the quantum field. It's also the place where your left and right brain start working in harmony. Focus on that point as you're going through your home to start feng shui your life so that you're not longer reacting from your personality, but you stay aligned with your heavenly luck. Now take a deep breath in . You can say out loud or in yourself, "I am the forgiveness of the universe, "within me and around me." Then bring your hands together, warm your hands. Bring your warm hands in front of your eyes. Open gently your eyes and let go of your hands. After you have connected with your quantum point, imagine golden light come over yourself as a golden dome. And the golden light stands for abundance, divine perfection, divine manifestation. And as the golden light comes around you, you can say to yourself, out loud or in yourself, "I am the abundance of the universe, "within me and around me." This Tubes of Light meditation can be practiced every morning. Thousands of people do this meditation in the morning so they will have an aligned and successful day. Some people also use this Tube of Light meditation before they go to sleep so that they are also receiving the alignment and are in connection with the universe during the night. But especially before you start with your feng shui preparation, do your Tubes of Light meditation so you'll be observing better what is going on in your life and you'll be easier to create change because your ego and personality will not come in between the change anymore and you will follow your sole purpose. The second exercise is an exercise of becoming aware of your home and your office. And imagine you're standing outside of your home, outside your office. You open the door and become aware that you are the God within you, the universe within you, or you can even imagine you're an angel, a teacher, walking into your home, and you welcome them. What is the first thing you see? Is this home a welcoming home? Does it feel good to enter? Or is there chaos around the entrance? Look at every image that is at the entrance. Does it welcome you? Does it make you feel good? Are there images of family, of prosperity, of success? So make a mental note for yourself if there is something that really disturbs you, that you immediately feel this is not the right image or statue in that area. And then walk as the God within you into your living space. What's the first thing you see? Are you welcomed by the positioning of the furniture or are the sofas with their back towards you? What are the first images you see? Are there plants, crystals, colors? Is this a living space that creates harmony, and peace, and wonderful relationships between the family members? Or is it the opposite? Make some mental notes of things that immediately disturb you when you come in and think that you are the God within that enters. Would the God within you feel there's prosperity, success, harmony, and happiness here or not? Then go to the area in your home where you work, it can be your office. It can be a place in your dining room area, a place where you are connecting with your clients or with your company or preparing for your career. What do you see? The God comes in, does it see success, teamwork, prosperity, money flow? Or is it telling something completely different? Make some mental notes of things you feel immediately, "That is probably something I need to change." Then you keep walking and you go to your master bedroom and you walk in, you open the door. What does the God within you see? Is this a place of harmony, a place for romance? Or is it telling there's chaos, there's loneliness, there's depression here? So make some mental notes of everything you see that you immediately feel this is not the right law of attraction. And then walk back outside of your house. Look at what you see right there. Do you have a feeling you can create success? Is there space for that? Or do you feel there's chaos, some things need to be cleaned up? Make a mental note. And then bring your hands together, warm your hands. Bring them in front of your eyes, open your eyes, let go of your hands. And then take a paper and write down what are your mental notes and what do you need to go and change right away? So now I invite you to go back to the places in your home that we just were looking at in that Awareness meditation and use muscle-testing to feel how your body and your heart feels towards these images or things you felt already in your Awareness meditation that were disruptive. In the coming weeks, you also will declutter your whole home and it is actually good to keep doing the Awareness meditation to start feeling what is really affecting your mindset and your body. So keep doing this Awareness meditation. The next exercise, I call it the Five Bags exercise. It's an exercise for decluttering. You can use five bags or five boxes. So every place where we ask you to start decluttering, you can use this exercise. How does it work? Let's say you are decluttering a cabinet. You will put your five bags out. The first bag is a bag that says everything that is broken that you do not longer need anymore, you can not longer use it, you put it in there. It is to throw in the garbage. So you look in your cabinet and you go through everything and we see that something is broken or papers that you don't longer need anymore, you can put it in that bag. The second bag is a bag that you want to give things away to Goodwill. It's not broken but you don't want to longer use it anymore, but perhaps if somebody with less good fortune that can use that, you can put it in that bag. The third bag is a bag for friends and family. You look at the items and you say,"Well it's not broken. "Perhaps I don't want to really give it to Goodwill, "but there is somebody I know exactly that can use that." Make sure you have a little Post-it Note with you, and a pen, and then you put a Post-it Note on that item, and you write their name down. and that can be friends, it can be family. And then later on after decluttering, you will give them a call or an email or a text and say, "I have some gifts for you." The fourth bag is a bag to sell things. Perhaps you find this item and you're saying, perhaps you find this item or these clothes and you say, "Well, I don't know anyone that can really use it, "but perhaps I can make some money from it "if I give it to a thrift store or I sell it on eBay." And the fifth bag is the bag to keep things. So I would say that 75% of that cabinet can be in the bag to keep, but try to have at least 10 to 25% of whatever was in that cabinet to be in the other bags. And it's up to you which one you want to fill the most. This Five Bag exercise is something you can use each time you do decluttering and all the areas that we will indicate in every chapter. So your homework for this upcoming week is to go through all the exercises and to make sure you declutter your entrance. As homework, we also want you to share your Five Bag exercise and your decluttering before and after pictures of your cabinets, in the community. I'm looking forward to seeing you in the next chapter.

Week 2: The Foundation of Feng Shui for Life

====================

LESSON 4 – Your Personal Energy Number & Four Directions
--------------------
<v ->Welcome to Chapter Two.</v> Today, I'm going to teach you about your personal energy number. What is your personal energy number? When you come from the multidimensional experience as a soul here on this planet, you come in this three-dimensional world and there are certain compass directions that are stronger for you. When the Feng Shui masters start understanding more about the flow of chi, they saw that everybody reacted differently towards this universal chi that is on this planet and they started understanding that based on your birthday, there's a different flow of energy. That your purpose, your attraction to certain colors, to certain practices, how your success and money flow is, how your health and well-being unfolds, how you connect with your personal and professional relationships and which energy you're focused on to receive wisdom is different based on your personal birthday. This is what we call The Compass School. What can you do with this personal energy number? Your law of attraction will be different based on your personal energy number. You will attract different things when you have energy number one, than when you have energy number five and you can actually use this information from the moment you're born to the moment you pass on. The energy number directs you and tells you how is your chi in your life and what to activate in your home and space to manifest that one third of good luck, your earth luck to the maximum. In order to find your energy number, there is a mathematical formula. To find Your personal energy number, you can calculate a very specific formula. You can find the steps in your personal energy number book. You will see that the energy flow changes each time with the Chinese New Year. So especially people that are born in January, in February have to pay attention because it's not just a numerology based on the year of birth, it's also connected with when you are born, the day and the month. In your personal energy number book that is for free to be downloaded, you see that you need to check out when you are born based on that if you're male or female, you will have a different energy number for that year. Based on that energy number, there will be four personal directions that will be the strongest for you to activate in your home and workspace. There is a direction for your success and money flow. There is one for your health and well-being. Your third direction is about your personal and professional relationship and the fourth direction is about your wisdom and how you evolve on your spiritual path. You can of course, also connect in with the Marie Diamond app and check it out on your phone. You will learn today how to find your four best directions. So you need to stand in the center of your home or of the three major rooms, your bedroom, office and living space and from your app that you have in your hand, you will start seeing where are these four directions. South east, east, south and north. So how does your energy number influence you? Based on your energy number, there will be a different purpose about your success, money, health, relationship and wisdom. You will also understand what colors, what images, what symbols are actually supporting your earth luck based on your energy number. Now, the first thing that is important is that you always try to face when you're awake one of these four directions. So if you want to attract success and money flow, facing your success direction creates a difference in your brain state. Your mindset will open up and you will receive easier opportunities to attract success and money. Facing your health and your well-being when you're doing practices for your health will stimulate your body, your chakras and your mindset to manifest your health. When you face your personal relationship direction, when you're in meetings, even personally or professionally, it will enhance your energy in your personal and professional relationships. When you face a personal wisdom direction, this is really good when you do meditation, you pray or you do your affirmations or anything you do on your spiritual paths. In your bedroom, it is good to point your head towards one of your four good directions because it will give you a better sleep and you will see later on, we're also focusing how your front door direction is better and you create more success, health, better relationships when you're facing one of your four good directions. And then also checking in every room, what is in one of these four directions? Are the images correct? The colors correct? Will actually add up to your earth luck. So this is the basic of personal Feng Shui, making sure you face one of your four directions. You sleep towards one of your four directions and you activate in your bedroom, living room and your office, these four directions. You will open up your space to align yourself with your mindset and your destiny. Now I will give you the overview of the nine energy numbers. The first energy number is number one. We call them the wealth creator. So your purpose in life is to create wealth. To really learn how to work with money, abundance and wealth. Now it's possible you're very good in creating wealth for others but that your greatest lesson is to learn how to create wealth for yourself. There are some professional activities that most wealth creators love. Working in the financial system, accountancy, strategy around money and finances, working with stock and investments but also people that love working with wealthy people and help them to create a wealthy brand. Or even working with luxury brands, products and services. Your four best directions are south east for success is for health, south for relationships and north for wisdom. Now what are the best colors and images to place in these different areas? For your success, the south-east. It is activated with plants and lush flowers.

They only have one east direction but they have the three west directions. Each energy number gives you a purpose and what are the best activations for you in your home? So does that mean can only live together with east people or west people? No, it means that you just activate things differently. Example you have energy number one and you are a wealth creator.

====================

LESSON 5 – Test Your Four Directions
--------------------
<v ->So Lauren this is your living room</v> and your beautiful space that you have here. So we are going to check out your energy number, because based on your energy number we can check out what are your good directions. In order to do that you can calculate it personally manually, but we're going to use the Marie Diamond app for the moment. So it's going to be a little bit faster. So I need to ask you to put in your birthday right. And you can choose between male and female so I already put out female. And just put in your birthday there. <v ->Okay.</v> There we go. <v ->And then we click on find your energy number</v> and you are energy number four. And that means you are called a manager. Is that what you are doing in life? <v ->I am actually a project manager so that's correct.</v> <v ->That's perfect,</v> wonderful. So if you look at your compass you will see that north is your success direction right, and we're going to find out right away what that means in your living space. East is your relationship direction, southeast is your wisdom direction and health is your south area of this living room. <v ->Okay.</v> <v ->Okay so in order to do that</v> we're going to see where is actually north here. And north is actually pointing towards this image up there. So it is an image of strong women playing volleyball. But I don't know if you play volleyball so. <v ->Actually I don't at all so.</v> <v ->Okay but anyhow it's a strong image of powerful women.</v> Okay so let's first of all see if this is really your success direction. <v ->Okay.</v> <v ->Because your brain will react with muscle testing</v> if we point towards that area so. <v ->Okay.</v> <v ->If you can look at it,</v> yeah we're going to first check with the muscle testing. So please push up as I push down. <v ->Yes.</v> <v ->Okay so push up</v> as hard as you can okay. Now think is this my success direction so say I am successful and you look at that direction. <v ->I am successful.</v> <v ->Push up as hard as you can,</v> come on give me, yeah very good. All right I want you to look just on this area because that's northwest. Is this your success direction? So think I'm successful. <v ->I am successful.</v> <v ->You're weak,</v> you feel that? <v ->Wow yeah I do.</v> <v ->Right okay.</v> So northwest is not your direction, north is. <v ->Okay.</v> <v ->Right so I want you to look at it again</v> and see is this image good for my success? <v ->Okay.</v> <v ->Yeah so push up.</v> You know it's not super weak but. <v ->Yeah.</v> <v ->It's not really what you should be focusing on right.</v> So it's not bad but it could improve right. So we can look into what needs to happen afterwards right. And now we're going to also check your relationship direction. And if we look at the app you will see that your relationship direction is actually that area over there. So we're going to see actually how that affects you. So we're going to muscle test you to see if your body reacts to that. So if you can point look at that area and think about relationships and push as hard as you can. Push up yes very strong. So think that you will look this direction okay think about relationship. This is southwest. <v ->Wow.</v> <v ->It doesn't give you energy.</v> Now we're going to see what that area really affects you for your relationship. So keep looking at that area and think about whatever is there is this positive for my relationship energy? It's not yeah and you know why. Well first of all you have a mirror right? <v ->Yeah.</v> <v ->So a mirror what does it reflect?</v> You always have to see what is a reflection of the mirror. So then if you look at your home it actually reflects another mirror. <v ->There are two,</v> wow. <v ->So it's like bouncing back and forward right</v> and so it actually doubles the table and doubles the table I would say exponentially. <v ->It's endless yes.</v> <v ->Endlessly right.</v> But it doesn't really tell you something about relationships. So that is something I would actually suggest to remove and only have one mirror. <v ->Okay.</v> <v ->And I would remove the one in your relationship energy</v> and then you can place there images of your family, images of you if you are with a loved one already. If you have children you can put your images of your children. So everything connected with family and personal relationships because it's your personal relationship energy here, it's your living space right. Now another interesting thing is if you look outside even what is outside will affect your relationship. And you actually have some back drop there you have staircases going down. So you never want to see through the window something that slopes down in your relationship because you're actually saying my relationship go down the hill right. <v ->Oh wow.</v> <v ->So I would definitely suggest</v> instead of this small plant you have there to put like a bigger plant or to put a bigger plant outside, so we don't see from inside the living area the back drop outside. <v ->Okay.</v> <v ->So can you just imagine that we're taking this mirror away</v> and we put this beautiful plant and you put pictures there of your loved ones. Can you just imagine that? <v ->Yes, I can.</v> <v ->Okay let's do a muscle test.</v> I want you to keep looking there okay. You have that image in your mind. How is your relationship now? Push up. Wow very very strong. You feel that? <v ->Yeah I do,</v> very strong. <v ->Okay super.</v> So now we're going to check out your other directions because we have done your success and your relationship direction. But you also have actually your health direction. Yeah so your health direction if you look at the app, it is actually south. So it's actually that area over there. So let me do some testing with you. So if you look at that area there so think about health. Yeah push up as hard as you can. See you're strong you feel that? Now point that area what is actually west. So think about health, it's weak. So every other place in this area that is not your health direction, you will react weak. <v ->Oh.</v> <v ->But let's see what is there right now.</v> And you have your mirror there? right. <v ->Second one.</v> <v ->Second one.</v> And you have like a ceramic pot and some green. So it's not really telling too much. Now you could keep the mirror there if you would put on the table some lush plants. <v ->Okay.</v> <v ->Because for you south is actually the area of light</v> it's the area of plants. So everything that just creates good energy would be actually affecting you. But the mirror is always neutral unless it reflects something. So the table is fine with me but candles on the table. <v ->Oh yes.</v> <v ->That's actually really nice idea with some plants.</v> So then it reflects something positive already in the mirror. Or you take the mirror away yeah. <v ->Or that.</v> <v ->You could do that too.</v> Actually that image of these women these powerful women that are playing volleyball <v ->Yeah.</v> <v ->That could actually be a really good.</v> <v ->Well, maybe I'll switch it around.</v> <v ->Useful to swap it around.</v> You can actually swap that around yeah. <v ->Okay.</v> <v ->But the thing is</v> I wouldn't also put in your success direction right. So I think the mirrors need to find a different place. <v ->I'll just, okay.</v> <v ->Yeah but that image of the powerful,</v> strong women playing volleyball could actually be a really positive image for health. <v ->Okay.</v> <v ->Right because you keep being active, right.</v> So also what you could place there is instead of a small plant you could place a larger plant there or a light yeah. And some good colors there are green and reds and purples and roses. So you can play with that. <v ->All right, okay.</v> <v ->Yeah so can you kind of imagine</v> we're taking the mirror away we're put these powerful volleyball playing women there. We put a light there and perhaps some plant. <v ->Yes I will.</v> <v ->Just imagine</v> we're just playing with your mindset right now. So can you imagine that? And think about your health. Push up as hard as you can. Okay you're strong. Think about how it is now, whatever is there think about health. Yeah it will not affect you in a positive way okay. Now you do have a fourth direction. And a lot of people are sometimes forgetting that fourth direction and it's your wisdom direction. Now wisdom direction is all about your connection with heaven. It's all about your connection with your education, your knowledge, your motivation, your mindset. So I always want to activate that. Because it keeps you actually uplifted and motivated in life. And that if you look at your app is actually southeast for your personal energy number. And right now there is the table right but there's the window and you have a beautiful terrace there, where you have a sitting area. So what I would suggest in this case you can also activate the outside area. You don't have to only activate the inside. <v ->Inside.</v> <v ->So you could actually place in that area</v> a beautiful statue of an angel or a Buddha or anything connected with your personal religious or philosophical beliefs, you can actually place their image. But also some crystals like on that table out there, at night beautiful candle light. So this would be a perfect area for you to read to meditate, to pray. So because it's actually the southeast the wisdom direction for you personally. So if we look at this area, your wisdom direction is actually over there where the window is and your terrace. So let's check this out. So if you face that direction, think about wisdom, push up as hard as you can. Push up. Okay it feels strong. Okay so just think in that area remember that was your health direction, but let's see if this will help you for wisdom. Yeah it's not for wisdom there. <v ->Yeah.</v> <v ->It's for health,</v> because if you would face there and think about health again. Face that direction. You're getting strong okay. Push up okay. So if you look in the wisdom direction, as it is now it's kind of not telling me anything right. So that's why I've suggested to you for example to place an image outside like a Buddha or an angel, something that connects with your religious or philosophical beliefs. You could also put some crystals, some candle light. This is actually your place to mediate to pray to just read a book. You know to acknowledge your wisdom energy. So can you imagine there something, what would you place yourself there? <v ->I can totally imagine a big Buddha there.</v> <v ->Okay perhaps with some candles?</v> <v ->Some candles too.</v> <v ->Okay.</v> If you can imagine that and think about wisdom. Push up as hard as you can. Okay so you're very strong. <v ->Yes.</v> <v ->So your body really loves that idea.</v> So what we're going to do now we're going to go to your bedroom and we're going to check again for your personal energy number, your best directions over there. So let's go up to your bedroom and check this out. <v ->So this is a second guest bedroom I have.</v> I wonder if this one will be better for me to sleep in. <v ->Well that's actually a very good possibility.</v> You know I love this one too. <v ->It's nice isn't it?</v> <v ->It is.</v> So in order to really check this out we're going to look again at your app, and your birthday. So your success direction is actually north. <v ->Oh.</v> <v ->Yeah.</v> So north is actually that area. So we're going to check that if your sleeping exactly north, I think you are. So sleeping with your head, your crown chakra towards one of your focal directions actually is a plus. <v ->Okay.</v> <v ->Because it means your energy</v> you're going to be stronger in the morning when you wake up. <v ->All right.</v> <v ->And of course</v> if you would sleep towards your success direction. <v ->I will have more success in my life?</v> <v ->Then you will have new ideas,</v> new aha moments about your success at that time. So we're going to find that out later but right now it's kind of half of your bed to that corner. So also next to your bed we'll need to see if that's the good energy for you. <v ->Okay.</v> <v ->So let's do some muscle testing.</v> So hold your arm and focus towards there, and think about success. Push up as hard as you can. Okay see I can keep pushing, very strong <v ->Very strong.</v> <v ->You feel that right?</v> <v ->I do.</v> <v ->Now what is there right now?</v> There's just a plant and there's some books. It doesn't really say anything. But think about success yeah. Is this good whatever is there for me? It's not so strong. <v ->It isn't.</v> Could it be because the plant is fake, could that be the reason? <v ->No actually it's because a plant what is green</v> in the north is not a good area. <v ->Oh.</v> <v ->So plants are better for south,</v> south east and south. So good energy there is white, is metal, it's blues, it's water. We never really want water in your bedroom right. <v ->Exactly yeah.</v> <v ->So but think about what you would put there</v> books on success or books that motivate you. Even your journal you know <v ->That's a good one.</v> <v ->That when you wake up in the morning</v> you want to put your journal in there. So that's actually really good for there. <v ->Okay I'll imagine that.</v> <v ->Okay so can you imagine that?</v> Think about that push up. Okay now you're strong again. <v ->I can feel it yes.</v> <v ->You can feel that?</v> <v ->Yes.</v> <v ->Okay very good.</v> <v ->I will get some books.</v> <v ->So let's go and check out</v> if you're sleeping in the right direction. <v ->Okay.</v> So if you would love to lay down on this side of the bed. Okay. Because if we look at the app, you're still just slightly in the north yes. So don't cross your feet okay. Hold your arm and you push up this way as hard as you can. So think about that direction, close your eyes for a second as you would be asleep. Is this good for your success? Push up as hard as you can. Yeah you feel? You're very strong. So energetically it's a good direction for you to sleep. Now I would love to check if you're good on the other side because I think you're just off. <v ->Just off the north.</v> <v ->The north.</v> So if you could go over there yeah. <v ->Actually I sleep on this side</v> so maybe I need to switch around and see. <v ->Let's check yeah.</v> So let's check if this is a good area for you to sleep. So you push up okay, push as hard as you can. Your body's weak. <v ->No it isn't.</v> <v ->It is not right.</v> <v ->Wow.</v> <v ->Now it's possible</v> that this is a good area for your loved one right. <v ->Right.</v> <v ->The one you're in a relationship with.</v> And of course if that person has an energy number two, five, six, seven and eight northwest would be one of his good directions. So in that case that it would be good, but for you that area is strong, so that's where you're going to sleep. <v ->I will.</v> <v ->Okay because you have two things</v> that are good here for you. You have the door that you see, so when you wake up you always want to see the door and you're sleeping in the right direction for yourself. Yeah so you could feel that difference right? <v ->I did.</v> Is it not a problem that it's close to the windows and it's a door that opens? <v ->Well yes it is actually a door that opens</v> but people don't come through that door right. <v ->That's true.</v> <v ->People come through the door from the hallway.</v> <v ->All right.</v> <v ->I would probably suggest</v> to make sure you take the blinds down especially when there's a lot of moonlight because moonlight can kind of create a little bit of disturbances energetically and emotionally. So definitely make sure that is down. And you can keep the window open if you want and that's all fine. <v ->Fresh air.</v> <v ->It's just people are not coming into that area.</v> <v ->That's true okay.</v> <v ->Now another thing that is really interesting here</v> and especially also for your health there is a beam over here. Now the beam is not above your head or above your body, your torso but it's kind of above your knees and even more this area. So it's quite high so that's a good thing. It's a least two meter or like six feet high. So it won't affect you that much. But if you start having issues with this part of your body it means the beam was like a cutting edge it's like an ax it cuts all the time. <v ->Wow.</v> <v ->Every night yeah.</v> And the lower the beam is the lower it cuts the aura fields right. <v ->Okay it's good to know yeah.</v> <v ->So be careful about that.</v> What you can do make sure you keep it in the same color as the ceiling so it kind of blends in. If you start having issues there make sure you take like a fabric and kind of cover it. So it kinds of blends in and it doesn't feel like this cutting edging energy yeah. Just I want to let you know be careful about this. <v ->I will.</v> <v ->Okay.</v> <v ->Yeah I'll get some nice fabric indeed.</v> <v ->Yeah just white in the same color as the ceiling.</v> Yeah so it kind of blends in. <v ->Perfect.</v> <v ->But most of the time it doesn't affect people</v> within the first year, but the lower the beams are the faster it affects them, especially if the beam is more towards this part of the body. <v ->Yeah.</v> <v ->Okay so I'm going to do a little muscle testing on that</v> so look at these beams and think about this part of your body right. <v ->Yes should I close my eyes?</v> <v ->You can open your eyes it's fine.</v> So think about how does that feel there. See? <v ->Wow.</v> <v ->Very weak.</v> <v ->It's very weak.</v> <v ->It already energetically affects you</v> but of course you're a healthy young woman it won't affect you that fast. But I have seen a lot of bad results with beams over the body. <v ->Okay.</v> <v ->Okay so now I would like to check the romantic energy</v> of this bedroom because that's really important right? So when we look at your compass we see that for your energy number the east is your relationship direction and from the center of this room the east is actually this area. <v ->Okay.</v> <v ->So you have a sofa there</v> I think that's kind of cool that's nice. But that image right? That image is really not good because if you look at it, it's a landscape with one tree right? <v ->I know but I love that one.</v> <v ->Oh I understand but it's actually not so good.</v> So let's check it out right. <v ->All right.</v> <v ->So may I have your arm okay.</v> So look that direction, think about relationship just direction wise push up as hard as you can. Okay so think about what is there right now. <v ->Right.</v> <v ->Think about the image how is that image doing?</v> Push up as hard as you can. You know see it's not <v ->Not a good image for me okay.</v> <v ->I'm sorry I cannot give this one right.</v> <v ->It's okay.</v> <v ->So this is for example</v> an image you could put in a health direction right because it's a tree. I wouldn't even put it in a success direction to be honest because it's just oh, it's not lush enough. So this could be in any direction that's not one of your four directions yeah. <v ->Okay.</v> <v ->But there I would like you to have an image</v> of you and your loved one right. <v ->That's really good actually.</v> <v ->I would not even put the family pictures up there.</v> <v ->Just the two of us.</v> <v ->Just the two of you</v> because let's say you have the whole family there you don't want the family to be around in your bedroom. <v ->Yeah bedroom is like</v> <v ->Definitely not the mother in law right?</v> So I just would make sure make it very personal and you also can work with some because it's east some green colors would be really good for you. <v ->All right.</v> <v ->Yeah</v> <v ->Some plants maybe?</v> <v ->Some plants</v> you can actually do some fake plants it's in a bedroom. In a bedroom we don't want too much live plants because it actually is not so positive. But you can do fake plants as long as you see it's like a really good fake, because the mind doesn't see the difference <v ->Oh really?</v> <v ->Between the real and the fake</v> because the mind sees first of all it's a plant right? <v ->Yeah.</v> <v ->Even if you know it right.</v> But I also would add for example in this area because it's really over there in that corner, for example two pink or rose candles that you can burn at night before you go to sleep. Just having that. <v ->Maybe scented ones even.</v> <v ->The scented ones yeah they will be lovely.</v> And so I said you can green you can also do some light blue. So that's actually really good energy here. And now you have some gray colors, one orange again it's like <v ->It matches with the chairs</v> <v ->It does match with the chairs.</v> You can do the orange but then I would add some green ones to it too. <v ->Okay.</v> <v ->It will be actually nicer.</v> Can you just now imagine an image of you and your beloved one and the colors and like this candles there yeah? <v ->Yes I can.</v> <v ->All right so close your eyes imagine that</v> and think about romance. Push up as hard as you can. Yeah very strong. Think about as it is now. Open your eyes and see what it is now and there we go. Weak again right. <v ->Okay I'll change that for sure.</v> <v ->Okay.</v> This is definitely an important piece. If you choose to be in this bedroom, I would actually change things around a little bit. Now you also have your health direction and when I look at your health direction here this actually the image of Frida Kahlo and she's a powerful woman for sure. If that would be in your success direction I would say yes. She was famous right, She made her dreams come true international renowned even after her passing on. But health wise, she really suffered quite a bit in her life. <v ->That's true.</v> <v ->And so for health I would not place that there.</v> So let's just check out if that direction south is a good direction for you. Okay for health push up as hard as you can yeah push harder come on, show me some strength. Okay now look at the image of Frida, is this image going to activate your health? Look at it, you know it's not. <v ->It's not at all I can feel it.</v> <v ->Right you can feel it right away in your body.</v> Even before I pushed you could feel it right? <v ->Yes I could, I could.</v> <v ->So that could be an image where you could place flowers,</v> plants something just very active but not too active because you're in a bedroom. <v ->Yes I won't sleep at night.</v> <v ->You won't sleep at night,</v> so think about your volleyball playing women. <v ->Yes.</v> <v ->That's not something you want in here.</v> You don't want any other women in the bedroom with but also make sure that it's too active. So I would go with an image of flowers, an image of nature but again no water right. <v ->Okay.</v> <v ->Yeah so can you just imagine</v> a beautiful image of flowers? <v ->Okay.</v> <v ->Yeah push up as hard as you can.</v> That's much stronger. <v ->I feel it yeah.</v> <v ->Yeah you can feel that?</v> <v ->And it sounds really nice too.</v> <v ->Yeah so I would definitely place her</v> perhaps even downstairs in your success direction. If you're more focused towards art and creativity that is actually a strong image for you in the north. <v ->I'd love that.</v> <v ->Yeah I think that would be really powerful.</v> All right.

LESSON 6 – Activate Your Four Pillars of Light

- Your exercise for this week is to define your personal energy number and to learn about your personal directions for success, health, relationship and wisdom. Your second exercise it's called the 4 Pillars Meditation. I'll First invite you to sit in the direction facing your wisdom direction. So you connect in with your yellow pillar and connect in with your spiritual, strong energy then close your eyes and take a deep breath in and take a deep breath out. And as you breathing in, fill your whole body and your aura field with this bright white light coming from the universe and activating your energy. And as you breathe in, visualize that light to go deep into every cell of your body and to fill up your whole aura field an arm link all around you and above you. And as you take a deep breath out, release any tension or stress you might have. Visualize and around is to provide light, the tube of royal blue energy that creates power and protection around you. And imagine that tube of royal blue energy to be all around you as high as your arms can stretch and also under your feet. Take a deep breath in and take a deep breath . Visualize now around this royal blue tube of light, the color rose and the rose stands for love and support. And imagine that tube of rose light goes up as high as you can imagine into the universe, connecting in with all the spiritual support and love for you. And then around you and under your feet connecting with the love and support of the earth. Take a deep breath in and take a deep breath out. Imagine then the violet light coming from under your feet, clockwise spinning through your physical body and your whole aura field, going up into the universe and by using the power of forgiveness, you release all your limiting beliefs, thoughts and feelings. And take a deep breath in, and take a deep breath out . Imagine now you have a magical hat on and the top of your magical hat has this bright white light. It's an arm length above your physical head. From that point out now, we're going to use the four colors of your four pillars to activate your directions. The first color we're going to use is the color for success; Royal blue, royal blue stimulates the power of the universe within you and around you. Knowing your personal success direction. Imagine now from the top of your magical hat, you received this royal blue energy feeling your whole body, your whole aura field accepting that you're a powerful creator of success and abundance. And then from the top of your magical hat, you set this royal blue vibration out into your success direction of your home, into the success direction of your bedroom, of your office, of your living room. Activating it energetically for success and abundance. Take a deep breath in, and take a deep breath out . Reconnecting with your quantum point, the top of your magical hats. And you connect in now with the color emerald green, which is the strongest color for health, and fill your whole body and your aura field up with that emerald green vibration. And from the top of your magical hat, send out to emerald green energy towards your personal health direction in your home, your bedroom, your living space and your office blessing it with universal healing. Take a deep breath in and take a deep breath out , reconnecting with the top of your magical hats and from there we connect in with the color rose that stands for universal love and fill your whole body and your aura field with this loving rose vibration, accepting it to deep into yourselves. And now from the top of your magical hat, send out this rose light to your personal relationship direction in your bedroom, living space and office to create loving relationships both in your personal and professional life. Take a deep breath in , and take a deep breath out reconnecting with the top of your magical hats. We'll call in now to color yellow that stands for wisdom and fill your whole body and your aura fields with this universal wisdom vibration, then reconnecting with the top of your magical hat and sent out yellow energy to your personal wisdom direction in your bedroom, living space and office. So you will have a stronger connection with your spiritual self and receive spiritual support. Take a deep breath in , and take a deep breath out . I imagine you're on the top of your magical hats and we're calling in the color gold and we visualize it all around you that is like a golden dome coming down, connecting in with the heart, manifesting with perfection your success, health, relationship and wisdom energy in yourself and in your home. Take a deep breath in and out, bring your hands together, move your hands, bring your warm hands in front of your eyes. Open gently your eyes and let go off your hands. I share with you this 4 Pillar Meditation so you will be actually ready to activate your directions in your home, your office, your office, your bedroom, and your living space by connecting in in meditation by the best colors for dissections, it will be easy for you to start doing your functional way and optimize your four best of actions.

LESSON 7 – Q&A with Marie Diamond

Hi, everyone. Good morning, good afternoon, or good evening. Whatever the case might be for you, I know that we are truly an international crowd here tonight. I was just throwing to the chat box there, and it's wonderful to see all of you coming here and joining as a group. I am Alex. On behalf of the Mindvalley team, I would like to welcome you to your Feng Shui live Q &A coaching call number. We have a great session prepared for you today. We have very interesting topics that we'll cover, mainly belonging to the first two chapters of your course. And I believe you'll get a lot of great insights from tonight's session. That being said, and without further ado, let's welcome our wonderful and inspiring teacher on this journey, Marie Diamond. Hello, Marie. Hello. It's so wonderful to be with all of you. I'm so excited. I have been checking out Facebook. I've seen your enthusiasm and I've seen also wonderful results already. And that is just amazing. So I'm super happy we have this live call. So thank you to the Mindvalley team that we can be in touch. Definitely also really. here together. And, you know, I know some of you have already decluttered like crazy. I mean, that's like, I see the before and after pictures and I'm like, wow, super, right? I know some of you have been really working with your energy number already activating some of the things in your home. you already have felt a shift, right? A shift, some of you in your success, some of you in attracting different clients, just how you feel in your home. So I've been really watching all the, in my very busy schedule in travel, I've been really trying to get on the Facebook and I've been like, wow, amazing. I just love it. So today we're going to go into the questions and answers. So the team will help me to find out the best. questions, but I would like to set kind of the tone. And so I would love for you if you, you know, just could close your eyes for a second, right? And take a deep breath in and take a deep breath out. I know your life is busy, but let's focus on becoming peaceful and in harmony. And just imagine you in a beautiful space in nature. An open space. And you feel the breeze of the wind. It's like a perfect temperature. It's like around you. And it moves the energy around you. And close by, there's a little waterfall or a little creek or a river. And you hear the sound of the water. And you totally relax with it. And you feel the groundedness of the earth. You feel your feet on the earth. Or when you're sitting down, you feel that in your body. And feel the support and the warmth of the earth below you. And you feel the sun shining on you. The warmth of the fire of the sun. Just perfect temperature. You are the one visualizing, so you can choose your own temperature. And then imagine you're surrounded by flowers and trees and nature. And just feel like you can smell the nature and you feel the beauty and the harmony of nature around you. So we're connecting with water, the element water, the element air that stands for metal, the element earth, the element fire. That's the heat of the sun and the element wood from nature. And feel these five elements all around you and feel how you centralize your energy in your heart. You take a deep breath in and feel you're centering your energy in your heart right now, in your heart chakra. And from your heart, we're sending out now. like a ray of vibration, a ray of light, an energy ray, and we're connecting it in with everyone that's on the call now or will be listening. We're connecting in with this Feng Shui for Life tribe from our hearts to everyone now and in the future listening. Knowing that we're all on a journey to transform our lives, our success, our health, our relationships, our wisdom. We're sending now and we're creating this connection from heart to heart. Take a deep breath in and take a deep breath out. Beautiful. Focus again on your place in nature. Bring your hands together. Warm your hands. Bring your warm hands in front of your eyes. Gently open your eyes and let go of your hands. And now we're ready to listen to the questions. I feel better already. Let's see here. First of all, before we get started with the question, let me first acknowledge all the people that have submitted questions for this session. We got around 100 questions for this session alone. So Marie, how is your schedule for the next six to eight hours? I am free. Okay, wonderful. So guys, just as I mentioned, I offer the four criteria that we pick questions. We'll try to make them relevant for this chapter. I saw a lot of questions that I know that belong to future chapters. So I know that the excitement is big and everybody wants to know and they want to learn a lot. But do be patient because we have several other chapters coming up and many of the things that you asked about will be addressed in the content. in the training session, in the practical session for those things. So that being said, let's get started with our first question here in the queue. And it comes from Diane. I sometimes feel that my own bias towards an object changes the outcome of my self -testing. How can I ensure clear and unbiased testing? That's a very good question. So the first thing I always say to me, before you test, make sure you do your tubes of light. Because when you do your tubes of light, you're actually not in your personality anymore. You're not in your emotions. emotional and mental attachments. So when you're connecting with the top of your magical hat, you actually go into a field of observation. So that's the first thing I would like you to do, to go there. And by doing this and then testing, you will actually not be so affected by your own subconscious or personal story about an item or about like a painting or an image. So that's the first thing. Another thing that helps with testing is to do it. at a moment when you're, you know, very much in peace. So don't do it like when you just come rushing from home or you're rushing to your journey of that day. So just relax first a little bit, you know, have a cup of nice tea. I wouldn't do the coffee, to be honest. It's just some tea, some water. Make sure you don't eat too much sugar before your test because it actually is not helpful for your brain. have a clear answer. So it's not like after having a cake or something or a tart in the afternoon, that's not the best time to test. So the more clear you are, drink some water before you test so that there's a clarity about you. So that's what I would suggest. And as you're testing, say even to yourself, I'm testing for clarity. So it's like you're programming yourself and say, I'm not just want to know if it's, I like this object or not. It's about clarity if this is good for your feng shui. So ask the question, say, you know, I really set the intention. I want really to have clarity about this. And so that will be helpful. Also make sure a really important piece, try to test facing one of your good directions. So when you face one of your good directions and you do your testing, even if it's personal, like for yourself or somebody else's testing, face a good direction because then your brainwave is an alpha brainwave and you're more in an observant mode. If you face a wrong direction for you, your testing is more likely to be off. So these are some good tips. I see a follow -up question here. How do you discover your best direction? So I think you all have access to a PDF about your energy number book, right? So it's actually based on your birthday to find your energy number. And it's not just like numerology that you have to add like the digits of your birthday. That's how it works. There's a formula. And the formula for people born before 2000 is different even than the formula. after 2000 and it's different formula for men and women and it's actually I think described in it but you can look at the list right you can look at that and you can also go to the app and fill in the Mary Diamond app you can actually fill in your birthday and then click on it and then you see your number so you can go to your extra pdf file that you received and then look at the list and so every number connects with four good directions one for success one for health one for relationship and one for wisdom and so you look at the list or you can go to the app yeah i do not identify with my personal number so this is a general question several of you ask this so this is the general topic i do not identify with my personal number for example my personal number is six which suits me though i think which not suits me, though I think nine or two would be a better fit for me. My partner is a nine. He's a healer, which is not him at all. What's happening here? How can we view this situation? First of all, the energy number is an indication for your four best directions, right? So put aside the archetype. This is actually the connection. The number gives you the four good directions and they are accurate and they will work for you. Now, when we looked deeper into what the archetype is, so I actually went with the success direction. So if your success direction and you have energy number nine, your success direction is east. The people from the east are called generally the healers. That doesn't mean that this will be your business or what you share about in your life, but it means that there is a purpose in your soul. when you came to this planet, through whatever you do to bring a healing frequency. This is about vibrations and energy. For example, I'm a five, right? I'm a connector, right? Now, I'm not really focused on marketing. You know, this is like the marketeers and so on. But one of the practices of the five is they love working with people. They love working with homes, right? That is actually where the connection is, you know, I can connect things with each other. And the words that are connected with this energy number and your archetype, that means these are strong words for you, right? But it's not just your success direction. Like, it also means that your health, your relationship and wisdom direction are an indication. Not just for your health and relationship, but for who you are. So we just put it as a name. So don't get stuck on that name that we gave you, right? But I'll give you an example. There was somebody and she was a top marketing person, right? And she had energy number nine. And she said, but Maria, don't do anything with healing. But everyone she was talking to always felt like when they had talked to her, they felt uplifted. And when she was about 50, 55, she suddenly became very interested in healing modalities. And she said, now I finally understood. It's like I needed to connect. And she did the feng shui. And then something from her soul started unfolding. Right. And she started understanding I needed to really connect with that healing modality because it's part of her soul. So it's possible from your as a personality, you do other choices, but there is a soul purpose behind it. Yeah. So don't get stuck on that. Right. You know, I'm not a manager. I'm at number four, but I'm actually a really good manager. So I'm also a really good healer, but I'm not number nine. So don't get stuck on that. First of all, it gives an indication how your feng shui energy works. And then let it just unfold and you will see some things will start unfolding because you're activating your feng shui. How does the personal number and direction work when two people in the same house have different directions that are best for them? How to combine the right direction for two people with different numbers in order to still create harmony. Yes. So let's say you have two partners, right? And one has an energy number. That's what we call an east group. So energy number one, four, one, four, three, and nine. And the others have a west direction. And that means they have energy number two, five, six, seven, and eight. So they have complete different compass direction combination. The east group will go with a combination of south, east, southeast, and north. That's why they call east because they have most of them east. Others, the two, five, six, seven, and eights, they have a combination of west, northwest, southwest, and northeast. So they have all the west directions. So what do you do? In that case, how do you bring harmony? Well, the first thing you can do is you just look at your number and you activate your four directions. So for, let's say, energy number nine, they look at, okay, the east is their success direction. They will, in their bedroom, in their office, in their living room, the places we are indicating in the course, they will look at that direction from the center of that room and place some things connected with that for that person. So I'll give you an example. My husband is Northwest, right? So he loves cars, right? So in his success direction, we put something with cars. Now, once you place that there, also put the intention and say it is to activate this person, right? I have another direction. So when I put it in my direction, I put there the activation and said it is for Marie. So you activate it with the intention for who it is. So this is how it is possible that you have four directions you're activating and then the other four directions are for your partner. So that's the first thing. The second thing is a lot of people are getting a little bit upset when they're like seeing like, oh my God, you know, we're sleeping. Let's say facing west with your head. And for one person, it's good. And for the other person, it's not. And they're saying, do I have to get bunk beds or have a different bed or something? No, you don't. So you will see when you measure the foot end of your bed, looking at your headboard, it can be that it's good for one person. And the other person, it's not good. Now, you cannot have perfect feng shui. It's impossible. Once that happens, then you make sure you look at other areas. For example, your front door. You stand in your front door, in your frame of your front door with a compass, and you face out. You face out into the world. That means into the garden, towards the street. If you're in an apartment, you face out in the hallway of the building, not looking inside into your space. And when you're there, you look at which is a good direction. right it's possible again it's a good direction for one person and not for the other person and what you do then if it's the front door is good for one person make sure the bed direction is good for the other person let's say it's an east facing front door and you can put the bed to the west area and still see the door then the two partners have both something they have something what we call day feng shui it's a front door and night feng shui the bed it's still possible they're both facing good for one direction and still not for the other person in that case i would like you to look at the desk direction so when you're sitting at your desk like i'm at my desk right now i'm facing out towards the direction Check that out and make sure that the desk direction, the place where the person works is good for that person. So that's why it's sometimes good to have two desks so that, you know, the workspace is always good for you personally. It's easier to change a desk than to change a bed because for a bed and a bedroom, you don't always have so much possibilities, right? You cannot just change your front door. Right. But desk is easy to change. Another place where you can work on is in your living room. Yeah. When you, for example, watch television or you have, you know, you talk to each other, make sure in the living space on the sofa, you both are facing a good direction. So because, you know, you're watching perhaps two, three hours a day television or you're talking together, at least you're facing a good direction there, even on the dining room table. Check out when you're eating that you're facing a good direction. So to have 24 hours a day a good direction is barely not possible. But to have at least five to eight hours a day a good direction will create major change. So it could be a front door. Each time you open your door. That's always good. Your front door is a good direction. It gives you 10 % boost. If your bedroom is a good direction, it gives you a 10 % boost of energy. And then if that doesn't work, you look at your desk direction because you're working there five to eight hours. You have some social life in your living room. Face your good direction if you can. At the dining room, face your good direction. So you add the hours of facing your good direction. And the more you have, the better it works. I am sometimes sitting in a space that I cannot face my perfect direction, right? And that's fine. Then I try to make sure I sleep the good direction, right? Or I eat towards the good direction. So literally when I'm going on a lunch, I have my app with me and, you know, they have like a boot and I take my app and I'm making sure that that hour I face my good direction. That's an hour extra that my brain is into alpha vibration. Plus, if that all doesn't work, you need to make sure you activate your four good directions as much as possible in your living space, in your workspace, in your office. Because even if you're not facing the good direction, activating your four directions does boost your energy. So I hope that's kind of a clear answer for all of you. I'm curious how you work with this. If your spouse and your children live in the same house, how do we respect all occupants within the home and their own direction when it comes to feng shui needs? Okay. So the parents are the major people in a house, especially in the living room. right and the front door because you are the breadwinners so you're bringing uh the good luck the success the money into the house you're responsible for the children so in the living room i always say on the entrance the offices focus on the breadwinners the parents right for the children focus in their own room for their four directions, that they're sleeping the right direction, that their little desk when they're working on is facing a good direction. So focus in their own bedroom. And then a good thing you can also do is take one picture of your child and in the living room, put that picture of that child in their success direction. Hang it or place it there. So that's what I do with my children. And so what I have seen, because I activate them also to be in the living space, they love the living space. Even if it's focused on my husband and me, I also make sure they are present. And I always update that picture, meaning I don't keep the picture of them when they're babies, even if they're already grownups. You know, I just tell them, you're not a baby to me, you're a grownup, right? So I update these pictures. I always make sure there's a family picture. right in the the living room so that they know we're welcome in that space so they don't like go to their bedroom all the time so the children focus in their bedroom parents you know you need to really focus on because you're the ones that hold the energy for your children so focus in the living room and your office of course your own bedroom focus there for you as a couple from cheryl uh when in a relationship how would we balance that colors and objects in joint living spaces to benefit both our energy numbers? One of the things I've seen, and we go a little bit deeper into it in the next sessions, but when there's a lot of difference, and you will see people that have energy number one, three, four, and nine, they will have, when, for example, partners have these two numbers, like numbers connect with the east, They will more likely attract the same colors and people that have or West people are two five six seven and eight They have more likely an interest to the same colors But what I always suggest to people is to find and when you have different numbers and different choice of colors is to make sure that in a living space, for example, in a bedroom space, to work as a major tone with earth colors. So earth colors could be beiges, could be yellows, it could be a warm peach and orange and like tans. So they could actually be more earth colors because earth always balance everything. Yeah, because the... Other four elements, right, like fire element, water, metal, and wood, they all are connected with the earth. It's all happening on the earth, right? So earth elements always balance things out. So as neutral colors, like if I look at your background right now, you know, Alexa, you actually have earth colors there. Right. So that is always in the living room, a really good combination. And then in the personal directions, work more with the colors that work with them. Yeah. So for their success direction or the health direction, then look at these things. And, you know, if you feel like I would like to have a combination of certain colors, muscle test both partners on these color combinations. Yeah. I remember this one. couple and she loved very much oranges and he loved very much greens. And so they actually tested themselves out with the color map, you know, like with, you know, Adobe colors or whatever, Pantone colors, and they checked out and muscle tested till they found the perfect combination for each other. So that both she loved that kind of green and both what he loved as oranges. So make sure you just test because your body is your compass. Your body knows what is best for you. So check out the colors that work for the whole family. If you want to change something around and you like saying, well, I want to add some more blues and it's in the living room, test out the parents and test out the children because if the children don't like the color, they won't come into that living room a lot. So test everybody out. That's why you have muscle testing. My partner and I have the same personal energy number. Will one set of energy objects be useful for both of us? What would be the disadvantages of this, if any? You can definitely put some symbols up if you have the same number that are more general, like a crystal or a candle or an image that is more general. But I still would if... Like for success, you have perhaps different goals that you have about success. Let's say you have books that you want to place there, a book on success. I would still take that book or a symbol that is more personal for you, like a certification or a product that you are bringing forward in the world. Take that and place it and put it with your intention. It is good for this person. yeah the intention setting is really really important it's not just placing something but there are some symbols that are more general like the crystals and you know wind chimes and things like this but if it's something more person related i would put the intention said this is for this person and this book is for this person yeah so you can actually do that and when you have it in the same area let's say you put a cabinet out there, like a little table, then the things that work for that person, I would kind of put that more separate, yeah, and make some space between the two and then make a little bit of a creation for the other person. So don't mix the objects, right? So because otherwise it's like the universe can't really read it. So say like, let's say you have a bookcase in that area and I say, well, this area of the bookcase is for that person. And this area of the bookcase is for the other person. And you really put the intention and you can even put a picture of you there so that universe can read it because you remember you are the universe that is reading it. Yeah. And so if it's kind of all. through each other, then there's a chaos in your own head and the universe will not respond so easily. How do we use Feng Shui when the room or structure itself is working against us? For example, my bedroom has a door facing east, is south and window facing north. How do you overcome the challenge of the structure itself? Well, sometimes indeed the format of a place is really interesting, right? So you're sometimes missing corners. You are, it's like, you know, slanted or it's just, it's not straight. The best format is always a square or rectangular format. So if you move in a future home, make sure that, you know, the best for harmony is. square or rectangular form, but sometimes it's not like that. So in that case, you just place your activations as close as possible to that area, right? And in order to make and have a feeling of the square or the rectangular energy, because if you have square and rectangle, it means that all the compass directions are represented in it. If you are missing a corner, you're missing an area. So what you can do is even work with crystals, right? And small crystals, they don't have to be big, like a crystal is kind of that big, a quartz crystal, white quartz crystal, and putting them in the four corners and like creating with the crystals like a square or rectangular energy, right? So that's a possibility. Again, feng shui is not something that can be perfect, you know? I have lived in many houses in my life and never had perfect feng shui. But it's not about having perfect feng shui. It's about activating what you can. So it's possible that a certain area is not so good and you can activate it like in your bedroom. But then you can, for example, are not able to activate your success direction because there's a window in your health direction, in your success direction in your bedroom. Well, then activate it in your... living space activated in your office. I always say if at least you're staying in a place, sleeping, working, or living five to eight hours in an area that is activated, your energy is boosted and you start feeling so much better. I remember I was staying in a home and My health direction in my bedroom, I just could not really activate. It was impossible there. So I made sure I activated in my office area. I was there eight hours a day, right? So I had to be healthy to work, right? So you cannot do it always perfect, but you do as much as you can because it's already going to be better than it was before. Oh, that's wonderful. I think you touched on a very interesting subject here because I know that I'm also checking the chat and seeing the 100 questions that were being posted. It's about this desire of activating everything in one place because I see it's mostly probably some form of like fear of missing out or the perfection complex as in I want to do everything perfect in every room. Can you touch a little more on this subject? Yeah. I'm very, very happy that you want to do so much activations, right? You really want to change your life. So that's amazing. But, you know, some of you already have seen just by decluttering, you know, that the energy started flowing. So when we activate, we redirect the flow. The first thing is you have to open the space, right? So, you know, chi, as I shared it in Facebook, it's like water. So the chi is a moving vibration. So it's not stagnant. So that's why we decluttered first, because we needed to get all the rocks out of the river that stops the flow of the water. That's why we're decluttering. And then what we want to do with Feng Shui, we want to direct the flow. We want to direct the river in a direction that is good for you, that will enhance your life. you start redirecting the energy but you have to understand each time you place something in a different direction the river moves and it moves but it's sometimes a big river that you want to move so you you have to understand if you have this river and you just say suddenly I move it 90 degrees opposite right it's like the river goes a little bit in chaos and the river is you who is you know in the river yeah in the river of the energy and that's why sometimes people feel um you know reactions you know some chaos right because you you're so used to to flow in a certain direction right and it's it became comfortable even if it was not good the direction of the flow of chi you were you became comfortable in it we are I say always we're comfortable in whatever it is because we accept it as a rule. It's as an energy. So if we move the energy and we can move fast like this to a whole other area, our whole body goes a little bit like, oh, this is too much, right? That's why some of you have some reaction of partners and family. They're like, oh, what are you doing here, right? I remember when I did that for the first time and I just changed everything around. really my husband was ready to throw me out he was super super angry right so then I understood that it's not about moving everything at once it's about moving gently you know be gentle with yourself so you start activating and feel what it does to you yeah it's not about like taking this river and just change the river around It's about gently saying to the river, okay, I'm going to move you, I'm going to move you, and this is ultimately the good direction. So, you know, you're forcing the energy. It will actually create a little bit of backlash to some people, especially if they're very sensitive. So that's why we have an eight -week program, right? That's why we're going steady, you know, steps. Do this now this week. Then do this week. Because I know what the moving of the river is going to do for you. And some of you will have, just by moving little things, will immediately have a huge positive reaction. And some of you will only feel the difference when the river has changed completely after eight weeks. And even a few weeks after that. Because you have to get out of your comfort zone. So trying to do it perfectly. swing things around, your body will not react that well. And definitely your personality, your ego will not react well because your ego will go in, whoa, this is too much. You will go in resistance. You don't want that. Feng Shui is something that is very gently and loving, right? So don't force the Qi. you know move the chi gently and that's why i'm saying like if you feel like to do the clutter today just do it if you feel to do it tomorrow you do it tomorrow so i know you guys are so enthusiastic to move the energy that is amazing but be gentle How do you recommend maximizing the Feng Shui in a room or house when you cannot move the furniture to suit your personal energy needs or make any significant changes in general? For example, you're renting for an extended period of time, you are having an Airbnb, student dorms, or nomadic work life, etc. I wonder if there are some general workarounds for such situations. Well, hey, you speak to the expert on that because I am a nomadic. I'm a gypsy, right? I'm moving all the time around. And I lived in so many houses, so many countries. So the first thing I do, like I just arrived yesterday in Minneapolis, right? So the first thing I do, I have a little what I call my feng shui kit, right? So I have pictures of my family, yeah? And I take them out and I check with the app. you know over the compass which is my my relationship direction i put there the pictures i always have post -it notes with me right and the post -it notes i put some you know, things I really want to focus on for the days I'm, for example, here in Minneapolis, right? So people I want to meet and the outcome I have. And I stick this information in my relationship direction. I have some goals or have some, even I have some business cards of the people I want to meet. I put them in my relationship direction. So the same thing is I, um in my success direction have some goals i always have some books from me or some products that i have with me um you know right now i have a little um i actually printed out a logo of mind valley right so i i put that actually in my success direction as i'm traveling going through this course right so i put that there In my success direction, I just put it there. I don't put it on the ground because putting things on the ground, it's like you are not seeing it. It's not so connected with you. So I put it on the chair or I put my suitcase there and I put it on my suitcase. So I adapt that. And also in a hotel room or an Airbnb I'm sometimes in, I make sure I try to sleep the right direction. i sometimes really move the bed around i do or i i sleep you know in an angle on my bed right because i feel so much different if i activate as much as i can so um this is one of the things you do always as much as you can but having your feng shui kit with you right the things and Put just post -it notes out and you already are helping. And even on post -it notes, I just put success or I am success or I am wisdom or I am held. And I just stick them out. You know what? I'm going to try to, in the coming days, take a little video of how I do it and post it because it's really fun to do that. So you cannot always change things around, but you can put your intentions out with small steps. It was later on in the queue, but since you touched on this, I see also a lot of questions here. They're going around the concept of decluttering, but the main point of this is pictures. what is your view on pictures around the house? And let me just elaborate a little bit more because I see here is like, how do you view pictures with your loved ones? Do you keep all their pictures in the house? Should those be eliminated? Should you keep only recent pictures? What about family, extended family, friends, the concept of pictures in general? Yeah, there are several rules I want to go deeper into. So first of all, you have your personal relationship direction, right? So pictures of family and friends, and I'm speaking about extended family, not like your spouse or partner or wife and your children and grandchildren. So like the more, you know, extended family and friends, I would not put them in their bedroom or in your office. I would put them in your living space. I would not be... with that it's better to try to get some pictures where you are like with a lot of people together it you have to understand it's a symbol not everybody has to not all your friends and all your family have to be on these pictures it's like it's an indication that you welcome your friends and family into your living room you don't want them into your bedroom right that's too crowded that so that's the first thing for your children I would definitely try to use some of the pictures in your living room space, try to update them as much as possible. But I have like, sometimes I just make a collage, you know, like you have like now collage where you can put different pictures in where I can kind of see them growing up and from a baby to where they are right now. Right. And I have some of the collages for my children. and I put them actually and hang them out in their success direction in the living space. Sometimes that's not even possible. And then I make like one big collage. I buy this, you know, format where you can put all these pictures in. And I put it in the relationship direction of me or for my husband. Yeah. Where all my children and all my family, like all the ones I really love and are dear to me, I put them in my living space. Now, I do have a picture of my children in my personal relationship direction in my... but like one picture because I don't want too many of my children come in my bedroom right this is the space for me and my partner right so that's where I really focus on romance okay so I will definitely not hang my mother -in -law you know I adore her I totally adore her in my bedroom no way right so you have to understand you know the the focus and the goal of the space right So some people will say, well, I still have so much more pictures. Right. Well, then use your hallway. Yeah. Your hallways is like it's it's go through your house. So if you have more pictures, you can hang them in your hallway. So because it creates flow and. People, pictures of people, it always creates happiness anyhow to see that, right? Now, if you don't want a lot of people to come to your home, then don't hang too many pictures in the hallway because you're like inviting them in. Now, I love that, right? I love a lot of people coming to my home, but even if I travel so much. But even my friends, there are some friends that are also connected with me through business. I will then put their pictures in my office, right? So some of that you can use there. And I always have a picture of my family in my personal relationship direction in the office because just one, not 10 of them, one, because it means that they're supporting. my, my business is supporting what I do in the world. Right. So I have one picture there. So I want you to really see that too many pictures can be too crowded. Right. And again, do your muscle testing. If you see, is this a good picture for me or is it too many pictures? Right. So sometimes less is more like one beautiful picture is sometimes better than like tons of pictures. Yeah. Definitely. So a follow -up question to this would be like, how should we view pictures of our deceased ones? Yes. Okay. So the first thing I would say, don't put them in your bedroom, right? That's the first rule. Okay. Why? Because in your bedroom, you're energizing your energy and your body. And so you don't... bedroom is already a yin place, a very passive place. And people that have passed on already are yin, right? They are already passive. They're not living anymore. So it creates too much yin energy. It throws the balance off in your bedroom. So I suggest to put them in your living space. But there are some rules about that. So people that have energy number one, three, four, and nine. We try to avoid having deceased people in the east, southeast, south, and north. Place it then in the west area. The west area is a good place for people that are passed on. Even for urns with ashes, you can place that in the living space. You never put an urn with ashes in your bedroom. It's against two yin. Your health needs to recover there. So if you put ashes there, you're actually giving a message of like, I'm open to pass on. So that's not a thing. People that have energy number two, five, six, seven, and eight, they're West people. You don't place it in West, Southwest, Northwest, or Northeast. You can place it in the North, the North area. Also make sure pictures of deceased or urns with ashes in the entrance is not good because the entrance needs to be active and yang energy. So that's not a good thing. You can also, if you have a meditation space, you can put it there also if you feel that you want to connect with your deceased ancestors or family or friends. A meditation place is fine too. But again, be sure that it's not in one of your good directions. Is Feng Shui different in the southern hemisphere? What changes must be made to direction for health, relationship, etc., given the sun is toward north, not south, as it is in the northern hemisphere? So, the energy number doesn't change. okay so based on your birthday you will have your four directions and you will activate them as i will be sharing in the energy number there are some changes in feng shui for example the flow of water right the flow of water is different so if you go in more advanced feng shui we work with what we call the water dragon technique it will be different in the south hemisphere We also, landscape -wise, the winds are a little bit different, right? But, you know, some feng shui masters will just say, we'll just keep using the typical information for the landscape where the phoenix and the dragon and the tiger and the turtoises, we're going to keep using it also in the southern hemisphere. I actually go with that and say you can, you know, it is like a general principle. But the more you go south, I have seen, you know, they really feel that, you know, the colder winds come from the south and they don't come from the north. So I would say if you really live like in South Africa, if you really live in Australia and New Zealand, I would change the landscape symbols opposite because you have really the southern winds are the coldest winds and the warmer winds are coming from the north. But your directions don't change. You will still have, based on your energy number, these will be the directions that are really strong for you. right so I would still do the activations it just is on the landscape feng shui there will be a shift happening and also in the water dragon but that is not something we cover anyhow there will be a change happening so right now in what we're sharing with you you're totally fine my living room office and dining rooms are all in one space How do I deal with this? Consider each space separately when working with the compass direction or consider the entire area as a whole, regardless of whether it is the living room, office or dining room. Well, I would say the normal rule is you have to stand in the center of that open space, right? And find out your directions. Now, it depends how large that space is. Sometimes people have an open landscape in their house, but you can still... say this area is really just the living space. And in the middle, it's a dining area. And then, you know, it's like there is space between the different focus points. If there's a difference between the different focus points, you can actually imaginary, right, kind of divide them, right, and say this is the living space. That's where the sofa and television is. And then you can do that. And you can actually make an energetic. barrier between these different areas by putting two crystals out so let's say this area is where the sofa area is and then you have a dining space and to put between like on the walls on one side on the other side like a crystal on the ground where you can hang it so you kind of make a barrier or even put like two plants there or two cabinets to kind of say you know this is really this area And then the dining room area, and if you can really divide it, if it works, then I would stand in the center of that part of the space and say, I'll look at the four directions there. Sometimes that's not possible. It's quite close, all of that. It's like one flows into the other, right? Then in that case, I would... from the center of that space and activate your four directions there in that one space. When it comes to calculation of directions, do you calculate from the center of the room or from the central piece of furniture in the room? No, always from the center of the room because you want to really have access to all the directions. So think about you are the sun that shines the light. yeah so it's like if you're in the center of the room you it's like the distance between you and every area is kind of equal right so let's say you stand in the center and you take three steps and you're on a wall or 10 steps on the wall and so every area is like you have the same ability to shine light yeah so if you stand in the center you're like the sun radiating out to all areas. So that is better than the central piece of furniture. What if we have a small apartment? Because most of us most probably will face this particular type of situation. So what if we have a small apartment? Can we still have good Feng Shui? And she says, continues. I live in a one room apartment. So should I activate my directions for my apartment on each area I have set up in my apartment, even though they are part of one room? Hey, I started doing feng shui in a studio. So don't worry about that. You can totally do that. Now, the big problem is when it's a one open space, even if it's a small space, is that your bedroom and your sleeping area and your... I would say your office or your workspace and your living area, like your sofa, is all in the same area. So you have what we call the yin and the yang, the passive and active areas are all in one space. So that is the greatest problem. So you will stand in the center of that room and still activate your four directions. But one of the things I suggest in that case, if you have a bed in that area, make sure you... always clean up your bed perfectly. And then what I always did when I started, you know, using feng shui, you know, in the beginning when I only had a very small place is I would then bring out some pillows and make my bed look like a sofa, like, you know, so that my, it doesn't look like a bed. So I put like some pillows against the wall. So it looks like it's a sitting area. So during the day, make sure you don't see your bed as a bed. That's the first possibility. So it feels like it's part of a living space. Put a nice throw over it, like a nice fabric over it, so it doesn't feel like a bed. So I know it's kind of a discipline, but it really pays off. another thing is that you can do is get some screens like a paravan or a japanese screen and you make sure you are dividing even that small small space with some screens right or with some plants so that you feel like there's some separation of energy between the different areas, especially if you have, and I know some of you were having this question and we answered it several times in a Facebook group is, you know, you have your bedroom and your office and your workspace in the same area. You can hang a curtain, you know, you can even do that in a one smaller apartment or an open studio. You can hang a curtain to say like at night, you know, I close myself off from my workspace. I close myself off from my living space and I create a more warmer field around me so that you can do that. Or you can put a screen to divide it, especially also in the bedroom where you're working and you're sleeping at the same time. It's really, it's not good for business because subconsciously when you're working, yeah, there's still a part of you that said, I want to go to sleep. right so your money your business will also go to sleep at the same time so make sure there's a screen or a curtain that's it like now i'm in my working mode right if you go to sleep and you have a workspace there you know for your romance and your health it's really not good because subconsciously there's still a message out that says i'm working you know i have to do something While you went to sleep and you won't have romance, it's a whole other vibration. So by putting a screen or a curtain, you're actually making subconsciously a decision what you're really focusing on. If you do both at the same time, I always see people, their business suffers or their romance or their health suffers. Do ceiling fans wreak havoc on your energy? If the ceiling fans are above your beds, You know, if they're like in the middle of the room towards your... foot your feet it's fine but if they're hanging above your head it's really not okay yeah so i know there are some things you can hang on your ceiling so it feels like more like a flower so they move but it's not so sharp so the sharper the blades are of the fan then they act like beams like cutting energy yeah so having a fan above a dining room table for example create some communication problems also for people. So people will go faster in fighting with each other if it's above a dining room table. It's one of the reasons when I come in like a restaurant and there are some fans, I always stare away in my meeting from the areas where there are fans above the table because it's harder to concentrate because they make this white noise also. They make a disturbance. But it's like they're... like this spinning of energy and the the air because uh is moving too fast because it creates chi Chi needs also to be gentle like a breeze. So it's like that feeling. But if it's a fan that just starts spinning above you, I mean, energetic is not okay. Also, because when you're sitting there, your aura field is always like an arm length above you. And it's possible your aura field is actually disturbed. And then your crown chakra will be disturbed by that fan. So try not to sit under it. And in case it is, make sure it's moving slower. Right. Or make sure that I know there are some systems you can put on the blade so that it feels like there's more like it's not so sharp. Right. So I would suggest that. But of course, you know, in some countries we really need it. Right. So just try not to sit under it. What is more important in the bedroom, facing the door or sleeping in the right direction? The first thing is to see the door. That is the general rule. everywhere, right? If you can then sleep the good direction, that's an extra bonus. There's like a 10 % boost of your romance and your health. But if that's not possible, make sure you activate your directions for romance, you know, relationship and health in your bedroom because it will give a stimulus. And again, then make sure you're sitting towards the right direction when you work, when you're with your family, in your living space. So the more you can, the better it is. But seeing the door is the first rule. Okay, wonderful. I think we'll have that as the last question here. Like we said, guys, we have three more calls that are coming up. We'll answer a lot more questions. Always use the Facebook group. And like I said, I see a lot of questions here that will definitely be answered within the content of the weeks that are coming up next. So continue to play full out, get engaged with the content, and don't stress out by the end of this. course you definitely have all of your answers met like this and we also let Marie go because she had a tour de force here answering for non -stop for one hour so Marie can you share with us a final moment of inspiration on our journey Well, first of all, I want to really thank you. And I'm so grateful to Mindvalley to inspire all of you and give me that opportunity. And I want to go back to that. you know, the gentleness that I want you to really focus on. You know, feng shui has rules and principles and it's very analytic in one way, but there's also this creative part. And I'm happy to see also the pictures that you have on Facebook and you're showing me like the changes you're making. That inspires others. So please put that on the Facebook. It inspires me also to see, you know, how much beautiful energy that you're creating in your home. And remember, Everything you're changing, it creates a gentleness and just don't force yourself. Do everything you can and every step will build up on top of each other. We really worked on that, that the course just builds on each other and this layer and layer of change and suddenly you will have a breakthrough and you're like, wow, it's like magic is happening. Well, it's not magic. It is called Feng Shui for life. Thank you so much. Thank you, Marie. Thank you very much for all of your wisdom and all of the excitement that you bring to this process and for sharing everything you learned with us. You're welcome.

Week 3: 3-Dimensional Vision Board

====================

LESSON 8 – Turn Your Home Into a 3-Dimensional Vision Board
--------------------
<v ->Welcome to chapter three.</v> Today, we're talking about space feng shui. The space around you is like a three-dimensional vision board. Everything that is around you affects your subconscious mind. The space around you is divided in eight areas. We call that the compass directions. So imagine if you look at a compass, you have eight directions. North, south, east, west, southeast, southwest, northeast, northwest. So when you stand in the center of a house, you can actually check out what is in all these directions. We're going over every direction now and tell you what is the purpose, what is the element, the color, the material, the form, and the symbol that is the strongest in that area. We're starting with south. The purpose of the south compass direction is actually about fame. It's about recognition. It is about entertainment. It's about being in the light. Because the element for the south is fire. It is light. It's the sun. When you look at the south of your home, you actually need to see if there is a representation of that purpose. The color of the element fire is red, but you can work with many shades of red. You can even go to yellow and oranges and purples. The element fire can also be represented by a form. And if you think about a fire, think about a flame. So when you look at a flame, when you look at the form of it, it's like a triangle. So a triangle, a pyramid has all the representation of south. So a triangle, a pyramid shape, all represents the fire element. If you look at the material, well, what is the fire? It's a candle, it is a fireplace, but also, plastic is considered a fire element. And a symbol of fire, well think about a lamp, a candle, the sun. And everything that also represents fame and recognition. So certificates and awards all represent the purpose of the south. The number for the south is the number nine because this is actually the strongest number for fire and for fame and recognition. The next compass direction I want to share about is the southwest. The purpose of the southwest is motherhood, it's romance, it is teamwork. It's a feminine power. And it's collaboration. So the element for the southwest is called large earth. Think about, it's a mother energy. So it's Mother Earth, the planet we are living on. And every material coming from the earth, any crystal, is also the right material for the southwest. Color-wise, all colors connected in with earth are strong for the southwest, but especially rose, and all shades of rose will actually support that direction the most. The form for the southwest is a square or a rectangle or a cube or a box form. The number for the southwest is the number two. So placing things in pairs will actually support the southwest. So think about two rose candles or two rose quartz hearts. When you think about the symbol for the southwest, think about the purpose. The symbol for the southwest is like a globe, because it's Mother Earth, but it can also be a strong woman, it can be everything about romance, two hearts, a beautiful image of romance. It can be a beautiful image of a couple. Another symbol you can place there to support the collaboration and teamwork is a ceramic circle of friendship. The next compass direction is west, and west stands for our creativity. It stands for technology, psychology. It stands also for the joy of children. The element for the west is considered small metal. So all small metal items will actually support the west, but don't put objects made of metal that are sharp, like knives and weapons. So why are knives and guns not good? Because they have the sharp edge, and so they are also pointing, and they are actually attacking energy. You never want to place that, especially in the west that is really strong for children. And also, the form for the west is actually round and oval and a ball. And so, sharp images are actually the opposite of what you want to focus on. The material objects you place there can be made out of silver, gold, and copper, or they look like these materials. The best colors for the west are actually whites, silvers, and golds, or any shades of metal. Symbols connect again with the purpose. So a symbol could be playing children. It can be symbols of technology. You can also place an image of a lake, a calm lake, because it represents the peace and the harmony on the psychological level. The number for the west is number seven. The next compass direction is northwest. And northwest stands, first of all, for the father. And from the father, we can connect in with the mentor and advisor. And so when we look beyond our human experience, then we can see the father is actually also the Universe. So the stars, the moons, the planets. The space outside our planet is also considered the northwest. Another part of the purpose for the northwest is friendship and traveling. The element for the northwest is considered big metal. So larger metal objects can actually be placed in the northwest. So everything connected with the material metal, or looks like material metal, is actually good for the northwest. The form is everything round, everything oval, and again, a ball is considered a right element for the northwest. The symbols are always connected to purpose. So, images of fatherhood. Also the stars, the moon. An image of the Milky Way is a good symbol for the northwest. And also, beautiful pictures and images of friends. And traveling pictures or traveling images are really good there. Or anything that you have brought from your traveling to your home, you can place in the northwest. The number for the northwest is the number six. The colors for the northwest are metal colors, so you can go with whites, with golds, with silvers, and all shades of that, but you also can add some more of the opal essence and the diamond vibration. The material for the northwest is all objects of metal. The next compass direction is the north, and the north has as purpose everything connected in with your career, your professional life, your future. The element of the north is water. So it can be a fountain, it can be the ocean, it can be a lake. So everything that represents that element will actually support the north. The colors for the north are all the colors of blue, all the shades of blue. So from dark blue to light blue, everything connected with that. And also, the color black. The material for the north is, of course, water. So representing an image in the north or using, literally, water there, like as a fountain or an aquarium, can be really positive for the north. The form of water is actually asymmetric. It never is the same. So asymmetric forms or things that are out of shape, can actually be placed in the north. The symbol can be definitely everything with water. So a beautiful image of water, but definitely not something that is too much water. Like a big waterfall is too much. But it can be a creek, it can be a river. These are good symbols for the north. But also, it can be everything connected in with your professional life, or images that, for you, connect in with the future or a pathway to the future. And the number for the north is the number one. The next compass direction is the northeast. And the northeast, it's purpose stands for knowledge and wisdom. It's about teaching, and it's also connected with spirituality and religion. The element for the northeast is small earth. So small crystals and small ceramic objects can actually support the northeast. Color-wise, the colors for the northeast are mostly earth colors. So you can go for yellows, you can go for warm beiges. You can also go for earth reds and earth browns. The material for the northeast, again, is small earth. So you want to have small ceramic or crystal objects in that area. The form, as it's an earth element, you can actually go again with square, rectangular, a cube, or a box form. And the symbol connects always with the purpose. So if you have any symbol representing your religious, your philosophical, your spiritual beliefs, this is a perfect place to put it in the northeast. And the number for the northeast is the eight. The compass direction east stands for everything with healing and the past. And also, your family from the past. So your parents, your grandparents. It also connects in with the government and everything with nature. The element for the east is considered big wood. The color for this is all the shades of green and browns and beiges. The material is wood, so all objects that are made from wood, plants, flowers, and that look like wood are considered really good for the east area. The form for the east are long objects. Think about the tree. And also, stripes are really very good as a form for the east. And the symbol connects in with the purpose. So everything connected with plants, with flowers, with trees, forest, but also connecting in with the past. So your family tree, or antiques are really good symbols for that. Or even the flag of your country, as it's connected with the government. The number for the east is the number three. The purpose for the southeast as compass directions is everything to do with money and abundance and luxury goods and good fortune. The element for the southeast is considered small wood. So small flowers, small plants are really representing that element. And the colors for that, again, are warm beiges, warm browns, and all shades of green. The material, again, is everything made from wood. And the form, again, are long objects, and also stripes. And the symbol connects in with the purpose, so all symbols of abundance and money and luxury objects are actually considered really good for the southeast. The number for the southeast is the number four. And then, as we have seen all the compass directions, we're still missing the center. And the center is also really important, because the center is where the harmony and the peace of a house is. So the purpose for the center is the general wellbeing and the general health and harmony for the family. The element there is considered middle earth. The color, again, are considered all earth shades, from yellows to warm browns to warm reds, and even to roses and oranges. Material, again, is everything made from earth. So crystals, but also ceramics. The form, it is rectangular, square, a cube, or a box form. The symbols connect with the purpose, so everything that gives you harmony and peace and connects in with your overall wellbeing. So an example of the symbol could be the yin-yang symbol, or even an image of your family, because this is the overall wellbeing for your family you want to represent there. And the number is number five. So these nine areas, your eight compass directions and the center, are actually activated by all these purposes, colors, elements, material, and forms. I invite you to go to each of these compass directions and see if it has the right purpose, the right colors, the right element, the right forms, and the right symbols. Now, these eight compass directions and the center, the activations for these are actually very general. So these areas work for everyone. This has nothing to do with your personal energy number, but these are what, overall, will affect you in a positive way if you bring in the right colors, symbols, material, and forms. So you already have received your personal energy number, and now you understand what every compass direction stands for. So let's bring that now together. Based on your personal energy number, you have four pillars. So the first pillar is called the blue pillar, and it's a pillar of success, your income, career, your future success and money, from surviving to thriving. And this is based on your personal energy number, you know what direction that is. For some of you, it will be southwest, for others it will be north. And so, as you know now what this direction is about, you can bring these two together and say, well, the north is my success direction, but north stands for purpose, working with career, looking towards the journey for the future. Or perhaps your success direction is east and your blue pillar, your personal blue pillar connects in with the east, and it stands about healing and about government and connecting with the past and the family. So you bring these two now together, your general space purposes and what it means for you. Your green pillar is all about health and wellbeing. If southwest is your green pillar, and it's your health direction, then you can think about, my health and wellbeing connects in with being a mother, or connecting with the mother line, or focusing on the feminine aspect of myself. Or perhaps for my health, I need to collaborate, or work in a team to have a better health purpose. Or, for example, northeast is your green pillar. And that means, the northeast stands for spirituality and for education, and perhaps you need to educate yourself a little bit more about your health and wellbeing and receive more wisdom and information how to move forward to create a better health. The rose pillar is the pillar for relationships. So if you look at your directions, based on your personal energy number, you will see that you have, each one of you, a personal relationship direction. So let's see how that works together. So for example, if your relationship direction, your rose pillar, is the south, and we know the south stands for fame and recognition and music and theater and movies and entertainment, you know that you would love to have somebody that is also connected with that area, or would love to go out to the movies with you or to theater or connecting through music and dance with you. Or if your relationship direction is northwest, it is possible you look for somebody who is more a father figure or has a strong male energy or is a great advisor or loves to travel and be your best friend. The fourth pillar is the yellow pillar, and connects in with your wisdom. And your wisdom stands for how you personally connect in with heaven, with spirituality and your religion. So again, we can bring these dots together. Your yellow pillar is, for example, southeast. So perhaps it's really important for you to open up to the spiritual laws of abundance and to allow to really receive money and work around money to go to the next level in your connection with heaven. It's possible that your yellow wisdom direction is connected with the west, for you. And the west stands as purpose, really for everything with technology and children and psychology. And so perhaps for you, it's good to connect in with your inner child and to work within yourself to find out what is psychologically blocking you. So I will explain my own four pillars. So I am number five, I'm a connector. And what I see as my success direction is all about connecting. It's all about a strong female energy. It's also about teamwork and relationships, and I love working with romance and creating romance for people. And I don't know if you remember, but in "The Secret," I was actually talking about romance. And that brought my success to a whole other level by talking about romance. My health direction is the northwest, so I had to release a lot connected with the father energy in my life. On a physical level, and also on a deeper emotional level. There was a lot of healing connected with my father. But also, I love traveling, and when I travel, I feel so healthy. My relationship direction is the west. And for me, being a mother and having children around me, that is the greatest thing for me. I love working, also, with younger people because I love that joy and that creativity. I love, also, being a creative person. And I surround myself with creative people because that's what the west stands for. And I love everything with technology. And my yellow pillar is the northeast. And that is about spirituality and meditation and prayer. And definitely, that is my journey. When I focus on gaining more wisdom, I always go into prayer and meditation and connecting with wonderful teachers. Now I will explain you how to work with the compass. So you can use a water compass. You can download the compass on your phone, or you can also go to the Marie Diamond app and see your four pillars. So how do we start? So the first thing is, when you have your compass, you need to always make sure you hold the compass on the level of your heart because it needs to connect in with you. Make sure there's nothing around you that disturbs the compass. So don't wear too much metal around you, and don't put it too close to lamps or to computers. Also, don't put it on the ground, because the Earth magnetic field can be different than the magnetic field where you are on the level of your heart. The first step is, you're going to check, where is the center of your house? When you have a square or rectangular house, you'd imagine the four corners connected with each other, and where the two imaginary lines connect, that's your center. When your house has not a rectangular or a square shape, fill in the areas that are not in the building and make it square and rectangular, and then, again, divide the four corners and in the middle is the center. When you are standing in the center with your compass, you will first of all look at, where is the north area? And from there, you can see the opposite is the south, the left is the west, the right is the east. And the best way would be to take your floor plan, or to draw a floor plan, with all the rooms, standing in the center, and indicate on your floor plan, where are all the directions? Going from north, northeast, east, southeast, south, southwest, west, northwest, and back to the north. Then check, in your home, where are your four pillars? So where is your success direction? Where is your health and relationship and wisdom direction? And it will be interesting to see, what is there on your floor plan? So if it's an area where there's an active energy, like a living room or a bedroom or an office, that is always good for your directions. When it's an area where there is not such a good area, like a bathroom, a kitchen, storage, a garage, that doesn't stimulate your four pillars. Don't worry, we'll also make sure that even if it's not a good area, we're going to activate them, also, but in what we call the micro way. Then I would like you to take your compass and go to the living space. And again, make sure you stand in the center of your living space. For some of you, it's your living area. For others, it's more the family area where you spend the most of your social time. When you stand in the center, again, you'll hold the compass on this level of your heart, and you'll look again, where are the directions? And you can make, even, a floor plan of that room and indicate, where's the door, where are the windows, even where are the furniture? And place that on that plan. And then, you indicate, where are the compass directions? From north, again, the whole compass around. And then, you will also check out, what are your four pillars? What is my success pillar, the blue one? What is my health, the green pillar? What is my relationship, the rose pillar? And what is my wisdom, my yellow pillar? And you indicate it on your floor plan. So when you have been looking at the overall compass directions of your home, it is possible you've found that one of your pillars is in an area where it's your garage or your kitchen or your laundry room or a storage area. And perhaps you're worried about that. Do not worry about that. If you cannot activate it in the larger floor plan, we will activate it in the different rooms. So if, for example, your health direction is in the garage, it will be important to declutter that garage, but it is a garage. And then you will activate your health direction specifically in your bedroom and your living room. Or if, for example, your laundry area is your relationship direction, your rose pillar, you can say, well, that's not good, either. Well, you make sure it's always decluttered and organized, and then you will activate your personal relationship direction in your bedroom and your living space. So if things don't work on the bigger floor plan, we'll work on the specific areas in your smaller rooms. So for example, if you find out that in your living room, your health direction has a trash can in it, well then you're actually saying, my health goes in the trash. So of course, that is not good, and you will have to remove it. So which rooms are we going to use for each of the goals? For your success direction, you will focus, first of all, on your office, if you have a work space, and the living room. So for example, you will use your compass and stand in your office and find out, where is your personal success direction, your blue pillar? Let's say, in that area, you have a lot of clutter. There's really nothing telling what your success is about. Then you have to, first of all, remove what is wrong, and then you place things in that area that will support your success. And you will then, for example, check if your success direction is the east, as an example, you will know the materials that are good for the east are like flowers and plants. It's also possible you'll want to activate it with colors and say, well, I will put something green or brown. Or I will put some wooden objects. So example, the success direction for you is the southwest in your office. You're, for example, energy number eight. Well, you know that collaboration and teamwork is important for you. And global thinking, because it's connected with the earth, itself. So putting a globe in the southwest, or putting, for example, two crystals or a ceramic circle of friendship with actually activate that success and that energy. But you'll always first check, what is there at this moment, and is that area really supporting my success, my health, my relationship, and my wisdom in my office? Always take, first, away what is not supporting you, and then start stimulating it again. Success can also be activated in your living room, because we, now in this modern world, use our laptop or phone to make some calls about business. So check out, what is in your success area in your living room? Again, whatever is there that is not supporting you, you take it away. I'll give you an example. Many years ago, when I was looking at my own living room, in the southwest, for me, that is my success direction, did hang a beautiful painting. It was given by my father-in-law. It was an image of a winter landscape. So of course, if my business would be skiing or working in the winter sports, I would say, that would be great. But that's not my business. So I took that away. And I placed instead an image of a mountain, because it supports the earth energy of the southwest. And as my business before was kind of not thriving, after I put the mountain image, I started really feeling the difference in my success. So even the living room, as you're there socially, will actually create ideas and supports your success and your money flow. For health, it is best to activate, first of all, your bedroom, because that is where you are energizing yourself at night. If you're not having a good sleep and you're not rested well enough, you actually are not strong enough to go through life. So again, take your compass, stand in the center of your bedroom, and sometimes that's almost like sitting on your bed, because your bed can be so big. You're sitting or standing there, and you look, where is my green pillar? And check out what is there at this moment. So the health in a bedroom is really important to look at. And I'll give you an example. There was a bedroom of a child, and that child was really not feeling well. And when we looked in the health direction of that child, there was this collection of dinosaurs. So, you can say, well dinosaurs were healthy animals, right? But they are extinct. So, let's be honest, that's not great for the health. So we moved that away. So then we put images that really supported her health, and her health was the west direction. And west stands for joy and children playing. So I actually suggested to place images of her playing soccer and playing basketball, so that were actually things she really loved. So also, your living room, you really want to activate for your health. I remember once there was this lady, and she was saying, you know, I'm emotionally feeling like I'm drowning. I feel like life is so hard. And when I looked in her living space, there was a very famous image, and it's like a woman, she's like floating on water with her hands like this. Well, I said to her, this is what your health direction stands for. Health is not only your physical health, it's also your emotional and mental health. And so, you're floating on water, so let's be honest. If that would happen, you would not feel emotionally very stable. And she said, that's exactly what I have experienced. So we took that away and we actually replaced it by plants and flowers, because the southeast was the personal health direction for her. So let's check out now personal relationship direction. So you will look at your compass and see, where is your rose pillar? What is the compass direction that connects for you, personally, with your relationships? For your personal relationship, we'll focus on your personal romance, and of course, your connection with the family. We're going to focus in your bedroom to activate your personal romantic relationship. So stand again in the center of your bedroom and check out, where is your rose pillar? Let's say that your rose pillar is actually the access to your bathroom, and there is no door. You can see from the center of your bedroom, you can actually see your sink. So when you see the sink in your personal relationship direction, your romance will be drained. So the energy will go down. Or you won't even have a relationship. It's possible you have, for example, energy number two, and your relationship direction is northwest. So in your bedroom, having an image, for example, or you and your loved one traveling in a foreign country and putting that image up there will stimulate that vibration. Then also, you look at your living room. You will stand in the center of the living room, and again, check out, what is your personal relationship direction? What does hang there? So definitely, images of your family and you with your children and your partner will be a perfect place there. But everything else that shows loneliness or energy that is chaotic will actually not be good to activate your personal relationship direction. In your living room, where your personal relationship direction is, make sure you put images of your family and you and your partner, but remove everything that is chaotic. I'll give you an example. Somebody was telling me, I feel always so lonely in this house. Even if I have my family around me, my partner, I feel very lonely. So when I checked out her personal relationship direction in her living room, there was an image of her right in her relationship direction. And the images of her children and her partner were opposite the living room. So she was definitely separated, literally, in pictures, from them. So I invited her to take all these pictures of her husband and of children and hang them all around her in her personal relationship direction. And she started feeling that they were supporting and loving her more. Also, in the children bedroom. We want to check out the personal relationship direction. I also suggest to place in the child's bedroom in the personal relationship direction images of the team they are part of, and even images of the class because then, they are stimulating from within their bedroom their relationships outside in the world. You can also activate your professional relationships in your office or your work space. So again, stand in your office, look where is your rose pillar, where is your personal relationship direction? And check out first, what is there at this moment? If you're part of a company, you can actually place there the head of the company, the CEO, or perhaps a team picture with your colleagues. If you run your own company, it is possible you are by yourself, but you perhaps can place images that relate with collaboration and team, so to expand your business to attract a better team. Also in your personal relationship direction, you can activate it by checking out, where are my clients? Are your clients locally? Put an image up that symbolize the local area. If your clients are national, you can put up, for example, the flag or a symbol of your country. If your clients are globally, I always suggest to put a globe in that personal relationship direction. Since many years, I have a beautiful globe in my personal relationship direction in my office, so I attracted global clients. If you want to activate your social life and your social relationships, then you need to activate your living room. This is to stimulate the friendships that you have in your life. And if you want to go out more in the world and have a more outdoor social life, it's important to activate your living room. So you can place the images of your friends in your personal relationship direction in your living room. You don't want to put that in your office, you don't want to put that in your bedroom, because they have different focuses. And now we're going to stimulate your wisdom direction, your yellow pillar. We first of all do that in your bedroom because peace and harmony needs to be activated in your bedroom. And so, find out from the center of your bedroom, where is your yellow pillar? Where is your personal wisdom direction? And that's the only place in your bedroom where you can place something spiritually, connected with your religion and your spirituality. You do not want to place spiritual images in your health direction, success direction, and relationship direction, only in your wisdom direction. So it could be an image of an angel, image of a teacher, books on spirituality, books on religion, connected with what your belief is. Feng shui is not religious, but we are simulating your spiritual and religious belief by activating your wisdom direction. You also want to activate the wisdom direction in your living room. Or if you want, and you have a meditation room, you can also activate your wisdom direction there. If you have like a table or an altar where you want to place your spiritual images, your books of inspiration, your religious symbols, you can actually place it in the wisdom direction of your living room, or if you have a personal meditation or religious area, you can place then there your altar and activate by placing the altar there your wisdom direction. The next thing I want you to do is check out the direction of your front door. 'Cause a front door is actually where the incoming chi comes from, the outside world. So stand in the doorway, facing out towards the hallway of the apartment building, or towards the garden, or towards the street. You want to face out, not inwards towards your house. As you're standing in the doorframe, you hold your compass, again, on the heart level, and you will check, what is that direction? It is possible it is a good direction for you, it is, or your success or health or relationship or wisdom direction. Then you will know that house is really positive for you. If it's, for example, your success direction, that house will definitely stimulate your success even more. If it's your health direction, then that house will be a good healing energy for you. If this house is your relationship direction, you're facing it each time you go out into the world, then it will actually stimulate not only your personal relationship, but also your social life. If that direction is your wisdom direction, you will spiritually grow in that house. But it's possible it's not one of your four best directions. You're saying, oh, this is not a good house. Well, you can actually then check out if your bed direction and your desk direction is good for you. How do we do that? Because having a perfect feng shui is not always possible. But perhaps the next time you move, could be interesting to check out, for the new house or your new apartment, if your front door is facing one of your four good directions, 'cause it adds up to the percentages of good earth luck. How can you find out if your bed is a good direction for you? Well, you stand at the foot end, you hold your compass, and you look towards the headboard. And you kind of stand in the middle of your bed, if you have a bigger bed. Stand in the middle and you face out, and you check the direction. If your head is pointing towards one of your four directions, this is a good direction for you. If you're, for example, sleeping towards the success direction, you will actually be activated for success, just by sleeping. If you're focusing towards health, sleeping there will give you better health. If you're sleeping towards your relationship direction, it will be easier to attract wonderful romance. If you're sleeping towards your wisdom direction, you will have a better spiritual life. If it's not facing one of your four good directions, don't worry, we will activate it in a different way, and it's possible your front door is good for you. And if not, we definitely have to work on your desk direction, or in your home, or in the office. So how do you find out the direction for your desk? So please sit at your desk, very comfortable. Make sure the computer is away, because the computer can affect your compass. And as you're sitting down, you're actually looking forward to see which direction you're looking at. Again, you will check on your compass to see, what is that direction, and is it one of your four best directions? If it's one of your four best directions, that is awesome, especially if you can focus towards your success or relationship direction, because they are stronger for success. Health direction is wonderful, of course, too, but it's not so important for your success. So the strongest three directions for facing with your desk is your success, your relationship, and the third one, your wisdom direction. I just want to remind you, you always want to see the door, 'cause you want to keep being in the power position. So sometimes, it's just your health direction you can focus on. Well, this is better than focusing towards a direction that is not good for you. So the front door, the bed, and the desk direction, if they can be in a good focus for you, so if your front door, bed, and desk direction is facing one of your four best directions, that adds up to your good earth luck. It is possible your front door is not good. Make sure your bed and your desk direction is good. If the front door and the bed directions aren't good, definitely focus on your desk. If none of these are good, definitely make sure you activate your four good directions with the right images and the right activations. But the best would be to have all the directions of your front door, bed, and desk, and the activations at work, because then your percentage of good luck and good feng shui will actually be skyrocketing. Now, it is possible you're saying, well, we are a couple, and we have different numbers. Remember, there are people that are east people, the energy numbers one, three, four, and nine, and then there are people that are west people, with the numbers two, five, six, seven, and eight. So the people that have the combinations of the west, it's easier because they all are having the same directions. They also have the same compass directions, but just in a different way. For example, you are an east person, you have energy number one, and your combinations are southeast, east, south, and north. And your partner has energy number eight, and that is southwest, northwest, west, and northeast. This is completely different areas of the compass. What to do? Don't worry. The first thing you will check out is, what is the compass direction of the front door? Let's say the front door is east, then you will try to make sure the bed direction is good for the partner. So you'll kind of give each one something. The front door is considered the day energy, and the bed is considered the night energy. So if the front door is good for one person, you will try go give the direction where you point the bed towards for the other person. It is possible, based on your platform, that that is not even doable, and that your front door and the bed is only good for one person, let's say for energy number one. So then, the energy number eight needs to make sure the desk direction is facing one of his or her four best directions, west, southwest, northeast, or southwest. And activate these four areas. So having it perfectly in harmony is not always possible. But you will try to activate as much as possible. You can also use your four best directions on every two-dimensional form. So think about a laptop screen. So if you would look at your laptop, the top is always the south and the bottom stands for the north, 'cause the south stands for fire and the sun, and the sun shines from above on you. And the bottom stands for the north, where it's water, and water needs to run on the bottom, 'cause if you would flip that, you will be drowned by the water and burned up by the fire. So if you look at your laptop screen, you will see the south is on top. Then right up would be southwest, to the right would be west, to the bottom right will be northwest, the bottom would be north, left bottom would be northeast, the left side will be east, and the upper left would be southeast. So you can actually use your laptop screen by using your folders and saying, all the folders about my success, I put them on my laptop in the area that are about success for me. Let's say, if the west is your success direction, all your important programs and folders about success and your business, you'll move it to the right side of your laptop. So everything to do with relationships, let's say all the programs connected with social media, you would actually move over to an area on your laptop connected with your relationship direction. This is the same way you can work with a vision board. So you take a paper, and the center of your vision board is about you. You are the center of the Universe. So in the center, you need to place a picture of you. And of course, a recent picture, not your baby picture. It's about now and your future. And then, you can divide your vision board as a sun. So the center is the sun, with eight lines. And the lines are indicating all the different compass directions. The top is the south, again, that's southwest, west, northwest, north, northeast, east, and southeast. You will then indicate, where is your success area, your relationship area, your wisdom area, and your health area? And then you can put images and goals in the specific areas on your vision board. How to work with spaces if the room or the house has an unusual shape. So when your room has an unusual shape, and let's say you're missing, for example, your success direction, make sure you put the images and symbols to activate your success as close as possible to that area. When your house is missing a corner and you have a garden, you can then actually activate that area in the garden. I'll give you an example. If north would be your success direction, you can then put a fountain, that stands for the element water, in that area with water moving towards your house. Or, for example, if it's the northeast, your relationship direction, and you're missing that, you will place, for example, a beautiful symbol of spirituality, or religion, like an angel or a Buddha, or even some rocks, to stimulate your health direction. When you have a two-story home, make sure you're actually activated on both levels. So sometimes people sleep on the lower level, and they have a living space and work space on the higher level. The best in feng shui is to have your bedroom on the higher level and the living space and work space on the lower level, because it's closer to heaven, and when you're asleep, you want to be closer to heaven. In case it's the opposite, make sure, then, that your bedrooms are having warm earth colors. Browns and warm oranges and yellows, to activate energy enough. And then in the higher level, make sure that you connect in with more green colors and colors connected with water. So some of the major precautions we have in feng shui are poison arrows. So let's say you're sitting on your desk and there is an angle of the wall pointed at you, then that will actually affect your concentration and focus. You can then cure it by placing a plant in front of it, or hang something exactly on that sharp edge. So also plants that have sharp leaves, cactuses, I always suggest to people to have that outside of your house, not inside of your house, or definitely not in areas where you live, sleep, or work. Also, weapons, I suggest to people to not have that hanging on the walls, but put them in cabinets or closets. Or, if you want to still have that out, sometimes you have some antique weapons you want to hang out, put them in the hallways or in areas where you have no active energy, and definitely not in your bedroom. So when you sleep in your bedroom, make sure you're not in what we call the dead position. So that would mean that your body is ready to go out of the door, so that your feet are just opposite the door. We try to avoid that. That's why when you sleep, you make sure that the doors are to the side of your bed or to this side, but not opposite where you're sleeping, 'cause that is not a positive direction. In case that is like this, make sure you have a foot end that stops your feet going out the door. When you are sleeping with your head towards a window, that is okay, but you need to put heavy curtains to make sure that is no moonlight falling on you, because that can disturb your sleep and your emotional stability. Also, make sure that there are no mirrors reflecting your bed, because when you are alone in the bed, it doubles your loneliness. When you have health issues, it will double your health issues. And when you are with two in the bed, you will actually create more people coming to the bed, or you will create a lot of miscommunication between the people sleeping in that bedroom. So you need to make sure you don't see the mirror or that the mirror doesn't see you. And remember, televisions with reflecting screens do act as mirrors. When your bed is positioned under a slanted ceiling and the slanted ceiling is really low towards your head, your energy is compressed and people feel less lucky under such a slanted area. So try to avoid that. Make sure there's at least two arm lengths above your head so that you will feel free and strong and active. When you have cathedral ceilings in your bedroom and the arch of the cathedral ceilings is just in the middle between the two partners, it will actually create a division between the two of them. And when it's above your body, it will also create a cutting energy like a beam. That's why you want to make sure there's no beams over your head, no beams over your body, because they create cutting edges from on top on your body. You'll always try to cover that. You can put a fabric over it, or even under cathedral ceilings, you can put a fake ceiling in it, or make it even with fabric. So you can also protect yourself from a cathedral ceiling by putting a canopy over you. I also want to share with you some very advanced feng shui techniques. We have something what we call temple lines. So when your front door or your desk or your bedroom is facing exactly north, on zero degrees, exactly east, on 90 degrees, exactly 180 degrees south, and 270 degrees west, you are on what we call a temple line. Now, temple lines, you hear the word, it's good for temples. It's good for spirituality. It's good for your spiritual growth. But it is not good for money. It's like you're starting to live as a monk, and monks, they beg for their money, they live from charity, they don't work for their money. They focus on being with God and growing spiritually towards enlightenment. And also, they're not focused on romance and on family. In the case your front door is facing one of these temple lines, everybody in the house will feel that energy and will have difficulty with cash flow coming in for their business and for their career. And also, the people living inside will feel more like they're monks, also on romantic level. In order to cure that, I will give you something very special. This is a cure I received from my spiritual teachers. So the cures I created for that are very advanced feng shui and they're called the temple line cure. So for each direction, it will be a different cure, and they're based on the I Ching. There are hexagrams. And in the energy number ebook, you will find the cures for the different areas. So if your front door is facing one of these directions, you will have to hang it above the doorframe on the inside of the house, so that actually the energy shifts each time you come in and walk out. 'Cause when you come into a house, it's like your body is scanning the energy of the front door. And when you have a temple line, each time you come in, the energy is scanning your chakras and says, welcome to this temple. Now, if you have a temple, that will be great. But you have a family home, a business place, and then it creates the opposite. When you are seeing that your bed direction is facing zero, 90, 180, or 270 degrees as you're standing at your foot end facing to the headboard, you, of course, can hang above that headboard the hexagram, but you also can change it differently. You can take the headboard and slightly change it five centimeters away on the one side or on the other side from the wall, so you are pointing just next to these degrees. 'Cause if you're sleeping towards the temple line, it's possible you are with your partner, but on a physical level, you will start acting as a monk, and not have an intimate relationship anymore. When you're single, it will be harder to attract a long-term relationship, 'cause you will start living as a monk. Also check out your desk. As you're sitting at your desk and you see that you would face exactly due north, zero, due east, 90, or due south, 180, or due west, 270, then make sure you change your desk slightly left or right to not focus that direction. In case you can't be it's a built-in desk, make sure you take the hexagram, the temple line cure, put it on your desk towards the edge of the desk. You can glue it there or you can just put it in a beautiful gold-looking frame. This way, you are getting away from the temple line. Now, this is very advanced feng shui, and I'm very happy that you can readjust that, because if you do all the wonderful activations for success and abundance and relationships, but you still are pointing and connecting in with this temple line, it will overrule all your activations. So make sure you check that out. Now you will see a practical video clip, where I will demonstrate how to define all the compass directions and how your four best directions are influencing you. And we're going to share how to do that with muscle testing.

====================

LESSON 9 – Create a Floor Plan to Activate Your Pillars
--------------------
<v ->So I actually want to share with you</v> how you have to look at the compass in a house. <v ->All right.</v> <v ->So, when we have a normal compass,</v> we actually need to look at where is first of all the magnetic north. So the magnetic north is actually in that area over there. And then if you look at the other compass directions, the opposite of north of course is south. And so you go from north, east, south, west, right. <v ->West.</v> <v ->And so then, based on your energy number,</v> you will see which are the areas that you really need to focus on, okay. <v ->All right, okay.</v> <v ->So you can actually look per room, so the living room,</v> the bedroom, the office space. But you also have to, for in order to make that clear, you have to stand in the center of each room. <v ->Okay.</v> <v ->So in this area we are already standing</v> in the center, right. But you also can look, not just micro level, like per room, but you can also look macro level, for the whole house, yeah. So then you have to check out where is the center of the house? So most houses are a square or rectangular so it's kind of easy, you take the four corners and kind of imaginary put them in line and you find the center. <v ->Well this house is a little bit different as you can see.</v> <v ->Yes, it is, there is some different corners here.</v> So you will see actually here, you have an extension here, right. So, this area is longer right, and then you see there's a little area that is cut out, right. And probably in other areas of your house too there are some corners missing. Now the corners missing do affect you, right, especially if it's one of your success or health or relationship or wisdom direction. And interesting enough, is that here it is actually the north that is extended, that is a bit longer. And as this is your success direction, that's actually a really good thing for you <v ->Good thing, okay.</v> <v ->Because you have more energy in the north.</v> <v ->Great, okay.</v> <v ->But, in the east, you actually have a corner cut out.</v> <v ->Right, so relationship not going that well?</v> <v ->Your relationship, that's actually is like</v> your energy is less. <v ->Less, right.</v> <v ->So therefore, we need to make sure we are working on that.</v> So what you can do is you can put your activations in that area, but you always try to kind of make things even. So outside, it'll be good to add some lights to kind of shape it completely as a rectangular or square. <v ->All right.</v> <v ->Platform, right, or a plan.</v> So you want to really have the square or the rectangular plan. But what is good for you is to once you have your floor plan, is to indicate where is north, where is south, where is east, <v ->East and west.</v> <v ->Where is west, and then the directions in between,</v> south west, north east, south east and, so all the directions needs to be indicated. And, but you do that from the center of the home, yeah. <v ->All right.</v> <v ->All right, and then you will start seeing like,</v> oh I'm missing this there or the pool is in that area, or my kitchen is in that area. For example, in this house, your kitchen is actually in the south and the south is your health direction. <v ->So that's good isn't it?</v> <v ->Well, some people would say, well I make food there</v> so that's actually a really good thing, right. But other people would say well, it's where you are having the sinks and so you are draining water. <v ->The drains, yeah.</v> <v ->And you will have the fire area you know,</v> because you are burning things up there. <v ->Okay.</v> <v ->So, in that case, because it's south,</v> it'll be actually good for you to always make sure it's all decluttered, not to have knives out, right, always knives. <v ->No knives in the kitchen?</v> <v ->No, well, yeah, hidden in your closets, right.</v> And to make sure that you have images there that are uplifting for your health. <v ->All right.</v> <v ->And I would say, even put flowers up there</v> and so that the energy is definitely a bit more positive. <v ->All right, I can work on that for sure.</v> <v ->Because actually this is, if you look at your area,</v> this will affect you. So, every corner of the house does affect you, even if you're not really sitting there or sleeping there. <v ->Of course.</v> <v ->If it's one of your directions.</v> <v ->Okay.</v> <v ->All right?</v> So, the fact that the north is really. <v ->Extended.</v> <v ->Extended, that is good for your career, right.</v> <v ->Yes.</v> <v ->But on your relationship and your health direction.</v> <v ->I'll have to work a little bit.</v> <v ->Based on the compass directions here</v> for your energy number, it's a little bit weaker. <v ->Okay.</v> <v ->Okay, so in order to really make sure</v> I have a good compass reading, you know, it's important to hold the compass on your heart level, right. <v ->All right.</v> <v ->And so like this.</v> And to make sure you have not too much metal objects around your pulse. <v ->A few rings.</v> A few rings that won't really affect this. It's always better if you have a compass, on your phone, that's fine to use, but it's always better to work with a water compass, yeah. And to make sure you don't put it on the ground because there will be some disturbances <v ->Magnetic fields.</v> <v ->From the magnetic field.</v> And not, if you, and also if you too close to a computer, make sure the computer is out. So don't have electromagnetic fields, objects, actually around the compass, right. <v ->Around, okay.</v> <v ->Because otherwise, as you see here now with this,</v> it starts calibrating, <v ->Calibrating.</v> <v ->So I have to kind of move it around again, right.</v> And that is why you know, having a compass based with water inside will actually be better, okay. <v ->I'll have to get that then, yeah.</v> <v ->But you know, we've heard today,</v> we kind of use this compass to make it easier, okay. So, the living room is really majorly focused towards social relationships, so your family, your friends. <v ->Makes sense.</v> <v ->Right, because that's where you social life is forwarded.</v> That's where your social life is really active, right. So your bedroom is more towards your health actually because you're sleeping there and that's where you need to energize. And also, for romance of course, right yeah. <v ->All right yeah.</v> <v ->And then, the office of course</v> is your professional life, yeah. <v ->So success.</v> <v ->Success, abundance, right.</v> So, these are the areas where you definitely need to focus on these aspects of your life, okay. <v ->All right.</v> <v ->All right, wonderful.</v>

LESSON 10 – Clear Your Space & Draw Your Floor Plan: Meditation & Exercises

- The first exercise I want to share for this chapter is a space clearing meditation. So I invite you to sit in your home and face your personal health direction. Take a deep breath in. And take a deep breath out. And as you're breathing in and out, I want you to connect in with your quantum point, the top of your magical hat. You will use that bright white light that is there to help to space clear your home. From that point of light, we're connecting in with a universal source of white light. And we're imagining that light coming in to the center of your house. Through the ceiling to the place where you're sitting right now. And you imagine now, you will walk through your house and you will space clear your house. So, start walking in your visualization and go to your entrance. And imagine your whole entrance is filled with this universal white light. And it clears away all the stress, all the heaviness, all the difficulties, all the negativity that ever was created around your front door and at your entrance. And take a deep breath in . And take a deep breath out . Then follow into your home and go first into your living space. And stand, in your visualization, in the center of your living space. And imagine that whole space is filled with this universal white light. Every corner, from the floors to the ceiling. And you ask that all the negativity and all the stress is going to be cleared with this white light. Take a deep breath in . And take a deep breath out . And go then to the workspace or your office you might have. And again, stand in the center, fill this area with crystal white light coming from the universe, releasing all the negativity that ever had happened there. Any negative thoughts, feelings and actions that were there, we're releasing it now, we're clearing it now. Take a deep breath in , and let it go . And let's go to your dining area. Where you eat with your family, or by yourself. Where you invite your friends and your family to share your food. And imagine the crystal white light from the universe is clearing that whole space. And releases any density and heaviness that is, perhaps, present. Take a deep breath in . And take a deep breath out . And then we go to the place where you sleep. Your bedroom. Stand in the center of the bedroom and fill this whole bedroom with this crystal white light from the universe. And release any health issues, any stress, any miscommunication, any problems that might have occurred there with this universal white light. Take a deep breath in and just clear it. And now I want you to go to other places in your house, perhaps the rooms of your children, perhaps your family room, your kitchen, your bathrooms, any other area you have, and do exactly the same exercise. You go in the center of that room, fill it with this universal white crystal light, clear out all the negativity that ever had occurred, and take a deep breath in , and take a deep breath out . Take your own time to do this space clearing and when you're ready, go back to the center of your house. Be grateful to the universe for sending all this beautiful light to space clear your house. Then bring your hands together, move your hands, bring your warm hands in front of your eyes, open your eyes, and let go of your hands. Now, your space is cleared. The second exercise I will ask you to do is to make sure, on paper, you start drawing a floor plan. And on the floor plan of your house, you will indicate where the door, or the windows, where is the major furniture, like your sofas, your bed, your office space, and the major cabinets. From the center of each area, you will also indicate where are all the compass directions for your home, but also for each area, like the office, the living space, and your bedroom. You will indicate the name of the compass directions, you also will write on the paper where your success direction, your health, your relationship and your wisdom direction for your whole house, and for each major place, like your living space, office and bedroom. And you can even put on the floor plan, what is there right now, so that you remember what you need to change when you go to the next steps. I also invite you to share your floor plans and to share it in the community. The third exercise is to start decluttering your office before the next chapter. In the next chapter, we will focus on your success and money flow, and in order to have the best results with that, I will invite you to start decluttering your office and your living room in the next week. I'm looking forward to see you again next week.

Week 4: Money & Success

====================

LESSON 11 – Feng Shui Your Success and Business
--------------------
<v ->Welcome to chapter four.</v> Today, we're going to focus on feng shuing your success and your money flow. We'll share first the general steps to improve your success. First of all, make sure you active the north and the south area of your office. The purpose of north stands for your career. So having there the right colors for the north, even if this is not one of your good directions, is always positive. Make sure there are some items in blue. There are, perhaps, a little fountain. And there're general activations. If north is one of your good directions, even if it's another direction than your success direction, I would still look into that it is the right vibration for success. The south stands as purpose for your recognition and your fame. And if you want to make more promotion in your career, then the south needs to really have the right colors., some reds and oranges, and perhaps even a candle to keep the flame burning for greater success. The second general step is your power position. We already start sharing a little bit about this, but I want to go back to that because your power position is the major general step that everyone needs to do. It's really connected with what we called the phoenix flying out in the world. When you're in the power position, you need to have space in front of you. Just imagine that your gift and your talent needs to fly into the world as a phoenix. When you're sitting at a desk and you are looking at a wall, the phoenix can not fly out, and you will not have the respect and fame and recognition that you desire. So that is why we want to see the door. Because we want the phoenix to fly in the right direction. So always place your desk in such a way that you see the door and you have as much space in front of you as possible. It's not just at your desk alone, it's also in your living space. Direct your sofas in such a way that you see the incoming flow coming from the front door or the hallway, depending what kind of home or apartment you have. You never want to sit with your back to the incoming energy, the incoming people from the doorway or the hallway. Even in the bedroom, when you wake up, you want to see the door so when you wake up that you are ready to start and fly into the world with your success. The second aspect of your power position is that you also need to protect yourself. So the phoenix is in front of you, and the torches has to be behind you. That means that you have to have some protection behind you. So even if you have space in front of you, if you have an emptiness behind you, that is not good. So you can have a high-backed chair you're sitting on or a sofa with a high back. Or in your bed, you would also have a high headboard. But if you cannot have that, make sure you place an image behind you that gives you support and protection. It can be an image of angels, can be an image of saints, of masters. It can even be an image of a mountain because a mountain can support you. Remember the torches was about making sure you are supported from the cold winds behind you. But powerful and successful people always have great support. Think about a king or a queen who sits on a throne. The throne always has a high back behind the king or the queen. In case you cannot protect yourself with an image, you could also place a plant behind you. Just make sure it has round leaves. Another general step that is important to create success is to focus on your entrance door. Doors that are solid and made out of wood are always more powerful than doors made of metal or doors with windows in or see-through. Always make sure the entrance door and the area around it, even outside and inside, are clean and organized. You always want to have a lot of space around your front door to create an open chi. Because if you want great gifts and great flow of money and great success coming in, you need to have space to receive it. And when you then walk in through the entrance door, you always want to have that feeling of openness. We call that the mount of chi, the openness of receiving the energy of the universe. Make sure there's always a fresh carpet. Every year, I suggest people to change the carpet at the front door. And do not place carpets with holes in it so that the money can fall through it. If you wish, you can even indicate that this is a powerful house, a house of a successful person. You can put on the outside of your front door, left and right, two plants, like buxus plants. Or what the Chinese did, they put fu dogs. But in the Western world, I suggest to put two lions or two dogs. But just have that feeling of there is something left and right from the door, but plants do the trick. Just make sure the plants are at least a meter high or three feet high. Another thing you want to avoid is when you walk in, is to have a mirror opposite the door. Because you come in with all the wonderful energy from the universe, and the mirror says, "Get out." So you can have mirrors left and right of you in the hallway, but never having the mirror opposite of you. Also when you have a bathroom or a door to a toilet opposite the front door, it has that same affect. You bring all this good energy in, and it rushes into the bathroom or into the toilet. How to avoid that, how to change that? Well then, make sure when you come in that your attention is actually going somewhere else than that bathroom or toilet door. So place left and right of you a beautiful image of your family or from nature so your attention is focused towards this area. When you have a narrow hallway, it's actually really good to place a mirror on one side, to have a feeling that the hallway is bigger and you have a bigger mount of chi and more energy can come in. You always try to avoid at entrance to see shoes and coats hanging. Make sure they are in a shoe box covered or that the coats are hanging in the cabinet. Think about your the queen and the king coming in your castle. I'm sure the queen and king, their shoes and their clothes are placed in the cabinet. And the first thing you see is always flowers and beautiful images to tell how successful and how powerful they are. Make sure your entrance looks like a castle walking in and confirming what a successful person you are. When you come from the front door, and the first thing you see is the kitchen, that isn't positive either because there is the draining of the sink and the burning of the stove. You always want to direct the energy away from the first view you have of the kitchen by placing plants in front of it or even hang a curtain of beads or another curtain. You're making sure that the energy that comes from the front door is not getting into your sink or being burned by the stove. Always direct the energy towards areas that are active like your living room and the office. Now, when you walk in and you have a staircase to the right or to the left or even in front of you, you actually redirect the energy going up. If you would live on the second floor, that would be fine. But if your bedrooms would be on the second floor, you actually rush all this positive energy from your front door into the bedroom, and it goes to sleep. You want to keep the energy on the first floor where your living space is and also your office space is located. Because you want to create that good flow of energy from the front door to the areas where you are welcoming people. You will actually bring the energy in, and you want to place images that catches your eyes and direct you into the living space or into your office. Some people do not use the front door, and they use the back door or the garage door to come into the house. I always say, queens and kings do not use the back door and do not come in through the garage. They use the front door. Sometimes you're just packed with errands and you want to drop it as fast as possible in the kitchen. I would say it's okay to come in through the garage but never leave through the garage. 'Cause the moment you want to walk into the world and create success, you need to use the front door. Remember when I talked about the phoenix flying out. So when you come out of your front door, you want to have at least 10 steps walking out of your front door into the world. Then you will have the most success and the most abundance. But that's not always possible because sometimes you will hit the wall when you are in an apartment building because you have to left or right. Well, then make sure you have 10 steps to get to the elevator or to get to the staircase to go down through the main exit. When you have a garden in front of you, you always want to make sure there is a feeling of 10 steps. But it can be that you put a pathway up so that it doesn't have to be direct in front of you, it can be kind of directed to the right and the left to get to the street. One day I came into a house of a Hollywood celebrity. And as I walked in, there were two staircases, one left, and one right, to go to the master bedroom. Well, it actually created a split between the left and the right. And the first thing I saw on the left and the right of that staircase was a huge image of the artist herself. So as she was walking in, all positive energy that came from that front door that was a solid wooden door was actually split in two. And she felt like that. She always felt split between being a singer and being part of one of the most famous American reality shows. And also the energy split also in a relationship. So do I go left, do I go right? And so we actually decided to close off one of the staircases so the direction would go just one way. When you walk out of the house, I shared with you, you want to have 10 steps to go into the world and be recognized for what you bring as success. I remember an actor, and he was very successful. He had a top-rating TV series. And he moved into another house, and suddenly, people were like, not telling positive things about him. And his reputation got really beaten up. So I looked at his house, I stood at the front door, and when you took even three steps, you ended up into a pond. So literally, his reputation, his phoenix, was doing three steps and tumbled into water. So in that case, we closed off the view of the pond with some bushes and redirected with light the energy so he could actually do 10 steps, and he started really feeling the difference in the reputation and fame again within a few weeks. One day I was invited to the penthouse apartment of a famous actor from the "Ghostbusters" movie series. And he was kind of complaining that people didn't call him anymore to act. Now, he had other business that were doing wonderful. But he said, "You know, I really would like to do "some more movies and TV series." And as I walked in, there was just nothing visible. I mean, there was definitely a mount of chi, but it was not telling what they really wanted as success. So I finally found all the posters of his famous movies in his personal bathroom. And I said, "Let's take them out "and put them at the entrance, so when you walk in "you are telling to all this positive energy that comes in, "'This is what I want to focus on.'" And he told me that within literally 48 hours, people started calling him, saying, "Oh, we have this little thing that we can do." And, "I have this production for you." So we actually changed that energy. So make sure at the front door, when you come in, that you tell what you want to be successful about. If it's a business, make sure your logo is there. You are indicating what kind of business you're about. Or if it is your home, your success should be your family. So family pictures at the front door are always a good energy. The next level to create fen shui for success is to work with your personal direction. So each one of you has now already understood that you have a personal energy number and a energy archetype, and you already know now what is your personal success direction. In order to create success, it is important to activate it in your living space and in your office. I'm going to go now over every energy number and tell you what are good activations for your success direction. And I'm also going to give you, for every energy number, some colors to quantum-boost your success. When you are energy number one, your success direction is southeast. So check from the center of your living space and your office with your compass where is the southeast area? Now, the southeast can be a part of the wall. It can be also a corner. When it's in a corner, you have space on the left side and on the right side of that angle to activate it. It's always a 45 degree angle in your room. So how can you activate the southeast? Well, you can go back to check out what is good in the southeast. The southeast has its purpose everything to do when money and abundance and luxury goods. To active your success direction, you need to focus on what do you want success in? Perhaps you want success in a certain career you have. Perhaps you want to have something new as a career. Perhaps you want to have a new career. Perhaps you have a business. Perhaps it is just life in general you want to be successful in. So take some time to write that down and think about what would relate with your goals you have about success. And then check also in your home, in your office, are there any symbols you can place in your personal success direction to activate it? You can put in there products you have, your business cards, your marketing flyers. If you're a writer, you can put in there your books. Or if you don't have any of this, but you want to be successful in a certain career, you can always look for people that have become very successful in that professional field. So when I work, for example, with celebrities, I would always ask if they do have awards. And I would suggest that they would the awards in their success direction. So look in your professional field, are there not any awards or certificates you really would like to desire? And nowaday, you can just print them out, the certificates, put your name on it, and hang it there. Remember, fake it 'til ya make it. 'Cause what I did by putting an image of an Oscar in my success direction. It was a fake Oscar statue. I still don't have a real one. Because I'm not a producer, director, or actress. But I brought in a lot of Oscar-winning clients because I focused on that. So what do you want to focus on? Check out what are the symbols that would work for that. Some people say, "I want more media, I want more PR. "I want to be more visible in the world." Well, check that online. Then you can actually check what are the magazines, what are the television shows, what are the radio shows, what are the kind of media you want to be successful in? Take these logos and put it in your success direction. So you could even put a corkboard there or a whiteboard and just put in all the items that you want in your success direction to activate your success. You can definitely place also your vision board there. The success direction for energy number two, and the number five for men, is northeast. Your energy archetype is the teacher. To active the northeast, it is important to really look again to your purpose. And the purpose of the northeast is about teaching and connecting with wisdom. So make sure you place things there that stimulate your success through wisdom. So make sure that there are definitely biographies of people that are very successful in your professional field. You can also place there crystals, especially amethyst crystals will do great for your success. You can also activate it with warm earth colors. You can also place there items in earth, ceramics and crystals. Energy number three are called the light workers, and their success direction is south. So place in the south things for your general activations. Light, candles, all warm colors of red. And of course, as the south stands for music and entertainment and fame, definitely place there also famous people from your professional field. The success direction for energy number four is the north. And the north stands generally as purpose for your career, so people that have energy number four, they really want to focus on their career and to have a long-life future in their professional field. The best symbols to activate that is to work with water images of fountain, a beautiful image of the sea with a beautiful sailboat sailing over the water, a powerful river, a creek, a spring. And definitely put something that tells you are the number one in your professional field. Who is the number one in your professional field? Place that image or a book about that person. For energy number five, when you are a man, we have talked already about it, when you are like the number two. And the energy number five for women, we'll talk about you when we connect with the energy number eight. To activate the success direction for energy number six, you need to focus on the west area of your living space and office. You can always stimulate it with the general symbols for the west and use metal, small objects to boost your success there. The west is all about creativity and technology, so check out how you can activate your success by being more creative and connecting with the technological industry. Energy number seven, the advisors, have a success direction the northwest. So the northwest stands generally for the advisors, for traveling, for friends. So it's possible you want to be successful with your friends and you want to travel a lot as you're unfolding your professional career. Place there also larger metal objects and work with the general colors for metal. Energy number eight, and the women that have energy number five, have their success direction in the southwest. The southwest stands generally for everything with earth. So ceramics, crystals, and especially working with citrine gemstone and amethyst and rose quartz will be stronger for you. The energy number nine, success direction is the east. And the east stands for large woods. So you can put there the tallest plants of your whole house to boost your success. You also can focus on images of flowers. You can also look at who in the past was successful in your success. So somebody from previous generations that you really look to, an ancestor of you or an ancestor in your professional field that you want to use to activate your success. Now I'm going to share with you the general steps to improve your money flow. Now, in the general space feng shui, the direction for abundance is the southeast. So make sure you have in the southeast general symbols for abundance and even books and magazines about people that are very wealthy and have a wealthy lifestyle. You know, one of the things I see with people that have a hard time to keep money flow going is that I find as I walk through their house coins everywhere. On the floor, in their cabinets, in the kitchen. Make sure there is never money in the kitchen because there is a fireplace, there is a sink. And definitely also no money in the bathroom. So try to have one space where you collect all your coins together. And if you want, you can even place it in the southeast. Another thing I suggest to people is not to work in the kitchen. Make sure you create your own work area even if that's part of your dining area so that each time you have to make important decisions, you have to work on your finances, when you're creating projects, that you always sit in a power position facing your success direction, and you have your own space to keep the energy focused. Even if you have an office that you are sharing with your family, always make sure there is one desk or one area where you can place your own work information. Also place your valuable papers like bank statements, information about stock and investment, everything about projects you're working on, place them in your success direction. Make sure there's a cabinet in your success direction or a file holder where you can place your important papers. The Chinese also love to work with the wealth ship. A wealth ship is a sailboat that you actually fill up with coins from your own currency. You can also add some Chinese old coins. You can put some ingots in it. Also some old jewelry that you do not longer want to wear. And even some gemstones, small, little gemstones. Placing your wealth ship can be crucial for your money flow. Of course, if you want just a little bit of money flow, you'll get yourself a small sail ship. But if you really want to become a millionaire, then you have to make sure you have a bigger wealth ship. Always be careful what the name is on that wealth ship. You never want to have a wealth ship that is called the Titanic or any ship that really perished in the sea. So it's better to avoid having the ship with a negative name. Make sure the wealth ship has beautiful sails. If you don't find a real wealth ship, also you can get yourself an image of a wealth ship and hang it in the right area. Where to place it? You can always place it when you come into your house and have a wealth ship there that directs the energy into your office or into your living space. I remember when I put my wealth ship at the entrance, I put it Americana. That was the name of the wealth ship. And I put all USA coins. That's how I directed my income from Europe to America, and I start having more and more business coming from America. You can also put your wealth ship, if you wish, in your office, in your success direction. And you can even point that slightly towards you at your desk. Not pointed directly, because you don't want to create a sharp arrow, but kind of telling, it comes through the place where you work. And generally, a wealth ship can always be placed in the southeast area and in the north. Another symbol of money flow are fountains. The best place for a fountain is in the southeast of your office or your living space or in the north, depending on where you want to focus the energy to. If you really want to focus just on money flow, and it can be beyond your career, then place it in the southeast. If you want to create money flow coming from your professional life, you can put it in the north. But you will see that also we give you every year where is the best place for that current year for creating money flow. Some years, it will be northwest or northeast or south or west, depending on the flow of the current year. So check that out on your instructions. Now, what kind of fountain? Well, to create money flow, it's best to have a fountain that is bubbling. If you want a fountain to come and direct the flow towards you, then you have a directional fountain. But normally, as a general rule, you do not put a fountain in the south area unless that current year, I will instruct you to place it in the south. Because the south is about fire, and you don't want to get the fire out. Now I will go over the nine personal energy numbers and tell you how to activate your money flow for you personally. When you are an energy number one and your success direction is southeast, it's important to place in the southeast a bamboo or a lush, flowering plant. Energy number two, who has a success direction the northeast and also the energy number five that are men, you can place in the northeast an angel or a deity or a saint that is helping you in activating your abundance and money flow. Or even you can put there books about the spiritual laws of abundance. The energy number three can place in the south a beautiful golden candle to activate the light of the money flow. When you have energy number four and your success direction is north, I would definitely place an image of a wealth ship. Energy number five who are men, we talked about in when you have energy number two. It's the same activation. And when you're a woman and you have energy number five, it's the same as energy number eights. When you have energy number six, to activate the money flow in your success direction, I would place a copper bowl with all coins. Just make sure it's completely filled and it's almost overflowing. Energy number seven, to activate your money flow, I would put a beautiful golden star in your success direction. For energy number eight and women that have energy number five, I would definitely place a crystal globe or a crystal ball in your success direction to create more money flow. Energy number nine, your success direction is the east, and when you want to activate money, I would look, if you have a very ancient or antique symbol from your family that is worth some money, and I would place it in your east direction. To quantum boost your success and your money flow, there are some specific quantum colors that actually can activate you to go to the next level. So for energy number one, your success direction is southeast, the quantum colors are violet, lilac, and gold. Energy number two and the men that have energy number five, your success direction is northeast, and your quantum colors are yellow, saffron yellow, and magenta. When you have energy number three and your success direction is south, your quantum boost colors for success and money flow are ruby red, cherry red, and orange. When you have energy number four, you want to quantum boost your abundance and success with the colors royal blue, Hubble blue, and aqua blue. When you have energy number five and you're a man, you'll have the same colors as energy number two. When you're a woman and you have energy number five, you have the same quantum boost colors as energy number eight. Energy number six can quantum boost their abundance and their success with the colors white, ivory white, and peach. Energy number seven can quantum boost all their abundance and their career with the colors silver, opal essence, and diamond. For energy number eight and the women that have energy number five, their quantum colors are rose, pink, and fuchsia. Energy number nine can activate their abundance and their success with the colors emerald green, citrus green, and an Irish blue, who's kind of a metal blue. Placing these colors in your personal success direction will exponentially create abundance and success. So you will receive instructions, also cards, for these areas to place in that area. You don't have to use these quantum colors as main colors. They're just like acupuncture colors to quantum boost your abundance and success. In this current year, you also will receive where to place a fountain to activate your money flow. Every year, there's a different area of the house that can use this fountain. So look carefully to your instructions. So far, we have focused on space feng shui. But there's also something called time feng shui. Now, you will receive a special PDF to tell you what to do for this current year to update your time energy. Time is all about making sure for this upcoming year you have a stronger activation for your success, health, relationship, and wisdom direction. Look at the instructions to activate the best energy for success and money flow for this year, what to do to activate the healing energy for the current year, how to stimulate the relationship energy for this year, and how to stimulate the wisdom energy for this year. It is possible that these directions are not connected in with your personal energy number. But these are general time activations for the current year. But they do boost you to have this year, the best success, health, relationship, and wisdom.

LESSON 12 – Activate Your Personal Directions for Success
--------------------
<v Marie>In the next practical video clip</v> I'll teach you how to activate your personal directions to create success and money flow. <v ->Oh, hello</v> <v ->Hi.</v> <v ->Good to see you.</v> <v ->Wonderful to be here, Janette.</v> <v ->Yeah, thank you.</v> <v ->I'm so excited I'm going to help you with your success</v> and your house for your business and your family. <v ->I'm looking forward.</v> Come on in. <v ->Thank you.</v> Oh, Janette, you have a wonderful house. <v ->Thank you so much.</v> <v ->Yeah, so...</v> But let's really look at what we can improve for your success in this house. <v ->Okay.</v> <v ->So the first thing I look at when I walk in</v> is the flow of energy. And the first thing I see is you have dead flowers. And dead flowers, well, they're dead. They're not really showing good energy. <v ->Oh, yeah.</v> <v ->So let me look around, oh well,</v> we have more dead flowers here. So that will be the first thing to remove. <v ->They'll go.</v> <v ->They go.</v> Okay, great. Because, you know, it's actually not giving uplifting and positive energy, right? And so, the moment you walk in and that is the first thing you see your subconscious mind will actually take that as an image, take that as a message. So let's, you know, remove that. <v ->Do you want me to remove them?</v> <v ->No...</v> <v ->I'm ready to remove them.</v> <v ->Not now.</v> <v ->We'll do that latter, right?</v> <v ->But also when I came in the first thing I see</v> is this image, it's a beautiful image. What does it represent for you? <v ->This represents spirituality, so we got this</v> we travel a lot, so we got this in New Mexico. In the Navajo village, and the gentleman did not want to sell because it was very personal to him. But he relinquished it, it let us have it. So it means a lot to us because we have a little bit of them. Wherever we travel, we bring things into our world. Well, it's important when you come in that you see something that is really dear to yourself. And so if that is important, we leave it there. But one of the other things I'd definitely do is make sure you make a little more welcoming to the family. So I always suggest when you walk in to have some family pictures up right now. Because what you have is, they're beautiful things, but they're not very personal. <v ->Oh, I see.</v> <v ->Or family related.</v> As you're moving away this, you could actually put a beautiful orchid, right? And you could put a few family pictures of you and your husband and your children. <v ->My children.</v> <v ->You have grandchildren?</v> <v ->I wish.</v> <v ->Well, when they come, you'll definitely add</v> some grandchildren pictures too. <v ->Yeah.</v> <v ->So that is to really maybe say,</v> "This is the house of this family." Because I come in and is not telling me, really, anything personal. <v ->Oh, that's good tip.</v> So you can actually do the same over on this side, you know, you take these dead flowers away, and you know, I see that you're very interested in teapots. <v ->Yes, see?</v> <v ->Because I see a lot of teapots.</v> <v ->From all over.</v> <v ->Very well, there is an okay thing.</v> The only thing I would suggest is to make sure when you look at the teapot that the top of the teapot is never attacking you. <v ->Oh, good tip.</v> <v ->Because they kind of creating a little bit of an attack.</v> <v ->Aggressive.</v> <v ->Over here too also.</v> You just always make sure and you point them out towards the home. Because otherwise you're actually saying to the tea flow out, instead of flowing in. <v ->That's so interesting.</v> <v ->So, Janette, we also need to check out</v> the success of your front door. <v ->Okay.</v> <v ->So based on the app, I checked your direction,</v> you're actually Energy number 6. And that means you're the Archetype of The Creator. And so we need to check if the directions that are on your compass was West, a success direction. There's also Northwest, Southwest and Northeast for you, if your front door is facing one of these directions. <v ->So how do we come to number 6?</v> <v ->Well we put in your birthday.</v> <v ->Oh, okay.</v> <v ->And based on your birthday and your gender</v> we receive information and get the compass for your directions. <v ->Okay, good.</v> <v ->But I'll use my big compass to find out.</v> And so let's stand... Let's us stand in the front door degree and you're actually facing north. And North is not one of your good directions. So I'll do some muscle testing and show you how that affects you. So could you like stand right there. Perfect. And give me your arm, and think about success. <v ->Okay.</v> <v ->Push up as hard as you can.</v> <v ->Oh,</v> I guess my door doesn't work. <v ->Yeah, your door is not a perfect thing for you.</v> <v ->There's why we have to, in every area,</v> really focus on your success direction. So your living room, in your office, we have to really make sure your success direction is activated. And also check, definitely, the direction of your bed. But as we're actually standing here, I actually want to say that as you walk out the energy is kind of cut because you have to kind of walk this way to get to your pathway and part of the energy is blocked with the plants. It's not just the flow that comes in is also the flow that goes out. <v ->I see, I see.</v> <v ->So success is not only about the flow going</v> into your house, but the flow going out of your house. And so, you're actually splitting the energy right now. <v ->Oh, wow.</v> <v ->So I suggest that you actually take these plants out</v> and make it a complete pathway here. Right? Or to get these high level bushes out and put, like, smaller flowers. <v ->That's easy.</v> <v ->That's easier?</v> <v ->That's a little easier to do.</v> <v ->Okay.</v> <v ->This, I can get rid of this.</v> <v ->Because right now you always have to think</v> when you're at the front door, you have to think as a phoenix. Like a bird that opens its wings and now, if the bird would come out, it kind would stumble into your bushes. <v ->Right, your know, you want the phoenix to fly out</v> and the more you actually have space in front of you, the more recognition and fame will come to the people in the house. That's why if you cut this down a little bit, that would be actually much better. <v ->Okay.</v> <v ->And you want ten steps to go out,</v> and you have ten steps. It you think about, from here you have 10 steps before you get to the street. So you have strength to fly out, but you just are tumbling into the bushes. <v ->So leave that clear, and the best colors</v> for a North facing front door is actually white flowers. So I would do that. If you... If I can give you a really good suggestion to have more abundance come into this house, it's to have a fountain here. <v ->A fountain? I love that plan.</v> <v ->Yeah.</v> To have a fountain, but having the fountain kind of come towards your house. So let me show you. And that's actually for a North facing front door. Its actually to put it around here a fountain, but it kind of brings the water towards you. <v ->So one of those things that you buy that can be</v> kind of a half fountain, put against the wall, and the water comes this way? <v ->Yeah. So because...</v> <v ->That's doable.</v> <v ->That's doable, and will be very nice when you walk out</v> to have this lower flowers and to add a fountain. That is not for every house but this would be definitely tripling your income. <v ->That's good, because right now here</v> I feel like I'm going to go into a forest. So, you know. <v ->Correct, you get lost here.</v> <v ->You sort of get lost here.</v> <v ->So now I would like to look at your living room</v> and to make sure that your success direction is activated and that you're in the power position. <v ->Okay.</v> <v ->So let's go in.</v> So Janette as we walk into your home, you see the energy is actually directed with your red carpet from your entrance right way into the piano. Instead of welcoming it to the rest of your home. So when we follow that we need to make sure that whatever we're seeing is definitely telling this is a successful, abundance house. Right now I think we need to address this because it doesn't look the perfect way. Will you come with me? So when I look at this energy that we're pointing at, we first of all, see all these single items, like the people are single, the statues are single, and we have these two masks. The two masks are actually saying, "We're hiding ourselves. We having a mask on." <v ->No, this is not what I want.</v> <v ->I know, you really want people to be actually</v> I'm sure, open and happy. And you're actually saying, you know, "Stay behind the mask, don't feel spontaneous." <v ->So if I, okay, so they didn't work there,</v> because we're very attached to these masks. Would they work over there? <v ->Yes, so the really important part is that this is not</v> opposite to door, and that you can put them somewhere else. But right now they're influencing, actually, the welcoming feeling of people. And so I also would suggest to have like a beautiful nature scene here. I would not do a nature scene with water because we don't want water to be opposite to door because then the water flows away again and water stands for money in Feng Shui. And make sure you put like lamps or some orchids and beautiful images of the family, but in a gold looking frame. <v ->Yeah, because gold stands for abundance,</v> so immediately is saying this family is abundance and happy. So I'd like to redecorate this area. Now in order to really see if that fits you, I'd like to do some muscle testing. <v ->Sure.</v> <v ->Yeah?</v> <v ->Yeah.</v> <v ->So can I have your arm?</v> Okay, perfect. So you push up as I push down. <v ->Okay.</v> <v ->Okay, go up.</v> So think about I'm a woman. <v ->I'm a woman.</v> <v ->Okay, push up.</v> As hard as you can. Think about I'm a man. <v ->Okay.</v> <v ->I'll just push with one finger.</v> <v ->Okay.</v> <v ->You push as hard as you can.</v> <v ->So, I'm a man.</v> <v ->I'm a man.</v> Oh, my God. <v ->I know.</v> You know what happen is your muscles... don't accept this <v ->So think about...</v> <v ->My name is Janette.</v> <v ->My name is Janette.</v> Push as hard as you can. Okay, my name is Peter. <v ->My name is Peter.</v> Of course, that's my partner. <v ->You're not Peter, right?</v> <v ->Not called Peter.</v> <v ->So I'd like you to look at this right now</v> and think about I'm successful. <v ->Okay.</v> <v ->Is whatever is here giving me success?</v> <v ->Is whatever is here giving me success?</v> <v ->Push up as hard as you can.</v> <v ->Oops, we got fix that.</v> <v ->You have to fix that. So it means really</v> that whatever is here is giving you a subconscious message that things are not working for you. So can you just close your eyes and imagine I've removed the masks, I've this beautiful nature scene here, I have family pictures in a golden looking frame, I have some lights here, some orchids, something, you know, very lush. <v ->Can you imagine that?</v> <v ->Yeah.</v> Okay, think about I'm successful. <v ->I'm successful.</v> <v ->Push up as hard as you can.</v> See how strong you are? <v ->Oh my God.</v> <v ->You can feel the difference?</v> <v ->Yeah.</v> <v ->Right?</v> So you can open your eyes again. So this is actually each time you walk in, you're actually giving the wrong message. That's is definitely something we need to address and you'll feel like it's more open, and I'd say even it's a little bit too cluttered. You know? So less is sometimes more. Right? <v ->Okay.</v> <v ->But I love this one because</v> it definitely gives a statement, it's beautiful colors, ceramic is always good for abundance. But, you know, some other things you know, take a little bit away from what is there and focus on success and the family, and the lushness. <v ->Is it good to put a family picture here also?</v> <v ->Yeah, correct.</v> <v ->Maybe a standing plant.</v> <v ->Would that work?</v> <v ->You can do standing plants, definitely,</v> but always make sure for plants that you have plants that have lush flowers. <v ->Okay, I see.</v> <v ->Or lush</v> leaves not like spike leaves. <v ->Oh, round.</v> <v ->Something round that would be okay.</v> And if you have a family picture, make sure is a recent family picture. <v ->Oh, that's harder, no one is here.</v> My kids are grown, you know? <v ->Well, you know, the next family reunion, I would say.</v> So make sure there's not images of them when they were small, because then you're actually saying, you know, I'm keeping them small. Right? Make sure that you have a recent family picture. <v ->Yeah, I'll try to find something.</v> <v ->Okay, wonderful.</v> <v ->Thank you.</v> <v ->It's an excuse to gather the family.</v> <v ->I'm sure, yes</v> So now I would like to move to the living room to see if the living room is actually telling that it's a successful, an abundant family. So let's go there. <v ->Yeah, but watch your step.</v> <v ->Okay, thank you.</v> So when we look at your living room area, actually, your whole setting of your sofas is not the best Feng Shui. Because when you see the front door, the front door is actually, when people walk in, the big sofa is with the back to the door. And that's actually the opposite of power, the opposite of abundance. <v ->No.</v> <v ->So I would really like to reorganize this,</v> and I want you to also feel how your brains are actually affected by this situation here in your living room. So may I ask you to sit down for a second? <v ->Sure.</v> <v ->So this is like if you were to be sitting</v> here with people, and people would walk coming in they would be behind you. Right? So you'd have to... like you just did. You have to turn around. <v ->Yes, I have to turn around.</v> So when you have to turn around you don't see the opportunities, you don't see the success, you don't see the abundance coming in. So let me do some muscle testing with you. <v ->Yes.</v> <v ->So you push up as hard as you can and think about</v> <v ->I'm successful.</v> <v ->I'm successful.</v> <v ->Oh my God.</v> <v ->You're weak, right?</v> Think about I'm abundant. <v ->I'm abundant.</v> <v ->So think about the Queen of England,</v> would she ever sit with her throne, with her back to door? <v ->No, she'd likely get killed.</v> <v ->She would get killed, right?</v> So you actually have the wrong position. And of course you positioned everything towards the fireplace because it looks beautiful, but abundantly you're actually putting yourself in what we call a poverty position. <v ->Oh, oh my God!</v> <v ->So let's not do that.</v> I'm asking you a question, because I think you don't sit here a lot. <v ->No, we never, ever sit here, but I'm getting up right now.</v> We rarely use this. This is a showpiece. <v ->Yeah.</v> <v ->People walk in and then they head into my kitchen.</v> <v ->Well, everything is directed towards that, you know,</v> because you come from the door, you follow the red carpet, you get to that one place where the piano is and then you go to the kitchen. So you're actually walking behind this beautiful sofa. So I want you to sit here to kind of feel the difference. When you'd be sitting here, you would be able to see the door. <v ->Yes.</v> <v ->Can I do the muscle testing?</v> <v ->Yes.</v> <v ->So think about I'm successful.</v> <v ->I'm successful.</v> <v ->Push up.</v> <v ->Okay, you feel the difference?</v> <v ->Yeah.</v> <v ->You can resist.</v> <v ->I can resist.</v> I feel stronger. <v ->So that's why I would like to reposition this area,</v> and I would like to take this big sofa and put it here. Like this. Right? Then we would definitely put your beautiful coffee table in this way and then we put two other little sofas like this. So just imagine you'd be standing like this. <v ->Uhum.</v> <v ->Or siting like this, you see you see the door.</v> <v ->I see the door.</v> <v ->And then people would be able to walk in</v> and position themselves around the coffee table, because right now, you're actually are blocking the good energy. <v ->And it's very easy to do, because all I have to do</v> is move the couch, put the two chairs over there. And you think there's enough space for that couch? <v ->Yeah, there's definitely enough space.</v> Because you will redirect also your carpet, right? <v ->Yeah, and I can move the couch out slightly</v> so it doesn't come... <v ->Yeah, of course. You're actually</v> will create some more space. Another aspect here is that is kind of neutral, is not very welcoming. So I would add some colors. And really good color for welcoming is oranges and peaches, so we're going to redesign it and I'm going to put some pillows on and you'll see. We need to get intention here because now everything is directed away from this area. So we have to put in the energy. <v ->And then intention has to come in through that front door</v> because what I used to do in the past is forget this room. <v ->Yes.</v> <v ->And how everyone would go over there,</v> and by time they go over there is over, right? <v ->It is.</v> <v ->Lost opportunity .</v> <v ->Yes, you did, you lost opportunity.</v> <v ->That's lost opportunity.</v> <v ->And so another aspect is actually</v> this beautiful area here. If you look at your fireplace, and people come in, that's the first thing they will see here. So let's be honest, being overlooked by Chinese ancient soldiers is not that welcoming, right? <v ->I love these too, but I get it.</v> I understand. <v ->And so, you have that other beautiful image there</v> of like a family reunion. <v ->Um-hum.</v> <v ->Right?</v> So I'd like to hang this over here, you can swap that. <v ->Yeah, that's doable.</v> <v ->That's doable?</v> So again because you created this beautiful area here with lush flowers and so on, but I want to tell people the family can come and sit here, there's a gathering possible. Cause now you're just saying, we're ready to fight, we are warriors. <v ->Oh, my God, no.</v> <v ->And people will not feel welcome to be here.</v> <v ->Yeah?</v> <v ->Yes.</v> So I would change that. Again your beautiful teapots, but again, they are attacking everybody. So you can totally turn them around like this. <v ->Maybe I should rethink teapots</v> and put lamps or something. <v ->You do have a lot, let's be honest.</v> <v ->That's it, the collection is over.</v> I'll think of something else. So one of the things you could do, especially when there's an area where you want people to gather and feel welcome and be abundant, is to add some more things from ceramics of crystals. <v ->Crystal is a good thing.</v> <v ->That's actually a really beautiful thing.</v> Another thing I though it was kind of cute were your beautiful elephants. Because they are actually saying, you know, "Look at our beautiful back." Right? <v ->I was told that the elephants</v> always have to point East, right? So that's not really true. Good, because I never, never liked this. But I was sort of thinking, "Oh, no, bad vibes." But then I'm seeing there's bad vibes everywhere, so let's fix it. Well, let's put it this way, your sofa is a much important thing than the elephants facing East. So I would like to suggest to place them in such a way you know, that... They are pointing, definitely, to this area away from the door. And then people see how beautiful and powerful they are. I would never put them opposite each other because when they have, they're set up this way they're attacking each other. <v ->They're attacking.</v> <v ->So I would do this, right?</v> <v ->I like that so much better already.</v> <v ->Yeah?</v> <v ->I do.</v> So this is something we're going to redesign, we're going to put the sofa differently, add some beautiful colors. And then we're going to hang something differently and then you'll feel that people will have more a feeling of I would say, warmth and harmony. But also this will make you more successful. <v ->I like that.</v> <v ->And create more income.</v> Because you have a very successful energy coming in but then you're anchoring it. Because right now you bring that all to the kitchen and you don't want the abundance and the success to go to the kitchen, you want to anchor it in the first place in your home. <v ->Well I definitely want the place to feel more welcoming.</v> You know? I love the success too, if that comes, great. But the welcoming is a big important part for all of us. <v ->Okay, let's rearrange like that.</v> <v ->Let's rearrange.</v> <v ->So now as we have looked at the general flow of this area</v> I want also to look at your personal success direction. <v ->Okay.</v> <v ->So I checked on the app</v> and checked your... <v ->Oh, wow! Look at that.</v> <v ->Yeah, checked your birthday.</v> So based on your birthday, we actually see that West is your success direction. <v ->Oh, wow!</v> <v ->So we want to see in this area,</v> what is actually in the West area. It's actually over there, so why don't we move over there. <v ->Okay.</v> <v ->If we look at what is in your success direction</v> we actually see this area here. So you have, for example, a red statue, I think is a taurus, is that correct? <v ->It's a bull, it's a bull.</v> <v ->It's a bull, yeah?</v> And so we have a beautiful image here, I think it's also painted by your mother? <v ->It's my grandmother that painted that.</v> <v ->Your grandmother.</v> <v ->She was very special.</v> <v ->And then you have here images of your family.</v> <v ->Yes, my dad.</v> You know, family. <v ->Okay, wonderful.</v> <v ->If you look at these I want to check</v> your success energy, you know, how does it feel, because it's connect with your family, but it's like the past. It's not like towards the future. <v ->Okay.</v> <v ->So can I do some muscle testing on that?</v> <v ->Sure, which one do you like?</v> <v ->This one, let's keep this one.</v> So think about success, look at this area. Think about success, as hard as you can push up. Push up. Okay, you see? It's not as weak, but it's... <v ->It could use some help.</v> <v ->It could use some help.</v> May I ask you, the bull, is that a symbol that connects with you? <v ->My husband found that in Mexico.</v> It does connect because I grew up in South America, so I like something that reminds me of Latin culture. <v ->Okay, so we can, for example, focus first there</v> and let's check. So look at it, think about success. So, you see, that is strong. <v ->Yes, yes.</v> <v ->So if you look now at this area here,</v> and think about success. <v ->You see? That is weak.</v> <v ->So that..</v> <v ->That's more family.</v> <v ->Yes, it's family oriented, but its the past.</v> Now West as you will see based on the energy number, can use everything silver, everything metal. <v ->Metal.</v> <v ->Crystals, ceramics.</v> So there is some of that, but again is the past. <v ->Hum, yeah.</v> <v ->So as you coming in from the entrance here</v> in your living room, in the living room you have to focus on the now and the future. <v ->The future.</v> <v ->Right?</v> Again, cause in a living room you want to focus on family, this is not your business. <v ->Right now.</v> But you can place things connected with your business if you wish to. But this is not your office area. <v ->No, I'm not interested in putting my office here.</v> <v ->Okay, so let's focus on your family.</v> Again, I would put here an image of your family or even a painting connected in with family gathering. Because right now, it just doesn't give me... the strength. <v ->Yeah, the strength.</v> <v ->So can you just imagine that we would remove this.</v> I'll just kind of put them down for the moment, cause that is the past. <v ->Okay.</v> <v ->And in your success direction you want to go always</v> from the now to the future. <v ->Future, yes.</v> <v ->So is there anything that you feel like,</v> a country you'd like to travel to? Or goals you have. <v ->I've got every country.</v> How about that? <v ->That is really interesting, so you want to travel.</v> <v ->Yes, a lot.</v> <v ->Why don't we then imagine there is like</v> a crystal globe, for example. We can find beautiful globes and in crystal. <v ->Yeah, I like that.</v> <v ->And is also good to have a light here</v> because you always want to shine the light in your success direction. And we can add some silver or golden statues. Or perhaps you have some of your beautiful teapots, that are made out of silver and gold looking or copper. <v ->There's that face there.</v> Or is that mask, is a scary thing? <v ->Thinking about your masks, right?</v> <v ->You want to do away with the masks that love so much.</v> Don't put them in your success direction because you're masking your success. So can you image that globe and a beautiful light? And, you know, I have a feeling that that is not so bad, but it's the past. And what I'm a little bit concerned about is that the water... It this water or is that a road? <v ->Um-hum.</v> <v ->No, it kind of goes down.</v> Or you can see it goes up, it depends how you look at it. <v ->Oh, yeah.</v> That's very typical rainforest in Latin America after a monsoon. <v ->Okay.</v> <v ->This puddles that appear mysteriously from nowhere.</v> <v ->Okay, so it's important to ask each time</v> what the image represents. So it's like after monsoon, you know, it's not like an uplifting energy. <v ->No, it's...</v> water ground swell. <v ->Okay, so then that's not a good image</v> for your success direction. <v ->So I can move this around.</v> <v ->Get moved around, get again something</v> that is an uplifting energy. So, can you just imagine? <v ->Yes.</v> <v ->That there is a globe, there's the family picture,</v> there is a light, there is a different nature scene. Can you do that? <v ->Yes, I can do it.</v> <v ->Think about success, pushing hard as you can.</v> You see how strong you are? I can keep pushing. So definitely that will stimulate you, even if you are actually not here still influences you 24 hours a day. <v ->Right.</v> <v ->Each time when you walk in,</v> in this first area of your home, your success will be activated. <v ->Okay, great.</v> <v ->Okay?</v> <v ->Yeah, yeah.</v> <v ->Thank you.</v> <v ->You're welcome.</v> <v ->So Janette, we've just redesigned</v> and re Fung Shuidyour living room. How do you like it? <v ->I love it.</v> I'm really excited about this whole thing. It never occurred to me to have it look like this. I mean, I though, I just call this looking at the chimney. <v ->Yes, and now everybody can still see the chimney.</v> <v ->Right?</v> <v ->Yes, that's right.</v> <v ->But you can see the door,</v> you can see all the opportunities. So I also added some colors that really will bring forward some success and some joy. You know, the peach is for joy and orange, the blues are more for success. I would like to do a little testing with you. <v ->Sure.</v> <v ->Can you please take a seat?</v> Now you're the Queen, come on, sit down. <v ->I'll go in the middle.</v> <v ->Well, go in the middle.</v> <v ->I get to sit in the middle in my own house.</v> <v ->Wonderful.</v> Now you see the door. <v ->Right?</v> <v ->I see the door.</v> <v ->How does it feel?</v> It just feels very inviting and welcoming, I feel now that I can actually have a party here. <v ->Yes, and now you can enjoy this place.</v> <v ->And we can eat the food I put here.</v> <v ->Yeah, of course.</v> So let me do some muscle testing. Think about success. <v ->Okay.</v> <v ->Push up.</v> See? You're strong. <v ->Wow!</v> <v ->Think about money flow, abundance.</v> <v ->You're strong right now.</v> <v ->Yes.</v> <v ->Okay?</v> So now wee have actually invited abundance and success into your living room. I also want to test now your personal success direction because we did some changes there. <v ->Okay.</v> <v ->So let us go there.</v> <v ->Alright, you lead the way.</v> <v ->Okay.</v> <v ->So</v> you see, we actually placed a different natural scene, you have some still water, but is good for the West. You have a little bit of a mountain feeling that always give a lot of strength and power. We put a beautiful, lush flower, an image of you with your husband, smiling in a silver frame. We don't have yet the Earth globe, but we do have some crystals here. I would like to test you out. It that's okay with you? <v ->Of course.</v> <v ->If you could look towards that area</v> and think about success. <v ->Wow!</v> You can feel that? <v ->Yeah, I feel a huge difference.</v> <v ->Yeah, think about money.</v> <v ->Yes.</v> <v ->Okay.</v> Push up. Let's see, wow. <v ->It's very, very strong.</v> We started really shifting the energy now. So first steps are done. <v ->Great.</v> I'm so excited. Thank you so much. <v ->You're so welcome.</v> This will be making a big difference. <v ->I can't wait.</v> <v ->So let's check out your office space now.</v> <v ->Yes, let's do that.</v> I spend a lot of time here. <v ->And you know what?</v> I'm wondering how your success is going to be here. <v ->It's going to be interesting, we'll see.</v> <v ->So, you have this...</v> <v ->This is my chair, this is where I seat.</v> <v ->So Jeanette we're now here in your office,</v> and I want to check if this office is bringing you success and good money flow. <v ->It could be better.</v> <v ->It could be better, right?</v> The way you're seating right now, remember we talked about the power position, so you're always facing that direction so turn towards that. <v ->Okay.</v> <v ->And you're actually seating with your back to the door.</v> <v ->Right?</v> Again, people coming in, opportunities come in, you don't see them. Can I do a little muscle testing? The way your positioning, look there. <v ->Okay.</v> <v ->Push up as hard as you can.</v> <v ->There is no energy.</v> Right? You're actually facing a painting. I don't know what this painting means, but it looks very chaotic for me. And also you're hitting with your focus the wall. <v ->Yeah.</v> <v ->So that's not a really good point.</v> One of the first things we're going to do is make sure this desk is pointing the right direction, seeing the door, and facing one of your good directions. <v ->Okay.</v> <v ->Now in order to do that, I need to go back to your compass</v> and if I look where your success direction here is. It is actually, kind of here, in this energy here. There's nothing over there except a beautiful window and some lush plants. And so, actually, I want to make sure you see the door and you face one of your four directions. You see, you know, that your success of action is here but there is a help of action over there. So if I would position you this way. Sitting like this, exactly like this. <v ->Okay.</v> You see, you're facing Northeast, so you see the door. <v ->Yeah.</v> If I were to put your desk like this, I'll also put in a kitty corner, but it works. Can you imagine thinking about success right now? <v ->I will.</v> <v ->Push up as hard as you can.</v> See how strong you are? <v ->Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.</v> <v ->Would you think about money.</v> <v ->Yes.</v> <v ->Okay.</v> See how strong you are? <v ->Oh, wow. That's pretty impressive.</v> <v ->Yeah.</v> So this is how're going to redesign your office. You have a good chair, a high back chair. That's pretty good. <v ->Yeah, it's comfy.</v> We'll probably take away this chair because it's a little bit too, too much here. I do love that you have a sofa over there because this is like your clients. <v ->Yeah, and they're comfortable.</v> <v ->You can talk to your clients now.</v> <v ->Yes.</v> <v ->The way you're siting before</v> you couldn't even see your clients. <v ->Yes, that's right.</v> <v ->So we do that.</v> And we're going to activate it with some right colors, I would work with golds and blue pillows, because that are good colors for that. <v ->It'll liven it up.</v> <v ->Yeah.</v> Because right now is not really telling me anything about success, and what is really funny here, is look at all these toys. <v ->These are leftovers from my children.</v> <v ->I can understand that.</v> And the beautiful monkey, right? So unless you're in the toy business... <v ->No.</v> <v ->Which you're not.</v> I would definitely take these out. <v ->I know, I couldn't bring myself to part with them,</v> but I'm ready now. It's time, time to say goodbye to the toys. <v ->Yeah, give them to Goodwill.</v> But what is really important is that in your success direction, which is kind in this direction here, so you could use that wall to put your logo of your company, certificates. And your relationship direction was really interesting because business is about relationships. <v ->Yeah.</v> <v ->Yeah?</v> It's actually here, this is your relationship energy. And this is a discounted picture, and so, clients, relationships aren't just counted right now. With the monkey, so... That is not good. So I would definitely make sure you place there images of some of your famous clients I know. <v ->Yeah.</v> <v ->You could perhaps have.</v> <v ->I could probably do that.</v> <v ->It could be a team picture, if you have a team,</v> take a picture of your team. <v ->Yeah, that'd be good.</v> <v ->I don't know if your clients</v> are working globally. Or you as a company working globally. <v ->Some are, but some are very private.</v> But I can put it here, this is my private space. <v ->It's your private space, right?</v> <v ->Yeah.</v> <v ->If you feel like you want to really embrace,</v> make them more globally, you could hang a map of the world. Or if it's just the USA, hang a map of the USA. <v ->I like the map of the world.</v> <v ->Yeah?</v> Okay, so I'll definitely redesign this because the way it's now I feel like again, like it in your living room, you don't see the opportunities. <v ->I see.</v> <v ->You don't see the possibilities, even if you work hard,</v> it's like you're not getting to the 33% of success and money flow that Feng Shui could bring you. <v ->Okay.</v> <v ->But redesigning you'll really feel a big shift.</v> That's definitively something I want to do here. <v ->Great.</v> <v ->Okay.</v> <v ->Let's go for it.</v> <v ->Yeah, let's do it.</v>

LESSON 13 – Boost Your Money & Success: Meditation & Exercises

- The first exercise for this upcoming week is a meditation to quantum boost your success and money flow. May I invite you to close your eyes. And sit towards your success direction. So turn your chair and focus towards your personal success direction. Close your eyes and take a deep breath in and take a deep breath out. Fill your whole body with crystal white light coming from the universe, creating energy in your body and in your aura fields. And any stress and any tensions that you might have, let them go by breathing deeply out. Breathe in and allow this universal energy come into your body, and your aura field, and breathe out, and let go of all the negative thoughts, feelings and energy. Imagine now you're standing in the center of your house. And you're walking towards your front door, and you open the front door. We're calling in now from the universe the color royal blue, the quantum color for success. And we visualize in that a stream, a ray of royal blue comes in from the universe, coming through your door, filling your whole home. Every place. But especially, you direct the royal blue to your living room and your personal success direction in the living room and bless it with the universal color of success. And then direct this ray of royal blue, this flow of royal blue towards your office and bless whatever you have placed there to activate your success and money flow. And then go back to your front door and we're calling in now from the universe the quantum color gold. And we're bringing it into your home and into your space, allowing and receiving the abundance of the universe. And fill your whole house with that color. But especially directed to the personal success direction in your living room, blessing that area with universal abundance. And then direct the gold and follow the flow to your office and bless your personal success direction with the golden vibration of abundance. Take a deep breath in and allow to receive all this abundance. And then go back to your entrance and we're calling in the color orange who is a color of celebration, of manifesting true joy, all your goals about success and money flow, and allow that golden energy to come in and fill your whole house. And direct it especially to the success direction in your living room, blessing it with celebration. And direct it also to your office space and bless your success direction with the orange color for celebrating your success and money flow goals to celebrate the results of your success and money flow. And then go back to the center of the house, close the door to keep these wonderful blessings inside of your house and just feel that deep gratitude within yourself. That success and money flow are here for you now. Take a deep breath in now, bring your hands together, move your hands, bring your warm hands in front of your eyes, open your eyes and let go of your bands. The next exercise is to start with the feng shui of your office and your living space for success and money flow and to share your pictures with the community. In the next chapter, we will focus on your health and your well-being. So your next exercise for the coming week is to declutter your bedroom and your living room. I'm looking very much forward to help you next week with your health and your well-being.

LESSON 14 – Q&A with Marie Diamond

Hi everyone, good morning, good afternoon, good evening, whatever the case might be for you. I am Alex and on behalf of the Mindvalley team, I'd like to welcome you to your Feng Shui live Q &A coaching call number two. We have a great session prepared for you today. I know this because we receive a ton of questions, exactly like last time. So we'll see how we can deal with all of this enthusiasm and curiosity. We have very interesting topics that we'll cover, but they belong mainly to chapters three. which is uh your home is a three -dimensional vision board and chapter four which is feng shui your success and business and i believe you'll get a lot of great insights from this session that being said and without further ado let's welcome directly from london our wonderful teacher marie hello everyone it's so wonderful to be with you and so uh i see so many people from all over the world and so thank you um to be here and um i just been So amazed in how you have been really taking the class serious and doing your work because I can teach as much as I want. If you're not taking action, nothing happens. Very proud of you that you're taking action, decluttering the first weeks and now really putting things in place. And I know there's different layers and some of you want to run through the course, right? And others of you just really need to take step by step and all is fine. And I would just like us to take a little deep breath in and close our eyes for a second. And as you're breathing in and out, just... Allow the Qi of the universe to flow through you by breathing in. And as you breathe out, allow all the stress, what we call Sha Qi, to get out of your body. And the more you breathe in the energy from the universe that we call Sheng Qi, the more we're actually allowing it to nurture our body. And especially you can direct it to places in your body where you feel you need some help. And as you breathe out, release from the places in your body where there's too much stress or pain or uncomfortable feeling and release it out of your body. Beautiful. And then one long, take one long breath in, hold the space for you and breathe out. Very wonderful. Bring your hands together. bring your warm hands in front of your eyes open your eyes and let go of your hands and you are ready now and centered okay what's the first question i understand that specific areas of the house or the office represent different sectors like relationship wealth health what is the difference between our favorable sectors so for example my personal relationship sector might be different from the general areas specific sector which do we actually follow well the first thing is we have our personal feng shui and that's based on your energy number and you have four directions and um there are areas in your home that connect with that let's say you have energy number two and northeast is your success direction so whatever is in the success area so the northeast of that home that affects you personally yeah now We have, for example, the Northwest is your relationship direction. Let's say that's where the kitchen is, that having a kitchen there and your relationship direction will affect you personally. So that's one thing. So you look first at what is there and how does it affect me? If there's an active space, like a living room, a bedroom, an office, personal good directions it will benefit you more than if there would be a garage or a kitchen or a storage unit it will actually affect you more negative yeah then for sure if that's like in your whole house you need to activate these directions for sure in your bedroom office and your living space as much as possible because the bigger a framework is not positive for you then you make it sure it's positive in the smaller version meaning in a specific room. Now we also have the whole house connecting with general what we call general space feng shui and so general space feng shui means that every area stands for a certain quality of life. For example, the South stands for fame and entertainment. The Southwest stands for relationships and romance. But, you know, this is more general. So you can look for yourself and then you can look more general. So let's say the general means it affects for everyone in the house. Whatever the personal energy number is, it will affect everyone. Give you an example. Again, the Southwest, it stands for romance. And if you have there a bathroom, that will affect everyone that wants to have love, a romance, even if that is not your personal direction. if it's on top of it one of your personal directions then you have you know both not good so one for everyone for romance let's say it's also your health direction then it will be not good for romance and for health yeah so that's what you're doing when you look at your floor plan you look at your whole floor plan and indicate where your directions are your personal directions are and see like oh that is you know my success direction is my living room, well, that's better than if it would be your bathroom, right? And if then your living room is, for example, in the north, well, it stands for career, the north. Well, having a living room there is more positive than if you would have a kitchen there. Yeah. So again, it's like you first look at your personal energy and then you look at the more general and you write that down and then you start understanding perhaps why you have certain problems in your law of attraction. If, for example, you have your health direction is the EAST and we know the E stands general for the health, for everyone. And you have there your garage, then you have both personal and general a problem because Having a garage there will not benefit your health and the health from everybody else. So then you have like a double negative if that would be personal and general in a wrong area. Should we use magnetic north or true north to determine our four directions? I have done both and they are quite different. Feng Shui is based on magnetic Nord, not true Nord. Yes, because our body reacts to the magnetic fields. It doesn't react to the true Nord. So what actually happens is our body contains also iron. the element iron in our bloodstream. And it's because of that that we react to the magnetic energy. So you actually need to follow the magnetic energy of your home because that's where your body and also your brain will react to. If some favorable sectors are located in areas like a toilet or a garage, what do we do? Well, first of all, you cannot change that toilet or that garage. I mean, it's there. Right. So always I say then in that case, make sure it's very well organized and you keep it clean. And let's say you have a toilet there. What you can still do is make sure it keeps it fresh. Yeah. So not just that it's clean, but there's always a nice smell there. You can also, if you have a toilet in that area, place an image even on the door of towards the toilet. that is kind of a landscape or flowers or even a mirror on it. So to kind of say, well, there's not really a toilet, it's something else. So you could do that, right? For a garage, it's a bit more difficult because it's a bigger space. So in case that's your favorable areas of the whole house. definitely make sure if it doesn't work in the larger space, that you activate these areas in the smaller spaces. That means your bedroom, your workspace, your living room, even your family room, if you have that. So I always say if it doesn't work in the bigger space, activate it in the smaller space. It will still help you, but just make sure you keep these areas clean, fresh, and organized. When multiple people live in a home that has different numbers, how can I activate my areas without weakening theirs or vice versa? So one of the things is when you are activating for you, you always put the intention in it. So let's say you're activating a certain area for your success. and whenever you place a symbol or an item or a color say very explicit out loud to the universe you know i activate it for me right and then you know you can make sure that there's in that same area there's some space for your sample to activate his or her good energy. So, and again, you place it with your name. You can say, well, this is activated for that person. So if, for example, in the north for you, but the north stands for the relationship for your partner, then make sure it's both placed, but don't mingle or don't mix the energies. So don't hang or put the symbols all through each other. Make sure there's some separation between the two. areas where you activate. So, and as you're placing it with intention, you have to understand the universe remembers that because you're the universe, you know, this is activated for this person, this is activated for this other person. And again, having it all perfect is not always possible, right? So some of you are saying, I don't have space like to put it separate, like left and right, but perhaps you have space to put one higher and one a little bit lower. yeah so this is the best you can and put the intention in it that's the best thing many of us use colored rocks and crystals to decorate and elevate the room with energy i noticed that you do not reference them in your list are crystals and stones not good feng shui oh yes they are definitely good feng shui um we um I would suggest that you have to understand that crystals are connected with the earth element. So when you want to activate generally, you can always place them in the southwest, in the center of a space, and the northeast area to activate the earth element of these areas. You can also enhance the metal areas of west and northwest to activate the areas these are the more metal but earth activates the metal so you can place them always in that area i would try to avoid to place too many crystals in the north the south the east and the southeast because there they are kind of taking away the energy so because they have other elements and it's possible that crystals weaken the energy. So be careful the way you're putting it together, but there's perfect good areas for crystals. And there are areas that I won't say that one crystal is okay, but not like putting all your crystals in the North will actually stop. career or stop the energy where the north stands for for you. So that's why when you look at your energy number book that you will see certain areas will be or certain numbers will use more crystals than other areas or or other numbers. It is stated in your guide that it's best to sleep with the top of the head facing east. Yet in each category for example relationship success etc there are different head points to face. This seems confusing. Is it good Feng Shui to continually alter your bed -head direction? When you look at the energy number book, it means that if you want to activate success, then it's better to sleep with your head towards success. If you want to activate health, you will activate it towards your health direction. But it actually means that you need to... best pointed towards one of your four good directions yeah but if you want a specific area to be activated you try to sleep towards that direction but you always try to see the door too so it's sometimes a little bit difficult okay so you can say um i want to see the door when i wake up so by now you you raise your head you're like oh i see the door that's the first rule then try to sleep with your head pointed towards one of the four good directions but if you have several choices in your room what sometimes is possible then you can see what do i really want to activate so if you for example say well i have a choice between pointing towards my success or towards my relationship direction in my room and i really want romance then i would point towards your relationship direction because you attract easier relationship. But if you're saying, you know, I'm cool with relationships, I want to create more money, then sleep towards your success direction, yeah? Even if people are, for example, sick and they are laying in their couch, for example, to recuperate during the day, I then sometimes suggest to people, especially if they come like from a hospital or they have been through some major health crisis, to during the day in their living room to sleep with their head to help at least if that's easier to change because it's a sofa couch that you're going to change. Changing your bed is much more complicated. I have never been interested in house decorations or with stuff on them. I keep things to a minimum. I feel stuck and my decluttered home now looks very empty. Are there Feng Shui objects which also have practical uses to include in our lives? Yeah, I understand that, you know, when you're already very zen and very, you know, not having too much around you and then you declutter, like it's now kind of... So what I would suggest to you is start working with adding plants. Yeah, because plants are immediately giving an atmosphere. So you can always place them in the southeast and the southeast area of your living room. Again, you don't place them in your bedroom. You always can put some candles out. I mean, a beautiful candle is always filling the space. Candles are the best in the south, northeast, center. and southwest of a space. You also can hang beautiful images up. You can look for some posters and then looking based on your energy number, success, health, relationship, or wisdom direction to place some posters or beautiful paintings in the areas that work for you. based on success or relationship or health i understand what you're saying i'm quite zen too i don't like all too much small things so just by putting your furniture putting something nice on your tables hanging some a few very strong images and putting some crystals and plants around it will just definitely bring the energy up How do we correct arrows created by sharp corners of a room that cut across our lines of Gucci flow in our health direction? A little bit what you have as possibility. Some people put, if it's not in your bedroom, you can put a plant on it or hang a plant. up just where the edge is some people put a scarf on top of it and kind of let the scarf hang over the edge some people take a tube and they kind of cut it in two and then make sure the the tube is like on the edge yeah so it's like it becomes round like almost like half a pillar yeah so there are you know a lot of practical things but just hanging for example a wind chime in front of it or a hanging crystal will not do it because it's not because you hang something that the rest of the edge is cured. So what I sometimes just do is I hang sometimes a scarf like a long scarf in the same color as the wallpaper so it just doesn't show up so much. You try to be very I would say creative. Some people have hanged like a few beads up there. So everything that I would say this, let your focus not be on the edge. Yeah. So it's like they're hanging something has people hanging, um, lamps kind of as a, in a meandering way over the edge. I mean, you can play with a lot of things on that. What are some tips on finding the balance for those that have a bedroom that also doubles as an office? It's a question that comes back a lot. Depending on what is the possibilities, some people have suggested to hang a curtain between your workspace and your bedroom. Others, it's sometimes easier to hang a screen or to place a screen or a paravan so that you would not look at the other part of your room. Because you have the passive and the... active energy. So when you're working, you have to be active. When you're sleeping, you're passive. So you don't want to mix these two energies together. So there are some possibilities to work with. If you still can, take your office out of your bedroom. Make sure you place, for example, on your dining area and just leave on your workspace. in your bedroom, just papers, right? And then you cover the papers with a fabric or something before you go to sleep, but work and call not in your bedroom, yeah? Because again, your brain is like saying, what do I do now? Do I sleep? Do I work? Do I make money? make love. I mean, it's like, it's kind of confusing. So if you have important calls to make or important conversations, don't do them in your bedroom, then do it in your living room or in your dining room, or even go out and go to a place, you know, where you have more positive energy. What to choose, king position or best direction position? in my office space is it more important to face the door and none of my best directions or is it better to face one of my directions with the back to the entrance door the first rule always remember is being the king or the queen in your space yeah so seeing the door is a first rule and then you try to face your good direction sometimes it's really not possible sometimes it's like you can put your desk a certain way but then your screen, you can kind of turn your screen towards a good direction. If that is not possible, make sure you see the door and activate the four good directions in your environment. I had this happening too in my life that I was just able to see the door and I was facing not one of my good directions, but I was still doing better than with my back to the door while I was activating the good directions. um i had i mean i move a lot in my life so i have a lot of examples but i remember that my success direction was once behind me right so i couldn't even see what my vision board was but when i came in i could see it i took some time to look at it even a few minutes in the morning but still when i was sitting i could see the door And because you see the door, your brainwaves will already go into alpha -free vibration. So you already will be better off. I have people facing their good directions, but with their back to the door, you know, they will be fine, but they will never be as strong as seeing the door. A variation on this is, can you face the door at an angle? You have to look at how your eyes are looking. your eyes are looking like this yeah so the 90 degrees right or the 90 degrees left you don't really look you have to say like i'm working on my computer i don't see who comes in here of course if i turn my head i do so make sure when you put yourself in such position that you have this angle right that's like 45 degrees from the front of your nose to 45 degrees to the right of your nose that's actually the angle that we have a natural connection with. So if you have that and you can see without moving your head, the people coming in, you're fine. If you're not, then turn it around a little bit. Now, some people always want everything to be vertical and horizontal. Sometimes just very slightly switching your desk a certain way. And you can say, well, it's kind of odd. It's kind of odd. interior design it is but feng shui it's not so you know changing a little bit that you have that view will actually benefit you very much how do we know if we have to if we have to include a terrace or a balcony in our floor map or not when we look at a house we look first of all at the whatever is covered right so a terrace or a balcony is not covered completely it's not like you have to look at your house where everything is closed so the three -dimensional is in place so a balcony or a terrace can be an extension of a certain area let's say in the south you have a balcony or a terrace then it actually means the south area will be activated even more. But you're not there all the time. It's not in a covered energy. The same with the garage. Some people say, well, I have a garage, but if it's a covered garage, means it has a roof, it has walls, there's a direct access from inside the house, then you actually have it part of the house. If it's just... garage that you drive in and there's like an opening you know it's it's not covered there's not like a garage door that covers it and it's closed on top or not closed on top then it's not considered part of your floor plan that you have to look for your good directions we can see it as an extension But it's not something we really have at the first place to look at our vision board, the home as a three -dimensional vision board. Is your personal energy number only good for one year and then it changes? How do you calculate the next year if this is so? And does that mean that you have to change your home every year? Your energy number is something you receive. From the moment you're born. So this is like connect with your birthday. So this is for the rest of your life. You have your energy number. It doesn't change, right? So I'm born as energy number five. And, you know, this is for the rest of my life. Now what this person is probably focusing on is that there is something what we call yearly time feng shui. where we kind of tell what is for a certain year a stronger energy for health or for relationship or for success and money. But that's an extra activation. And when we give the course, we actually tell for this year, as we are now in a certain year, this is some extra things you can do to activate it even stronger. But it doesn't change your energy number. Now, every year, there's what we call the yearly time feng shui. There are some things that will be stronger. Like, for example, my success direction this year is very, very strong. So last year, it was a little bit more difficult. But it's not saying that it's difficult, but the energy was lower. But that's why what we do, we place some activations and cures to make it even stronger. think about it's a very strong success year for me um and you know i i work with mind value this year so it's actually really amazing but um it just started happening because the beginning of the year that's when vision called me i mean he didn't call me the year before or the year before because it was just not the right time my law of attraction was not so strong as this year right But it still means that Southwest is my success direction. That doesn't change. Technically, everything is activated based on your personal energy number. And each year, if you want an extra, like you want to improve on the work that you have already done, then you have this annual time activation. Is that correct? Yes, correct. You said that in the office, where our success direction is, we can hang certificates on the wall. My question would be like, is it okay to hang certificates from past careers or do we have to have certificates that show what we are doing now in the present day? I would say you can definitely place things from past career, but I would start with certificates on top of your current career. And because on top means more current and to the bottom means the past. Yeah. So, so if there are like, let's say they have 10 certifications. Focus first on the more current ones and then go down to the ones that are more from the past. Next question. Do you need to see the item or image for it to affect your energy? I would say it's better that you see it because, you know, we are working with bringing the unconsciousness to the consciousness. So if you see something, your unconsciousness will receive it. and it will come forward to the consciousness. So that's why putting it in a closet or putting an image behind something, your eyes don't see it, so you won't receive the message from it. So try to have it as visible as possible. Let's see here. In the video, Marie said to not enter through the garage. But I have the main door through my garage. What can I do in this case? Yes. Well, then there's not a lot of alternatives, right? When you have your main door there. So make sure your garage is as cleaned up as possible. And that when you come into the door, then from your garage, that it's as pleasant as possible. And, you know. I would say there is at this moment no alternative so just next time when you have another house look for another front door. In an office I'm sitting in the power position but is it better to have the door open so the energy comes in or is it okay to work with the door closed to have more privacy? oh, you can definitely close your door. That's not a problem. It's just that when the door opens, you see the people come in. Now, I have to tell you, some people are really getting very good at feng shui because they see that there's something behind you there, a little cactus. And they're saying, this is not good to have in your home. So I just want to let you know, good on all of you that have seen that. There's like a little red flag there based on the feng shui. The arrangement of our house or office, is it active only when we are present in the space or also when we are not in the space? That is a very good question. I always say it's always present because even if you're not there, your energy is anchored there. It's where you have your address. It's where you live. does affect you all the time so i'm traveling you know half of the month you know in many months and still you know having my home a specific area organized feng shui wise perfectly it does affect me wherever i am not just um when i'm there it affects me all the time so because if you have your address there it it's like an anchoring of your energy in a business meeting In our own company or in a partner's company, should I choose a power position? And if yes, which one? Well, I was just in a company and we... talking about that and so I would definitely say if you have a conference area make sure you're in the position if you're the one that wants to have most power that is the furthest away from the door if possible so that you there's nobody sitting further than you right when they come in so that means you'll be in the most strong position as a king or a queen. And then also try to face one of your good directions. So depending on how the table or how the sitting area is organized, try to always sit in such a way that you see everyone in the room, right? But from the furthest position from the door. What can we put by windows in the living spaces and offices? keep it free or put furniture next to it you can definitely at windows can place furniture if that you know is appealing and is possible if you want to activate um the areas where your windows are for example you have there your relationship direction and there's a window what do you do right now some people will hang something you know from the window can be stained glass for example that is the right color or the right shape In that case, I always did myself. I just put a little table in front of the window and put some items that are connected with my directions I want to activate so that at least there's some activation or I put some plants in front of it or anything that relates with that area. But you definitely can put some... would say furniture in front of it people ask me sometimes also about their their bed if they can face it against the window if that's pointing towards the right direction said yes you can but you have to make sure that your curtains are very thick and can close off well so you don't have the moonlight shining on you. Yeah, because that is not a good thing. But you can definitely put the bed in front of the window. Can you have flowers in your bedroom? Because you mentioned there should be no plants in the bedroom. Yes, and flowers are considered part of the plants. But again, you can do fake plants, right? You definitely can. put like a fake orchid or something or a fake rose or or silk if you have it in silk it's even better than than plastic so as much as more natural the I would say the material is that the flower or the plant is made of, like silk or even cotton. They do now cotton material to create fake plants or flowers. That is actually better than plastic. If one of our best directions is in a corner, how far from the actual corner is still that direction? can we do in this situation? Sometimes you can actually get yourself like a corner I would say little table or play something round like a round table there and put some things on it. How far is it? Well it depends on how if you would measure your eight directions in the room but I always say it's like you have if the direction is in the middle like you know is the edge of the corner you have like 45 degrees right and 45 degrees left so depending on your measurement of the other areas of the of your room perhaps it could be a meter you know three feet right and three feet a meter left it could be a meter and a half to like five feet right and left i don't know depends on the measurement of your house I see lots of questions here about mirrors. So let's see, Carolina says, mirrors, how can we use them to empower directions? For example, to direct the energy into a space or give a sense of more spaciousness? I think in one of the following courses, we'll go a little bit deeper into it, but let me go quickly into it. Any small space... right, like a hallway that is too narrow, you can place a mirror, so it opens up the energy. Reflecting like a dining area, we always say, doubles the food so just only make sure there is not always clutter on your dining room or leftovers from the day before because then you double all your clutter so that's not a good thing so if you put a mirror to double your dining room make sure there's always flowers or a bowl of fruit on it so you're kind of doubling something beautiful and something that is you know, creating positive energy. You can also place them in your living room if you feel that's a good thing to create a more open space. I try to avoid to put them in your good directions unless that's the only place you want to. You can hang them just to make sure that what the mirror reflects is still activating that direction let's say you want romance and you that's the place where your mirror is and you cannot take it off sometimes certain homes are indicated this way that you cannot take it off but you can hang something across the mirror that has to do with romance then actually when you look in the mirror it looks romance and doesn't look you know a mirror I'm not in favor of hanging mirrors above a fireplace because a fireplace stands for fire, of course, as element. And a mirror stands originally as element for water. So it's like you have water on top of your fire. So that is something I'm really not in favor of. We try to avoid the mirrors in the bedroom, of course, because we double the sleep, we double the stress. We double the people in the bed. That's not always positive. You can place them also in your office area. But there was one question here. I saw somebody had it hanging behind them. That's a place where I would avoid it because you're actually, you know, seeing yourself reflected, but like backwards, right? So that's a very uncomfortable feeling. People feel much more in fear when they have the mirror behind them. I don't like to have the mirror in front of me too, because when I look at the mirror, I see myself all the time. You can say, well, I doubled myself, I doubled the work. I said, yes, but it's really awkward to see yourself being doubled. If you want, you can put it left or right from you. So that will be an easier way. But every small space, to open up the space, having a mirror could be positive, just not in the bedroom. Is it helpful to paint the room in certain colors, for example, to activate success or romance or health? Or should we wear certain colors to activate success, romance, and health? Can you elaborate on this? Yes, of course. First of all, you can wear your colors like your quantum colors. You can wear them if you want to be more successful, you want to be more healthy, you want to be... know, you're going to a certain dinner date, you want to activate a possibility for romance. So per energy number, there are some quantum colors that are stronger for you to play with. So that's definitely a possibility. When you look at a home, you have to a little bit be careful. Some people say, well, you know, my bedroom is in the north. North stands generally for blue, right? For water. Is it okay if I paint my whole bedroom in blue? I am always a little bit careful with colors blue to paint a house and reds because blue is water and too much of water creates too much emotion. Definitely in a bedroom, people are more frustrated, they're more fearful, they're more emotional when a whole room is painted in blue. The same with red. Red stands for fire. It can be too active, too energizing. Definitely also in the bedroom, I would avoid having a whole wall or whole bedroom in red. I see people have a harder time to sleep, harder time to communicate. You can say, well, it looks very passionate. I said, yes, but your bedroom is not all about passion. It's also about rest and peace. Yeah. So be careful about that. So I suggest to people to... main tone in a house to go for earth colors so like beiges or like yellow beiges or peaches or light tans to to calm the energy down and then per room you could say then well in this area i would like to have more an earth color or like an orange or i want to have more like a metal color like gold then do like one wall of that color or add his colors as a carpet or rug or you know the color for your sofa or the pillows in it or the curtains in that color so to uplift that energy but it's better to not have like i know there's like an interior designs they're like okay That room is the red room and that room is the green room. They kind of like that. And I'm saying, yes, but I've seen a lot of problems sometimes occur with that because it's too much of the green in the wrong area and it's too much of the red in a certain area. So earth colors always gives the most harmony in a family, for sure. And that's, but I wouldn't go too white either. You know, if people do too white, then it's also too unsettling for people. So, you know, I've seen some of the wonderful images that you've been putting on the Facebook group. And I would always say, try to work in a room with like not more than three colors. Yeah. So don't put like, you know, a whole bunch of colors up, right? Three colors. is enough per room because you have to understand we get all this information in our brain and when there's too much colors we get very unsettling and we get out of harmony yeah so it doesn't mean you cannot have small objects in different colors but like for the majors like the walls the curtains the the furniture don't go in more than three colors and then you can add smaller objects in different colors that is fine but not for the bigger space that you have to fill that was a very elaborate answer I hope guys you got all of that because we covered a lot of information here because I'm seeing like I'm seeing a lot of these variations here like everybody's asking about specific colors so we're trying to give information that most most of you can resonate with we're not going to pick each individual color for each individual type of bed and well it's not possible I don't know their home I cannot I mean I would love to kind of look at to your home right away but I have to keep it in general as possible that you can do something with it I saw a lot of positive comments like life my life has changed and thank you very much so thank you guys for also keep those positive comments also coming it's also wonderful for us to read them but I saw at least three around this topic why after I changed my bed position and my other living room things to follow the power position and best directions my life has become a bit more chaotic my career has uh taken a downward spiral from an amazing turn on events to its opposite what can i do or what causes this um it can be many many different things first of all feng shui is not the only thing that you do in your life you know um it is only one third that um creates energy so it could be part of a lesson you need to learn you know more a heavenly luck what we call the a soul lesson you need to learn i i don't know your karma first of all um it can be also perhaps your mindset is um you know needs to be addressed and it can also be that by changing the energy um that uh first your life goes a little bit into um a changing mode it's like because you have perhaps changed too much at one time that's why we always say go step by step because it's like if you even if you would go the right direction it's like i said last time if you take the river and you turn it around 90 degrees your body will be shaking it's like it's too much right so if you do it step by step things move forward easily so i know some of you have been very enthusiastic and what is wonderful and you change things around but look again what you have been placing how it feels, do your muscle testing. It is possible that you went too fast and that, you know, things are a little bit unsettling. They will definitely calm down in that case, right? Because it has an effect on you. Every change you make has an effect on you. And it's possible your mind is a little bit reacting to all the energy, but to have suddenly everything fall apart is not normal. And it is not something I've ever seen happening with feng shui. So it's possible. that there are some other things in place that I have no way to see at this moment for you. And let's see our last question because I see a lot of them. Can we touch a little bit on the position of pets? So where would be the best position for pet baskets, let's say? I have two dogs, so I know it's important. You know, I always try to place their beds in the living or the family room because they're part of a family for me. right? I try to avoid placing the beds or the carpets definitely in their success, in your success health relationship direction. In a wisdom direction, that still could be okay because wisdom is like something that inspires you. And I always feel pets inspire me, right? But I would not put their bowls, you know, the water and their food tray in your health direction, for example. And some people say, but, you know, my pets are like my personal relationship. that's great and you can put the the little mattress or carpets that you have in your relationship but i wouldn't still not put a trace for food and water there right because it's like putting a kitchen of a dog there or a kitchen for um a rabbit or something there so you know and still check it out muscle test yourself is this okay for me but i would definitely definitely avoid your success direction in your living room or space. And the question was also, do you have pets a personal energy number? Yes, they have. So you could actually look into that and again, look at their birthday and look male or female and check this out. And I have seen people placing their success, you know, putting like their toys or their basket with toys in the success direction of their pets and that they played more with the toys. So You can play with that, of course. The cat litter box, though, is something I don't want to have in a place where you live, sleep, or work. Yeah? So that's where we want to avoid that. Guys, I hope you got a lot of value from the session. I also love this comment here that came in from Vicky that mimics what we talked about earlier. If we do little by little, we can also gouge and measure how things are changing too. That's also very, very true. So thank you guys for all of your wonderful comments and questions and also for helping each other. I saw a lot of you are also giving information from the course to your fellow student. That's also wonderful, wonderful to see. That's about it from our session today. I will ask Marie for the touch of inspiration as we are at the middle part. We are at the 50 % mark of our course. We're exactly at the middle. We have four more weeks to go. So Marie, what would be your advice for us continuing? Well, first of all, keep going, right? So keep going and moving forward to the course. And definitely make sure you use a Facebook group. You know, people are really loving the connection. I try to be every few days definitely responding as much as I can and supporting you there. And I know some of you really have gone like... already through the course, really, and they are helping the ones that are just starting. So I love that. And just keep, you know, keep using the wonderful energy that is in the tribe and reach out to your tribe members and to us that are here to support and help you so that we are able to fulfill and finalize this course and really make even more amazing changes in your life. Thank you very much, Marie. Thank you very much for your wisdom and for your inspiration and for everything you are teaching us on this journey. Welcome. Bye -bye.

Week 5: Health & Well-Being

====================

LESSON 15 – Feng Shui Your Health & Well-Being
--------------------
<v ->Welcome to chapter five.</v> Today we're going to focus on the feng shui of your health and well-being. Always make sure the space around your house between three to five meters from the physical body of your house, or between nine and 15 feet, is always clear from any blockages. No garbage bins, no stacked wood, and also no dead plants. Also try to avoid to have plants with sharp leaves that are too close to your house because you're actually not allowing the aura field of the house to breathe, and it does affect immune system and the nervous system of everybody living in the house. Also to have a pool in that same perimeter around the house will affect the health and well-being of people, so make sure you have the pool at least 10 'til 20 meters away. It's about 30 to 60 feet away from the physical building of the house. So in your bedroom, most people have now on their nightstand their computer, their cell phone and their alarm clock. I would actually suggest to move that at least two meters away from you, because these are electrical devices and they create some negative vibrations. The general direction to always focus on for health is the east. So make sure you always have live plants and flowers in the east area of your living room. The center of your house is also focused on health and well-being, so make sure there is no clutter in the center of your house. You can activate it with some crystals, with some candles, with some light, but make sure there's no images of violence or waterfalls or anything that disturbs the health and the well-being. In order to have the best health, it is good to sleep towards your health direction. So that's not always possible in your bedroom, but especially when you're sick and you feel not having enough good energy, sleeping with your head pointed towards your health direction will create more energy for you. When you're sick, you can also lay in your sofa but just make sure you're sleeping with your head towards the health direction. Also to have more health and you are doing yoga or qi gong or tai chi or any physical exercises to improve your health, always make sure you do this exercises facing your health direction. So another aspect that really affects your health and well-being are mirrors. So having a mirror in front of your bed or on the side of the bed will actually create more stress. So when people go to sleep and they're already stressed and they're exhausted, the mirrors will actually double that vibration. It's like the aura field will constantly receive that information back at night. The mirror reflects the ongoing stress the person has that goes to bed. Also, when you want to lose some weight, mirrors are not good in the bedroom because you're actually doubling your body there. So cover the mirrors at night before you go to sleep. You can put a screen in front of it. And remember, a television with reflective glass does react as a mirror. Also make sure you have no images of violence in the bedroom, like fierce animals like tigers and lions and dinosaurs, and even anything that creates violence. So that could be toy guns or images of heroes that are fighting. Make sure that all these images and toys and all these little hero statues are placed in a cabinet before a child go to sleep. When you have too much the color red in the bedroom, like the wallpaper is in red, the cover is in red, it can create too much fire, because red is a color of the element fire. When you have too much red around you, you get restless because everything is in fire, it's super active, so it's not the right color to calm down before you go to bed. Now a few items in red and a few pillows are okay, but not large spaces in red. When you have too much blues in the bedroom, it can also create a negative effect. So if your bedroom is all in dark blue or you have images of water above your headboard or when you wake up, it actually also will create a disturbance in your emotional well-being, because when you will be surrounded by water, you would not feel safe. So when you have too much blue, it actually creates miscommunication in the bedroom. Now sometimes you come in a place and the energy is quite heavy, and so it is good to allow the chi to flow into your house. So at least once a week, make sure the windows are open and all the doors are open, so that there is a flow of energy going through your house, because that will create a natural space clearing. Another way to create space clearing is to use lavender mist or use essential oil from lavender and spray around in your house, especially to the areas where the energy is kind of heavy and you feel not very comfortable. Lavender has the quality to uplift the vibration and to create more prana in the house. You can even use that for yourself and spray some lavender mist around you after a very difficult day, or put some lavender essential oil on your wrist and move your hands around your body, and you will feel immediately uplifted. When a house is very heavy, and especially when you come and move into a house for the first time, a really good thing to space clear a house is to take some sea salt and in every corner of the house, throw a little bit of sea salt and leave it there for seven days. The sea salt has a tendency to pull in all the negative energy, and then you can vacuum clean it and your house will start feeling much more fresher. Also, cleaning your windows. The windows are the eyes of your house, so if you clean the windows, you actually help to refresh your sensitivity connecting with the world. You actually will see that your senses will become stronger. Also, organize your kitchen and bathroom. It's not because we are not personally feng shui-ing your kitchen and your bathroom that they are not part of good feng shui. Make sure your kitchen is organized, all the cabinets are organized, and that tabletop is clean and decluttered and place a bowl with fresh fruit on your dining room table. Also your bathroom, make sure there are no clothes on the ground, that they are in the laundry basket, and that it smells fresh. When you want a house that is focused on well-being, it's also good when you come into your house to immediately lit up some candles. When you want some calmness and peace, it's good to lit up vanilla candles. When you feel like the energy is too heavy, you can lit up some lavender candles, especially when you have a lot of stress. When you really need to focus on health, you can lit up some sage candles, because it all create a better energy. And also when you come home, when you want to feel relaxed and in harmony, don't put this television on right away, just put some soft music as background. Your fridge is also a symbol of your health, so make sure you don't leave your doggy bags too long in your fridge and your takeaways. So at least once a week, declutter your fridge and clean your fridge and don't put images of people on the door of the fridge because you're actually freezing their health. I remember this client and she was telling me, "My children have all the time health issues. "One after another has some flu or some cold." And she said, "I really take care of their health, "I make sure it's always warm in the house." And I looked at the door of her fridge and it was completely covered with all images of her children, and I said, "Well no wonder they are getting a cold, "you put their energy on the fridge." So she took that away and she really saw a big shift in the health and the immune system of the children. So it's not because it's not connected with their bedroom that it does not affect them. I remember another house and the parents were saying that the child was very frightened, it was not very emotionally at peace. And it would go to bed and start really being frightened and having nightmares. The child was about a year and a half to two years. So when I looked at the bedroom, there were everywhere images of lions. The parents said, "Yeah, our child loves lions." The child is only so old, so how do you know it really likes lions? So I said, "But at night, the lions come to life "in the subconscious mind of a child, "so be careful what you place around it, "because for a child and for us as adults, "every image is like reality in the subconscious mind." So when I counted all the lions in that bedroom, there were more than 20. I share with the mother, "If you would have 20 lions around you, "would you feel healthy? "Would you feel okay?" So we removed everything, we made sure there were some good colors in that area and the energy went completely calm and healthy for the child. One of my clients was a woman that had gained, since she came into that house, quite an amount of weight and she was very concerned about that. And when I looked at her house inside, I couldn't really see anything that caused it from a feng shui perspective. She was eating healthy, was doing yoga, was walking a lot but still she was gaining weight. And then I saw that in the southwest area of her garden was the pool, and the pool was very close to her house. Now the southwest, remember, stands for the mother, for the strong woman, and she was the only woman in the house. She had her husband and her three sons. So of course, you cannot just move away the pool. We made sure we put some rocks and bushes in front of the pool, so from her living room, she could not really focus so much on the pool. And we activated, of course, the personal health directions everywhere in the rest of her house, and she felt the difference. She started losing easier weight. So all the things she did before were not helping, and now as the pool was not so overwhelming for her in her subconscious mind, things were easier. Now we're going to activate your personal health direction. Now in your personal health direction, it is really good to place symbols of health. It can be books on health, it can be anything that, according to your belief and religion, connects with health. If you are doing any sports or any practical exercises for health, like yoga or qi gong and you have DVDs or audios or images about that, and you want to place that in your personal health direction, that is fabulous. Even you could put there the tools that you using for your personal health activation, like a yoga mat for example, or a ball as you're playing basketball to improve your energy. For energy number one, the health direction is the east. So if you look in the east in your living room and your bedroom, make sure there's something that supports your health. Now, in the living room, you can place definitely a beautiful plant. In the bedroom, I would avoid to put live plants. You can put a silk plant for sure, or an image of a plant in your bedroom. You can also place, in the east, an image, a picture of an ancestor that lived very long and was super healthy. Energy number two, and the man that have energy number five, your health direction is the west. So you can actually place, in the west area, a beautiful white quartz crystal, because that will stimulate the metal energy of the west. For energy number three, the bringers of light, your health direction is the north. So in your living space, you can put an image of a river with boats sailing on it, but definitely do not place an image of a harbor where all the boats are anchored, because there's no movement and there will not be good energy for your health. In your bedroom, definitely place some blue items in your health direction, and you can even activate it with some gold and silver to stimulate your health. For energy number four, your health direction is south. So make sure you place, in the south area, something that gives you light. A beautiful candle, a lamp, and perhaps even an image of the sun. The best colors for your health are all kind of shades of red, oranges, violet and hot pink. Energy number five, for men, you have the same health direction as energy number two. And energy number five for women, listen when I speak about energy number eight. Energy number six, the creator, has as health direction, the northeast. So you can activate that area in your living room and bedroom with a deity or an angel or a saint or any spiritual image that connects with healing, or you can also place books on healing. Also you can activate the northeast with an amethyst gemstone. When you are energy number seven, your personal health direction is southwest. You can activate the southwest with a beautiful rose quartz crystal, and you can also place images of people playing sports in a team. When you are energy number eight, or you are energy number five for women, your health direction is the northwest, and you can activate that area also with a white quartz crystal and placing some silver items. Energy number nine, your personal health direction is the southeast. So make sure you place in your living room a flowering plant, and put in your bedroom some green objects. More examples of what you can place in your personal health direction, you can find that in your Personal Energy Number ebook, and also some practices that really work well for you to activate your health and well-being. A friend of mine was really struggling with her health and we checked the health direction in her living room. She had the image there of what we call The Thinker of Rodin and it's a man that does like this. And I say to her, "Is that what you're always doing? "Are you concerned and thinking about your health?" She said, "Yeah, it's always on my mind." And I showed her the image and said, "Well, that's what you're doing. "You're always thinking about your health." But it's an image of somebody who is really concerned and even anxious. So we took that away and placed there an image of a woman that just was walking and having fun and joy in her life. And she stopped thinking and being concerned about her health. One day, I went into a home of somebody and she was really having problems with her health. And she was not eating super well and she was not exercising so it's not just feng shui. Remember, feng shui is only a third of your good luck in your health. Also she was not really active and working on her health. But I still checked around what was going on and in her health direction, that was east, she did have plants but she had a collection of small little cactus. I said to her, "This is not helping you." She said, "Well, so I studied your work "and I put healthy living plants there." I said, "Yes but they're cactus." So we removed them and we placed them outside her house because cactus should not be inside of the house, unless if you want to put it in the hallway, but it was an open space so she didn't have a hallway. We moved it out and we placed some living plants there and she started thinking differently about her health and she felt that she had more courage to walk and to work on a healthy diet, and that made the shift happening for her. I am sure you want to quantum boost your health and well-being right now. Well, we're going to go over the energy numbers and I'll give you the quantum colors for your health. Energy number one, your quantum colors are emerald green, citrus green and Irish blue, a light metal blue. For energy number two and man that have energy number five, your quantum colors for your personal health direction are white, ivory white and peach. The quantum colors for health for energy number three are royal blue, cobalt blue, and aqua blue. The quantum colors for energy number four are ruby red, cherry red and a beautiful orange. The energy number five, when you are a man and you have energy number five, you have the same colors as energy number two. When you're energy number five and you are a woman, you have the same quantum colors as energy number eight. For energy number six, your quantum colors are yellow, saffron yellow and magenta. And for energy number seven, your quantum colors are rose, pink and fuchsia. And for energy number eight, and women with energy number five, your colors are silver, opalescence and diamond. And as last, the energy number nine, your quantum colors for health are violet, lilac and gold. So you can quantum boost your personal health direction with placing an item or a card with this colors in that exact area to add more energy and to create exponential health and well-being. You also want to activate the time energy of this current year for your health and well-being and you actually will receive in your instructions what is the health area for this year in your home. You will activate with placing a small six rod, metal hollow wind chime. Now I will demonstrate in a practical video how to activate the health and the well-being in the living room and your bedroom.

LESSON 16 – Activate Your Personal Direction for Health
--------------------
<v ->Hey Marie, come into my bedroom and have a look.</v> <v ->Oh wow, it's very spacious, lovely.</v> So in this area, we're definitely going to focus on health, right, and so how has your health been here? <v ->Health?</v> <v ->Yeah.</v> <v ->You know, it could be better.</v> Backache, headaches. <v ->Okay. All right. So, we're going to check out</v> you on the bed so I will ask you to come and lie on your side, so which side is it on? <v ->I'm over here.</v> <v ->Okay.</v> <v ->So I'm going to just scooch over this way.</v> <v ->Okay, please.</v> Yes, just imagine that you're lying on your bed, okay? <v ->I'm going to just quickly take my shoes off.</v> <v ->Of course. Okay?</v> <v ->Okay. How do you want me to lie?</v> <v ->Just lay like you normally ...</v> <v ->Like I normally would?</v> <v ->No, no, just with your ...</v> on the back. <v ->On my back?</v> <v ->Yes.</v> <v ->Okay. So good.</v> So I'm going to check your health energy of this house. So, let me ... Xan you just double cross your feet? <v ->Okay.</v> <v ->Okay. So, you push up as hard as you can.</v> Okay. So, close your eyes for a second and think now about the health in this room. <v ->Okay.</v> <v ->Is this room supporting your health?</v> <v ->Ooh.</v> <v ->Whoa.</v> <v ->Perhaps not.</v> <v ->Perhaps not. I'm sure not.</v> So, what can we do? We can do two things. We actually need to check out your personal health direction. So, if I look in this room, you know, where your health direction is, it is actually north-east, for energy number six. <v ->Oh.</v> <v ->And this is actually what is in the north-east area</v> of this bedroom. So, you know, you have some pills here so it's really important that you focus on things about health. So, like, a book that is about healing. What actually would be also good for you is a crystal. And especially for the north-east an amethyst crystal. <v ->Amethyst ...</v> <v ->Okay.</v> <v ->is really good.</v> Make sure there's never clutter in this area. <v ->Okay.</v> <v ->Because it actually affects your health</v> 24 hours a day and night. And also, in this area you have I think, is that your wedding picture? <v Janet>Yes, that's my wedding picture.</v> <v ->Well, we'll definitely, we'll place it</v> in your personal relationship direction but it's nothing about your health and you have some boxes and you some bags so I would like you to redesign this area and any book you can find about health or images about health. <v ->I have plenty of those.</v> <v ->You have plenty of those?</v> So I would like you to activate this. <v ->Okay.</v> <v ->Now, there's another thing that really</v> affects you tremendously and this is actually your mirror. <v ->Oh boy.</v> <v ->Right.</v> <v ->The mirrors.</v> <v ->The mirrors, yes. And so,</v> when somebody has a mirror doubling them and you're the closest to the mirror of both of you it actually doubles the stress, so when people come to bed, it's like the mind cannot come to a peaceful energy. So, it's one of the things that I always suggest to people is to cover the mirrors. <v ->Okay, that's doable.</v> <v ->Is that doable?</v> <v ->Cover the mirror at night, or just cover in general?</v> <v ->Just at night is enough.</v> <v ->Yes, that's very doable.</v> <v ->So, you can actually hang over a curtain</v> or something in front of it but especially I would say where your head and your heart and your torso is. <v ->So, one of those Japanese screens would be nice, right?</v> <v ->Perfect, yes.</v> <v ->Would be kind of nice here.</v> <v ->They would be very nice,</v> especially these Japanese screens have, you know, beautiful, lush nature. <v ->Oh, that's nice.</v> <v ->Make sure there's no water in it.</v> <v ->No water.</v> <v ->Because water images are not good in a bedroom.</v> <v ->Okay, that's good to know.</v> <v ->Because it creates more emotions.</v> <v ->All right.</v> <v ->But can be beautiful mountain,</v> can be birds. <v ->Bamboo?</v> <v ->Bamboo. So that's all very good.</v> Bamboo stands for longevity. <v ->Oh, that's a good one.</v> <v ->So, that's actually a really good thing for you to have</v> in your direction of health. Yes? <v ->So that, it could ... You know,</v> there's even space for it there. You could put it right there and it could be tall. <v ->Yes, you could actually put it in front of it, right?</v> Yes. But that is definitely a big difference, so there's a little muscle testing. So, just imagine you clear all this up, this will be focused on health and your mirror is covered. <v ->Okay.</v> <v ->All right. So, can you manage that?</v> So, think about health. Push up. <v ->Oh.</v> <v ->Can you feel the difference?</v> <v ->Yeah, I can feel it.</v> <v ->I can keep pushing.</v> <v ->So, this is definitely really important for you.</v> <v ->Okay.</v> <v ->So, we have checked out your health</v> and now I would love to check out the health of your husband Bob. <v ->Oh. Sure, sure.</v> <v ->Okay, so let's go find him.</v> <v ->Let's go find him. Yeah.</v> <v ->So, hi Bob. Wonderful to connect with you.</v> <v ->Nice to meet you.</v> <v ->And so, I would like to check out</v> your health energy in the bedroom. So, can you follow me? <v ->Sure.</v> <v ->I want to check you out.</v> So, invite you to lay down on your bed, like you normally do. Okay? Very good. And so, before I go and check out your personal health direction, I just want to point out you have a beam just going above you and so it actually, it cuts kind of your legs. Any problem with your legs or your knees? <v ->I used to have a little problem</v> because I played basketball. <v Marie>Yeah.</v> <v ->When I was taking some supplements.</v> <v Marie>It's better.</v> <v ->I haven't any problems, yeah.</v> <v ->Because that is, thank God is quite high,</v> the ceiling, but it's one of the things that still can affect you. Right? So, let me do some muscle testing. <v ->Sure.</v> <v ->So, you hold your arm like this, and you push up.</v> And I push down. Okay, very good. So, think, "I'm a man." <v ->I'm a man.</v> <v ->Okay, you're strong. "I think I'm a woman."</v> <v ->I'm a woman.</v> See, you're weak. So, your muscles are very clear. So, when I look at your birthday and I check your energy number, you're energy number five. That means that you're the teacher and your health direction is west. So, actually in this room, the west area is right there where your fireplace is. <v ->Oh, okay.</v> <v ->Do you use your fireplace a lot?</v> <v ->Not too often, no.</v> <v ->Okay. Well, it's definitely not a good thing</v> to have a fireplace in your health direction because you're burning your health up. Okay? So, if we look at the image there, it's definitely a very lush image you have, but there were a lot of small little items there and it's nothing really that supports your health. So, I would make sure you place some things like crystals, any items that shows longevity, any symbols that show, you know, great energy, that is something you can place there, but right now there's a lot of small little things and little dolls and so it's not really telling what you need to do. So, like, a symbol of longevity, for example, is a yin-yang symbol, for example. Or an image of a sportsman, you know, that is playing golf or you can actually also place like the Wu Lou, that's like a Chinese symbol but it can be any symbol that relates with your religion or philosophy that focuses on that. Or even sometimes a god or a goddess or a saint that connects in with health and is good for health. You can place that there. But also, you can put some books on health in that area. And especially for the west, using things with white colors, silver colors and the best crystal for you would be a white quartz crystal, yeah? And a citrine gemstone. So, and you could even a symbol find like a citrine gemstone tree that's actually very lucky for you. You can place that there. But right now, what is over there is not really supporting you. So, I want you to look at that health energy there, yeah, and we'll do some muscle testing. Okay. Look at this, over there, yeah? How do you feel there with your health? See, it's not strong. <v ->Uh-huh.</v> <v ->Right? So, your health is affected by this.</v> Thank God that the image there, the big painting is definitely really positive, okay? So, we could improve that for sure, in this area. <v ->Could I put pictures of my children up there?</v> <v ->You can put pictures of your children,</v> but make sure that you don't put pictures when they are young. Right? <v ->Right.</v> <v ->But like, more recent pictures.</v> <v ->Okay.</v> <v ->Is definitely something because ...</v> <v ->It shows a continuation, the longevity.</v> <v ->Correct. It shows, like, the next generation</v> and even if you have and if it's your grandchildren, that also shows a symbol of longevity. So, you can definitely place that there. If you would place pictures of the past, like your family members that have gone before you, I would not suggest that because they already are gone, right? So, you don't want any pictures of people that have passed on already, because that's not very good symbols for your future health, right? So, the next generation for sure is something you can place there. <v ->Okay, thank you.</v> <v ->You're welcome.</v> So, let's come into the family room. <v ->Okay.</v> <v ->And in this room and also in your bedroom</v> we're going to check out your health, because especially the place where you are the most social, I can imagine the family room is the place where you hang out the most, right? <v ->Yes, this is where we hang out.</v> <v ->So, we definitely want to focus</v> on your health here, right? <v ->Okay.</v> <v ->And so, if we look at this area</v> we see a lot of masks, yeah So, apparently you love them, right? <v ->Yes, I do actually. I love my masks.</v> <v ->So, I always say to people,</v> if you look something that always give you energy. So, it's okay, but we're going to see if it's not hanging in your health direction. <v ->Oh, okay.</v> <v ->Because that's where I would not put it in there</v> because they are mostly used for rituals or connect with death masks, so we have to be a little bit careful about this and what they represent. <v ->Oh, okay, yeah.</v> <v ->Because in the ancient traditions</v> they were not always used for the living but for the ones that passed on. <v ->Oh my god. I don't want that.</v> <v ->Of course not. So, let me first check you.</v> You have energy number five. You're the teacher and your health direction is actually the west. So, when we look in this room towards where the west is it's actually in this area here, yeah. So, the first thing I see is that you have a dying plant here. And also a plant that has spiky leaves, so I would remove that. You also have an aloe vera plant, I can imagine. <v ->No, that's some kind of a palm tree.</v> Oh, it's not a palm tree, okay. <v ->It is. Yes, it's not aloe vera.</v> <v ->So, anyhow. It is a sharp edge, right?</v> <v ->Okay.</v> <v ->So, these are two things that I would take out</v> and put something lush because this, if you think about this is health, you know, and this is health, it's not really something ... Yes, for example, this plant or plants like this <v ->Not that one. That one's spiky.</v> <v ->Or something lush, I would definitely go to that area.</v> Also if you look at these masks, they are not really telling so much about your health. So, I want to do a little muscle testing with you, Bob. <v ->Okay.</v> <v ->Okay. So, I would like you to look at this area</v> as it is now. We're going to do muscle testing. So, you push up. Okay. So think about this area and think about your health. Okay. You're very weak, right. So, let's just imagine you take this mask off and we'll put some images you can work with, images for your children, for example, images of joy, some joyful scenery. You can also put some lush plants in this area, right? But definitely we'll let go of the masks. <v ->Okay.</v> <v ->So, can you imagine that and look at it?</v> Close your eyes. Just imagine it's all there. Push up. It's still a bit weak. You can feel that? So, one of the things you could also do is make sure you have a beautiful crystal there. I would actually take a little table there and put some books on health there, some crystals and some lush plants and definitely also a light. Like a beautiful light. A lamp, it could be a metal lamp, it could be a tall lamp, but definitely bring some life to it. <v ->Bring some light into it.</v> <v ->So, can you imagine that? Yeah?</v> Okay, think about health, push up. Push up, go on. Yes, okay. Now you're strong. You can feel that? <v ->Yes.</v> <v ->Yes, okay. So, look at this as it is right now,</v> thank about your health. So you can see, there's a big difference, right? <v ->Yes.</v> <v ->So, also part of your bookcase</v> is still connected with your health. So, for example, "Eat to Lose, Eat to Win," hey, that's a really good book to place there, right? But, we have here James Ellroy, "Bloods a Rover," I think that's kind of a thriller, so that is not a good book. So, I want you to look at whatever is there, could be travel books, but any images that is there needs to relate with your health or any books you place there. So, right now, it's not supporting that field. <v ->Okay.</v> <v ->Yeah. So, definitely focus on that.</v> Always good colors for health are greens, light greens, whites, purples, lilacs are all really good quantum colors to place in that area. So, even if it's a symbol that represents that you can place that there. Okay? <v ->Thank you, that's great.</v> <v ->That's good.</v> <v ->So, I have a question.</v> If we implement everything you're asking us, how long does it take for the results to start showing? <v ->Well, we believe that it's between</v> nine days and nine weeks. <v ->Oh, okay.</v> <v ->So, it takes about nine days</v> after you have implemented things to get the energy shift happening because of the nine compass directions So, the eight directions and the center before the energy moves through everything, it takes about nine days. Now some people have experienced that within nine hours. They have some shift happening. <v ->Like with the living room.</v> <v ->For example.</v> <v ->I experienced it immediately.</v> <v ->Right. Some people will feel like</v> within even nine minutes, like "Woo." There's like a new energy comes in. <v ->Right.</v> <v ->I have seen people by changing something</v> that literally the same day phone calls they have been waiting for for a long time. Others have been, like, really waiting to like nine weeks. It's like after nine weeks like something really shifted. It all depends on how much clutter you have in the house. <v ->I see.</v> The more you declutter, and you know, there's perhaps some decluttering, rearrangement you could do. <v ->Yes.</v> <v ->The faster results will come.</v> So, it's not just placing everything. <v ->It's getting rid of ...</v> <v ->It's getting rid of things</v> to create some space for new energy to come in. <v ->Yeah. Things that are irrelevant,</v> part of the past. <v ->Yes, things like you're saying,</v> "Well, you know what. "I don't really need that so much anymore. "It's not me anymore." <v ->It's sort of almost like bad habits,</v> you're just, kind of, throwing them away. <v ->You actually ... Well, you don't throw them away,</v> you kind of give them away. It's always good to give things away, yeah? To goodwill or to family or to friends, so that you keep an energy of gratitude happening. Because you don't want to throw it away unless if something is broken, yeah? <v ->Right.</v> <v ->And even if you can make some money</v> from what you're giving, right? That's fine too. If you have, like, a shop you can pass some things on and you make some money, hey, that's already abundance coming in, anyhow. <v ->Hey, we got you.</v> <v ->So, I also want to check your health direction here.</v> So, when we look at your health direction, it is actually the north-east. And so, the north-east area is actually right there, and it's actually your bar. <v ->Oh dear.</v> <v Marie>You know, where all the alcohol is.</v> <v ->I don't even drink that much.</v> <v ->Well, when it's still affecting you, right?</v> So, let's look towards that, yes? So, if we look at your health direction, Janet, this is actually where the bar is, right? So, there is some clutter, so I would definitely suggest to work on that. It is a bar, so, <v ->Drinks are going to be here.</v> <v ->Drinks are going to be here,</v> but in order to really amplify the good energy here, I would actually add some lush plants here. <v ->Oh, that's doable.</v> <v ->So you have a few of these plants</v> that you even ... A beautiful plant that kind of hangs. <v ->Oh, that would be very nice.</v> <v ->That would be really nice, and you know,</v> this is probably another mask, right? <v ->Another mask.</v> <v ->Another mask, right.</v> And this door, I don't know if that has a meaning for you? <v ->Yeah, again, this I got in Venezuela</v> and it represents very much the people there, because the houses have those tall doors and they do graffiti. It's very much, it's kind of, like, you have to be there, type of picture. <v ->Okay. But the question is,</v> "Is this good for your health?" Right? <v ->Oh, I don't know about that.</v> I like it. That's all I know. <v ->That's all you know.</v> So, let's do a little muscle testing. So, let's check your health energy. Okay, think about health here. <v ->Whoa! Okay, I guess the door has to go.</v> <v ->So can you imagine, you know,</v> the door's gone, it's cleaned up, there's a beautiful lush plant here. Put some crystals because they have beautiful crystal balls and some things, so you can place that even here more. <v ->More crystals, right.</v> <v ->And yeah. I would definitely do that.</v> Yeah, because that's a good area for it, for the north-east, that is your health direction. So, can you just think about that? Close your eyes. It's changed. How do you feel with your health? Push up. <v ->Oh.</v> <v ->Yeah. You feel it?</v> <v ->Yes.</v> <v ->Okay. So I definitely would let go of this.</v> I probably would also let go of this. <v ->Oh, my little house. Okay.</v> <v ->You know, because again it shows</v> you know, it's a broken house, it's poverty, it's, you know, it's not like the lush abundant energy for your health. Right? So, I would, you know, go around and I love the rest of this here, but just, you know, make it a little bit better for your health. <v ->Yes, I understand.</v> <v ->Okay. That's doable.</v> <v ->It's doable.</v> <v ->It's all doable.</v> <v ->And again, it's all very easy to fix, right?</v> <v ->I mean a plant.

LESSON 17 – Quantum Boost Your Health: Meditation & Exercises

- The first exercise I want to share for this chapter is a Quantum Boost Health Meditation. When we work with the Quantum Boost Meditation, we're actually bringing in quantum colors to stimulate the energy and to create an extra health potential. So I invite you to close your eyes. Imagine you are now standing, again, in the center of your house. And we're opening the door and we are asking now, to the universe, that the color emerald green, that stands for healing, is coming into your house, through the front door and fills your whole house, so that the health frequency in the house will be optimized. And then, go into your living room and bedroom and send this emerald green vibration into your health direction, blessing your health and your wellbeing. Then focus again on your front door, and we're bringing in the color violet. Who stands for letting go of the past through forgiveness. And you ask that this beautiful violet color comes in and fills your whole house, because in order to have this emotional wellbeing we need to let go of any emotional situations from the past. And direct that violet light to your health direction in your living room and your health direction in your bedroom. You can even direct these colors towards the health direction of your children and your partner in their bedroom. And then take a deep breath in and imagine a golden light surrounds your whole house to manifest perfectly, to manifest in abundance, your health and wellbeing. And then take a deep breath in, bring your hands together, warm your hands, bring your warm hands in front of your eyes, open your eyes and let get go of your hands. Your homework for this week is to Feng Shui your living room and bedroom for your health and wellbeing and to share the before and after pictures with your community. Next week I'm going to teach you about your personal relationship directions so before the next chapter I will ask you to start decluttering your bedroom, your children's bedrooms, your living room, so that you'll be ready for the next week. I'm very happy to see you again in the next chapter.

Week 6: Personal Relationships

====================

LESSON 18 – Feng Shui Your Personal Relationships
--------------------
<v ->Welcome to chapter six.</v> Today we're going to Feng Shui your personal relationships. And that includes your personal romantic relationship, your relationship with your family, and your relationship with your children and grandchildren. First we're going to share some general feng shui steps that you can do to activate your home. When you want to honor your parents and grandparents and your family line, you can place pictures of them in the east area of your living room, because the east stands for family and for the past. You place them best in frames that are made from wood. To activate in a general way your connection with your children and grandchildren, you can always place their images and pictures in the west area of your living room. And you best frame them with silver or gold-looking frames, because the west stands for creativity and children and joy. Some of you will ask me I have family that has passed away, where do I place them? Well, for people that are east people, that means if you have energy number one, three, four and nine, the best place to put these pictures is in the west area of your living room. And when you are a west person and your energy number is two, five, six, seven or eight, the best place to put pictures of people that have passed on is to place them in the north area. Both times, both for the west or for the north, you place the people that have passed on best with silver-looking frames. Now, if you want to honor your mother and your grandmother, and even strengthen your own mother energy, you can always place images of strong women and even images and pictures of you with your mother and your grandmother or you with your children as a mother in the southwest area of your living room because the southwest stands for motherhood. In the southwest you place best the pictures in a gold-looking frame. When you want to activate the fatherline, and you want to strengthen the connection with your father and grandfather or you as father with your children, you can also place pictures of them and you with your children in the northwest area of your living room, 'cause the northwest stands generally for fatherhood. I always suggest people to put a beautiful family picture at the entrance of the door, so when you walk in that across of the door or on the side, you tell the world this is where this family lives. Make sure it's a happy family picture where everybody's smiling and enjoying themselves. That's also for the ones that walk into the house that are part of your family are feeling welcomed and saying yes, it will be a happy day together in the family. Make sure it is the family that is living there, not a picture with your inlaws and your grandparents included. It needs to be you as parents and the children. Even if the children are not longer living in that house because they have moved on and they are living on their own, it's always good to anchor the family energy at the entrance. You also can place happy family pictures in the center of your home. You can find the center by checking on your floorplan the four corners and line them up and find out where the center is. There you can place happy family pictures, even pictures from when the children were younger. Just be careful, if there's in the center of your home a staircase, you do not want to place family pictures there because the energy goes up and down. It is not good for the well-being of the people that are pictured in that area. Definitely also do not put pictures of your family in your bedroom. And I talk about the family you come from. You definitely don't want a picture of your mother-in-law in the bedroom, right? You definitely can have pictures of your children in your bedroom, but make sure they're not overwhelming. So one picture is definitely enough, and focus on your personal relationship pictures in the bedroom. Also, putting family pictures in your office is okay, but don't overdo this. I remember once that my children would all the time come into my office. And they disturbed me a little bit in my concentration, and then I checked out, and I had put 10 pictures of my children in my office, telling them you're very welcome. And so I moved nine of the pictures away, and they disturbed me much less, because I just said my focus needs to be about my business in my office space. Definitely do not put photos in your bathroom or your kitchen because these are areas where the energy is draining. To activate your personal relationships, you can also work with crystals. If you want to activate the mother energy, then you can place in the southwest rose quartz items. What I really like is a rose quartz candle holder with a little tea light in it so that you're always activating the mother energy. You can also work with an amethyst. And as it's the southwest, it's better to put two rose quartz crystals or two amethysts as the number for southwest is the number two. If you want to activate the father energy, you will place a white quartz crystal in the northwest because the northwest is, first of all, metal energy, but crystal is an earth element, and it activates, actually, the metal vibration of the northwest. The west area you also can activate, even if it's a metal element, by placing some white quartz crystals. But as west is small metal and it's children, you could even put small little white crystals in a bowl, so to really activate the joyfulness of the west. If you have, for example, three children and two grandchildren, you can put in that bowl as many crystals as you have children and grandchildren. So you activate your connection with each one of them. You also want your family to grow and to blossom, so as you have crystals to anchor your relationship, you want plants to help your family to thrive. So if your family has some issues with self-esteem, I would definitely place a blossoming, round-leafed plant in the south area of your living room because it will support everybody's self-esteem and confidence. If you want to have better relationship with the family where you're coming from, not just with your parents and your grandparents but with your cousins and nieces, then place a lush, large plant in the east to activate these relationships. And if you want to have better money relationships with your family, because that is sometimes also an issue, place some flowering plants in the southeast section of your living room. And this way, you create prosperity for everyone living in the family. Now let's give you some general tips for romance. I'm sure you've been waiting for this one. First of all, when you walk into your bedroom, make sure there's no single image on top of your bed. I was recently in somebody's bedroom, and when I walked in, there was an image of a woman, totally naked, laying down with her head on her hand. It looked like the woman was totally exhausted, and I asked her, "How have you been feeling?" And she said, "Oh, so exhausted." I said, "Okay, take that image away "and place there an image of a couple." And as they were already having a romantic relationship, we put there a picture of her and her husband. Also, when you wake up, the first thing you see across your bed, you want to make sure there are no images of single people. As the first thing you see when you wake up, it gives an imprint in your subconscious mind. So make sure you place there images also from couples. Now, you have to really pay attention what kind of couples you place there. If you put up an image of a couple that have split or have a hard time, that is not a good message too. Or you put an image up of people that kind of look away from each other and not look towards each other, that is something you need to avoid. And even items in your bedroom. For example, you put two little figurines, and they're kind of standing next to each other. Well, that's kind of how your relationship will be. But then you need to take those figurines and move them slightly too each other so they can look at each other, not away from each other because then you give a different vibration. I remember coming in a bedroom and they had a picture up from the husband and from the wife in the bedroom when they woke up but in separate frames. And when you looked at them, they were actually not looking at each other. Then I asked them to put these pictures and swap them so at least, even if they were not in the same frame, they were looking at each other. But I suggested to make sure they had a picture of both of them in one picture in the same frame. Also be careful what kind of items you put around you that perhaps do not connect in with romance. Like for example angels or saints. It's great to put them there in your personal wisdom direction. Too many figurines and images of saints and masters and angels does not activate romance. I remember somebody had put two dolphin figurines across her bed. And she said, "Well, your dolphins are there. "I love dolphins." I said, "Yes, but dolphins are not "very faithful beings. "They love the group experience." That's why sometimes the Chinese will use two ducks, 'cause ducks are considered very faithful in love. So if you find two duck figurines, also make sure they look slightly at each other, and they're not swimming behind each other. Definitely add some color to your bedroom. Don't make it plain like all whites and all blacks. Bring some warmth to your bedroom. Men love more oranges and yellows and browns to pick up the energy. And women love more all kinds of rose colors and reds. Make sure you put some colors on the bed or even carpets in that color. Do not paint all the walls in red or in orange. It sometimes can be too much for the other gender. Also, do not put live plants in the bedroom. You can put images of plants and flowers or fake plants. Life plants are considered creating too much active energy for a place like a bedroom where the energy needs to be calm and peaceful. Also make sure there's enough space for each partner in the cabinets, so it's not all focused to the woman or all focused to the man. And especially if you're single, prepare your space. Make sure there's space enough for a future partner to bring toiletries. And also make sure there's space in your closet, so at least the future partner can bring in some clothes when they're moving in. On your bed, make sure then when you're single, there are two pillows, there are two nightstands, there are two lamps. And also do not place your bed against the wall on one side so nobody can come in to the side of the bed. There must be space around the bed so both partners can come into the bed. Before you really want to move into a new relationship, perhaps it's good to check out what is still in your house connected with your previous relationship. Perhaps there's still some books and CDs and DVDs or other items that are still in your house. Make sure you give them back or you send them back or give them away to Goodwill. If you had a marriage that didn't end well, make sure your previous wedding dress is not longer in your home so you open yourself for new marriage possibilities. Also, when you go from your living space to your bedroom, you want to make sure that the last pictures you see in the hallway before you enter your bedroom has a romantic experience. I want to tell you a very funny story. One day, a very famous PR lady called me. She was a PR lady from some very famous celebrities in Hollywood. And she said, "I have everything. "I have fame, I have money, "I have all the success I need, "and I really miss out on personal relationships." She was about 55, and she shared that when she came into this house that her fiance and her broke up within a few weeks moving into this house. I said, "Okay, let me check what is going on." So I come to the staircase to go up, and the last picture I see is a picture of an opera where the woman is sitting on the ground, and she is kind of begging to the father to be married with the man standing next to the father. So that was not really positive. She's also a woman that has a Catholic background. And along the staircase, there were all images of Jesus holding the cross on his back. And so as you were moving up, the last picture before you walked into her bedroom was an image of Jesus laying dead on the lap of his mother. And then you opened the door, and above her head was the image of Jesus with his thorn crown. I said to her, "Well, this is really interesting. "I understand you're very connected with Jesus, "but perhaps you have a meditation "or a prayer room where we can put these pictures, "because right now, what happens is, "you come to the staircase "and you tell to the man I will torture you. "You'll be dead before you get into your bedroom, "and if you survive that, "I will even torture you in the bed, "because of the thorn crown on Jesus." And she said, "Wow, this is so interesting, "because I had several times men coming "into my house, and each time as we come "to the staircase to go up, they change their minds. "And they say, well, perhaps we better stay friends." I said, "Yes, that is because subconsciously "they're getting the message don't get up there. "I'm killed!" So we moved these pictures away. We put all beautiful, romantic images, definitely above her bed making sure there was a couple image. And we put all the things that she really connected with from a religious perspective in wisdom areas in the rest of her house. What happened is that a few weeks later, her old fiance called her again and said, "I've been thinking about you "the last two weeks. "I really want to connect again with you. "I really want to see if we still have a future." Six months later, they were married. So also make sure that what is standing or placed next to your bed on your nightstand is also connected with romance. It can be your journal. It can be candlelight. It can be beautiful lights, but it needs to be definitely inspiring, being connected with somebody else. I remember a woman from about 60, and she asked me to come to her house. Again, she had all the prosperity, all the success, but she lost her husband. And she wanted really something new in her life. And she wanted a new partner in her life. She actually moved to Paris because she thought, well, it is the city of romance. So I walk into her bedroom, and I literally froze. Because next to her bed, where normally the nightstands are, were two tiger statues that big. And they were so real, the eyes were so real, I thought real tigers in the bedroom. And I was like. And she said, "No, no, no, they're just statues. "Go in." And I said to her, "How can a new partner "ever come in, because he will do like me. "He will freeze." She said, "But I feel so protected with them." I said, "I understand that having two big tigers "next to you feels confident for you, "but it doesn't allow anyone to come in, "because the tigers are chasing the man away." So she decided actually to keep the tigers, 'cause she loved them. So guess what? Because of some other activations we did in her home, she attracted more men, and they came for tea and for some bridge, but they never came to her bedroom. The northwest, it stands for the father energy and strong men, so it is possible that by having a fireplace in the northwest, you weaken the man's energy and you weaken also a man to come into your life. In that case, if you have a fireplace there, you don't need to use it, do not use it. Or place some blue items or bowls with still water around the fireplace when you are using it to calm the energy, 'cause a fireplace in the northwest is called fire at heaven's gate. The northwest stands for the universe where the heavenly energy, and it's a metal element. So when you put fire there, we weaken, we melt the metal, and you melt the power of the man. One day, I was asked by a woman to help her with her personal relationship. And she said, "I really want a new man in my life, "but I have some specific goals about that." I said, "Okay." She said, "I want a man from a different culture." I said, "Okay." She said, "I want a younger man, at least 15 years younger." "Okay." "And I would love that he has children "because I never got children with my husband "that passed on, and I would love to raise a young child. "But I really don't want to do anything about it. "I don't want to go on online sites. "I don't want to go to special clubs. "I just want him to show up in my life, "here on my property." Well, these are some very specific goals, right? And I said to her, "Well, your fireplace "in the northwest will definitely not make that happen." She said, "Well, I'm not really using it." She was living in California. I said, "Why don't we cover the fireplace "and put some other things in front of it "and put some images of powerful men there." She said, "Okay, I love that idea." A few weeks later, a man showed up on her property with a child of seven years, his little son. He was from the Sikh tradition. He was a lawyer, and he was camping around in the area. And he had already looked at her property and thought, wow, what an amazing property that is. I would love to camp there. So he called in and said, "Is there a possibility "we could camp on your property "because we would have a beautiful view of the ocean?" And they start talking. He was 15 years younger. He was a very powerful lawyer. He was a single dad, with a child of seven, and he was very intelligent and beautiful, and he was from a different culture. They never left. And they got married. To thank me, she actually sent me a diamond ring as bonus. And she send it to me actually through the mail. I remember getting an envelope, and I open it with the US mail. And I was like, what is that? It's a diamond ring. And she said to me, "You had so much faith in me "that this was going to happen, "and I had so much faith in you. "And I know you tell the diamond stands for fate. "I wanted to give you a diamond ring." And she lived happy ever after with her husband. Some people ask me is destiny not the major cause for your husband or your partner to come to your life? Well, your destiny's connect with your heavenly luck, and that's 1/3 of your activations. And feng shui is your earth luck, and it's also 1/3. But one of the secrets my grand master shared with me is that sometimes we have no access to the full potential of our destiny because our feng shui is actually closing that energy off. In that case that I just shared, she was not able to connect in with the man that was in her destiny. He was going around this area and didn't come into her property till she changed her feng shui. And then the energy opened up. I believe we have a basket of possibilities when we come in as a soul to this planet. And perhaps we are only interesting part of our destiny because our feng shui is closing off the energy to come in our life. And we are aligning our feng shui with our destiny and our mindset, then our destiny comes in in full potential. I believe if I would not have started doing my feng shui at 15, I would not be a feng shui master right now and teaching you this information. I probably would have been a really good scholar in law or in mathematics, what is also great. But I had some other possibilities in my basket of destiny. And now I am fulfilling my full potential. So can you. Some general activations to support your children and grandchildren. So activate the west area of your living room or family room with pictures of your children and grandchildren. Now, it can be all the children separately, or it can be you surrounded with all your children and grandchildren. That is actually the best way because then you create that family feeling, and they will get better along with each other. And you can place best these pictures in silver-looking frames. Do not place images on the walls of your staircase, because the energy goes up and down and you create miscommunication with your children. Do not put images of your grown up children when they were still babies in your living room because you tell them oh, for me you're still like a baby. No, they're grown up. Make sure you always adjust the pictures of your children in your living space as your children grow up. Make sure when you go in the children's room that there's no images of fiercy animals or weapons or toys fighting with each other. Do not place toys connected with a military team like soldiers, weapons, tanks in the children's room. Make sure they are covered at night when they are asleep. Also, I see many times that a child's desk is not in a power position and that they're sitting with their back to the door. Just make sure they're always sitting with their back protected by a wall and seeing the door towards the hallway. They will be doing better at school. Sometimes, we really want to create more color in a child's room and then they use a lot of red colors. Now, red stands for fire and can be too active for a child to fall asleep. I remember the story of the son of a billionaire. He was about 10 years old, and they had tried everything to make that child fall asleep, reading hours of books, giving him therapy, name it and they had done it. So I come into his bedroom, and he's sleeping in a bed that looks like a red Ferrari. It's very popular, but he's in a Ferrari. I don't know about you, but if you were sitting in a Ferrari, would you fall asleep? It's too noisy. It's impossible. Well, that red and that symbol of the red Ferrari was the opposite of what normally a boy should have, is calmness and peacefulness in order to fall asleep. So we took out the red Ferrari bed, and the child fell easy asleep. Sometimes I also see that children, even teenagers, they love to sleep with their mattress on the ground. You always need to have at least 30 centimeter away from the magnetic field of the earth. Otherwise, they have disturbances in sleeping and have sometimes nightmares. Also, there are a lot of children beds and they have cabinets under the mattress. And they put all their toys and all their junk under there. Now, imagine while you're asleep your aura field is all around you, also under you. And people have a harder time to fall asleep and have a peaceful night when there's a lot of junk under the bed. Even if there are no cabinets, but you just throw all the junk under the bed, it is not good. Make sure there's always space between the floor and the bed so the air can pass through and it will be a better, healthy sleep, not just for children, also for grownups. When your child has some awards or some certificates, make sure you hang it out in their bedroom and definitely focus to place it in their personal success direction because you definitely want to help them feel more confident for the future. So don't hide them in the closets or the cabinet space. The best colors for girls are rose, brown and beiges. Also some girls love some greens in the bedroom. But do not go for too much blues, because that is not energetically the strongest color for girls. For boys, the best colors are blues, yellows and oranges. Just make sure not too much blues, because that can create some more emotional disturbances. The next layer I want you to activate for a feng shui of your personal relationship is to look at your energy number and check out what is your personal relationship direction. Let's go over the energy numbers and see how you can activate your personal direction. For energy number one, your personal relationship direction is the south. So if you want to activate your family connection, you can always place pictures of your personal family in the personal relationship direction of you in the living room. You can also place a picture of your current personal relationship in your relationship direction in your bedroom. Placing these pictures in your personal relationship direction will be stronger than in the general. Also, for each child, I suggest to place in their personal relationship direction in the bedroom of the child an image of the child with the parents, an image of the child with the siblings. Even a child can also put their images with their classmates or their friends. So for energy number one, your personal relationship direction is the south. In your living room, it is good to activate, with the pictures that you place in your personal relationship direction there, a beautiful candle, and especially a red or an orange candle would support that area. In your personal relationship direction in your bedroom, you can actually also place some candles when you're awake, but then make sure there's always two or any other two items that work there. The south stands specifically for red and orange. You can definitely look for some figurines that have some of these colors in it or even you can place two red hearts or two orange hearts to activate in your bedroom. You can place these objects both in your bedroom or in the bedroom of your child. You're energy number two, or you're a man and has energy number five, your personal relationship direction is the northwest. In the northwest in your living room, it is good to place two metal objects. To show the personal relationship energy is activated, you can also add there a white quartz crystal to stimulate the northwest. Or you can also put an image of two stars or a beautiful image seeing the planets because it actual tells we are a family in the universe. In the bedroom in the northwest, you can also put a beautiful picture of romance, but definitely work with silver frames, 'cause that stimulates the northwest, using metal. The same thing you can do for a children's room to activate their personal relationship direction. The personal relationship direction for energy number three is in the southeast. In the living room, make sure you place at least two plants in that area. One plant shows loneliness, so put two beautiful plants in that direction. And in the bedroom, we do not put plants, but you can place an image of a bouquet of flowers or, again, some beautiful plants in that area. Or you will place fake or plastic plants in that direction, and you can do the same, also, for the children's room. For energy number four, your relationship direction is the east. The east, again, stands also for the past and for family, so perhaps you have a beautiful image of your parents or your grandparents that looks very romantic. You can place that there. For energy number five, when you're a man, check out the energy number two to activate, and when you're a woman and you have energy number five, listen to the energy number eight. Energy number six, your personal relationship direction is the southwest. So in the living room, even there you can place something very romantic. You can place two rose quartz hearts. You can also put a rose quartz candle holder with some light in it. You can even put a globe there. In the bedroom, definitely activate it with images of romance, two figurines that are loving looking at each other, two mandarin ducks, again, that are looking at each other. They're all very positive to place in your bedroom. The personal relationship direction for energy number seven is the northeast. The northeast stands for wisdom and knowledge, so putting some books about romance and about how to activate your romantic relationship and to create more passion is perfectly placed in the living room or in the bedroom for the northeast. You can also put images up there from two deities that are showing love and are, in history, known as being together. For energy number eight and when you are a woman and has energy number five, your relationship direction is the west. And the west is about joyful energy. So you can actually place something very funny and joyful, a cartoon or an image that makes you laugh, about relationships in your living room. It could be even an image of you and your loved one having a lot of fun together. And you can place that both in the living room and in the bedroom, and you can also activate it with a white quartz crystal. For energy number nine, your personal relationship direction is the north. The north stands for blue colors, but it also stands for water. You can also put an image of the ocean with a fleet of boats over the ocean. In the bedroom, you do not put images of water. So you will focus on placing, for example, two blue items or figurines that show romantic energy. And, again, you can place the same thing for the children's room. One day, I came into the apartment of somebody, and she has a energy number number seven. So her personal relationship direction is the northeast, so she did put some books up there about relationships. But when you look deeper into the title of these books, the books were all about how to deal with her divorce. So "The Best Tips for Divorce," "How to Get Rid of a Nasty Ex," these were the images. These were the kind of books that were there. She was actually still focusing on whatever had happened in her past, so I asked her to remove these books and to put books out there and DVDs about how to receive and how to find romance, not to focus on what is in the past. Also when you place books there, be careful and read the title and see if it really works for you. I found once in a child's room in the personal relationship direction two Japanese weapons that were hanging on the wall crossed. And I asked the child, "How is it going with your friends?" And he said, "Oh well, I don't really have any friends." I said, "Are you bullied at school?" He said, "Well, they're pushing me around." And I said, "Well, you have tried to protect yourself "by placing the weapons there saying not with me." I say, "But it's actually protecting, it's not inviting "friends to come in your life. "Let's remove these Japanese weapons "and put them in your cabinet "and tell me what sports do you like." "Oh," he said, "I'm a big fan of FC Barcelona. I said to him, "Well, are you playing soccer?" He said, "You know, the boys don't want "to play soccer with me. "I'm always like putting aside. "They don't think I'm really good at it." So we put an image of the team of FC Barcelona on his relationship direction, and within a few weeks, he started playing soccer with his friends. They were not pushing him around anymore, because there was like a new comraderie that started happening in his life. And he found another friend in his class that was also a big fan of FC Barcelona, and together they actually went to the local soccer team. And this young man became, 10 years later, a professional soccer player, not for FC Barcelona, but at least also for the national team. Now you can also quantum boost your relationships by using certain quantum colors. You can place in the living room, in your personal relationship direction to activate your family, colors like fuchsia and magenta. Fuchsia create collaboration so that the family will work better together. And magenta creates peace and harmony. In your personal relationship direction in your bedroom, you can quantum boost your romance by placing rose for love, pink for tenderness and red for passion. To quantum boost the relationship with your children and grandchildren, you can place in your personal relationship direction orange and peach. You will see in the PDF what is the time activation for the current year. You will activate it by placing in that area real flowers or an image of flowers if it's in the bedroom, or you can also place a bamboo image or real bamboo in that direction. In the next practical video clip, I will demonstrate how to stimulate your personal relationship direction. In your bedroom, we'll focus on romance. In your living room, we'll focus on your family. And we also will make sure that your children have better relationships by activating their bedroom.

<v Marie>Oh hello, I am Marie Diamond and I've come</v> to Feng Shui your home. Wonderful to connect with you! <v ->Hi Marie, lovely to meet you.</v> <v Marie>Thank you.</v> So, I would like to start with the children's room. <v ->Sure! Yeah.</v> <v ->Can you show me the way? Wonderful.</v> <v ->After you guys.</v> <v ->You have twins, right?</v> <v Chris>Yes, twin boys.</v> <v Marie>Wow, that's exciting.</v> <v Chris>Seven years old. Lots of noise, lots of fun.</v> <v Marie>Oh, that's amazing. So this is...okay.</v> <v Chris>Step right through.</v> <v ->First of all, I want to check what is the energy number</v> of your children. So, when I look at the app, I see that they are born on July 7, 2010. They are men, so I click on the energy number. They have energy number eight. That means that their success direction is Southwest, their relationship direction is West, their health is Northwest, and wisdom is Northeast. So we're holding at the center of this bedroom, and we see that their relationship direction is over there. So if we look at what is there right now, well they are definitely sleeping with their head pointed towards the West. So that's always really good, because they are tapping into that relationship direction when they are asleep. Okay, so that's the first good step. Now the second thing is, what I see is there's a lot of blue. Now, blue stands for water in Feng Shui, and having blue around you can create a lot of emotional disturbances, or just imagine the water were really there, you would not feel very safe. You would not sleep well, right? So this is actually an area where I would suggest to change the color. You can keep the blue in the rest of the room, but like, from this wall, the wall behind the bed, and this little area, I would change it to an earth direction, like an earth color. And an earth color could be beige, brownish, yellows, oranges, something that you think you like or that also they like. 'Cause right now, it creates too much emotional energy. So I want do to a little muscle testing with you. Even if your children are not here, you know, they are still connected with you, and so, let's do a little test on you first, okay, so give me your arm, you'll push up as hard as you can, okay, push up, okay. Think about I'm a woman, okay, push up, think about I'm a man, push up as hard as you can, you're weak, okay, 'cause your muscles are saying, "Oh, no, I'm a woman, I'm not really getting strong on this one." So think about your name is Mel, yeah, push up as hard as you can. Think about your name is Chris, that's your husband's name, okay, you're not Chris. Now I want you to close your eyes and think, "I'm connecting with my children," you know, with Harden, it's Arden? <v ->Arden.</v> <v ->So, think you're connecting with your children now,</v> Harry and Arden. Okay, so, is your body now connected with them, push up as hard as you can, okay, you're strong. Now, I want you to come a little bit closer here, okay, and so you're seeing where they're sleeping, so is that direction good for them? Push up as hard as you can, okay, see, you're strong. Let's say if you would face that direction, 'cause that's the South, is the direction good for them? It's not. The South is not one of their four directions if you look at the compass. See, if you look at the compass, so if you look at the compass, you'll see on the app, there is nothing there. So that is why they won't be strong there, okay? They're already sleeping towards their relationship direction, so that's a bonus, but let's check how the water makes them feel. So can I have again your arm? You look at the blue, how does that make Arden and Harry feel? Push up as hard as you can. You see, you're weak. Can you close your eyes and imagine, like, a beautiful beige, yeah? This is beige now, like a yellow beige, I think it would be great to have a lighter color there, so think how would they feel there, push up. See how strong they are? Okay, because if you do darker colors, the area becomes narrower. And it's already a narrow area, so if you do a little bit lighter color, it would open up. And also will open up their mind better when they wake up in the morning. It will be more positive. <v ->Okay.</v> <v ->Okay?</v> So when we look at this area, we see also in the West, there's not really images hanging right now in that part, and it would be great to have pictures of them together. I already saw in the bedroom an image of them together by like holding a Star Wars sword. That's not the kind of image we're looking for. Images when they're playing and having fun so you can put it over there, and even images with you and your husband together, to say "We are a family." I don't know if they are in sports, do they do sports? <v ->Yeah, a little bit.</v> <v ->Okay, what kind of sports do they do?</v> <v ->Just whatever the school sports are.</v> <v ->Okay, school sports, great.</v> It will be great to have like, even images of a team that they're part of the team, or a class picture, they can put it there but again, don't put images up that they're not really playing the sports because you don't want too much activity. But just like they're standing there holding a ball, or whatever they are doing, right? Now another interesting energy here is close to the bed, they have actually some interesting Star Wars pictures, so let's go and check this out. So, if you look at it, you see Darth Vader, and one of the negative characters of Star Wars like, ready to fight. Now, this is too close to their beds, so, because the mind doesn't make a difference between the reality and the picture. So, even if they're asleep, that energy is still there, so it feels unsafe, they feel like they have to be on guard, 'cause there's always some negative energy there coming to attack them. So, to have good relationships, both with their parents, with each other, and with friends, that energy is really too negative and violent. So I would suggest to take that away, and put it over that wall, because that is not one of their good directions, so it's okay to place that, but make sure that any violent images are away from their bed. Even there, you can put, again, pictures of them together, or even, as this is their success direction, more in this bedroom, if they have any awards or trophies, do they have that? <v ->No, not yet, they're too young.</v> <v ->Not yet, they're too young.</v> When they have it, you can place it over there. Or any dreams they have, or things they are looking up or even people they're looking up to, their heroes or, you know, the people that they think, "This is the best sports guy in my field," you can actually place it over there, okay? <v ->Mmm hmm.</v> <v ->So these are some suggestions I would do to make sure</v> that the relationships become better. Now one other point. As this is in the area of their relationship direction, and the Southwest having this strong, negative male energy, it actually creates some issues with the father, right? 'Cause it's Darth Vader, right? So it's like the father figure, and he didn't have such a great relationship with Luke Skywalker. <v ->I didn't think about it that way.</v> <v ->Right? So, make sure that is away, yeah?</v> Okay, great. So now I would advise you to go to your master bedroom to check out your personal relationship direction and the one of your husband. <v ->Great.</v> <v ->This is your master bedroom?</v> Okay, wonderful. Oh it's very open and spacious, lovely. So, when we look around, we're going to also check out again, your energy number and your four best directions, so I just want to share again, that you have energy number one, you're called a wealth creator. And so, your success direction is Southeast, your health is East, your relationship is South, and your wisdom direction is North. And for you, Chris, your energy number is number five, it's the same as energy number 2, for men, and your success direction is Northeast, your relationship direction is Northwest, health is West, and your wisdom is Southwest. So here we're going to really check out your personal relationship direction, because in your bedroom, it should be about romance, okay? So when I walked in, the first thing I look at in everything is to see what is the color, right? So also, you have the color blue, the same color as your children, and again that can create a lot of emotional disturbances, because it's too blue. It's like, just imagine you have a wall of water around you, you wouldn't feel safe. Especially around the bed, that's something I would try to avoid. So if you look at your bedspace, so if you look at your bed area, you have the blue there, and you also have three beautiful images. Now the number three is considered not a lucky number for your bed, because, like, you bring in a third party, right? So do they have a certain meaning for you, these images, or are they just abstracts? <v ->Um, we both like them, the meaning is</v> we discovered them on a trip to Tokyo together. <v ->Okay, wonderful.</v> So in that case, I would suggest to just put two of them, right, to just have that pair feeling. Another solution or another suggestion would be to have an image of something very romantic. If you would put a pair you would just say, "One is sleeping here, the other is sleeping there," but there's no connection, so having a very romantic or even passionate image connected with you or even an abstract or a beautiful painting connecting with the romantic vibration would be stronger, okay? So also the color there, again, is blue, so I actually would suggest to just take that wall, right where the headboard is towards, to paint it in a different color, like an earth color, right, so because earth is a really good combination between both of you. So you can even pick up some of the like, goldish beige, like a little saffron energy to put there, I think it would just come out more, and even the images would come stronger forward, right? So I would like to do a little muscle testing on that to just have that overall feeling, can I do that with you Mel? <v ->Sure.</v> <v ->So I want you to look at it right now.</v> How is that overall feeling of romance there? Push up as hard as you can. Okay, it's not so strong, right, so let's improve that. So can you just imagine, even if you would pick up, like, the color of the curtain, right? And you put that behind, instead of the blue. And let's just do now two images, just to feel the difference. Can you imagine that? close your eyes. Is it there, so how do you feel? Push up as hard as you can. See, it's strong, but I can still move your arm, you feel that? So can you imagine, again, that color of your curtain is over there, you take away these pictures and you put a beautiful picture of you and Chris. Can you imagine that? Okay, push up as hard as you can. You can feel the difference, yeah? And I know you are traveling a lot, so it could be even an image of a place where it's very important for you. Can I do that for you also? All right, so, look as it is now, how's it feeling for romance, push up as hard as you can. Okay, it's very weak, right? So, imagine the color of the curtain at the end will be a great combination right, put it over there, and just put now two of these images there, we're going to see how it affects you. How is romance there? See, I can, it's not so weak anymore, but even with one finger, I can move your arm. So take them away, keep the color, and put a beautiful image of you and Mel, perhaps in one of your traveling places, perhaps in a place that you love to travel to. Push up as hard as you can, okay, you can feel the difference? Whoa, I can keep pushing, and he has muscles, so. So that's a little twist I would definitely work on right away, yeah? So, first of all we're going to check out your personal relationship direction now. So, let's go and check out what that is, and that's actually for you, the South, yeah? So the South area of this place is this wall. This is a very powerful image, so it has definitely the right colors in it. I also see two people there, right? So greens and purples are really strong for that area. What, again, I see is that you have a sofa area here but again, it's like a threesome, like two people and one extra person. So in order to make that balance, I would look for a fourth area, I would look for a fourth sofa, so you don't have again the number three, you want to stay in even numbers or take one out, of course. But I would like to see if that painting is strong enough to activate your personal relation direction, okay? So I would like you to look at it, okay? And you push up as hard as you can and think about romance. Okay, push up. See? You're very strong. So it definitely is good enough for your relationship direction. So these are really great colors for you but I would love, perhaps, to bring some of these colors to the sofa. So even like that special red or that purple, to bring that as some pillows in that area. Would you like that idea? <v ->Yeah, and are there any colors that you would suggest</v> we avoid? <v ->Yeah, for you in that area is again to avoid blue,</v> right, okay, you have this blue wall. But I think, to be honest, that image is really strong enough to overcome the blue, right? So whites I would not put there that much either, but that's not really so visible. So, can you just imagine to put some of that red and that purple as some pillows here, and you just imagine you move away that chair for the moment. Could you do that? Okay, push up as hard as you can. Okay, you feel, even you're stronger, yes, I can keep pushing. You could even put some pictures of both of you, and even of you together with the children even in that area, yeah? Like on the sofa, like on the table, and definitely put like two candles there, because romance is all about pairs, all right? So can you just imagine that one more last time? Okay, close your eyes, imagine all the things we shared, how you feel. See, I can keep pushing, yeah? You felt the difference? <v ->Mm-hmm.</v> <v ->Okay, wonderful.</v> So now I would like to look at your personal relationship direction. So if we look in this room, where is your personal relationship direction? Then it's actually in that corner over there, right? So, if we look at this corner, right? Right now, who sleeps on which side? <v ->I'm sleeping on that side, and Mel's on this side.</v> <v ->Okay, so this bed is actually facing North, right?</v> Now North, as we have seen, is one of the good directions. It's actually a wisdom direction. So sleeping that direction, it definitely gives you some wisdom, so that's great. But it doesn't really activate you, right? So if you would sleep more on the right side you will be more towards the North area, and if you would sleep on this side, you will be more, if you would turn around or you would wake up in the morning, you would be more towards the West. That is stronger for you. So I also wanted to check out the Northwest area there, that you can actually activate by having this nightstand, and place there a beautiful image of you and your beloved, right? I see you have placed sort of some crystals so that is very strong, but you also have a wastebasket over there. <v ->Yeah.</v> <v ->Yeah. So you don't want to have a wastebasket</v> in your personal relation direction, because your romance goes in the garbage, right? So I would like to change your positions, and then you can activate that stronger. Because, if she is sleeping there, and this is your personal relation direction, you don't connect with it, yeah? So can we do some muscle testing to check this out? Why don't you first lay there, on the normal side? <v ->Excuse my shoes.</v> <v ->Don't worry.</v> Okay, so I would like to do some muscle testing with you, so give me your arm please, and I want you to push this way, and I'll push down. Think about romance right now, how do you feel? Push up as hard as you can. See, your energy is weak. Can you feel that? So I would like you to go to the other side of your bed. Even if you're still sleeping towards the North, you're already more to the West side of the bed. So, please don't cross your feet when you test, okay? So again, think about romance, push as hard as you can. See, you're much stronger. Can you feel that? <v ->Yes.</v> <v ->Okay, wonderful.</v> And then if you will have then here, images, like a beautiful picture of you and Mel, you can even put a picture of you and your children here, that is totally fine, but I love that you have some crystals here, right? And again, remember, you will have a beautiful painting here, right? And this will be painted in a warm yellow, or this will be painted in the same color as the curtains. Yeah? How would that feel? <v ->Nice. Cozy.</v> <v ->Nice? Cozy?</v> <v ->Yeah.</v> Right, so let's do this overall test. So close your eyes, think all this is already in place. How would you feel? Push as hard as you can. See, I can keep pushing you, you feel that? <v ->Yeah.</v> <v ->So you will be much stronger and also</v> in the morning, feel much more positive waking up, okay? <v ->Cool.</v> <v ->So that's always a bonus.</v> So I would like to check Mel for a moment. So Mel, can you go back to that area, right? Because now we have to see if you are still strong, right. So please try to have a feeling like you're laying down, because now you're sitting up. Okay, and put your feet next to each other. Okay, all right, perfect. So let me muscle test you. You're still facing with your head pointed towards your Wisdom direction, so we'll just focus on romance like it is right now, right? We haven't changed anything. Push up as hard as you can. Yep, it's a little bit weak. So imagine now again, the color of the curtains here, we hang something more different, these are actually good images for hallways, yeah? Because they don't say something personal. Just imagine a beautiful picture of you and Chris on a travel place, right? Push up as hard as you can. You see? You feel the difference? Okay, so these are the little changes I would make to make your romance one third more lucky and stronger, okay? So, I would say goodnight, I am going! <v ->Thank you.</v> <v ->Thank you.</v> <v ->You're welcome.</v>

LESSON 21 – Q&A with Marie Diamond

Hi, everyone. Good morning, good afternoon, or good evening, whatever the case might be for you. I am Alex, and on behalf of the Mindvalley team, I'd like to welcome you to your Feng Shui for Life Q &A coaching call number three. Time is flying really, really fast. This is your third call, and remember, we still have one more to go. So you are in the sixth chapter at this point, and we have a great session prepared for you. We will be covering topics mainly belonging to chapter five. which is Feng Shui, your health and well -being, and Chapter 6, which is Feng Shui, your personal relationships. And I believe you have great insights from this session. That being said, and without further ado, let's welcome our wonderful teacher on this journey, Marie Diamond. Hi, Marie. Hi, Alex. Hi, everyone. So happy to be with you. My God, it is flying. You know, definitely. This is already the third Q &A. And I've been trying to respond as much as possible in the group. And I've seen your, you know, moving forward with the class, you know. really implementing everything i'm super proud of you really you know as a teacher you can teach but it's ultimately the students have to have to take actions either cannot come into your home and do your things so you do it yourself and uh and also i want to thank you for helping and supporting each other in the tribe because some of you were there from the first week right away and they're really helped themselves, but also really helping others at coming in later into the tribe. So very happy and thankful that you're helping each other. It's just really amazing. So let us focus for a moment to get our energy together. So may I invite you to close your eyes and take a deep breath in and take a deep breath out. And let us just imagine now that you're in a beautiful space in nature, somewhere where The energy is calm and peaceful. And feel the sunlight filling your whole body and your whole aura field. And any stress you might have, any fear, any sadness or anger or anything that bothers you at this moment, just take a deep breath in and breathe it out. Take a deep breath in and just really let it go. So make some noise even. Like this. And as you're breathing out, fill your body more and more with this light of the sun. So you call in all this beautiful energy that is on the planet. Wherever you are, it is present. And then bring that focus of light to your heart, your heart chakra. And send out now from your heart a ray of light. And we're creating this big circle of light. This is our tribe energy. And bringing our light together. And let's focus to bring it all together to the headquarters of Mindvalley in Kuala Lumpur. And so wherever you are, let's focus and bring a ray of light to Mindvalley. To the team that's involved with... helping the tribe and helping you to become successful with Feng Shui for life. And as we're sending out this light to them, we are sending gratitude. And as we're connecting with the headquarters in Kuala Lumpur, at the same time connecting with everyone that is in the tribe. And we're sending gratitude to all of them for being part of this community, supporting each other. Knowing that other people go through this journey of eight sessions, that they're all implementing this for their highest good, for changing their lives, changing lives of their family and their business, and feeling each other's inspiration and change. And whatever positive change they have, it affects each other. So then take a deep breath in, bring your hands together, warm your hands, bring your warm hands in front of your eyes, open your eyes, and let go of your hands. Okay, I'm ready, Alex. How do I know what my strongest attraction category is for this year? Is it success, relationship, health? How do I find out? Let me tell you, right? So we are in 2018. So based on the time... vibration of the year we're actually um there is one of the four pillars success health relationship wisdom that is stronger so for people that have energy number one their highest focus this year is success and career yeah that's where the the most good luck is for them so they need to really focus on that but people have energy number two or they have energy number five they're men Relationship is their biggest focus. Can be personal or professional relationships. People have energy number three, it's success again. Energy number four, they have to really focus on wisdom and inspiration and spiritual growth. Energy number six, they have to focus on relationships this year. Again, personal and professional. energy number seven energy number eight and energy number five for women have to focus on success and career and energy number nine also focus most on wisdom this year let's move on let's see here and also I would like to first of all to acknowledge all the people that send questions so just for this just for the live calls till now we have received more than 200 questions so thank you guys very much for all of your interest and all of you all of the submitted questions as always we will not be able to go through all of them of course so we just chose the frequently asked ones do the contents of built -in cabinets shelves drawers or closets affect the feng shui for success or relationship in any room of your house you know the first rule is always what you don't see doesn't affect you so if the closet is closed off um then it doesn't affect you right but of course if you open up the cabinet frequently right let's say you have an open space and your success direction is part of the cabinets of your kitchen um and you open that you know many times let's say all your herbs are in there and your food uh food shelves are there and it's not well organized it will affect you so if there is a cabinet in one of your four main directions i would like even in your bedroom a cabinet where your clothes i would definitely still say because you open it up so frequently um like definitely mornings and evenings because you're taking take clothes out and put clothes back in is that you make sure it's organized and it's not overwhelming so it's not like you stuff all your clothes in it you just make sure it's well organized and when you open it up your brain has a feeling of order and harmony even let's say if it's a close in your your bedroom, make sure the clothes are hanging color by color. So it's not all this colors to each other. So like the white outfits and the darker outfits and the red outfit. So it kind of creates an energy and especially for clothes. If you open it up a lot and it's in one of the success of action, I would try to follow almost like the rainbow, right? So if you would go from red to purple, for example, yeah, I wouldn't go from purple to red, right? Or I go from white to black. So like white, then the colors like the rainbow and you can end with black. So that's kind of a good way to do that. But order and harmony is always one of the best things. So you always put too much stuff into one cabinet. Or make sure you put it in such a way that it's organized so it doesn't fall on you when you open up your cabinets. You know, that's not a good thing either. Because sometimes you cannot avoid it. And if there is a cabinet in your success direction, make sure you then look for another room where there is not a cabinet and activate that direction in that other room. Marie said that it's important to keep the space under the bed free. But you never see that space. What's the reason? It is, first of all, it's not good to sleep on the ground because there is a magnetic field connected with the earth and it's very important to keep that space open. So if you are having your mattress on the ground, you're actually in the field and sometimes the disturbances of magnetic field. So it is said that there needs to be a kind of a wind possibility, a chi flowing. under the space of the bed that's why you don't want to put any stuff under it if you still need to put things under your bed put it as much as possible towards your feet and not towards your head because you want to have some opening for moving energy of the magnetic field you will sleep better if you do that the second reason is also because when we look at our body we have an aura field all around us and even if we're on the bed with if we put things under the bed the space under us will actually be disturbed and so people have more tendency to have back pain or not feeling rested because the spine the aura field of the spine that is connected under the bed will actually not be having enough space. So there needs to be breathing space above you and under you. So that's why I will suggest if you have any boxes to put there, put them as much as possible towards your feet. Is there a point where we have too much of any element in our rooms? And if so, how do we balance these elements? Yeah, it is possible that we have too much of an element. So we have five elements, right? We have water, we have wood, we have metal, we have earth, and we have metal. So if we have too much of one element, let's say you have too much water, let's say you have too much blue, right? We actually, when we have too much water, we want to counter it. with putting more plants in it because plants need will absorb the water yeah so so that means we could add some more green yeah so green or brown colors will calm down if you have too much water energy so water it doesn't mean physical water it means colors of water right so that or images of water so to really calm it down If you have too much wood, too much plants, think about a wooden cabinet, for example. So everything around you is made out of wood panels, right? And you have all your furniture and wood. Then you can actually calm it down, weaken it with the element fire. So by adding some red objects or red flowers or red pillows will actually calm down if you have too much wood, yeah? um if you have too much fire so too much reds and you're like i'm not able to change that uh you can actually calm it down with adding some crystals or earth tones like yellows or oranges you will calm down some of that if you have too much earth so let's say you have so much crystals so much ceramics because that's also rock energy, you can actually calm it down with adding some metal objects or adding white or silver or gold as color. If you have too much metal, you know, too much whites and golds and silvers or too much metal objects or the walls are more metal, you know, material, then you can add some water, some blues towards it. or adding some water images, it will actually calm the energy down. So we call that the weakening cycle of the element. So if there's one element too much, you can weaken that element by adding another element to it. Before we go to the next question, here's a beautiful comment that we received from Jane. It says, I have never been so inspired to tidy up my living space before. I've shuffled around pictures and objects in my house and I feel my energy shifting. Yay. I love the idea that my course with you is there for me when I have the time because this fall will be very good for me to practice what I will learn. Thank you very much. A question that is kind of the opposite of this comment now comes from Anuja. Hopefully I'm not butchering your name. How long does it take to see changes after activating my four pillars? I did that in my office and saw no difference as of now. Yes, well, the first difference that will start being seen is that you start thinking differently, having new ideas coming your way, or even people coming with some new ideas and new opportunities to you. So I always say it takes between nine days and nine weeks to see the difference. So some people really feel within nine weeks, really like... really happening. The more sensitive you are, the more you already have worked also in changing your mindset before changing your environment, the faster these changes will happen. So I have people that really work very hard on changing their mindset already, but they were hitting a ceiling and then they changed the environment and within a few days you know within 10 days they start seeing these shifts happening but the first one is always how you feel like what you just shared that this person already felt the difference when you do the decluttering even if you have not done really all the steps yet yeah so i suggest to people if you don't feel any difference within a few weeks go back over all the areas because sometimes we think we have changed enough you know we have put the right things out then muscle test again if you have placed enough because sometimes we say okay i hang an image and you muscle test and you're like yeah it's strong but the good question is to also say i did I place enough to make a change? Yeah? So people say, oh, I put a crystal there. Yeah, but is that crystal enough to make a change? So ask your body that question because it's possible. In your mind, you're saying, oh, yeah, it's all good. But was it enough to make the shift? Yeah? Is it okay to put pictures of famous people? So for example, like the Buddha, Dalai Lama, Wayne Dyer, who have died. But to put these pictures in our wisdom direction, even though they have passed, their teachings are still very relevant. In the wisdom direction, when you have teachers that have passed on, there are masters in their field, right? I always say their image is like a symbol of their... mastery that is beyond time and space, right? These are not, we look at these images not because on a personal level that you don't have a personal relationship with them. They are representative of their wisdom, representative of their mastery. So in that case, yes, of course you can place it in your wisdom direction because it's not something someone you have a personal relationship with. You didn't have a You know, it's not their father, your father or mother, or you didn't have a personal love relationship with them. They are representative of that eternal wisdom they brought forward. So yes, no problem. I have still some beautiful jewelry, souvenirs, and memories from my ex -boyfriend. Should I put them away or remove them entirely from my house? I would love to have a new relationship again. I would suggest for her to place it in a beautiful box, right? Because if she has loving memories on that, that is fine. She doesn't have to remove it, but I would put it in a cabinet that is definitely not in one of her. best directions right and not put them out because if you put them out you're kind of subconsciously still connecting with that field of that old boyfriend so just put them in a nice box and just say well they're part of my jewelry box or something but they're not physically present in my bedroom or living room can be in your closet it can be even in your bathroom that's all fine Is it okay to place old pictures of my daughter's weddings and grandchildren when they were young and pictures of my deceased parents in my relationship court? So first of all, we try to avoid to put images of deceased people, even if they were your parents or grandparents or children, you know, or family members, in your personal relationship direction. The personal relationship direction should be about the living. about the ones that are in your life at this moment yeah so it's where there is your personal relationship is where there is active energy so when they're passed on there's no active energy anymore there's passive energy yeah so for people that have energy number one three four and nine i would then suggest to place the deceased family members in the west of their living room i wouldn't even put them in their bedroom i mean keep the bedroom for the living right if your energy number two five six seven and eight place images of deceased people in the north area of your living room again not in your bedroom but you can place pictures of your children grandchildren even if they were small in your living room but i always say try to update um as much as possible the pictures because otherwise you're kind of living in the past when they had you know a wedding so you can place it there but you know also place and more recent image of perhaps when you had thanksgiving or there was christmas or you know like um i would say once they hear make sure there's a new family picture where everybody's on there so even if you put like their wedding pictures the update is still there um i think that's connecting more with the living energy that is there right now. Other than the colors is there anything else to do to activate intimate relationship in the bedroom? Look for an image that shows an intimate relationship. and hang that above the headboard yeah but again it cannot be like a nude image of one person it needs to be um then um you know an intimate image that both you and your partner really love that shows the couple energy so you can place that there colors are beyond culture so that's easier to work for everyone because it depends on your spiritual or religious background or you know your the things you really connect with on an intimacy level so you need to really have a conversation with your partner on that to really see what is the kind of image that relates with what you both like and would love to have What if your partner, this is probably a very common question, what if your partner doesn't cooperate when I move things around to clear the way for health in our family room and bedroom? Do you have any suggestions there? Yeah, I think this is one of the reoccurring questions that we have seen. you are sometimes so enthusiastic and you really want to change things around and that the partner is not cooperating. So, I mean, I've been there myself. So when I started really focusing on feng shui with my partner, right? So I know how it feels. So one of the things I always say, try to say to your partner look i really want to give this a try um can i just place this there for like let's say two weeks because you need nine days to make the shift happening if you don't like it we can then place it back i just want to give it a try so If they don't allow you to give it a try, then I actually question a little bit about your relationship, to be honest, right? So they're like, they don't give you a lot of freedom in that case. So just say like, let me give it a try. I want to, you know, I'm practicing this. I want to give it to see how it feels, how it impacts us, right? So you can do that. You can then try to bring them into the conversation. Say, look, this is your health direction. Can I do some testing? Can I check out how does that feel for you? Start an open conversation with it and said, you know, you have this clutter here in your health direction. How have I been feeling lately? Oh, I've been feeling tired. They will have had an impact about this because, you know, even if they don't believe in feng shui, because you don't have to believe to have a feeling. of impact from the the bad feng shui so they say yeah i've had more headache or like i gained weight and i said well and you can say it could be related i don't know but can we give it a try to declutter this or put something else what would you if you feel like to feel great let me look at you energy number book these are the things that are really good for you what would you like yeah so open up the conversation and that's how i got my husband into it to be honest is to really share a conversation and um and let him think about his health or think about his wisdom um and now you know when i move into a new space My husband would say, okay, how's my health direction? You know, how is my relationship direction? Right? And I said, well, you know, these are some things we can still place there. And he'll say, oh, can you muscle test? And so now he's totally convinced, of course, after all these years of being with me. But in the beginning, I really had to do step by step. So don't push your partner. Keep the conversation open and light. Don't say, you have to do this. You know, it's so important. Don't go into the drama of things, right? Because I've seen many people. do that. So don't go there. Just keep it light and open. Say, you know, I'm learning this and always say it with a smile and then your partner cannot resist you. The health direction in the bedroom for me is directly the door. What do we do in this case? It's not a good thing, but you know, if you can't activate your health direction there, make sure you activate your health direction in your living space. Yeah. So what you can do is, for example, on the back of the door, uh put an image or a poster or colors that are connected with your health direction definitely make sure you don't have a hanger there with your pajama on it or you know i've seen that happening um so and put it or above the door you can put some of your quantum colors your quantum affirmations even on the door i know you got this beautiful affirmations in the right colors you can put it on the door it will work like i said perfect feng shui doesn't always work now in case you're saying i really really can't place anything there then put some health affirmations or health things in your success direction in your bedroom. So if you can't put it in the health direction, put your health energy in your success in your bedroom. Here from Joanna, a question says, Marie talks a lot about entrances to the houses, but one topic is not really being covered, which is what if we live in a building and the elevator? opens directly into our apartment how do we treat the entrance in this case so in that case your elevator is your front door yeah it's like you you have them to stand facing the elevator and check out that direction yeah so is it a good thing not so really because when you're You know, you cannot really connect in with the outside. You first have to go down or up, right? So one of the things I always say to calm down this up and down energy is when you walk like into your elevator to put left and right from the elevator, like a beautiful plant with round leaves to calm the energy. So you feel like it's like going into your garden. right so that's something you can do or to put left and right from that elevator symmetric a little table with a candle on it so that you like or a lamp on it so you kind of open up the energy so you're creating a symmetric vibration left and right from your elevator and then when you would come out of the elevator the first thing you will see is then your hallway yeah so it could be that it's a hallway it could be that's part of your living room you're walking in so that will be then your entrance and so what i would suggest and remember we talked about temple lines that your front door could be on a temple line right so check out if your elevator if you stand in front of the elevator is facing do east or south or north and west and in that case if it is hang a hexagram of the temple line the barcode above the elevator entrance because that is in that case your i call it mouth of chi to the world yeah so it is you know you work with what you have but try to create symmetry left and right and then make sure that in front of your elevator you put a little carpet. So it's like when you come out of the elevator, you have a little carpet to say, that's my entrance. Yeah. And then again, you can connect in where in the house is that elevator and look for the best elements and the best color for that area for the carpet. My success direction in my bedroom is a window this time. What to do to activate in this case? Yes, so I always suggest to people to place a table in front of the window, put some symbols on it. If in case you cannot activate your success energy in your bedroom and your success in your bedroom could be about relationships more, then you activate just your relationship direction, your health and your wisdom direction. And then you put and activate your success direction in your office space or in your... your living space. I had it once that I could not activate my success direction. It was where the door was, right? But you know, my success is not in my bedroom, right? It is actually in my office. So then I really focused on there. So that's why you have three spaces where you really focus on where you sleep, where you work and where you live. And if you can already activate two out of the three, you will be really fine. So don't worry about that. If you only can activate one, well then it will be even better than you have the feng shui before. So think about you want to be perfect in everything. Perfection does not exist in feng shui, but it will be better than what you did before. So it says we don't touch that much on the subject of kids rooms in the program, but the kids room is a bit different. for us at least when we don't because we don't have that much space the kid rooms the kid room also has a play space in it so they sleep around surrounded by stuffed animals and toys uh do you think that that is optimal for health i had um i have three children so i still have a 14 year old daughter so i i know how to work with the feng shui for children and it is the same basic principle right the basic principle is that you are not having clutter or too much information out for the children so make sure you put the most of the toys or in the cabinets or in boxes not see -through boxes but really closed off boxes so that at night when they go to sleep they don't have all this information Yeah, it's very hard for them to stay focused and have a good night's sleep. You activate their directions, yeah, success, health, relationship, and wisdom. And sometimes you can really use, you know, their toys as symbols, right, to place in their success direction, right? Or in their wisdom direction, you put like their bookcase or everything about school, you can put in their success direction. So their little... back with all their books for school or their report card or in the relationship direction they can put of their family, their friends, their team. So what I like to do with children's rooms is I always ask the parents to get these cork boards or these white boards and hang them in these four directions. And so then children can draw, for example, their dreams and they put that in their success direction. You can ask your children, like, oh, do a painting about being healthy, right? And you'll hang them in your health direction. You know. draw a painting about to school, right? Sitting in a school. So use their creativity and hand them on the cork board. They love it. They really love doing that. And once they know this is like, oh, this is my success board and they make paintings, they will come to you and say, oh, I made a painting about this. Where can I hang this mommy or daddy? And then you say, oh, it's over there. So that's how I did with my children and they loved it. Now stuffed animals, I would rather place that in the wisdom direction for children, right, than in the relationship direction. Because their relationship should not be with stuffed animals. It should be with children, right, and family and school. So stuffed animals are like the ones that give them inspiration. It gives them a good feeling, a good energy. So put that in their wisdom direction. Also make sure your child tries to sleep a good direction with their head because it really makes a big difference in their studies, in their focus, in a good night's sleep. And make sure that, you know, the paintings, the... The images that you have around them are nothing to do with violence or weapons, to not have all this energy around them, no wild animals. Sometimes people put like wild animals, think about dinosaurs or tigers, and they put them higher than where they sleep. I always say don't do that. Always when they're into these wild animals, put them on the ground so they are controlling the wild animals because otherwise they will attract more bullying and people that are controlling them with more violence. So always put violent animals, even stuffed animals, on the ground or lower than where they sleep. And again, you can put... their bed like in a good direction and their little table makes sure they see the door, they face a good direction, they will do better at school with that. I feel very overwhelmed. Every assignment I have to do is blocked by clutter everywhere. Do you have an overriding feng shui action to take to deal with the overall clutter so i can find the energy to deal with the clutter so i can get on with the assignments and feng shui for life impact and changes well thank you for sharing that you feel overwhelmed and i think it's one of the reasons that you felt already overwhelmed before that it was hard for you to find harmony and peace and organize things so it means It's really a good thing you're connected with Feng Shui for life. So I always would suggest, first of all, focus on the clutter that's in your bedroom, right? Because if you are taking all the clutter out of your bedroom, even if you put it somewhere else right now and it creates more clutter, your brain will at night at least feel rested and have more energy to move forward with the rest of the clutter. is like strip your bedroom and move it all away. That's the first thing. Activate your directions in your bedroom so that at least at night, your brain can receive all this good energy. So that definitely will be very helpful for you. The second thing I would look at is try to where you work, your workspace, if you have a workspace, to declutter there. yeah now one of the things is if you have too much clutter just take white fabric and place it over it till you're ready to deal with it yeah so white fabric it's like the sun is shining on it the energy is calm so that's a way that i suggest people and before you start doing the the cluttering take some time to go outside take a fresh breath Do some really good energy with the air coming into you. Do your tubes of light meditation. Spray some lavender mist really around you and in the space where you want to declutter so your brain is open. All your senses are open. And bring in an... Sometimes that's hard to do, but bring somebody in to help you. Because if you were not able to organize things before, you were already very overwhelmed probably through stress or through so much work already. You were not able to organize it well before you will have a hard time to organize it yourself. Yeah. So. I would say take a deep breath and ask somebody to help you with this. Yeah. I know it's not always easy because you don't want other people to see your clutter and your mess that, you know, or the stress that has been created for you. But, you know, it's a really important thing. And I will send you a lot of good energy so it will be easier for you. I saw. examples in the personal relationship area where doing Feng Shui helps achieving one's goals and aspirations. But my question is, did the other person do Feng Shui as well or not necessarily? What would be the explanation why the other person achieves the goal without Feng Shui? Like I said, Feng Shui is one -third of the law of attraction. right so it is possible that that person has really good connection with the spiritual aspect and spiritual alignment through meditation that they have a very open and clear mindset and take actions right so you can achieve your goals without feng shui but it is for some people harder and more and with more effort that they are achieving it because they don't have the foundation. Now, some people will hit the ceiling. It's possible that they are like, okay, I'm able to do this. A lot of people do wonderful work with mindset changes and they achieve their goals. What feng shui does, it makes it easier and more effortless. And especially the people that start hitting the ceiling, that just a mindset alone doesn't work enough. And by doing this, you're aligning completely the spiritual part. the human part and the environmental part to make it easier and more effortless. So I'm not saying you cannot have it happen without feng shui. I'm saying it's much easier with feng shui. That is wonderful. Okay, I see here several questions along this line. I'll try to combine them. I share a room. um with my wife and kids i sleep in the same room with my wife and kids uh i sleep in the bed with my younger daughter and my wife with my older daughter i would like to know what should we parents and children do to enhance the relationship between ourselves but also with the exterior people like friends like family I think in case it is possible right I don't know your personal situation is to make sure that the parents have their own space to sleep together and have the children their space to sleep together right when it's time for it it's possible that your children are very small and that's one of the reasons you do this because it's important for the children to create around their beds on the nightstands on the images around that bed more to focus towards them right well the parents then can put on the nightstand images or uh image above the headboard connected with with their relationship because right now if you um have you know your your child and a parent what do you place around it you you put something around for the child it's not good for the parent and if you put something from the parent it's you know not good for the child so you know i've seen that and i had the same experience i i brought my my daughter stayed for a couple of years staying with us in our bedroom but i was very very clear about that that she could not put all her toys around in my bedroom so i made sure she had her space in her bedroom or in the living room that was focused on her my space and space of my husband was for us if she wanted to come and join us in the middle of the night you know in the morning that's fine but she could not bring all her toys there it's really important that you create a space for parents or space for children. And if it's in the same room, make sure there's an area for the children, an area for the parents. From Debbie, quick question. You said there should be no water in the bedroom, but can we have water bottles at least by the bedside? Of course you can. You can have a cup of tea there. That is not a problem because it's just a bottle of water. But if you would put six liters of water there, you would have a problem, right? So it's because then it's just too much. This is just for personal use. So don't worry so much about that. I'm a three. And in the relationship area, you said the only thing I've heard you say in the course was to boost the relationship. area with flowers is that all i need to do no your personal relationship direction you always and um go back to you know the idea of what do i want in my relationship so you can put an image there of um of course flowers is good but that's a general thing put an image of your relationship if you have a relationship put an image of you and your partner there If you have not a partner yet, you can put images that are showing beautiful partners together. Could be a statue of two partners together. It can be two quartz hearts, for example, rose quartz hearts, or any item placing it as pairs. So not just single items, like one candle holder with a candle in, it shows. one person you can do two candle holders with like some pink or red uh candles there or in the quantum colors that work for your relationship direction so you can you always need to go back to seeing what can i personally place there or it could be a book about um i'm thinking about one of my dear friends marcer men are from mars women are from venus john gray right so you could put that book there or any other book about relationships that could be helpful for you. So any other symbol that you relate with, you can definitely place there. Okay, Lizzie, I saw here a very interesting question from Surya, because you mentioned that feng shui is just a part of the law of attraction. Marie, what are you personally addressing for the other two thirds of the law of attraction? Well, you know, when we do the tubes of light meditation, that is part of the inner diamond that we're addressing. And each time when we do meditations, I actually, when I do the activations for the colors in the meditations, I'm working with what I call the inner diamond feng shui. So that is how to align. And if you're connecting with your top of your magical hat, that is part of that. you know, my meditation that I'm doing for that. And of course, on the level of the human luck, right? I always say the first one is to be very grateful for everything that happens in my life, right? For the good things and the challenges, because that helps your mindset always to put in the right direction. um definitely my me personally you know definitely having positive thoughts and positive feelings um one of the things and um i hope that in the future we can share about that um you know working on your vision board right um and in your energy number book you also have the possibilities to work on your vision board so writing down, having a book with goals, right? Writing down your goals, writing down your intentions, and of course, taking actions every day. You know, one of the things I like is a principle that when I have a big to -do list, right, in my actions, and it's something that Jack Canfield shared with me, is the ABC system is to say, okay, I have tons of things to do and I just make a list. i write three columns the a list of to do the b list and the c list the a list is like today i need to do this today right i write in the first column the b list i have to do this week and c list i have to do this month yeah so this is helpful for me for actions because i have you know i'm a busy lady too um and it could be even that you're writing down I have to do this or I pass it on to somebody from my team or and then I write down the names on it so that's something how I try to do this and try to do as much as possible but also really clearing clearing the energy and that's where when we do the tubes of light meditation when we work with a violet light we're actually clearing every day Karma, we clear everyday emotions, we clear everyday limitations. So the tubes of light are actually affecting not only your spiritual connection, but your human luck and changing that. So keep doing it. Marie, would you recommend picking the things that we want to activate? What do I mean by this is that there are so many things to activate it. It feels like everything is getting mushed together. For example, if we are going for success and health, can we just concentrate there? Of course, you can concentrate on what you feel is important to you. So in feng shui for life, We kind of give you all the directions because one person needs to really activate success. Others really are coming in to take this beautiful program to work on their health. Others are like, I want to really focus on my personal relationship direction. So we cover as much as we can in these eight weeks, but it's up to you to make that decision. you need to focus on in your own life and it's possible that you're right now want to focus on your success but you have this program it's available for you because you have purchased this it's in your library I think right Ezra and Alex for as long as they're part of of this so if like in a few months you're saying I need to focus on on my health then you can listen again and and focus on that aspect so Some of you will go through your whole home and work on all directions. And some of you need to really feel into, you know, I really, that's what's missing right now in my life. And use what you want to work on. And if in a few months or, you know, if in a few years, you feel like I need to really focus on my personal relationship right now, go back to the program and. look at it again and i sometimes say to people in the beginning of the year right because you know we're working now at this time this is summer but like saying beginning of the year then you can look back at it and say like yeah this year we need to focus on my spiritual growth oh let me go back to the wisdom part of feng shui for life and now take time to activate that in my home so you don't have to do all We would appreciate and we know it will be benefiting you to do everything. But you have your time, take your own rhythm and make your choices. That's wonderful. And yes, it's correct. Exactly what Marie said. As long as you maintain your course, you'll have access, lifetime access to the course. And you will have any and all future updates done to the course. You will receive them automatically. It will be updated and it's always free of charge. I am divorced. How can I activate the rooms in my house, including my bedroom, to help bring a significant partner and romance into my home? First of all, make sure that everything connected with your previous relationship is out of view. You know, you put it in a box or you put it in a cabinet, so you don't connect with your previous relationship. Make sure... you look at your personal relationship direction, definitely in your bedroom, in your living space, and activate that for your energy number. One of the things you can do is, if you're a woman and you want to attract somebody, is to look for an image of peonies. So the peony flower, right? And it can be like... real peonies it can be a fake peony it can be an image of peonies and you put it and hang it in your personal relationship direction now the moment you meet someone and it's the right one take that away because otherwise you will have trouble so that's for women now for men right for men you don't hang peonies but you put like a bamboo plant yeah a little bamboo plant or an image of bamboo in your personal relationship direction. But if you do the real flowers or the real plants, the real bamboo plant, put it in your living room and don't put it in your bedroom. Again, once you have that person being attracted, then move it to a very successful symbol. We are at time. So thank you very much, Marie, for all of the time and all of the wisdom that you brought to this session. Thank you very much. It was wonderful to be with you. And I'm looking forward to see all your wonderful updates and reactions in the Facebook group.

Week 7: Social & Professional Relationships

====================

LESSON 22 – Feng Shui Your Social & Professional Relationships
--------------------
<v ->Welcome to chapter seven.</v> Today we're going to share with you how to Feng Shui your social and professional relationships. First we're going to share with you the general Feng Shui to activate your social relationships and we're going to make sure we activate that in your living room. Social relationships are about your friends and your acquaintances. The first place to activate in your living room is the Northwest. The Northwest stands as general purpose for friends and for traveling. When you have images of your friends, even when you're traveling with them, it will stimulate the future in your relationships with them. You can definitely place this images of them in silver or even white frames. When you're a woman and you really want to stimulate to be together with your girlfriends, you can also place images and photos with them in the Southwest area of your living room. Now, I definitely suggest not to have too many friends pictures in your bedroom otherwise they will kind of invite themselves to stay over longer or more. Do not put images of your friends on the fridge door in your kitchen because you invite them all the time to eat the food that is in your fridge. When you want to have a lot of friends over into your house, you can definitely put some pictures in the entrance of your house or apartment but if you have too many of them, you actually are saying to your friends, this is your home. Stay over all the time. Make sure you also update the pictures of the friends you have in your living room. Pictures of friends that are not longer in your life, let them go to make sure that the new friends that have come into your life feel welcome because their pictures are there. I know young people put all their pictures on social media or on their smartphone. Print some out and place them around you to activate your Feng Shui. Make sure there's some balance between the pictures that are in your living room, pictures of yourself, from your friends and your family. Not all directed towards your friends because your relationships are more than just friends and acquaintances. When you feel there's not a lot of friends that come over to be with you in your home or apartment, make sure you create some warm spaces. Place some carpets so you can sit on it and hang out. Put some more pillows in different beautiful colors like earth tones and yellows and oranges and roses and greens in your sofa to really make this home more welcoming. When you enter your living space, make sure your sofa is not with the back to the door 'cause you're telling your friends, stay out. I want to be alone. When you have in your living room too many single items placed or too many images of single men or women, then you're actually say to your friends, look, I want to stay with myself. I'm not inviting you in my life. Start placing these items together like by twos or fours or six. Always use even numbers 'cause when you put items together in threes, you're actually saying, well there will be some conflict happening between these three people. Make sure when you put pictures out of your friends that you are also in the picture because otherwise you are not connecting with them and if possible, make sure you are in the center of the crowd. When you feel like you've been hanging out too much inside your house and you want to go out more and meet more people, it's good to activate the South area of your living space. And you can put there images of your favorite artists or invitations you have or tickets to a concert or just put some images and items that support entertainment. Now let's focus now on the general Feng Shui for your professional relationships and you will activate them in your office or the place where you work. To stimulate more collaboration or teamwork in your professional relationships, activate the Southwest in your office. You can put there books about collaboration and teamwork. You can place there quotes on teamwork. You can also put images there that show teamwork. But just be careful, there's this popular image of a rowing team and they are really going for the victory, but it's water and the Southwest you do not want to put images of water because it creates muddy relationships and collaborations will fall apart. There's also a popular image that they show for teamwork and you see people climbing a mountain or the Mount Everest but let's be honest, it's hard work and not everybody is reaching the top. Plus it's winter and they're all behind each other, so it's not a good image for the Southwest. Look for images where people are holding hands, doing sports together. You see them really as a team. You can even put a picture up from your favorite sports team as they're proud to represent their team. Also, a globe is a really good symbol for the Southwest to stimulate collaboration. When you want to expand the reach of your connections on a professional level, you can also put a map in the Northwest area. If you want to activate your local community in your professional life, you place a map of the local area. If you want to reach out more to other countries, international, you can put out a map of your continent or if you want to go global, you put a map out from the globe and you can even indicate on the map where your clients are located. If you feel like you need more support from the team or from the management, you can put that image of the team or the management on the wall behind you to really say I'm supporting you. Always make sure you're still sitting in a power position so you can see the people coming in. But also when you have an open landscape in your office, position yourself to see the door and as many other people in the office. Your connection and your eye contact with people will be easier and the team spirit will be higher. I remember my first job as a lawyer, I was positioned with my back to the rest of the team. It was an open landscape, but it positioned my desk facing the window. Even the manager was not paying attention to me. I changed my desk around and made sure I could see as many people as possible from the team and we start collaborating much easier and even the manager started noticing me. If you want more clients to come to your company or reach out to you, then it's important to have on the other side of your desk one or two chairs so you're like communicating with your clients. Even if you have clients online, you actually have a space for your clients ready to be there in your office. And if you have space in your home to create a little waiting area at the entrance to put like two chairs out, comfortable chairs, not old chairs, then you're actually saying, I am allowing my clients to come in. And if you have a company space, definitely always have a little lobby area with two or more chairs with a little table to have some marketing information on it so you say to the universe, there's so many clients for me that they're already waiting in the lobby before they come to my office. The first time I went into business, I had created a center. A center of wellbeing and spirituality and so in the beginning it was really tough. People were not reaching out to me and it was even thinking that I would go back to become a lawyer and then I created a little waiting area. And first we put some old chairs and I said to my husband, to be honest, if people have to wait hours to see me, they just won't feel comfortable. I put some wonderful leather couches out in my waiting area and before I knew it, it was all the time filled. It was so filled that I had a waiting list for one year before people could come to me to have consulting and mentoring. When you want to attract some more well known clients for your consulting or business, then make sure you put well known clients or famous people in the South area of your office or even in the South area of your waiting room. And definitely in your personal relationship direction. And even if you don't have yet the clients, you can already put images up of future clients that you really want to have. At a certain point, I put in the South area of my office an image of Jerry Hall because I really thought she was an amazing woman and I wanted to meet her. A few years later she became my client. Now we're going to focus on your personal relationship directions and activate your social and professional connections. For the social life we're going to activate your personal relation direction in your living space and for your professional relationships, you'll focus on your office or your workspace. In your living room you will always place in your personal relationship direction, images of your friends and acquaintances. In your personal relationship direction in your office, you will focus on for example, putting the image of your CEO, your management, even you can put gratitude letters from clients or even famous clients you have, you put their picture up. You also can put everything connected with PR. Perhaps you were on television or on radio. Make sure there are pictures or symbols from these different stations in your relationship direction. If you have a lot of PR, then you create a map. And you put all your PR information in that personal relationship direction in your office. When you want to focus on certain countries for your business, you can also put flags or symbols of this countries in that area. When I want to expand my business to a certain area of the world, I get always a symbol and place it in my personal relationship direction. One day I was really getting in meditation that I needed to expand to Latin America. Now I did not know anyone in Latin America, but from a previous trip to Mexico, I had bought a little Mexican hat and I put it in my personal relationship direction that for me is the West. The next seminar I had in the United States, somebody came to me and said, I'm so passionate about your work. I'm actually a project manager that brings new products and new brands to Latin America. Can I do that for you? And I said, where do you live? And she said, in Mexico. I said, we're on. And indeed from that point on we started developing the Latin American market and I have many students in the Latin American countries but my Mexican hat is still in my relationship direction. It's also possible you work in the multi-level marketing industry and you have an upline and a downline. Make sure you have an image with the people that are in your upline and you have a picture which is downline teams in your personal relationship direction to activate the good energy. I came to an office once and everybody in the office was sitting in separate cubicles and the team spirit was really not great because they were always with their back to each other. I suggested to the manager to change that around to make sure we would just slightly change the desks so that at least they would see one other person or if possible more. He told me that before people would kind of take a lot of sick leaves, they didn't really like coming to the office but since we changed everything around, people showed up for work, they had more fun. There was more social connection and the company thrives from it. There was a man and he had the image of his boss and the CEO of his company behind the door and the door was always open. I said to him, how do you feel about your CEO? He said, well, the more I don't see him, the better it is. I said, well, you don't see him. He's behind the door so but that also means your CEO is not seeing you. Said, how has it been with promotion? He said, well, several times I was not getting the promotion I desired and I was passed by by younger people. I said, okay, let's take the picture of your CEO and I asked him to place it in his personal relationship direction in his office. And he said to me a few months later, it's really interesting, I got another promotion and I was invited to play golf with the CEO. And said, finally he sees me because I can see him. Now I will overview all the energy numbers and talk about the personal relationship direction and how to activate it. For energy number one, your personal relationship direction is the South. For activating your friends and acquaintances, make sure you place some pictures in the South of your living room and add some candles and lush flowers. For your professional relationships, activate the South in your office or workspace. If you have any awards or any media, how you are as a professional person definitely placed that in the South area to boost all the fame and recognition. And definitely add some light in the South. For energy number two, your personal relation direction is the Northwest. In your living room for your social connections, make sure you activate the Northwest. You can place there personal pictures but definitely add also some crystals because it anchors your friendships. And in your office space, the Northwest needs to be activated with the people that are experts. It could be coaches, teachers or books in how to become the best expert in your field. To activate your personal relationships for your social and professional life for energy number two and for energy number five for men, your direction is the Northwest. For energy number three, activate the Southeast. For your social life make sure you place with the pictures in your living room, some lush plants to tell that your connection with your friends is striving and blossoming. In the Southeast of your office, activate your professional relationships. You can place some bamboo there, but also as the Southeast stands for wealth, perhaps you can find some images of people that have really created wealth in your professional field. Even if you have pictures with them that will be better. But just placing this images of this wealthy people, you're telling, I'm open to wealthy clients. For energy number four, your personal relationship direction is the East. In your living room, place a beautiful plant to really say, I have longterm friends. Even if you have pictures from your longterm friends from the past when you were younger or when you started your relationship, that would be a good thing. In your professional environment, you can activate your personal relationship direction with placing a plant in the East. But also if you have any old pictures from the company you're working with, like from their start or from the past, that would actually tell the universe that you want to stay in a longterm relationship with that company. When you are a male and you have energy number five, you're connecting with energy number two and when you're a woman, listen when I talk about energy number eight. Energy number six, your personal relationship direction is the Southwest. In your living room, place images of your friends in the Southwest area and you can activate it with adding some rose quartz crystals. The Southwest area of your office activate your professional relationships and as the Southwest connected with women and teamwork, show images of teamwork and also collaborating not just only with men but also with women. For energy number seven, your relationship direction is the Northeast. Now, sharing wisdom and sharing spirituality and religion with your friends is something that is important for you. Perhaps you have an image of you and your friends doing yoga together, meditating together. That is a really good step for your relationships in the living room. Activate the Northeast in your office for energy number seven. Make sure you place some amethyst crystal because it anchors your longterm relationships. Also, put up there biographies of people that have been very successful in your professional field. When you have energy number eight or you are a woman and has energy number five, your personal relationship direction is the West. In your living room you will activate that by placing there pictures of your friends having fun, having joy, playing games, even on the beach where there's a lot of still water around you. And activate it with adding some white quartz crystal. In your professional field make sure you are placing also images of social media, of being creative with other people, even graphic design. Anything that shows this creative focus towards your relationships. You can definitely add some citrine gemstone to activated it. Energy number nine, your relationship direction is the North. In your living room to stimulate wonderful connections with your friends, you can put some blues or you can also even put a little bubbling fountain. In the North area of your office, make sure you show there the future. Show what kind of relationships you want in the future. Show even graphics of the amount of clients you want in the future and you can activate it also with some blue and even a fountain. I came once in a office and I looked at the personal relationship direction of a manager. And he had this beautiful image of him standing in the Grand Canyon just really on the edge with his arms open and he said, I love this picture. I said, can I ask you something? How are your employees reacting to you? Do they feel like you're pushing them to the edge? You're like really demanding a lot of things and you kind of feel lonely in your relationships with them. It's like you feel like you have to do everything. They don't listen to you and he looked with his weary eyes to me and he said, how do you know? Are you're clairvoyant or something? I said, well, this picture tells me I'm alone on the edge of the world. There's nobody around you to save you when you fall. There's not even anyone surrounding you to support you. He said, this is how you've been feeling, so he removed it. And I asked him to put a team picture up. He said, we don't have a team picture. I say, well, the next birthday party that's coming up, take some pictures, everybody will have fun and put a beautiful team picture in your personal relationship direction. When I heard from him later, he said it was really amazing. First of all, my mindset changed because I started being open to listen to people before that you are right. I wasn't even listening to the people around me. I felt so alone but I start listening and opening up and of course they were ready for that. They were waiting for me to be more open and have a better team. A client of mine had activated her South area. She was energy number one, so the South was her personal relationship direction and she put in the South of her living room, all images of friends when they were actually on a sailboat. Having fun, having a drink but you saw a lot of water. Now remember the South has this element fire so when you put a lot of water around it, you actually are taking the fire away. I asked her all the friends that are there, are they still in your life? And she looked and she said, you're right, nobody that's on that boat is still in my life. I said, yes, because you actually let them drown. You lost the fire between them. So I said, do you have a picture of these people like in a different environment? She said, yes, because I really want to have them in my life but you're right, they don't call me anymore. She found another picture when they were standing on land with the sun shining on them. Remember the South needs sunshine, needs light and she experienced that not everyone from the friends but most of the friends start calling her in the weeks after saying, it's been so long, let's hang out. There are some quantum boost colors for your social and professional relationships. For your social relationships, you also want to put some pink if you want some more tenderness from your friends, that they have more loving support for you. Perhaps you want some more balance with your friends, some more downtime, then you can put some ruby reds and to activate the collaboration in your professional relationships, place some fuchsia item in your personal relationship direction in your workspace. Also, every year there is a time activation for friends and professional connections. For this current year, go to your time activation PDF and see what is the right area in your home to activate this. For friendships, you always will focus on putting plants, lush plants, bamboo in that area that we indicate for your time activation. For professional, you will put a map connected with the reach of clients you want to have or if you want global clients, you put a globe in that area where is your time activation for the current year. In the upcoming practical video clip, I will demonstrate with you how to find and activate your personal, social and professional relationships in your living space and your office.

====================

LESSON 23 – Enhance Your Social & Professional Relationship
--------------------
<v ->So, when I look at your energy number,</v> you have energy number one. You're a wild creator. Your success is southeast, your health is east, your relationship direction is south, and your wisdom is north. Now, for your husband, his energy number is two. He's a teacher. His success direction is northeast, relationship northwest, his wisdom is southwest, and his health is west. So in this living space, we will check for both of you what is a good area and how to activate your social and professional relationships. <v ->Okay.</v> <v ->So, Mel, we are here in your living space, yes?</v> So, when you come in from the door, there's definitely a direct flow coming into your living space, and it's very welcoming. So that's really good for both your personal and your professional relationships because the flow is welcomed. The only thing that I would suggest is that when you follow the flow, you're actually stopped by this table, right? So I would move that table perhaps over between that one couch and the other, so that people just would walk in easier. So, that's the first thing I would definitely change. But otherwise, it's a very welcoming energy. The big couch is actually in the power position, so everyone who sits there sees the incoming energy and right now, your dog is definitely in the power position of the house, right? So, the other thing I would suggest is when you come in, you want to always have something that is calm and peaceful. And right now, there's this big beautiful painting, but I don't know what it really means. Can you tell me what that stands for, that image? <v ->Oh no, it's just an abstraction by an artist that we like.</v> <v ->Okay, okay.</v> Well, you know, one of the things is it's quite chaotic, color-wise, right? So that's not so positive for the relationships for everyone that sits here because it's quite overpowering. So, if you want to change that, it would be really great to have on this wall images of the family, of you as a couple, with he children, with friends, with family. Because then you're like saying, you know, you're all welcomed here, right? So, that could be a good swap or a good change, right? So, another thing, when you come in, you always want to tell to people, you're very welcome, but also, it's not just for you alone, it's not just for the family. And so, if you look at, you come into the living space, there's this lonely horse, yeah? There's this lonely horse. So I would suggest to take, for example, this beautiful crystal, citrine crystal is really powerful for relationship, it gives joy and harmony, and put that in the center of your coffee table. Put some candles around it. If you wish, if you want to keep this beautiful painting, you could even put some pictures of the family on the center of the coffee table so that at least there is this welcoming energy. And the colors otherwise are very beautiful because they're earth tones, and earth tones always give a good harmony for the family. And you can even put some more pillows in that. But definitely try to avoid reds and greens and blues. But I don't think this would match here anyhow, all right? So that's the first step I would like to work on. Then, if we look at your personal relationship direction, and I look at your birthday, and so when I look at the app, we see that your relationship direction is south, right? So, if you follow me here, and we're going to stand here. So, you see the south is actually where your windows are, that side of the window, you have some space. Right now, it says, I don't have relationships energy here, okay? So, I would suggest to perhaps put a picture of you and the family and you with your beloved one, you know, on either side of that window. You have some green over there, but I would event suggest to have some more flowering plants over there. So when you look out there, that you see like a beautiful lush plant against the wall. That would be telling my relationships are blossoming. If you look at your personal relationship direction, you see right now there's the window and there's not really something telling that this is good for your personal and professional relationships. So, can I do some muscle testing? <v ->Sure.</v> <v ->So please come forward.</v> So look at this and think about relationships, push as hard as you can. See, you're quite weak. Your mind is saying, well, I'm not supported here, right? So, can you just imagine, you put like on the side of the window, like a picture of you and your husband, your family, and you can even, you know, part of this bookcase even, you can even put there some images of friends and family. So you could use that. And I want you to imagine instead of seeing that wall, having like a blossoming plant there. And the color for the south is red, so if you even would have like a red blossoming plant or even you can go for oranges because I have seen that you really like earth tones, right? Can you imagine that there? <v ->Yeah.</v> <v ->Now can you close your eyes?</v> Yeah, and just imagine everything I said. How would your relationships be personally and professionally, push up, you see? Yeah? You're much stronger, you feel that? So these are the little suggestions I would do. I still want to go back to your painting, right? I want you to feel like what this painting does to you, okay? Energetically, subconsciously, even each time you come in, right? So I want you to look in that direction. I want you to look at the painting, and I want to test out if that painting is supporting your social relationships, okay? Look at it and see how you feel. Not strong, right? So, I would just imagine just for the fun that you take that away, right? So, I want to test this out and just take it away in your imagination. And you place there images of you and your family, pictures of friends, of your extended family. Can you just imagine that there, okay? <v ->Yeah.</v> <v ->Close your eyes.</v> Okay, it's on that wall, the painting is gone. How do you feel about your relationships? You see, you're much stronger. You feel that? So, it's a beautiful painting, but I would place it somewhere else, yeah? A place where it's not so affecting you personally. <v ->Okay.</v> <v ->Now, interesting enough here,</v> again, for your husband, who is northwest, so when we look-- So your husband's personal relationship direction, when we look at the app, he is actually an energy number two. And that means his personal relationship direction is the northwest. So when we look here, this is actually the northwest, right? There's water, the hot tub, now, that can be really great, you know? But for the rest is quite empty, and again, you don't have windows. And you cannot really active something, you know, on top of the windows. So what I would suggest is you have this little area there next to the hot tub. I would suggest to put out two beautiful chairs with a little sitting area, so that from here out, we see there is a togetherness, there's a harmony between the relationship. And you can even put a beautiful crystal like on the table you put there, so that from here out, his relationships are supported. <v ->Okay.</v> <v ->Okay?</v> So let me do a little test. I know you are not your husband's right now, but I want you to look there, that direction, and I just want you to think about your husband, okay? Push up, okay? And think now about his personal and professional relationships. And think about, look really at the hot tub and that area, how does that feel for him? You know, it's weak. Can you just close your eyes and imagine you'll put some, like two chairs there. The best would be whites or silver or gold if you want with some orange pillows in that area. And even putting like a crystal there or even, you know, some rocks if you wish, you can put it there, can you imagine that? <v ->Okay.</v> <v ->Okay, think about his personal</v> and professional relationships, and see, he's much stronger. You can feel that, okay? Wonderful. So now, invite me, I will check out your office space for your relationships. <v ->Yeah, sure.</v> <v ->Okay, let's go.</v> So, this is your office space? <v ->Yes.</v> <v ->So, hi!</v> So, this is where the headquarters of the company is working. <v ->Hi.</v> <v ->Pretty much, yeah.</v> <v ->Okay, wonderful, hi Chris, again.</v> So wonderful to have you here. We're going to check out first your professional relationship direction. <v ->Okay.</v> <v ->So the first thing we always say,</v> you have to be in a power position to have strong professional relationships. The power position means that you see the door. Now, Chris, where you're sitting, you're seeing the door, for sure. Where you're sitting, you don't see the people coming in. So even if your clients never come in here, it still is the incoming chi and so we need to move the energy a little bit around. So, we're going to reposition the desk in a little bit, but the second step is you always want to make sure you'll face a good direction. So based on your energy number, you have four directions that are strong. For you, it's northeast, northwest, southwest, and west. And for you, it's southeast, east, north, and south, so they're different, right? So, as you have two desks, that's actually really easy. You can then make sure that you are seeing both the power position and facing one of your good directions. And also that you see the door and face one of your good directions. <v ->Okay.</v> <v ->So, I would like to check you out.</v> I will start with Chris. So, Chris, may I invite you to sit on your desk? <v ->Sure.</v> <v ->Yeah, right.</v> So, I'm going to do some muscle testing, all right? So, you are seeing the door. So, should be good. But the question is will you sit the right direction? So, when I look at the compass, you're actually facing north, yeah? Now, if you look at the app, we see that north is not one of your good directions, yeah? There's nothing there. <v ->Okay.</v> <v ->So energetically, you are not stimulated there.</v> Do you like sitting here? Do you sit here a lot? <v ->Yeah, it's okay.</v> <v ->It's okay, well, we'll see how it feels.</v> So, we're going to do some muscle tests, and so, can I have your arm? Okay. You push up and I push down, so push up, okay. Say, my name is Chris. <v ->My name is Chris.</v> <v ->Okay, see, you're strong.</v> Say, my name is Peter. <v ->My name is Peter.</v> <v ->And see, you're weak, right?</v> So your body is like, I don't like that, right? So, just think now about your professional business and the clients and your team, okay? And you'll face that direction, okay? How do you feel there? Okay, you see? You're weak, right? So even, you let go of your hand, so even if you see the door, that energy does not give good energy for professional relationships. So in that case, we always want to make sure you face one of your good directions. Now, your personal good direction for a relationship is actually the northwest, and that's over there, right? So, my suggestion would be to take a desk and to actually place it here kind of kitty corner so you would face that direction. So, and we're not going to change your desk right now, but I would like you to stand up and stand over there, yeah? Facing that direction, so just imagine your desk would be there, you will be sitting there and you would look there, you will see the door. And you are facing the right direction, so let me do a muscle testing now. Okay. So think about your professional relationship, think about your team, your boards, you know, everything, your clients. Think about that and how you feel? You see how strong you are? <v ->Yep.</v> <v ->Yep, much stronger, I can keep pushing.</v> You can feel the difference, right? So, it actually means that sitting here, one third of your good luck for a professional relationship will actually go up. So here was not bad because you still had a power position, but you personally becomes actually weaker here. So I would suggest to have your desk like kitty corner, like you see the door. So that's a suggestion. Is that doable? <v ->Yep, I like it.</v> <v ->Okay.</v> So actually, I would suggest to take the office desk of your wife and put it here, okay? <v ->Okay.</v> <v ->Because that is not a good direction anyhow for her, okay?</v> <v ->Okay.</v> <v ->So now I would to check how Mel is doing in this place,</v> yeah? 'Cause we want her to be as strong as you, of course. So Mel, may I invite you to first check out your old space? So, sit down here, okay? So, you're facing that direction. Now, the direction for you is east. What is a good direction for you, but you don't see the door. So that means that you are not in power, you are not the queen of your business, yeah? So I really want you to be thriving in your business, right? So you sit, no, no, you look that direction, okay? So, let us check this, how is your connection with clients and your team? Push up as hard as you can. See, you're weak, you feel that? Yeah? People think I have a magical finger, but it's just because your body doesn't react, okay? Now, I want you to come and sit here, right? Because this is facing also a good direction for you, it is your wisdom direction, right? North. But if you sit here, you see, you see the door, right? So let us check out, you face that direction, how are your professional relationships here? And push as hard as you can. See how strong you are? Okay, you feel the difference? <v ->Yeah.</v> <v ->Okay.</v> So, what I would suggest is to move this desk a little bit over, right? And then to take this desk and put it kitty corner, okay? You still are connecting with each other because I think that's one of the things you like about this setup, that you can talk to each other. So you still are able to talk to each other, but now you become the queen of this office, and you become the king of this office and you're facing the right directions. Okay? So that's the first thing I'd do. Then I would like also to activate your personal relationship direction. So, if we look at your relationship direction, we see that this is the northwest for you, right? So, we see that part of the bookcase is northwest, so it would be good to instead of the books that are there right now, I looked at it, there are some detectives there, right? <v ->Yeah.</v> <v ->So that's not really telling something</v> about your professional relationships. So you could remove that and put some pictures up from your teams. Definitely also putting a picture of both of you because you're both working here. Or you can put biographies of very successful men and that you perhaps would like to be related to and then connect with, right? But you have space between the door and the bookcase and you can there put images of your team, I don't know if you have business partners, you have? <v ->Sort of, yeah.</v> <v ->Sort of, right?</v> So you could put a picture of you with your business partners. Definitely, like I said, a picture of both of you. You can put a picture of you with your children, but this is not really personally related here for your children, right? So I would perhaps avoid that. <v ->Okay.</v> <v ->Northwest also is very strong with crystals,</v> so you could put also like a quartz crystal there, yeah? So, is that easy to change? <v ->Yeah, absolutely.</v> <v ->Yeah, and the best frame for the northwest</v> is silver frames. <v ->Okay.</v> <v ->So I would place that over there.</v> <v ->Okay.</v> <v ->So let's do a little test with you.</v> So, the way it is now, okay? So, look at, it's an empty space, there's a bookcase with, you know, detectives and other kinds of books. Whatever is there isn't supporting your professional relationship. Push as hard as you can, yeah? Even if you're facing the right direction, it still doesn't relate with you. Your subconscious mind doesn't get any good feeling from it. So, can you close your eyes for a second and imagine part of the books are gone, right? You can put books on successful people, and I see some of them on your bookcase, so it would be really good to move them over. Put a picture of you with your beloved, even team pictures, or any images that support teamwork and collaboration. Yeah? Think about it, put a crystal there. You can even put a little table there and put some pictures on the table. Okay, you see that? <v ->Yup.</v> <v ->How do you feel now about your professional relationship?</v> Push as hard as you can. Ooh, now you're a strong man, and you can resist me, right? <v ->Yup.</v> <v ->So you see that this, just a little shift,</v> but it creates one third more luck in your professional relationships. So I think that's good to move forward to that. <v ->Cool, I appreciate it.</v> <v ->Okay, lovely.</v> Now, your personal relationship directions, Mel. They are actually behind you, okay? So in a way, it's good to have support of your relationships as you will sitting at your new space. But it's a bookcase. I would actually suggest also to put some pictures of relationships above you. Or you have some space here. So even to have here an image of you and your husband, you know, it's like he's supporting you in your work. Do you have teams you're working with? <v ->Yes.</v> <v ->Okay, so you could even put an image</v> or a symbol that supports that vibration in this area. Now, the south is always strong with plants, so even if you would put like a plant up there that's kind of hanging plant, that would be actually supporting you, okay? So that's a little twist that I would bring for you. <v ->Okay.</v> <v ->Okay?</v> So, I would say this is definitely an easy solution. I also love the fact that as you're sitting here, you both have access to that couch, you know? So, just imagine your clients would come in, what they probably don't do physically. You're both sitting and you can see them coming in and taking a seat, okay? Wonderful.

I'm looking very much forward to seeing you next week.

Week 8: Wisdom

====================

LESSON 25 – Feng Shui Your Wisdom
--------------------
<v ->Welcome to chapter eight.</v> Today we're going to talk about the feng shui of your wisdom. What does wisdom stand for? The wisdom energy in feng shui, it's about your connection with heaven. But it also is about your knowledge and your wisdom, your education and also your spiritual path. Feng shui is not a religion or a philosophy, but it supports whatever religion you have, whatever you believe in. I have clients from all kinds of religions and belief. I've people that are spiritual, orthodox Jewish, Catholics, newborn Christians, atheist people, it doesn't matter because it activates whatever you believe in. It enhances your spiritual practice and also your path towards enlightenment. It enhances your spiritual practice and growth. You also get better results with coaching and mentoring by using the feng shui of your wisdom, and also to have a better and a happy mindset. So there are some general steps that we can use to activate your wisdom. The strongest area in the compass to activate your wisdom is the northeast. The northeast stands for gathering wisdom, information and connecting with heaven through a spiritual path. So activate the northeast in your bedroom, your living room and your meditation space. What can you place in the northeast? The northeast is really focused on teachers. So you can place their images, statues, and figurines that connect in with your spiritual teachers, whatever is your religion or philosophy. It is more directed towards male energy and spirit guides. You can, for the whole family, have a family altar in the northeast of your living room independent of what is the personal energy number of each family member. You can activate it with an amethyst geode in that area. When you're more connected with female teachers and divine mothers, then the strongest area to activate for your spiritual growth is the southwest. There you can use earth colors and earth symbols. When you connect in with shamanic and native traditions, the southwest is the strongest to activate for your wisdom, including if your spiritual practice is connected with tantra. Also, when you're connecting with the spirit guides connected with Mother Earth, like fairies and gnomes, this is a good place to activate it. The strongest crystal to use there to activate that area is the rose quartz. When you want to activate, to have good mentors and coaches to support you on your spiritual path, then it's good to activate the northwest. You can place a quartz crystal and images and books on coaching and mentoring. And you can put there the images of your coaches and your mentors and books on that subject. When you meditate and pray, make also sure that you're sitting in a power position and you're facing the door of your living room, bedroom or meditation area because you want to really have the spiritual energy to come to you and support yourself with it. Also make sure you have a support in the back so that God, the universe is supporting you. The bed way to meditate and pray is not only to sit in your power position but also to face your wisdom direction where we're going to talk about later on. One of the symbols for wisdom is a mountain. Not a mountain covered with snow, unless just the top of the mountain, but definitely place an image of a mountain in the summertime. Also, when you want to see as the most wise person in the room, make sure you take the chair with the highest back. It can be in your dining room, so that the mother and father chair would be the one with the high-back chair, you will consider the most wise person towards your children or even in your office. If you have the high-back chair, you'll be considered by your clients and students as the one with the most wisdom. I've been in many homes in my practice as a feng shui master, and one of the things I always have to suggest is to let go of some of your books. People love collecting books. But some of the books are not longer serving you. So it is good to go through your books and see if perhaps, in your five-back exercise you can let go some of them towards your friends and family, to goodwill or even to sell them because your spiritual journey has been moving forward, you have been evolving and some of the books are just not longer necessary to hold onto. I myself have a very strict rule on books. In my house, I only have 30 books. If I buy a new book, another book has to go. In order to gain wisdom, you also have to have clarity and if you feel you have no clarity about your purpose, you can activate it by placing an aqua blue item in the north area of your bedroom, living room or meditation space. Some people have difficultly to focus when they are studying, when they are gathering information, when they are working on a project. In order to have more focus, put a light blue or an Irish blue item in the east area of your living room, office or meditation place. Also, I see that people sometimes, when they want to pray and meditate, have a hard time to stop the monkey mind. Make sure your space where you meditate and pray is zen. There's no chaos, everything is clear and the less images you have around you, it's better to keep your monkey mind quiet. For some people, it's also good to have a fountain around them when they are meditating or praying because it keeps the energy light. You can even spray some lavender mist before you pray or meditate because it creates some more prana and it release the heaviness of your thoughts and feelings in that area. When you want to have more faith and have stronger intuitive connection, make sure you place diamond-shaped crystals or glass in the northwest area of you meditation place, your bedroom and your living room. Each one of you has a personal wisdom direction. Look at your energy number and check out your personal wisdom direction. It's important to activate your personal wisdom direction in your living room, bedroom and meditation area. You can put there your journal, you can put there your diary, you can put there an image or a statue of your personal teacher, coach or mentor. Energy number one, your wisdom direction is in the north, so using blue colors, especially aqua blue in that direction will help you to stimulate your clarity about your purpose and your spiritual practice. When you have energy number two, or you have energy number five and you're a man, your personal wisdom direction is the southwest. So definitely place a powerful, divine mother energy in that area. For energy number three, your personal wisdom direction is the east. So connecting with practices from the east or teachers and masters from the east and place them in the east direction will stimulate you. When you have energy number four, your personal wisdom direction is the southeast, and the southeast stands about abundance. So place there books about the spiritual laws of abundance. When you have energy number five, and you're a man, you will activate your personal wisdom direction exactly like energy number two. When you're energy number five, and you're a woman, you focus on the same directions as for energy number eight. Energy number six, your personal wisdom direction is the northwest. So traveling for gathering wisdom and finding your spiritual purpose is a good thing for you. So place a globe in the northwest area. Energy number seven, your personal wisdom direction is the west. So make sure you work with your creativity to activate your personal wisdom direction. So create your own wisdom art and even your own poetry and place it in the west area. Energy number eight, and the women that have energy number five, your personal wisdom direction is the northeast. As the northeast is the general activation for wisdom, it means that wisdom will be very important for you and teaching about what you know will be part of your journey. You can activate it by placing there a beautiful amethyst. For energy number nine, activate the south for your personal wisdom direction. Make sure you place a beautiful light or place there your meditation candles. A mother had four children and she was complaining to me that her children just didn't like to study. She tried everything to make sure that after they came from school, they would still do their homework. They found all the excuses in the world to just not do their homework. So I asked her to check out the northeast area of her living room. In the northeast area of her living room was a garbage can saying to the children it doesn't matter if you study, it will end up in the garage can anyway. So I asked her to take the trash can away and to hang there certificates that her children had collected over the years. One certificate for each child. And she really saw a huge difference in the coming months. When she was asking, "Come on, let's do your homework," they didn't come up with any excuses anymore. And they trusted more the process of studying. They all started doing better at school. I came to the bedroom of a young boy. And his mother said, "Well, I really want him to pray more "and go to the church but instead, he always goes fishing, "Instead of going to pray with us in the church, "he loves sitting by the lake to catch fish." So I checked out the personal wisdom direction of this child. In his personal wisdom direction, he did put all his fishing rods and images of the fish that he did catch. Also, his personal wisdom direction was the north. He was energy number one, so being with the water created peace and harmony and he actually connected with heaven through that experience. It was his meditation place. So I suggested to her that this was normal but if she wanted also to have him come with her to the church, I suggested to place also in that personal wisdom direction, north for him, an image of Jesus to protect him as he was going to fish. And she told me that he started coming to the church with her and some Sundays he just would stay fishing. I was working with a public speaker and supporting her and mentoring her. And she said, "It feels like people are just not listening "to what I'm sharing. "They're interested but they don't go to the next level." And I said, "May I ask you to check out "what is in the southwest "'cause the southwest stands for female teachers." She did place there spiritual teachers but they were all men. And she said, "I even told people, "if I would be a man, you would listen to me." And I said, "Well, you told your home "that if you would be male, you would be accepted. "So take all those pictures of male teachers away "and only place powerful female teachers there." And she said it was a remarkable change. She attracted more clients, more speaking engagements, she was able to share her wisdom in a better and a bigger way. I suggest that when you place an altar for the family, you place it in the northeast area of your living room. Once I found the altar and all the dedication towards God and the universe in the kitchen, just next to the sink. Now, how do you think that went? I asked the lady of the house, "How is it going with your law of attraction? "How is it going with your prayers?" She said, "Well, I think God doesn't know I'm existing. "Nothing happens." And I said, "Well, it's the place of your altar. "You are not even respecting the altar. "You're not even respecting God "because you just say he's part of my kitchen. "He is part of my food. "He's just next to the draining sink." And she said, "Oh." So we took all these beautiful items, placed it in the northeast section of her living room and many of her requests to the universe and to God started manifesting. Based on certain traditions, facing east is the best direction to pray or meditate. Now, that is definitely a good direction for energy number one, three, four and nine, and especially for energy number three, the east is the best direction to face when you meditate or pray. But for energy numbers two, five, six, seven and eight, the east is not one of the good directions and you definitely want to avoid that. So it's not because traditions are saying that for thousands of years, that it's true for you personally. So make sure you definitely look at your personal direction, pray towards that direction, meditate towards that direction or any spiritual practice that you have and activate that direction with the right images. There are also some colors that quantum boost your wisdom. In order to grow as a spiritual human being, it is important to have more compassion. The color to activate compassion is saffron yellow and you can place it in your personal wisdom direction for any energy number. When you feel like you don't know the direction of your spiritual path, then placing an aqua blue item in your personal wisdom direction will activate creating clarity on your path. And when you have a lack of faith in your intuition and in your inner messages, and even in the teachings you receive from teachers and wonderful people on your spiritual path, place something in a diamond shape or a diamond color in your personal wisdom direction. Each year there is also a time activation. Check out your Time Activation PDF to find out what is the best activation for this current year to stimulate your spiritual growth and wisdom. In the next practical video, I will demonstrate in your living room and bedroom how to activate your personal wisdom direction.

====================

LESSON 26 – Optimize Your Living Room & Bedroom for Wisdom
--------------------
<v ->So when we look at your wisdom direction</v> that helps you on your spiritual path and also how to support your wisdom and gathering knowledge, that in this area, it is actually in the north for you. Energy number one has north as wisdom direction. And that's actually exactly where your fireplace and you television is. Now the television is good because you can watch documentaries and see the news. So the television is a good item there. The north also can use black or blues, so having a black television is a good symbol. But you have a fireplace, right? And the fireplace actually creates fire and brings down the water vibration and the water element of the north. So my question is, do you use your fireplace? <v ->Only for a month a year probably.</v> <v ->Okay, so that's good.</v> You're living in warm California. But the moment you place it, the moment you use your fireplace, I would definitely suggest to put or a bowl of still water next to it or to put left or right from the fireplace some items that are blue <v ->Okay.</v> <v ->Right, that'll be helpful.</v> Also I would suggest to take the plants away either left or right of that wisdom direction, because plants slow down the water energy. So you have this cabinet on the right side. I would suggest we take the plant out there, 'cause already crystal and the light, but I would suggest to put any books or any items or figurines connected with your spiritual beliefs or your religion, yeah? So I don't know what that is for you, but could be an angel, could be a Buddha, could be a saint, could be books on spirituality or self-development. So I would actually place that over there. So let's do a little muscle testing to check you out. So if I can have your arm. Okay, and I want you to look at your wisdom direction as it is right now. Is it a good area for your wisdom, whatever is there? Push up as hard as you can. You see, the television is helping you, right? But it's still not very strong, okay. So now I would like you to look at it and think how is your wisdom feeling as it is now. Push up and look at it. You see, it's not very weak, but it's not super strong. So can you imagine we remove the plants and you activate that area there on the cabinet. You put some books on self-help or anything connect with your religious or philosophical beliefs. Can you place that there? Okay, see you immediately went over, strong right away. You could feel your body was already reacting, right? So that will be a really good thing. So is that doable to change that around? <v ->Yep, yeah, absolutely.</v> <v ->Okay, wonderful.</v> Now we're going to check out the wisdom direction of your husband. And for him it is actually the southwest, yeah? And from this room, the southwest is actually the staircase. <v ->Okay.</v> <v ->Right?</v> So his wisdom goes up and down, right. But it's also part still of your bookcase that you have there. But behind the staircase there are some items that you have stored there. So for example, your vacuum cleaner is there. So I would remove the vacuum cleaner, right. And I would like you to place again on the right side of the bookcase some books connect with his wisdom. I don't know what kind of books are there right now, but if they are not related toward the wisdom he needs, the information he needs in his daily life, I would move them out. And also one of the things I always say is make sure you bring the books to the shelf edge. 'Cause now they're too much pointed inside. So bring them forward and, you know, take all the things that out there and move them up. So you have pictures there of the family. Now, these are family pictures we could move to another area where his personal relationship would be supporting, yeah? So let's do little test on him, yeah? So may I have your arm? Now I want you to just think you're him, because you're related, interconnected. Push up as hard as you can, okay. Now I want you to check out the staircase, the area where you have items stored and that right side of the bookcase, how does that feel for his wisdom direction? See, it's weak, right? So imagine that you cannot change the staircase, so we have to leave it like it is, right? Just move away the vacuum cleaner and the stored items and the right side of the bookcase, bring the books forward. You can even put some of rose quartz crystal there and some symbols of wisdom for him. Can you imagine that? Close your eyes. Okay, think about wisdom for Chris. See, he is much stronger. You feel that? Okay, so these are the little tweaks I would suggest so that he will feel more supported in his spiritual and in his knowledge wisdom. <v ->Okay.</v> <v ->Okay, wonderful.</v> So now I would like to check out the wisdom energy from you bedroom. So, I think we need to use the stairs, right? Okay, let's go. So let's check out in your master bedroom your wisdom direction and to see how it supports your spiritual paths, yeah? So for you, when we look at your number, your wisdom direction is the north, right? And so the north in this room is actually the way you are sleeping. So that's actually really good. Since you moved in here, how have you been sleeping here? <v ->Pretty good.</v> <v ->Do you have any dreams?</v> <v ->No, actually.</v> <v ->No, okay.</v> <v ->But I don't generally dream very much, so.</v> <v ->Okay, well, having revealing dreams is always a good thing</v> on the spiritual path. And so when we look at this area, the color, you know, blue kind of bring the dream state down. So I would suggest to change it in a color that's more warmer, like a warmer beige. But definitely the images that are hanging there, they're very psychedelic, I would say, right? As above your headboard, I would suggest to go more of a romantic energy anyhow. But I would suggest, you know, here, next to your nightstand, you have some crystals and candles, that's really nice. But I also would put some books, like even a journal. Do you journal? <v ->Not really.</v> <v ->Okay, well then I would suggest another book</v> that you're reading right now so that always the book that you're reading right now about spirituality or religion or making or improving yourself, right. I would always place it next to you, right? <v ->Okay.</v> <v ->'Cause you're activating that direction.</v> Is that something you could do? <v ->Yeah, absolutely.</v> <v ->Yeah?</v> So the way it is right now, let's do a little muscle testing on your wisdom. So think about it's blue, these images, there's nothing really next to you to support it. Push as hard as you can. Okay, so we'll changing the color to like warm beige, we take these images away, we're replacing something more romantic. You also put, you can put one book and more books about self-help, yeah? Push up as hard as you can. Oh, you're much stronger now. Yeah, you feel that? So this is a little change I would definitely make there. If you wish, you can put even a little statue there like an angel or a Buddha or anything with your background on your spiritual path you can place there. I would not put more than one, right. Because otherwise it becomes like too much like a temple. Yeah, but anything you feel that based on you personal belief about spirituality and wisdom you want to place there, you can definitely do that. <v ->Okay.</v> <v ->Okay?</v> Wonderful. So now I'm going to check out the personal wisdom direction of your husband. So let's go to this area, because this is actually the southwest and that is his personal wisdom direction. So right now what is there is a big coffee pot, right. Something water with something inside, I don't know what that- <v ->Charcoal.</v> <v ->Charcoal, okay.</v> You have a beautiful image of space, but I think that is about a magical night. So tell me about it. <v ->Oh, that's the constellation</v> above where we were when he proposed. <v ->Oh, beautiful.</v> I would actually suggest to remove that. I would say the coffee pot is not really something about wisdom, right? I don't know, the water with charcoal, if that's a certain meaning for you? <v ->No, that's just a filtration system.</v> <v ->It's a filtration system.</v> So I would move that out of that area. I definitely would put some crystals and definitely quartz crystals. Like rose quartz crystal is very positive there. Even light two candles there. But also anything that supports him in his personal wisdom direction. So is there any spiritual belief he connects in more specially or a spiritual practice that he has? <v ->I mean, sort of.</v> <v ->Yeah?</v> <v ->But I think, well, we have a bunch of books</v> and things like that. <v ->Okay, wonderful.</v> Would that make sense over there? <v ->Yeah, actually I saw some books over there, right,</v> that could be really positive. There are self-help books so whatever it was there, could actually move over here, right. And any image that he feels like, oh would just stimulate his personal spiritual belief, he could actually hang that over there, yeah? Or it can be an image of an angel or a Buddha or saint or a totem or something that he feels like personally very connected with, right? So you can place that over there or as figurines or as images, right? <v ->Okay.</v> <v ->So let's do a little test about him.</v> And so I want you to think about Chris, right. Push up as hard as you can. Okay, you become Chris. So look at it as it is now. Is this supporting his personal wisdom direction? Push up as hard as you can. It's not, okay. Can you imagine to take that coffee pot away and the charcoal. We're also removing that image because it's about romance for him. Put some self-help books there and some rose quartz crystal. <v ->Okay.</v> <v ->Okay, can you imagine that?</v> Look at it. Okay close you eyes, think how does he feel there? Push up as hard as you can. Nice, much stronger. Okay, so these are a little changes that would support him with. <v ->Okay.</v> <v ->Wonderful, thank you so much.</v> <v ->Yeah, thank you.</v>

====================

LESSON 27 – Quantum Boost Your Wisdom: Meditation & Exercises

- Now I share with you an exercise to quantum boost your wisdom. With this meditation it will help your spiritual path and also to focus on your education. You use it the best when you feel there's not enough clarity, you don't have enough on open heart on your own spiritual path and you judge yourself too much and you can do that in the coming week or each time in the future when you feel the need to do this. I invite you to sit down and face your personal wisdom direction. Close your eyes and take a deep breath in and take a deep breath out. And connecting with your quantum point on the top of your magical heart, imagine now you are in the center of your home and you open the door to the universe, and you bring in the color yellow. The color yellow stands for wisdom and intuition, and bring that color in and fill your whole home with this wisdom so that your home is activated for wisdom, not just for you but for every family member and every friend or acquaintance that visit your home. Send this yay of yellow energy towards your personal wisdom direction in your living room, and bless that area with that yellow vibration. Then direct that yellow energy to the personal wisdom direction in your bedroom and bless it with the universal color of wisdom. And then direct it to the personal wisdom direction in your meditation or prayer room, when you have one. Now focus again on the entrance and bring in the color saffron yellow. It's a color of compassion, it's a color that helps you to go beyond your own self-judgments and the judgments you have towards your family members. Fill your whole house with this saffron yellow energy. And move the saffron yellow energy through your whole house, so that everywhere the energy of compassion is vibrating. Then allow the universe to bring in the aqua blue energy and you direct it to the personal wisdom direction in your living room, to help you to have a clear focus on your purpose and on your spiritual path. Bless that energy with aqua blue, direct that aqua blue energy to your personal wisdom direction in your bedroom, to make sure that at night you receive intuitive messages, and remember your dreams, and also direct at aqua blue energy to your whole meditation area, specifically your personal wisdom direction. And then you allow from the front door of your house to bring in the diamond frequency, having faith in the universe. And send this out through your whole house so that everyone living and visiting this house will be positively affected by the diamond frequency of faith. And then imagine a golden dome of energy to surround your home, to manifest with abundance your wisdom, and the wisdom of your family. Then take the breath in, bring your hands together, warm your hands, bring your warm hands in front of your eyes, open your eyes and let go of your hands. Your homework is to feng shui way your wisdom in your bedroom, living room and meditation space, and to share the before and after pictures with the community. Yes you made it! This is the end of this program. No, it is the beginning. It's the beginning of a practice for the rest of your life. Wherever you live, whoever you meet, you'll be able to constantly use this amazing information to add 1/3 your good luck in your law of attraction to your life, to manifest your success, money flow, your relationships, your health and your wisdom and exponentially create results. It is the beginning of a practice that you'll be able to share what your family and friends and that you will continue sharing with the community. I want to express my gratitude to Vishen and to the Mindvalley team. Mindvalley has a mission to transform millions of people, and my vision to enlighten more than 500 million people found its way together to help to create this program to transform your life.

LESSON 28 - Q&A with Marie Diamond

Let's get started. Hi, everyone. Good morning, good afternoon, good evening. I am Alex, and on behalf of the Mindvalley team, I'd like to welcome you to your Feng Shui Live Q &A coaching call with Marie Diamond. Coaching call number four, our last coaching call for this course. We have a great session prepared for you. We'll have many interesting topics that we'll cover, belonging mainly to the last two chapters of your... course, which are chapter number seven, Feng Shui, your social and professional relationship. And chapter number eight, Feng Shui, your wisdom. And I believe you'll get great, great insights from this session. That being said, and without further ado, let's welcome for the last call, our wonderful teacher on this journey, Marie Diamond. Hi, Marie. Hi. Hi, Alex. And hi, Ezra. Hi, everybody. I'm super happy to be with you again and I was actually reading a beautiful message from somebody that shared and I was really touched by her words how for so many years she did not being appreciated as a mother there were fights going on and she really worked on her personal relationship energy from the last two weeks and It was amazing how her life shifted, that now her children are grateful, they're not fighting anymore. And, you know, I know most people always think Feng Shui is first of all about money and success. I always felt Feng Shui is really about relationships, first of all, and really being inspired to live a better life. And I know, you know, most people are not first of all looking for that. But, you know, there's a four pillars that we're working on anyhow, success, money, relationship, health and wisdom. But I was very touched by this beautiful response. And I have seen some of you really having very quick results. results and some of you will feel that the chi is still you know moving forward and we'll have a few better results in a couple of weeks ahead so first of all i want to have a moment of gratitude so let us close our eyes for just a second and um and just connecting with your heart space and let's connect in with the color rose that stands in diamond feng shui for love unconditional love and let us send from our heart all this unconditional love and gratitude to first of all the mind valley team and um vision that had the idea to bring me in as your teacher to help and support you know you having an amazing life and everyone in the mind valley team really send your unconditional love and gratitude to them because they are there always for you supporting you the people that filmed that edited that created the manuals Alex and Ezra and also send this unconditional love and support to your family members that your children your partner that perhaps with some resistance once in a while or um really open to for you to explore feng shui so send out all your gratitude and love and send it also to all your spiritual guidance that you received your intuition um angels masters teachers mentors coaches that have helped you on your path and that were inspiring you perhaps to take this class And so also send it to all of you. So because the fact that you are creating a tribe of change by using Feng Shui for life. So send out all this unconditional love and gratitude for everyone that's in the tribe. Because of working together, supporting each other. Just knowing that you're doing this with more than thousands of people together, you actually create a quantum field of change by using Feng Shui for life. So everyone that is applying is supporting and inspiring the other people in the tribe. So express this loving gratitude, this rose light to the whole tribe. Wonderful. So then take a deep breath in. And come back. You are now. And open your eyes. Again, I would like to acknowledge all of the people that submitted questions. We got around 60, again, submitted questions. And we picked the frequently asked ones from those. And some of them are also slightly adjusted. So in case I think I saw some of the people that submitted questions also in the call. So you will see that your questions are slightly adjusted in some cases because we are trying to get to make it relevant to a larger audience. First question comes from Nicole. Nicole says, it is becoming apparent to me that there is the potential for some directions to qualify for more than one activation. Two questions. Is it possible to activate too many things in a particular direction? And two, are there ways to activate more than one thing in a direction with fewer items? Sometimes we put too much things, right, in a certain direction to activate. I remember once somebody wanted to really activate her mother energy and she had like 20 images of Divine Mother Mary, right? She's a Catholic woman. Now her husband, that was her wisdom direction. and there was a southwest and her husband was his relationship direction was southwest so she put a lot of pictures and i told her just too much you know i always say to people you know you can activate five or six things in a certain area um you can do a little bit more if you wish but you can always muscle test to check you know what is enough for you to um to do and i remember she put like tons of things in her in the southwest and i said it's just too much right and she did hang this beautiful old wedding picture above a table with like really i think about 20 images or statues of divine mother mary and we were upstairs doing some other things and suddenly we heard this big crack and we went down and wedding picture had fallen down on the table and I had told her, you know, two images to five is enough. And about 15 images and 15 statues fell down and broke. So the university immediately told her. It was too much, right? So I would suggest to test it out to see if this is enough activation. So put a few things and muscle tests. Is this strong enough for what I want to activate? So that's one thing you can do. Or do I need more? You can always activate, check again with the muscle testing. Most of the time it's also knowing that look at the numbers so for example in the north the north stands for number one so just one thing is strong enough the southwest is number two so two strong things is is good enough the three is the east southeast is four the center is five six for northwest seven for west eight for northeast and the south is nine So you can also follow these numbers and you will always be good with that. But otherwise I would say, you know, five things is maximum to really activate there. And sometimes... thing that you place there can be working for both let's say let's say you put an image of a buddha for example in your wizard direction and it's also the health direction of somebody else in the family And you can say, well, you know, Buddha is a representative of a long life or a serene life, a harmonic life. I mean, if you feel that works for both, that you can do that. And then make sure you put the intention and say, this statue is for this person, this, and this statue is for this person, this intention. So you can definitely do that, but make sure the other person agrees with that intention. So just don't do it for somebody else if they are not really agreeing with, you know, some people say, well, Buddha, I'm not sure if that's a representative of my health, right? So ask and have conversations because out of the conversations, new energy can come forward. Are all straight edges considered bad Feng Shui? What about windowsills and table edges? Well, no, not all edges are considered really bad. It's all about where the edge focuses on. So let's say you have a window edge that's very sharp. So the more it is less than 90 degrees. So if it's 90 degrees, it's like this, right? It's kind of a normal thing, right? So you will have that everywhere. But if an angle becomes less than 90 degrees, then it becomes sharper and sharper. So in case that there is a statue or an image or something in your home that is like a 90 degrees and it's just opposite of where you are literally, and then you have that sharp edge of 90 degrees in your back or in front of you when you're working, when you're sleeping, that can definitely affect you and start creating this harmony. The more it is sharper, the edge, the worse actually the energy is. I would say you cannot work on all the sharp edges. Some people get a little frantic when we talk about the sharp edges, like, oh my God, I have so much sharp edges. But I would say where you sleep, where you work, that's the most important thing to cover them. And you can even ask your body, am I influenced by this sharp edge? So look at that sharp edge. It's pointing at you and just check, is this really necessary even to cover? Don't go and be frantic about this. Just, you know, check it out. What about those of us that are living on a houseboat? Technically, we are always going to be sleeping on the water. Any advice in general for this situation? And the same question applies for what if we are going on vacation and we are traveling the whole time in a camper? vehicles it's it's not a super good thing um so make sure that when you have a chance to spend at least a few hours a day on land um think about the sailors you know the sailors they would go um for you know six weeks two months sometimes on a boat you know um and then they come on land and we always say when they come on land get a little bit crazy right because when you're on water you actually go into that little bit of the trance state of calmness. It's very yin. So when you come on land, it becomes more yang. So make sure you have, don't stay the whole time, if possible, in the boat or on water. In the evening before the sunset, come on land, if possible. If that is not, then make sure you put some crystals really around you. Definitely in the corners of the boat. Put some good crystals. Make sure you have some warmer earth red colors in your space around you. So I'm not looking for the red from fire, but earth red. Yeah, so that it's like a warmer red. And also browns on the ground. So that's like there's an earthy energy under you. So that visually, right you're not thinking about water but you're seeing ground and soil under you so even if that's a carpet or when you um the colors that you see when you wake up some carpets next to your bed so that the first thing your subconscious mind is seeing is earth energy or even putting some um next to your bed on your nightstand a crystal right so that your subconscious mind doesn't connect in with water And I mean, there are other things you can do, but that's not part of our course today. Great. I see a follow -up question to something that you mentioned earlier here from Paula that says, how can we be sure of the validity of muscle testing? Could we be influencing it somehow? When you're doing this personally, Right. And you haven't done your meditation. Your personality sometimes can kind of, you know, push things too hard. So that's why I always say do a meditation. So you're just in observant mode and you're clear in your energy. And when you do the muscle testing with somebody else and you ask the question to that body. of the other person i have rarely seen that this is influenced um because you know the body always reacts a certain way i've i've seen people trying to manipulate and still they can't do it because you know the subconscious mind really knows this is good this is not good for you so i would say perhaps two three percent i've seen people that they were not able they were able to manipulate but I would say in that case you're probably manipulating other things in your life too. Many of us here are actually teachers. I was wondering how a person with Feng Shui, a classroom of students, to give the teacher the most benefit of connecting and educating those students. Also to provide the students with the most benefit of relating to the teacher and to the education they are receiving for overall success? I love that question. And we do have some schools and classrooms that are using my information. So the first thing is always make sure the teacher sits in such a position that the teacher sees the incoming door. So in this case, the students would be less strong than the teacher, but you know, the teacher has to have the power because they are the ones putting all the energy in teaching the students. So that's the first thing. One of the things we sometimes suggest to people is making sure if their teacher would be in front that the other students would be kind of in half circles. so that if the door would be just opposite the teacher that they still have a feeling of they still can see the incoming flow. Definitely make sure you take a picture of the class and put it in a personal relationship direction of the teacher so the teacher is connected personally with the students. Put also perhaps the goals for this year, the vision you have for that school year in the personal success direction of the teacher. And then what you can do, because you cannot activate everybody's personal energy number, it's kind of difficult. But then you look at the general space feng shui and you make sure there's something to activate all directions. So from north to... so the whole compass so that there's a little fountain in the north there's in the northeast for example little crystal there's a plant in the east another plant a smaller plant in the southeast in the south is the candle or some flowers southwest again you can put some crystals out west and northwest you can put some metal out i had even people uh doing a wonderful thing is you know we also can talk about the numbers so north is one south east is two and so forth that they put actually that number out into the right color for that area so a blue number one a yellow number two a golden six so they put it in the areas or they actually looked at what does this area stand for, the helpers, the advisors would be in the northwest, things about music, they would put their music instruments in the east, entertainment images of dance, they would put it in the south. So everything with technology, they would put in the west. So they actually redesigned their space more on a general feng shui. and then the personal energy number for the teacher. So that's kind of what they did and they had amazing results and improvement of the focus, concentration, also results for the students. Fantastic. On the similar topic, can we do something similar as parents in order for the kids to enjoy school in general, teachers and their education process? from home out um i would definitely um try to suggest that the parents always make sure the child looks to the door you know so because most of the time children they put their desk against the wall so make sure you change that around so they see the door activate the personal wisdom direction of that child in their bedroom now if the child doesn't study in the in the bedroom but it's like in the dining room or the family room activate the wisdom direction from that child there definitely always put an image of the school logo for example in the wisdom direction it can be even the the calendar the agenda images of the all the school teachers, school students, sometimes they have that from the year before. You can put it out in their wisdom direction. So I would definitely suggest to bring that more into their space. That's what I've always done with my children. So that they would always love to go to school. And also as parents, you know, in the morning, take some time. And this is perhaps not a typical feng shui, but I've always made sure that when you bring the kids to school or when you start the morning, don't create too much stress for the children. Put them some nice music. I always put up their favorite music. bring them and make sure it's their favorite music. We're singing along in the car. You should see me driving my kids to school all these years. I'm always at one dancing and singing in the morning in the car. And so they're all upbeat and happy. And we do a little meditation, a little focus before they go in. I mean, it's a little bit of an inner feng shui, but always make sure you don't talk too much about stressful things you're going to do the rest of the day, right? So make sure that they feel like they have a good focus in the morning. How do I attract friends into my life? I have a good relationship with people at work, but we do not socialize out of work. Do I put old pictures of old friends up to attract new ones? What do you recommend? Would not put up pictures of old friends if these friends are not longer in your life anymore. I would like rather look for images that show friendship or in your personal relationship direction. And right now, you know, you're focused on your professional life and perhaps you need to see what are the passions that you would like to explore more. right so um perhaps it is singing perhaps it is studying a subject and to i have a feeling when i tune into you you do not take enough space for outside friends to like to go and learn something new so I would suggest to look into your wisdom direction and see, you know, to clear the energy over there, declutter it, and put some books up from things you really would like to know more about. And then start taking some action and see if there's something in your town, in your community that, you know, that you can... you can study about. Because I have a feeling when I tune into him or her that the energy is just too focused home and professional life. So we need a third part of our life that's our social life. So I think you need to do a little bit more action steps there. The bathroom is in the wisdom direction of my house. What can we put to counteract the water draining effect of the bathroom? A bathroom is a bathroom. You cannot really do too much about it. But what you can do is on the door before you walk in into your bathroom or next to the bathroom on the wall is to put an image connected with wisdom for you so that it's like it's not a bathroom. It's like. a representative of wisdom for you. So inside the bathroom, you cannot really do anything else than cleaning it out, making sure you can put some of the colors that are connected with your wisdom direction, like in towels or in little carpets or even soap. So you can work with the colors there, but for the rest, I would not activate that wisdom direction in the bathroom and then focus on putting the wisdom direction activators in your bedroom. and in your space where you meditate or pray? There are windows in the wisdom and personal relationship area in my living room, so it's hard to activate them. I would love your thoughts on this. It's one of the problems that some people have, right? And I have that happen too, so that you look at the compass and think, oh no, I cannot activate it there, right? So if you have a window there, if possible, put there a little table. put some items on top of it. Never put things on the ground because when you put it on the ground, your energy doesn't have to put it. And you also look down on these things that you place, so that's not a good vibe. 30 centimeters up or like a foot up from the ground. You can put some activators. Sometimes you can hang something on the window like a crystal or a stained glass that presents perhaps a topic you're focusing on. And if you cannot work on the windows, then you will actually look at other beds, like other rooms, your bedroom, your office. You know, I had even a home once that I barely could activate my help. direction right and the only place i could actually activate it was in the dining room right but still then i do it there right um so the other areas where i just could not activate my health direction so i would say still then it's better than not doing anything or having the wrong things and now we'll try to answer a general question so i see it also here in the chat at least six or seven times I saw it. There seems to be a recurrent pattern in the questions, which is something like this. My personal relationship, wisdom, health, et cetera, direction is hard to activate because it faces different things like stairs, corners, windows, sink, bathroom, door, wall. So what would be a general advice or a rule that we can follow? or how we can think about these things let's first of all if there is something in your direction that you want to activate that is not really supporting that like a staircase or a fridge or you know you cannot change that i mean these are things you cannot just move around okay so If it's your health relationship or wisdom direction that you cannot activate, you can always place these activators in your success direction. The success direction is about success and money, but also works with the other areas. So in your success direction, if you have no other possibility to activate health, put your health activation in your success direction. Success will over lighten all of them. anyhow so that's one possibility now if your success direction is in an area that you're saying well it's really i cannot do anything about it then place it in your relationship direction so if success is for example um the door and there's just no way to activate it then take that success energy or activator and place it in your relationship direction but then say i'm activating success in my relationship direction If health, you can always put health activators in your wisdom direction, but again, you have to put the intention there. It's not that strong, but it's better, right? So if there is something wrong or something you cannot activate in a certain area, there's always something you can activate in another room, right? Sometimes people say, well, I cannot activate in the bedroom, neither in the living room, but I still have a dining room. Normally I would not activate it there, but then I would do that, especially because it's better to have one room activated than nothing at all. And again, you know, sometimes even then it's difficult. And when you see there's a lot of difficulties to activate things, then it is possible this home or this apartment is really not supporting you at all. And perhaps then it's a good idea to think about perhaps moving out or finding something else. Because if a home cannot be activated, it means you're actually losing, you know, a lot of your good luck. And if you then look honestly, then to yourself, you see like, well, this home has not been very lucky for me, right? Or for my family. But always every change you make will be better than if you haven't done anything. right so again perfect feng shui does not exist um i have lived in homes that i could do 50 right i wanted to do but still I had good results, right? Sometimes you will have less, but it's still more than you did before. And also remember, feng shui is not everything, right? It's responsible for 33 .3%, one third of your good luck, but you still have to focus on your mindset. You still have to connect in with your soul and your intuition. It supports you, but don't think it's suddenly the only thing you need to activate. You have to still be grateful. You still have to focus on your goals. You know, there's wonderful information that other teachers in my family are sharing that is as important as feng shui. So don't overestimate it and don't underestimate it at the same time. Is there a way in feng shui to improve our relationships when we are shy or timid? There is. So one of the things I would suggest is to put in your wisdom direction, put books on confidence to really focus on that in your wisdom direction. Yeah. Also like an image where, you know, where like an image of somebody that their hands are open, somebody that's joyful, that is playing, that is running, that is, you know, expressing themselves. So put that in your wisdom direction. That would be very helpful. And I would also put a light in your wisdom direction, right? A light and put that on five to eight hours a day. You can even put on an automatic timer. But a strong light is actually saying, I accept my light. So that is actually a very good extra support for you. Simple question from Surya is here. What is the best direction to place clocks? Glocks and even calendars are actually considered not so positive in Feng Shui because it's like time is passing, right? So we don't want to focus too much on it. So definitely not in your personal good directions. The best place for them is like in your kitchen, not where you really sleep, where you work. And if you want to put it in your office, make sure it's in your... that is not connected with your four directions. So if you're a west person, the best place for you is to put it in the north or the east. If you are an east person, so remember west people are, people have number two, five, six, seven, and eight. So north or east, they can put a clock or a calendar. For the East people have energy number one, three, four and nine. The best place for them is Northwest. Can my meditation space be in my study or office space? You definitely can place that there. Make sure then you put your wisdom area and you face that direction when you're meditating, when you're visualizing. So you can definitely put it there. That's not a problem. I would rather not have it in your bedroom because, you know, that's... It's better to have it in an active place. Some people think meditation, praying is not an active state, but I really believe it's a very important state. So it's actually good to put it there. What kind of Feng Shui principles we can use when we are consultants, which is a job based almost 100 % on relationships? When you are consulting, perhaps in person, make sure whenever you go into a company that you go earlier in and you are positioning yourself or checking out if you're facing a good direction and you're seeing the door when you give the consultation. I sometimes go into a company and train them. And I will always check where they put like the refreshments, right? The water or the tea and the coffee. And if I see they place it in one of my best directions, especially my success or relationship direction, I actually demand that they put it somewhere else. because it will actually affect my consulting because I'm there a whole day. It will affect how I'm thinking, how I'm bringing results to the company. And I always put that actually in my information that I... I have the freedom to change the room around. So sometimes I put the chairs or the tables a certain way. I come in earlier or I ask them to fax me or, you know, not fax anymore, how we call that, you know, send out a floor plan in an email attachment so that I can see the layout and I will address the layout before I start. So it's one of the things I really do. Now, if it's online, You know, of course, you're in your own space. You can focus on that and work on that. One of the things I definitely also do if I work online. is if i'm working with a company or a major client i will put a little index card with the name of that client or the logo of that company i will print it out put it in my relationship direction definitely during the fact during the time that i'm doing the work online so that it's not just in my mind to connection in my heart i'm also connecting in my environment with that client so um and then depending where you want to attract clients from because some of you are like I would love to attract global clients well you work with the globe you know you look at the globe or a map and you put that in your relationship direction If it's more local community or your country, you can put a flag, you can put a symbol of that area in your personal relationship direction of your office. So you can play with a lot of these things. And I know I have a lot of consultants that are just practicing this. They're also, most of them, I've really advised them. to do the tubes of light meditation before they start so that they are really in a strong energy field so that whatever criticism, whatever negative vibration there is in the room or with the people you're consulting, you don't take it on. Because you touched on this already. Is it best to sit in the direction that you are wanting to activate or can you sit in a different direction but face the direction that you want to activate? So the most important thing is that you are trying to face one of your four good directions. Yeah. First rule is you see the door and then you try to face. That means you're sitting towards like right now I'm facing Southwest in my hotel room. Right. Southwest is my success direction. Right. So I'm facing it and I see the door at the same time. So. That's important. Always when you're awake, you're facing. That means your eyes need to look towards it. When you're asleep, it's your crown chakra that needs to be pointed towards a good direction for you. The third rule is that you always activate your four good directions. So there's only one position for east people, that means number one, three, four, and nine, that they can sit in a good area and face a good area. That means if they're facing north, south. So they're sitting in the north, they're facing south, or they sit south, they face north. That would be that boat. both times they're sitting and they're facing direction is good. So we call that a cardinal energy. So if that is possible, that's even better, but it's only one possibility, right? Now for the West people, numbers two, five, six, seven, and eight, there's only one other position that is similar, and that is sitting Southwest facing Northeast. or sitting northeast facing southwest. That's also a cardinal position. But that's not always possible. But in case that is possible, and you see the door on top of it, it's a very lucky position. What can we do when our best areas fall into a glass window, a glass door, or your wardrobe? Sometimes you just, if it's like on a wardrobe, I just, you know, print out images and I put it on the wardrobe. right? Or the wardrobe can be the right color. Some people hang images on a window, right? Or on the window door. So, you know, you try as much as you can to activate it. Now, feng shui doesn't always mean it's aesthetically very beautiful. right but um sometimes you have to make a choice between good luck right and beauty so um some people will bring that together sometimes it's more difficult so again do as much as you can now if for example there's a glass door in your success direction or a good direction that what you see through that door will affect you or what you see through the window will affect you let's say I was this week in a hotel room and in my relationship direction, when I looked out, it was kind of a parking garage, you know, a parking, open parking energy. And it was like a dumpster and it was like, it was not nice. So in that case, I make sure the curtains are closed, right? So, or in that case you would put like, you can put even a... a veil over the the glass like so that the light still comes in but you don't see the negative energy that is there because whatever you see through the window through the door will impact you right so you can um you know put something in such a way that you don't see everything right like a see -through um Like the light comes through like a shimmering curtain, for example. So you can do that, right? Or you hang something on the window. Again, from the door, it is possible what you see through the door is not something you really like. Then you can cover the door. You can cover it with rice paper, for example. You can paint a door or you replace the door with, you know, a wooden door. yeah so again there's different possibilities but it does affect you what you see through so i'll give you an example um i remember a very uh very a dollar from a very famous artist um her father mother are two actors actors actors very very uh successful and she was just not having any success so her success direction she was staying in a home and her success direction was the ocean the pacific ocean right so and her success direction was the south and the south stands for fire so the only thing she had was the water coming in coming in so totally you know making sure that her success was not strong so what we actually did we did hang a lot of hanging plants on the um the curtain rail right so that the first thing she saw were the plants yeah and um she started really having uh more you know movie directors for her for also her next film. And she really felt a big shift because of the water not coming first anymore towards her. So you just have to find a creative way. And for every home, it can be different. What would be the best activations for selling or buying a home? There are several things. So it's a cure. It's kind of a crazy cure, but it doesn't work, is to have the light on at night when it's getting dark till like 12 o 'clock. You can do it automatically in the back of your home. It is said when the light is on behind your home, you're kind of pushing the people out to sell, to have a sale. The second thing is the entrance. Make sure it's very welcoming when you have people coming to your home. Make sure the bedroom is very inviting. People choose three things, apparently. The entrance, when they come in, the first feeling they have. The second thing is the living room. And the third one is the bedroom. So when you show people the home for the sales, make sure it's not too personal. Take away the personal pictures of you and your family so they can see themselves as living there. Because otherwise it's like, oh, this home belongs to these people. Subconsciously, we don't want to take a home away from a family. right so take away the personal images um make sure there's you know everything is uh beautiful and clean it's organized um another thing i suggest to people is take a picture of the home you want to sell put up the word sold over it like what they do like in the real estate companies with the the number you want to sell it for and put it in your personal success direction. Marie, we haven't spoken about the influence of our neighbors. So for example, if they have bad statues just at the edge of our entrance space, how can we deal with that? I had this happen before myself, so I actually went to explain it to the neighbors. I said, you know, I've studied this information and this is actually not helping for us to have a peaceful relationship. This image is not positive for both of us. Can I support you and tell you where would be best? That helped. So that was one thing. Sometimes you just ask and explain what is going on. Another time I did not have the good luck. They were not happy with my information. So then I was always looking for putting a plant or a bush or even... some wooden bamboo in front of it, so I would not see it. So depending on your possibilities, I would try to make sure I don't see it by planting something or placing something there that does not affect me. We know that the amount of information is still vast. We still need to learn a lot more. We are just at the beginning. But how can we continue practicing and stay motivated to learn and do more now that the course is going to end? I'm sure you will receive an email very soon from... Mindvalley, like from some possible next steps you can do with me because some of you would love to continue. And so that is definitely a possibility. Keep sharing in the Facebook group what you're doing. You know, it's not because the course is finalized that not new people are starting and you can still connect with each other through the Facebook group. So I'm very much looking forward to continue the conversation. look at the questions that are answered that are asked. So we'll keep up with that. And so you will have definitely some possibilities. Now, I just also want to share with you that when energy changes, right? So in order to move things forward up, sometimes it feels like the energy gets stuck and there's like first like a downward spiral. Now the downward spiral is the results still from what you have done in the times before you did a feng shui. Literally, you cannot have an activation and within 24 hours, something bad happens. It's not how feng shui works, right? So what you have, if something still happens within nine days after you do the activations, it is a result from what was before, right? feng shui cannot create bad results unless there was bad feng shui so if something didn't happen really well then it is because of the results of what was there before so just be patient know the energy is shifting sometimes the downward spiral was really strong and you're kind of it needs to neutralize and then starts going again towards the right direction so if it was a negative spin in your life And it needs to neutralize and start spinning up back in the positive sense. Within a few days, within a week, things will start happening. And I remember once I had myself happening that I thought that, oh, I did all these right things. And then, you know, I lost a very big client, but I could see it was a result of what I did before. And then literally a week later, that client called me back and said, I made a mistake. I'm going to hire you even more. So it was like. The negative spin was from the past, the decision, and then when I just kept going and kept practicing, the energy went up in the right direction. How to improve and get better and lasting results? Is there anything that we can study, read, learn next that can build upon or add more value to the things that we already learned? We're going to give you some next steps. One of the things we're going to focus on is the time feng shui. So you will get a next step coming in how to work with the time feng shui for the year. So, and how to really apply the time feng shui more deeper. So that will be a next step that will be provided as an opportunity for you to study with me. And some of you will be very interested to really continue this conversation and this studying with certifying so we'll definitely make sure you have some next steps available for that too. So now that the course is ended we would love to hear some words of wisdom or closing words or any last guidance. First of all I want to express my gratitude again and I'm really so happy to see all the steps you have taken to change your life. So make sure you continue the journey and help others with this very basic steps, but very life -changing steps in feng shui for life. So help your family, help your friends, so that we are all together creating a much better world for all of us. So thank you very much. Wonderful. Thank you also very much, Marie. Thank you for spending the time with us, for sharing your wisdom with us, for replying, for connecting, for all of the hard work you put into creating the course and bringing all of this information to us. So thank you very much for that. Thank you very much for all of your questions, for your comments, for your engagement, for your participation, for showing up and for playing full out.
