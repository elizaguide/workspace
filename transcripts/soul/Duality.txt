Preparation – Welcome to Duality Quest

<v ->When I had my first experiences with energy awareness and
intuition, I wasn’t even sure these things were real, or if I believed
in energy at all. At the time, I was finishing degrees in Computer
Science and Mathematics, and I’d already landed a job with the U.S.
Department of Energy, which is a whole different kind of energy. And I
was sure the path to success was hard work and a sharp mind. I wasn’t
really looking for anything else, but out of the blue, I started having
unusual experiences that I couldn’t explain. I was seeing light around
people, and speaking telepathically, and having these spontaneous energy
healing experiences. And honestly, I didn’t know what to think, but the
scientist in me couldn’t just ignore my experiences. So I did what any
good scientist would do. I started learning and experimenting more, but
mostly I kept these experiences to myself, so people wouldn’t think I
was a little crazy, or kind of going off the deep end. And over the next
15 years, my life really followed these two parallel paths. By day, I
was a software engineer, working up through the ranks, making money, and
succeeding at the American dream. And by night, I was studying
everything I could find about intuition and energy healing. I completed
clairvoyant training, and graduate studies, and energy work, and healing
apprenticeships, and trance mediumship training, and clairvoyant
teachers training, and so on. And I even served on the Board of
Directors for Psychic Horizons Center, which was the local clairvoyant
training school that I went to. And I lived in these two very different
worlds, but I didn’t really see it that way. For me, all of life was my
energy playground. I worked on energy in meetings at work, and in my
relationships, and for my health. And even when I was driving my car, or
eating, or exercising, I was totally fascinated by what we can do with
energy. And the fact that no one seemed to know about it, that part
really surprised me. And eventually I was teaching a little on the
weekends, and doing some healings after work, but this was all really
just a hobby until I started to see how much I was helping people. And
suddenly my computer job, even with all its money and success, seemed
kind of silly and even a little selfish. I was making more impact in the
world in a few hours with my hobby than an entire month in my real job.
And suddenly I saw this bigger potential for my life, and energetically,
I leaned into it. And by 2005, my life had completely changed. Energy
work was my career, and engineering was my hobby. And I used all the
energy tools that I’d learned to discover a whole new life for myself. I
became a full-time energy healer, intuitive, and teacher. And I used my
engineering mind to organize everything I learned into a system for
teaching intuition, and healing to others. It was great. And for the
next 10 years, teaching became my classroom where I learned what worked,
and what didn’t work to help others heal themselves, and access their
intuition. I tied energy healing and intuition around the world, and
founded my own teaching center in Japan. But again, I started to feel
like I was playing kind of small. I knew I could help so many more
people with the programs that I was developing. Again, I saw this bigger
potential for my life, and I leaned into it energetically. That’s when I
met Vishen and Mindvalley at A-Fest in Thailand. And Vishen was talking
about his vision for changing education, and upleveling human
consciousness. And I knew I wanted to help. Before long, I was working
on the Duality training with Mindvalley, using all the energy tools and
teaching techniques that I’d learned over the years, and adding one more
important piece that was missing. The why. Why would people want to
learn intuition and energy healing? How could each tool help them in
their daily life? What problems could they solve? How could they improve
their lives? How would this impact their relationships, and their
families in the world? It may sound silly, but until Vishen asked me
these things, I never thought about them. I was usually preaching to the
choir to people who were already interested in energy work, but Vishen
wanted to reach everyone, including people who didn’t know anything
about energy yet. And I thought, wow, now that’s bigger potential. And
this focus on energy and tangible practical benefits in everyday life is
what makes Duality different from other energy training, and spiritual
training that I’ve seen. Duality really is graduate level energy
training that anyone can digest. And it ties directly into your daily
life. People are drawn to energy work and spirituality for many reasons.
For some, it’s personal. Maybe you’re at a crossroads, and you’re tired
of life as usual, or you feel kind of stuck or hopeless, or just plain
bored with your life. You want to try something different, break out of
your box, and create a new life for yourself. But you don’t want to join
a cult, or change your religion. If this is you, Duality will help. You
can explore energy healing firsthand, and see tangible results for
yourself. And then you can decide what’s real for you. For many people,
energy healing is about relating to others. You want to communicate
better, improve your relationships, or have better boundaries, so you
can feel more comfortable around other people. Or maybe you’re tired of
getting in arguments, and you want to polish some of your rough edges,
so you can really enjoy your time with others. When you understand the
energy of how we relate to each other, all these things are possible,
because relationships are all about energy exchange. Or maybe a higher
calling is drawing you to energy healing. You may want to help people,
and make a big difference in the world, or if you’re already helping
people, you may want to refine your talents, and learn new tools to
engage even more powerfully. And we’ll do that in Duality. In fact,
these three motivations, self, others, and the world are how the Duality
training is organized, because it’s how our energy awareness naturally
progresses. In chapters one, two, and three, you’ll explore how energy
affects you personally. You’ll learn energy tools for grounding and
personal presence, mental clarity and focus, and healing, and energizing
your body. These are the tools which accelerate your growth, and help
you get through life’s difficult transitions. As you see results from
healing yourself, the next natural step is to work on how you relate
with others energetically. And that’s chapters four and five. You’ll
learn how to adjust your aura, create healthy boundaries energetically,
so that you’re not an energy sponge, and you’re not like a prickly pear.
You’re just comfortable and approachable energetically. You’ll learn how
the chakras talk with people, which is even stronger than body language.
And how chakra healing can help you manifest your dreams. And then once
you’re feeling good about you, and you’re feeling good about your
relationships, it’s time to peek behind the curtain, and see how you fit
into the world. In chapter six, you learn where your beliefs are stored
energetically, and how to see the world through a completely different
lens. And this is critical, because you’re getting ready to live your
life in a whole new way. You must open your mind to do this. In chapter
seven, you learn to refine your intuition. So you can lead a life of
synchronicity and abundance, where you’re creating and flowing, instead
of feeling stuck or struggling. And finally, in chapter eight, we pull
the curtain back all the way. And we look at who you truly are as a
spirit, as you learn to access your higher self, and your higher
guidance. Now this may sound like a tall order right now, but I will
guide you every step of the way. And by the time you’ve been through the
first seven chapters, it’ll be a lot easier than you think. You can do
this. I’ve taught intuition and energy healing to thousands of people
all around the world. And from what I’ve seen, everyone is intuitive.
Everyone is a healer. Everyone is amazing. And that includes you. To
access your natural healing abilities, all you need is a willingness to
try it out, a little time each day to learn step by step, the sense of
humor for when things don’t go as you expect, and a commitment to see it
through, a commitment to find out what you can really do. And there will
be times when resistance comes up in you. That’s normal, because you’re
growing, but just keep going. I can’t tell you how many times students
have told me, I was just about to drop out, and the very next lesson
said exactly what I needed to hear. You got this. You can tap into the
intuition and energy healing abilities, which are already within you.
You just need to lean in to your potential, and I’ll show you how.

Part 1: Energy Awareness & Personal Presence

====================

LESSON 1: The Power of Energy Awareness & Healing

<v ->Welcome everyone. I’m Jeffrey Allen and I’m going to be your guide
into the exciting world of energy awareness and energy healing. Even if
you’re not sure why you’re here, I can assure you, you are in the right
place. There is a purpose for us meeting here today. Maybe you’re new to
energy work and you’re looking for something fun and fascinating in your
life, or maybe you’re feeling stuck in life and you need a powerful
change. You might even be a seasoned practitioner and you’re wanting to
hone your existing skills, or you might be a skeptic and you don’t
believe in energy at all, and don’t even know why you’re here. All these
things are great. I’ve been in all these positions myself, and you’re
definitely welcome here. In my experience, energy training is so
powerful. It can literally change the way you think, how you relate to
other people, how you see yourself and how you live your life. If you
let it, energy work can transform every aspect of your life. And I can
say this with conviction because energy training has not only changed my
life, but I’ve seen it change 1000s and 1000s of other people’s lives as
well. And since you’re here, I know it will change your life too. To get
us started, I want to set the energy for the group and help you connect
with the group energy. So even though the program is recorded, it still
feels live to me. When we’re experienced with energy work, our
perception is not bound by time and space. So if we’re not in the same
room or not in the same day, it’s no problem, I can still feel you and I
can help you. Energetically, you’re here with me right now. But you
really have to experience this to understand it. So let me give you a
taste right now. Take a deep breath and close your eyes. Feel your own
presence in your body. And imagine how you would greet a dear friend
with a warm smile and a friendly hello. And without any effort, reach
out to everyone in the program right now. Send a hello and a smile. And
receive all those hellos and smiles too. And I’m doing the same for all
of you. Welcome. Thank you for being here, you are in the right place.
Now with no effort, send a hello and smile to all the past students of
Duality. And just feel yourself receiving a hello back. And send a hello
out to all future students as well. And again, feel yourself receiving a
hello back. Just feel yourself connecting with everyone in the Duality
family. Hmm, yeah, that looks really good. Now imagine a big bubble of
energy around all of us and let’s add our intentions. So my intention is
may all that happens during this training be in alignment with each of
our highest good, and the highest good of all. And I given 10, that’d be
a clear channel for all energy and information which comes through. So
go ahead and add your intention too. What do you want to learn, or heal,
or change? Let’s put that intention into the group energy. Put in a
little fun and amusement too. Give yourself a deep breath, and open your
eyes. Wow. I could really feel the energy of the group. I hope you could
too. And I could hope you could feel everyone’s sending those hellos and
smiles to you, it’s really powerful. Because you are not alone. This
group energy is always available. It’ll help carry you forward when you
feel stuck, and it’ll help you celebrate your breakthroughs. You can
grow more quickly and gracefully as you share everyone’s aha moments and
growth. So Duality is not just a journey of information and learning,
it’s a journey of experiencing and connecting and awakening, and you’ve
already begun. Duality training is all about energy awareness and self
healing, which really begs the question, what is energy? So what comes
to mind for you? When I say energy, I’m talking about the motivating
force, which drives everything. And we experienced this in two distinct
parts, which we call Duality in this training. The first is the physical
world, what we see, hear, smell, touch, and taste and change. And the
second is the energy world, which is not as obvious to sense or to
change. It takes a little practice, and it’s really subtle, but you can
see, hear and feel energy and it does get easier. And it changing energy
is actually easier than changing the physical. Now we also know that
everything is energy, even the physical world. So how do we sense energy
and work with it directly? Well, the first clue is that everything
starts as energy, as an idea, or an inspiration or a thought, and you
can’t see these things, but they’re real. Now your consciousness is
energy too, and you use it to interact directly with energy. When you
can focus your attention, you can make enormous impact. And your job in
his life is really to transfer this non-physical energy, thoughts,
ideas, and consciousness into the physical world. We’re really on the
cusp of the energy and physical worlds. The second big question you may
have is why is healing important? You might think, oh, my life is not so
bad or it’s not a big deal, or I can handle it, but we’re all holding
some pain. That, to me, it looks like a dark energy patches or
non-coherent energy. And this pain leads to negative thinking and
judgments and anger and sadness and fear and shame. And we all have some
confusion too, about how the world works. We all believe things that
aren’t true, and this causes friction and difficulty in our lives. And
we can’t help, but express our pain and confusion, it’s like energy
vibrations moving out into the world. We might blow up at a loved one or
miss out on an opportunity because we’re feeling confused or powerless.
And we cannot help expressing our pain and confusion. We’re always
spreading it to other people, even if we don’t want to. So this
expression creates a negative feedback loop. So I’m feeling grumpy and
it resonates to others and out to the world, and then back to me, and
it’s really a bigger problem than you think. That’s why we see pain and
confusion in the world. Judgment, fighting, war, hoarding, scarcity, and
so on. Unfortunately, there is an easy solution, first, we must raise
our awareness, we must see our pain and confusion even if it’s normally
invisible, or they’re hidden or blocked, if we don’t want to feel it,
there is a lot more happening inside us than we realize. And we might
actually feel a little worse at first as we bring up our hidden stuff,
but it’s an important step toward healing. The second step is healing.
Healing, our pain and confusion. And without your inner pain, you’ll
feel better than you thought possible. Without your inner confusion,
life begins to become very clear and not conflicted. Now the third step
is coherency. So energetically when people have a lot of pain and
confusion, the energy looks like many little arrows kind of pointed in
many different directions. And this is called a non-coherent state. As
you heal, those vectors all start to line up and you become more
coherent. Ideally, if you’re practicing energy work regularly, all those
energies are moving in the same direction for you. And when you have
this coherency, that’s when synchronicities happen and things get very
easy, and we say, you’re in the flow. And the way to accomplish this is
to clear your pain and confusion. When that’s stripped away, what’s
left, your natural state is a state of coherency. So if you get rid of
everything that’s not natural, and you return to this powerful lined up
coherent state. Maybe you’ve seen people who are always lucky, where
everything goes their way, or maybe you know somebody who’s always
abundant where life or money flows very easily for them. They have
coherency in that area of their life, and that’s what we’re aiming for
here for you. There are many personal benefits to energy healing. The
most obvious is that you feel better, you get more positive emotions,
more confidence and amusement and compassion, and deep knowing, and you
have better relationships and better health. You can be your best self,
not that injured or confused you. And as your awareness and sensitivity
increases, you can start to feel energy because there’s less other stuff
and less garbage in the way. as you’re starting to see more
synchronicity in your life, that’s the symptom of coherency. So life
moves more smoothly and easily most of the time, and energetically life
is very organized behind the scenes. This leads to a better career,
better money and better opportunities. And you also feel confident and
empowered. You know what to do when life is difficult. So you can notice
your pain and confusion and heal that pain, correct the confusion and
get back into this coherency and awareness. Does that sound good? So
imagine one thing right now that you would like to heal for yourself.
Good. So keep that one in mind throughout the training. Now, energy
healing has a wonderful group benefit too, your coherency will naturally
spread to those around you. So your friends and families start releasing
from their pain and confusion too. They’re happier and healthier and
more flowing and abundant in their lives. And I see this all the time. I
had a student who is feeling really distant from her husband for a long
time. And she started the Duality training, started playing with energy
work and he didn’t even believe in energy and thought she was being kind
of silly taking this class. And then one day he told her, I don’t know
what’s happening, but I am so attracted to you recently. I can’t keep my
eyes off you, you’re glowing, and I feel great too. And that’s coherency
is spreading. So attraction was their natural state. So when she began
clearing her pain and confusion, he could see it again, it’s really
beautiful. Another example is a client of mine who is at odds with her
dad for a long time. He was really set in his ways and stubborn and
skeptical. And she told me one day, I don’t know what happened, my dad
is getting into energy work now, I can’t believe it. And he was starting
to turn to her for advice on this new shared interest. It was such a
powerful change. And as you heal yourself, people around you heal
themselves too. It’s really, really amazing. Another powerful group
benefit is that as you become more coherent and the people around you
become more coherent, your situations become more coherent too. So maybe
you don’t like your relationship or your work situation, and you’re
wanting a change. I did that, I was an engineer and I changed to being a
healer, but consider that if you get more coherent in that same job,
that same relationship, same situation, the difficulties will often
clear up. Maybe you don’t need to wait for new job or don’t need to find
a new relationship. Maybe you’re already in the right place. Maybe
you’re there to heal that group or person or company or profession. You
might realize that you don’t actually need the change jobs at all, which
is pretty cool. So now think for a moment right now, what would you like
to see healed in your group of people? Good. So energy healing has a
huge world benefit as well, as awareness and coherency spreads, big
things happen. People make better choices and their pain and confusion
lessens. When our energy is coherent, it doesn’t make sense to hurt each
other or to hurt the environment. These actions don’t occur to us when
we’re in a coherent state. So as we become more coherent, the world
becomes more coherent as well. More peaceful and kind with more
synchronicity in the world. And this is happening on a big scale
already. Coherency is already building. And even though some old
energies and industries are breaking down and kind of crumbling right
now, in the big picture, coherency is building. And I believe this will
lead to a radical shift in the world that we can solve all the big
problems we have by simply shifting into coherency. And as I said, it’s
happening right now, and you can be on the cutting edge of it simply by
healing yourself. You can choose if you want to be part of the
resistance, this negative feedback loop or a part of the flow, this
positive feedback loop. So just think now, what would you like to see
healed in the world? Now, the beautiful thing about the positive
feedback loop is that it doesn’t matter which one motivates you, helping
yourself, helping other people, helping the world. If you focus on
yourself, others in the world will be helped too. If you focus on
helping others, the world, and you will be helped as well. Or if you’re
a big dreamer like me and you want to heal the world, that will come
back to you and other people. It doesn’t matter where you focus, you
always get all three benefits. So there are always opportunities to
interrupt the negative feedback loop. Let me give you a silly example,
so I was at Alfalfa’s Market in Boulder, Colorado, and I went through
and the teller was obviously really upset. She was in a lot of pain and
as she was checking me out, she starts telling me her story. And she’s
talking about a breakup with her boyfriend and some sickness that she
has and family problems, and she’s going really deep into her story. And
then she looks up at me and she’s kind of embarrassed because you know,
she’s talking to this stranger about all her problems, but she couldn’t
help it because she’s in that negative feedback loop, right? So she’s
spreading her pain out into the world. And I checked out and on the way
out of the store, I noticed there were these really beautiful
sunflowers, they’re just like $2 by the door. So I picked one up, I went
back through the store and I got in her line, even though it’s kind of
long. And when I got through, I handed her the flower, she was holding
it and I paid. And when I turned to walk away, she said, oh, you forgot
your flower. And I said, no that flower is for you. It looks like you
needed a little something to brighten your day. And you know, of course
she just burst into tears and I never saw her again, but I imagine that
that simple act changed the story that she was telling others. So
instead of talking about her pain, she could talk about a stranger that
did the kind thing to her. So we just changed her from her negative
feedback loop and got her into a positive feedback loop and instead.
Now, this may seem really small, but little things like this make a big
difference. So maybe you’ll find one way today that you can help shift
things into a positive feedback loop. I believe that this positive
feedback loop is what Gandhi was talking about when he said, “You must
be the change you wish to see in the world.” This is such a powerful
statement and holds true from an energy perspective, because of this
positive feedback loop. So if you heal yourself, your coherency spreads
to those around you and ultimately to the entire world. So think right
now, what changes do you want to see in the world? And then ask
yourself, are you ready to be that change? And I’ll leave you with that
thought today. As you go about your day, please practice your self
awareness. And that’s where the journey always begins. So notice your
positive and negative feedback loops without any judgment and notice
your pain and notice your confusion, and no judgment and notice what you
want to heal for yourself and for others and for the world. And know
that you can do it, you can heal yourself, you can heal others and you
can heal the world. And you can also notice the group energy around you
today, already growing already supporting you. Have a beautiful day.

====================

LESSON 2: Your Body & Spirit Connection for Personal Presence

<v ->Welcome back, give yourself a deep breath, and say hello to the
group energy. Send smiles and hellos to your fellow students and feel
the group energy and intention supporting you. Very good, today I want
to answer an important question, what’s the number one reason why people
can’t sense energy? I’ve heard a lot of good guesses, but the truth
might surprise you. The number one reason people can’t sense energy is
that they’re not present in their body, it’s that simple. Now this might
seem funny because we’re talking about energy awareness, but if you’re
not present in your body, it’s very hard to sense energy, and I know
this from experience. I had my first experiences with energy in 1990. I
was my last year of college, I was getting a BS in Mathematics and a BS
in Computer Science. And I had a few profound energy experiences and I
didn’t really know what to make of them, but they were really exciting.
So I started to study about energy and I was reading books, and
listening to channelers and by the mid ’90s, I was full on new age. I
was rejecting the physical world and attempting to be more spiritual. So
I had lots of restrictions on what I could eat and what I could drive or
drink, and so on and I had a lot of spiritual ideas, but honestly, I
didn’t have many energy experiences. And I do remember one exception
though, it was in 1995 and it was this stormy night and everything’s
rattling in the house and I heard this, this voice and I finally said,
okay, what, what are you trying to tell me? What are you trying to say?
And I got this really clear message said, “Go to Malkuth, there you will
find unprecedented clarity of thought and peace of mind, use it to save
the world.” And I woke up and kind of wrote it on the notepad next to
the phone, and in the morning, I was like, wow, this is real, I can’t
believe it, I got this message. And Malkuth must be this magical place
where I’m going to go get some magical awareness, all right. And I
started searching around and I was looking in libraries and on maps and
this is before the internet was around, so it was a little harder, I
couldn’t find it, even though I was really searching and I got really
disappointed. But years later, I discovered that Malkuth is actually the
bottom node on the Kabbalistic tree of life and it represents the body.
My guidance was just saying, get in your body, but I didn’t understand.
Now a few years later, in 1997, I found Psychic Horizon Center which is
this fantastic energy training school and I tried to sign up for their
astral travel class. Again, I was thinking if I got out of my body, I
was going to find some amazing information. Now, fortunately, they told
me you can’t take that, it’s a graduate class, and we recommend this
intuition and energy healing very much like what I’m teaching you right
now. And they knew that this idea of getting out of the body was not
going to work for me, so they steered me towards something that would
help me get into my body. About a year later, I remember I had my first
real experience of being in my body and I was shocked, it felt really
heavy and slow and really aware and relaxed and powerful, kind of like a
Neo in “The Matrix”. You know that scene where suddenly he’s like,
everything slows down and he’s blocking bullets, so it kind of felt like
that, my world was suddenly in 3D and it never had been before. And
since that time, I’ve had so many more energy experiences because I’m
present in my body, and this is a common confusion that many people
have. We believe in a world of opposites and we think that the body is
the opposite of the spirit, but yes, we have a body and yes, we have a
spirit, but no, they’re not in competition. Becoming more spiritual
isn’t about becoming less physical or restricting the physical or taking
anything away, in fact, less body focus just makes us more spaced out,
we have less energy awareness. And again, I know because I got really
spaced out and I got really woo-woo, I’ve been there. So your goal in
this training is really mastering both, it’s not a competition between
your body and your spirit. So you don’t have to be less physical or eat
less meat or have less possessions or less money to be more spiritual.
Spirituality doesn’t replace your physical awareness, it just augments
it. So you can change your experience and perception even if you don’t
change your situation, even ascension is not about getting out of your
body. This might sound kind of funny, but ascension is actually about
getting better integrated within your body. So your body is ascending or
becoming more coherent, but your spirit is descending or fitting into
the body, but of course, we can’t sell dissension workshops ’cause you
know, it’s not sexy, so we talk about ascension. So what does it look
like to really be in the body? So think about people who you really
admire. They probably have a strong personal presence and they probably
inspire you to be present too, like powerful speakers, like Martin
Luther king or Lisa Nichols. You might think of athletes in the zone, so
when somebody’s passing a ball, they’re totally focused in the body, in
that moment. You might think of a singer or a dancer or a performer,
they have to be so present in the body or actors, they’re so present in
the body that we can cry and celebrate about their fake situations that
aren’t even real. You can also think about strong public figures like
Obama, very present in the body or newborn babies, newborn babies are
very present. So when you think about this, what do all these people
have in common? They probably have a passion for what they’re doing,
they have a strong focus, they have confidence or expertise and they’re
present in their body. So such people also report having strong
intuition and guidance. So let’s think of some examples in your life
too. Maybe you’re having a deep conversation and you’re really
interested, or maybe you’re playing sports, you feel really motivated or
you’re doing yoga and you feel so focused, or maybe you’re performing
something, you’re sharing your expertise, maybe you’re just having a
moment of physical intimacy and you’re very present, or you’re out in
nature in this high coherence space and you’re becoming more present. My
point is that you already know how to be powerfully present, so why
aren’t you doing it all the time? I really want you to get this, that
personal presence simply means your spirit is more present in your body.
In all these situations, people are present in their body with their
attention, their awareness and their energy. And you’ve heard a lot of
sayings like this, be in the moment, live in the present, be here now.
So to me, these are all saying, be present in your body. From an energy
perspective, your physical body is your here and now, it’s the only part
of you which has a position here at a timeframe, now. So then what are
you? It’s common for people to think I am my body or I am my thoughts,
or I am my mind and it’s even getting popular to think I am
consciousness and my body is a vehicle, but this is a little funny too
because yes, your body is a vehicle for your spirit, but it’s not like a
car is a vehicle for a driver where the car is this bigger thing and
this little driver gets inside because your spirit is much bigger than
your body. There’s always more of you out there than there is in here.
So an easier way to think about this is that your spirit can be
expressed in your body, it’s like your spirit is water being poured into
a glass. You know, all the water won’t fit in any glass, but your glass
can be more or less full. And when your body is 10% full with your
spirit, you feel kind of weak and floating, and grumpy, and achy and
there’s 90% room left for other energies. And when your body is 50%
full, this is what consider normal or we think is feeling good, but
still 50% of your space is available for other energies. Now when your
body is getting 90% and 100% full, you feel really vibrant and powerful,
like wow. Think of those powerful speakers you’ve seen at A-Fest,
there’s no room for other energies and this is very healing and it’s
very easy to do. The secret is that your energy has priority in your
body, so when your spirit is present, everything else must leave.
Everything else is like, imagine this analogy with the water so if
there’s a little oil on top of the water where the water is your energy
and the oil is not your energy, you don’t need like a spoon or a sponge
or a laser, or something to get that oil out, you just pour more water
into the glass and the oil naturally floats off the top because the
water has priority. And this is how your spirit works with your body,
when you’re fully present, nothing else fits. Fortunately, we have some
great energy tools to help. This chapter’s tools are easy to use. The
first tool uses your focus and attention. Now, as I’m talking, you can
just start calling back all your attention from everywhere else. So have
all your awareness come back just gently be right behind your eyes.
Having a location for your awareness is really helpful because most
people don’t know where their energy and awareness is. So knowing where
you are right here helps you be more present. So let this be easy,
you’re just comfortable right behind your eyes, looking at me as I’m
looking at you, give me a little smile, very nice. So if you want to see
how powerful this is, then try this when someone is talking to you. So
as they’re talking, just be right behind your eyes and very present. And
many people will actually stop talking because there’ll be so shocked
that you’re present, which tells you how present you normally are. Now,
our second tool is Grounding and simply connecting yourself
energetically into the earth. So the most powerful tool for presence
that I can teach you is Grounding. It really works in any situation. So
Grounding is for anchoring your spirit and your energy into your body.
It starts healing your physical energy bodies right away and Grounding
is really a core practice of energy work. It looks a little bit like
this. If you’re not grounded, you feel kind of empty and unsure. So you
just imagine connecting your root chakra at the base of your spine, down
into the earth and you’ll start to feel better. If you imagine a very
wide grounding cord, as wide as your body connecting you deeply into the
earth, you feel even more present and more grounded. And this is how you
can get up to 90 or even 100% of personal presence. So let’s try it
right now, go ahead and close your eyes and notice, where did you go?
Just open your eyes again, it’s the world’s shortest meditation, and
when we close our eyes, this is a cue for most of us to leave our body.
So when you closed your eyes, you probably popped out and went
somewhere. So let’s do it a little differently. So now I want you to
notice your breath with your eyes open and just pick a point on the
breath and gently breathe your eyes closed and smile, good and call back
all your energy from other times and places and events, just call it all
back to you. Be present right behind your eyes in a calm relaxed way and
really breathe your energy all the way into your body and into
yourselves. And notice your root chakra near the base of your spine, and
notice a little vibration or pulse extending from this root chakra down
to the earth, deeply anchoring you all the way to the center of the
earth and breathe, and let this grounding cord become a little wider.
You can imagine it’s a tree trunk as wide as your body, notice how that
feels, or you can imagine this grounding cord as a waterfall, the water
cascading from you down into the earth. Just try it and see which one
feels stronger for you, or you can imagine your grounding as a beam of
light just shining down from your root chakra into the earth. Any of
these visualizations are fine, just pick the one which is strongest for
you. Very good. Now, feel yourself filling up with your own spirit, 30%,
50% full, see if you can get all the way to 90% full of you. Just feel
your energy radiating in your heart and your hands, and your feet and
notice if you’re still feeling relaxed behind your eyes. And now begin
to release your pain and confusion right down that grounding cord into
the earth. Don’t worry about harming the earth, it’s okay just let the
earth help you release your pain and confusion. And as you release your
old energy and the old memories or fears, just give it all permission to
release right now. Notice one more thing, something you didn’t know was
there before and give it permission to release down your grounding cord.
Good, and take a deep breath extend your awareness into the room, ground
the room as well and notice any stagnant or unconscious energy releasing
the new distractions or old memories and so on, just let them release
easily, write down that grounding and notice how clearing the room
affects you, there’s more space for you to be present in your body. You
could ground the building too if you like, and just be aware of your
body, be present behind your eyes, and give yourself permission to
maintain this strong presence in your body. Smile and be grateful for
your body and say, I love my body. I love being in my body. I love being
on planet earth. Breathe your eyes open, beautiful, your energy looks so
great. Please enjoy this strong presence in your body today.

LESSON 3: Healing Your Life

<v ->Welcome back. Give yourself a deep breath, and say “Hello” to the
group energy. Send smiles and hellos to all your fellow students, and
feel the group energy and intention supporting you. Today, I want to
look more deeply at how you can heal your life. From an energy
perspective, five things need to happen. First, you must heal your pain.
You must get through your current layer of pain so that you know,
experientially, that you can do it. And if you heal your pain once,
you’ll feel confident that you can do it again. We’ll be doing this in
different ways throughout the program. If you don’t take this first
step, if you don’t feel it, and you don’t have an experience, then
healing will just be a nice idea, not a powerful life-changing practice.
You’ll keep being stuck in the same patterns of pain and always
searching for a new program, or a new book, or a new meditation, always
searching, but not really finding a lasting solution. And this is why
the meditations and exercises in Duality are so important. You get a
tangible experience of healing yourself. Now, second, you must clear
your confusion. Now it’s funny because we all think our beliefs are
true, but they’re not. I hate to break it to you, but you have to get
past this false idea and uncover your biggest areas of confusion. Only
then can you clear them and begin finding your own answers clearly. Over
the years, I’ve taught hundreds of energy healing seminars to thousands
of students. And I always pay attention to why do people get stuck or
where are they confused? And we’ll cover these common confusions in each
chapter. Now, of course, I don’t have all your answers, but I can get
you asking the right questions so you find your own answers. Now, keep
in mind, if you don’t clear your confusion, you’ll keep thinking the
same way, making the same decisions with partial or incorrect
information. You’ll keep using half of your abilities and perception,
and getting about the same results, half of what you want. Now, the
third step to healing your life is increasing your intuition. So as your
pain and confusion calms down, you can take your intuition to the next
level. You can turn up your intuition so you can steer clearly and stay
on the coherent path of synchronicity. The tools I’m giving you are time
tested. They’re originally from Berkeley Psychic Institute, and the last
50 years, they’ve trained hundreds of thousands of people, so these
tools really work. And of course, I’m sharing my personal insights and
additions from my twenty-five years of applying energy work in real life
situations. Now keep in mind if you don’t increase your intuition,
you’re just going to keep guessing, instead of knowing. Now I get it. I
did this a lot myself. Thinking, thinking, and thinking, and this leads
to really stressful decision-making, but with intuition, my philosophy
is actually the opposite. I like to joke that I have to make a decision
before I think about anything, because my intuition is so much more
clear than my thoughts. Now, if you don’t increase your intuition,
you’ll keep reacting to life, instead of choosing your life. Life can
feel out of control, rather than just sensing things intuitively and
making conscious choices, which feels much better to me. Now, the fourth
step of healing your life is creating healthy habits. And this is really
all about practice. To create a habit you need to understand with your
mind, which is why we have these lectures. And you need to understand
with your energy, which is why we have the meditations. And you need to
understand with your actions, which is why we have exercises and real
world applications. And to help with this today, we’ll listen to your
first practice meditation together. And you can use this meditation any
time. It’s only six minutes long, and it gets you firmly grounded so
that your pain and confusion can release. And a good rule of thumb is
that if you’re thinking about Duality or thinking about the grounding
tools, then this is your spirit’s cue to do a quick energy exercise. You
can do my recording that we’re going to do now, or just do it quickly in
your own mind, either way is fine. Just remember to practice, practice,
practice. Creating healthy habits now is what will carry you through any
of the tough times that you have later. This is so important. If you
don’t create healthy habits, you’re going to get good initial results,
but then stop growing after the program. You’re going to feel strong
with the class and the group and kind of weak by yourself. So how many
programs have you taken where you got great results, and then
afterwards, you just kind of reset to your previous state. So I’d like
you to consciously decide not to do that this time. You deserve better.
The fifth step for healing your life is getting activated. When we
create the coherent field, you automatically align. You don’t need to
understand why or try to align. It just happens automatically, kind of
like iron filings with a magnet. And the group training creates this
effect. So one person gets a big aha, and then we all step up. One
person clears some deep pain, and we all get a healing. This is what I
call activation, and it’s a big part of the Duality training. And it’s
why I’m always working with the group energy, working to keep it
coherent and having you tune into it every day. Activation is one of the
biggest reasons to trust the program. It’ll keep pulling you forward,
even when you resist, and you will resist. You’ll have some pain that
you don’t want to clear, or you don’t want to show up to class, and
maybe you want to drop out altogether or give up. When this happens,
remember, that’s a sign that we’re getting at the good stuff for you.
That’s your cue to keep going and get your breakthrough. So trust this
group activation to carry you through those times. And remember, if you
don’t get activated, you will still make progress, but it’s going to be
slower and step-by-step. So by yourself is the slow long road to healing
and group activation is this shortcut, where it’s fast and easy. Without
the group activation, you’ll also have more learning adventures where
you go down a dead end path, and spend some time and energy. And then
you look back and the best you can say is, “Well, I guess I learned a
lot.” But probably what you learned is, don’t do that again. So this is
kind of a slow path forward. So these are the five steps that we’re
taking in each chapter. We’re going to heal your pain, clear your
confusion, increase your intuition, create healthy habits, and get
activated. And with these five steps we can accomplish my goal, which is
to systematically, reliably, get from pain and confusion, just lack,
frustration, feeling stuck, pain or disease, into awareness and
coherency, flow, abundance, happiness, joy, love, health, so that you
can be the brightest you and live your brightest life so that you can
create positive change for you and others in the world. All you need to
do is be committed to showing up, committed to practicing, committed to
sharing with others energetically. This is how you’ll heal your life.
Sound good? Great. Now, I like to set realistic goals and I think
healing everyone on the planet is a very realistic goal. And I say this
because healing is natural. It happens all the time if we’re not in the
way. Even grounding occurs naturally. Nature has some great tools for
getting us into our body. Think about it, gorillas beat on their chest
to get powerfully present in their body. Horses stomp their hoofs. And
animals and people like to yell when they’re going into battle, or when
you’re at the gym lifting weights . This actually works because you’re
stronger when you’re more present in your body. Touch also validates
your body. So being touched or touching something makes you more present
in your body. Eating is a great way to get present. You literally have
more physical presence, which is very grounding. And exercise. That’s
why it feels so good, and probably why we resist it, because we don’t
always want to be in our bodies, especially if we haven’t cleared out
our pain and confusion. So nature’s tools are great for helping us get
in the body, but you might want something a little more subtle that you
can practice all the time. So people might look at you funny if you’re
going into a meeting, beating on your chest, stomping your feet and
yelling. And that’s where the energy tools are so helpful. You can
practice them anytime, anywhere, without anyone noticing. You can be
standing, or sitting, or lying down. You can be walking or skiing. You
don’t even have to close your eyes. You can ground yourself right now
while I’m talking, just like I’m grinding myself as I’m talking to you.
Another beautiful thing about energy tools is that they can’t harm you
or harm others. So energy tools simply help restore the natural flow of
energy. And this is great because we often have habits which break or
restrict the natural flow. Using energy tools will help counteract your
bad habits and get your energy flowing again. Usually this feels great,
but if your energy is especially stuck or it hasn’t been moving for a
long time, you may feel some initial discomfort. So imagine if you were
sitting cross-legged for an hour. When you get up, your legs are going
to hurt a little bit as the blood returns to its natural flow. This is
okay. If you haven’t been grounded for 10 years, you might feel a little
woozy or dizzy when you start grounding, and that’s okay too. Don’t
worry. It’ll fade as your energy starts returning to its natural flow. I
should mention too, that if you’re having pain or discomfort, you might
be trying too hard. So energy tools are easy. You just let them happen.
You don’t have to put in effort or make them happen. You just want to
relax a little bit on your effort and things will start going more
smoothly for you. Another cool thing is that you cannot use energy tools
to manipulate or harm others, because personal freedom is in the natural
flow for everyone. Energy tools are simply for self-healing and of
course, energy tools could be used for healing others too. And this does
happen naturally. As you ground yourself, other people become more
grounded too. And you can enhance this with your intention. Maybe you
put your hands on someone’s shoulders and then ground yourself with
permission, of course, ground yourself, and then imagine them being
grounded too. They will easily match your grounding. But for now, I
recommend just focusing on yourself. And to make that easy, I’m giving
you a practice meditation today. So we’ll listen to it once together and
I encourage you to use it anytime you’re feeling ungrounded. So I
recommend grounding at least once every day, but grounding many times is
fine too. So let’s begin. Find a point across the room where your eyes
rest naturally. Focus on this point with a relaxed and present gaze.
Give yourself a deep breath and be very present behind your eyes. On
your next exhale, gently close your eyes, maintaining the same strong
presence behind your eyes. Smile and feel your energy in your body. Call
back all your attention from other times, places, people and events. As
you inhale, draw your energy into your lungs. As you exhale, feel your
energy filling your entire body. Notice your root chakra near the base
of your spine. Feel your energy pulsing there. Extend your energy
downward from your root chakra, like a tree growing roots, or a
waterfall cascading down into the earth. See it going down, down, down
all the way to the center of the earth. Breathe. Let your grounding
expand until it’s as wide as your body, deeply rooting you into the
earth. Feel your presence getting stronger in your body. Feel your
energy pulsing in your heart, and your hands, and your feet. Feel your
awareness right behind your eyes. Notice any pain or tension in your
body. Let it release now down into your grounding, away from your body
and into the earth. Give yourself permission to maintain this strong
presence in your body. Smile and be grateful you have this body. Say to
yourself, “I love planet earth. I love being in my body.” With your eyes
closed, remember the point across the room. On your next inhale, gently
open your eyes.

LESSON 4: Deepen Your Grounding

<v ->Welcome back. Give yourself a deep breath and say, “Hello” to your
grounding cord. Have your awareness behind your eyes and say, “Hello” to
the group energy. Just send some smiles and hellos to your fellow
students, and feel the group energy and attention supporting you. Today,
I want to share some of my favorite stories about grounding to inspire
you and show you what’s possible when you apply grounding in your life.
The first story is from one of my dear students in Sedona named
Jacqueline, was experimenting with grounding at her job at a local art
gallery. So let me read you what she wrote. “As of this week, my
commissions have almost doubled”since I began grounding as you taught in
‘Intuition 101.’ “The owner of the business said he didn’t know”how I
produced the increased sales as I have not “been following his verbal
sales presentation.” Now this is great. So what she was doing there was
she was grounding herself, of course, in the gallery, and then she was
grounding the art gallery, the room, and then she was grounding the
people as they were walking by outside. And it’s really fascinating. So
what happened was that as people were walking by, if they were kind of
in that space where they were just shopping, didn’t want to buy, kind of
spacey, those people just walked right by. They didn’t come into the
gallery because they didn’t want to be present. And the people who did
come in were more clear and present in their bodies. They can make a
choice more easily and purchase something that they really liked and it
stuck with them, so she had less returns too. So this is pretty amazing.
Within just that one week, she almost doubled her sales. So she also
said, “As the money continued to increase,”I decided to ground other
aspects of my life “for manifestation and other choices,”and I’m seeing
amazing results. “It seems that grounding could be the basis”for
creating all my intentions.” So that’s so true. Another favorite story
of mine comes from when I was first teaching in Japan. So I moved here
in 2011, right before the Tōhoku earthquakes. And I was teaching
students these same tools for powerful focus and presence and grounding.
And in Japan before there’s an earthquake, the phones actually have a
little alarm goes off. It’s like, bah, bah, bah, just to tell everybody
there’s an earthquake coming. You got to love Japan. And we’re in class
and we’re meditating and all these alarms start going off and the
building is shaking and no one moves. So everybody is still perfectly
grounded and present in their body, just sitting in their chairs
meditating. And since they were grounded, they could sense that there
was no big danger. This was just one of the aftershocks. We were having
two of those a day, roughly, for the first month. And I was so impressed
these students, even though the building’s shaking and their alarms are
going off, they were still present and in their body. So amazing. This
is my evidence to me that grounding really works. For me personally, the
most powerful grounding experiences I’ve had were the few times I’ve
been in life and death situations. So I love to rock climb and
backcountry snowboard, both of which come with some risks. And I
remember rock climbing one time in Estes Park, Colorado, and we’re on
this route. I’m having a good time. It was a friction slab, which means
that there aren’t really many holes. You’re just kind of using friction
from your hands and your feet. And I’m heading up the climb and I’m on
this little spot where I’m just holding on a little thing about the size
of a peanut with one hand, and my right foot’s just on this little tiny
slope, and my other hand and foot are just kind of flailing for balance.
There’s nothing to hold on to. And I thought to myself, “Okay, I could
use a little protection right now.” So I’m a free climber, which means I
put my own gear in as I go up. And before I went up, I could see where I
put the gear, but I was nowhere near it. This round was actually going
at an angle. On this kind of climb, you can’t really choose where you
go. There’s just, you have to go with the flow. And at that point I
realized, “Oh, this,”this doesn’t have any gear.” My mind flashed back
to the book, there’s a 9X climb in the book. An X means if you fall, you
know, X, it’s all over. And I never climb stuff like this, but I
happened to find myself in the middle of this one and I was starting to
come out of my body, my attention was going everywhere. I went down to
the last piece of pro that I put in, the last protection, and I realized
it’s behind a little flake, which is going to break at this distance and
fall. And my attention went to my partner who was at the belay station,
and that station just had a bunch of slings wrapped around a horn. And
at this distance, I was going to pull him up off of that when that first
piece popped. So I realized, “Oh, great.”So if I fall, I’m going to take
him with me.” And then my attention went to the walk-off ledge to the
side and I realized, “Oh, that’s why this is a 9X,”because I’m not, even
if the rope does hold me, “I’m going to hit that ledge.” It’s not a
clear fall. And as this is happening, I’m out of body. You know, my eyes
are getting wide, my heart’s starting to pound, and I realized, “Ah, if
I don’t get grounded”and get in my body, I’m going to fall just from
fear.” So I realized, “Ah, I just need to make a choice right now.”Is
today my day to go? “No, it’s not.” So I just grounded myself, got
really in my body, and all those fears went away. And I remembered I
love rock climbing and I love friction slabs and I’m pretty good at
them. So I just finished up the climb, got to the top. And we were about
that point about 250 feet up and I just clipped in, put my first, put my
pro in, and, you know, breath of relief. And it’s situations like this,
where I realize that, you know, grounding can really change your life
and grounding can really save your life. Now, I hope you never find
yourself in such a dire situation, but if you do, please remember your
grounding. Your body is so amazing when you’re present in the body.
You’ll be amazed at what it can do and what you can do. This is a great
time to explore some more examples of being ungrounded. So imagine times
when you’re not present in your body. One of the big ones is stage
fright. So people get onstage, we pop-out of our body, and we can’t do
anything or remember anything or even talk normal. And to make it worse,
our body panics because we left and we start sweating and shaking. I’ve
had this happen myself. And when this happens, you just need to be
amused and ground yourself and get back into your body. Another example
of being ungrounded is daydreaming. So we even have words for this. We
say, “I’m out of it, not into it.”I’m beside myself. “I’m out of touch
or spacey.” All of these things are just different ways of saying, “I’m
not in my body.” So maybe you’ve had that experience where you daydream
while you’re driving. So did you ever think, “Who is driving while
you’re away?” Kind of scary. How about the dentist or the doctor? You
know, when that drill starts, you just kind of shoot right out of your
body. Grounding can really help. After a bike crash or an accident, your
spirit tends to get knocked out of your body. And if you don’t have any
energy tools, it may take a week or two to get back in. In the meantime,
you’re feeling kind of spacey and bumping into things and so on. And
some of us feel ungrounded even when we’re using a smartphone or using
the computer, or in certain social situations, and so on. I recommend
that you make a list of all the situations where you feel ungrounded.
Making this list will help you remember so that you can ground before
going into them. And this will really help you. Jet lag is another
example of not being present in your body. Now, in this case you
actually are grounded, but you’re grounded into a different time zone or
a different place in the planet. You need to update your grounding to
your new location. That’s why going outside barefoot or hugging a tree
helps with jet lag. These are just natural grounding exercises. You can
also let go of your grounding cord and create a new one in present time,
the present location. And that’ll really help too. When I traveled a lot
for teaching, I like to pre-jet lag. So I would ground into the new
location one day before. So if I was in America and I was going to
Paris, I would take up my grounding cord and then reground myself into
Paris. And I would get all the same jet lag symptoms before I even got
on the plane. But then when I arrived in Paris, I was right there in
present in my body, without any jet lag. It was amazing. This is a
really fun energy trick and I’ve actually had some business people
email, thanking me for this one. It’s very handy. You’re naturally out
of your body when you’re sleeping too. You know, you’re actually going
off to a little bit different dimension. When you’re drunk, that gets
you out of your body and out of your pain, which is probably why people
like to do it. And, of course, you know, after life. So when you have no
more body, you’re not in it. So you’re probably starting to see a
pattern here. If being in the body feels good, then why aren’t we
present all the time? Sometimes it’s fear. It doesn’t feel good, so we
don’t want to be present for it. But in this case, your body probably
needs you to be present. It’s hard to make good decisions if you’re not
in your body. Pain is another big reason we’re not in our body. It also
doesn’t feel good and we don’t want to be present. You might have some
distractions like the TV or the phone or YouTube, or maybe a lack of
passion and interest in your life. These feelings tend to make us want
to float away. Self-judgment is a big one. If you think, “My nose is too
big, or my butt is too small,”or I’m too tall or too short,” or
whatever, you don’t have a good relationship between your spirit and
your body. And I recommend letting these ideas go because when you have
a good relationship with your body, it’s easier to be grounded and in
the body. All right? Whew! So we’re starting to get a little ungrounded
as I give all those examples, so let’s go ahead and change that. So just
think to yourself right now, what does strong presence look like to you?
Think of some people that you really admire. They probably have a strong
personal presence and they inspire you to be present too. I like to
think about this guy, Konishiki Yasokichi. He was the world’s heaviest
Sumo Wrestler. He’s from Hawaii. Now, this guy was 285 kilogram. That’s
over 630 pounds. So look at this face. He’s like 150% present. I don’t
want to face that guy. And I should probably mention here that while
gaining weight does help you ground, grounding energetically doesn’t
make you gain weight. So don’t worry about that. Remember our other
great examples too. Athletes in the zone, powerful speakers, singers,
dancers, performers, actors that can make you cry and jump for joy, even
though their stories aren’t real, spiritual leaders like a Yogi or the
Dalai Lama. These are our role models for personal presence and
oftentimes, they’re role models for great decision-making and positive
change too. Think about it. In his lifetime, Nelson Mandela helped South
Africa break out of a very strong negative feedback loop and begin
moving into a positive feedback loop instead. Everything is possible.
Next, I’d like to share a different way of learning about being in the
body. So we’ll take a little journey into the earth and then back to
your body. I always imagine an elevator for this journey, but if
elevators make you uncomfortable, feel free to imagine a beautiful ball
of light instead. That’ll work too. So let’s begin. Go ahead and close
your eyes. Give yourself a deep breath. Be grounded, present, and
relaxed in your body. Call back all your energy from other times and
places, and be fully present behind your eyes. Breathe. And notice the
earth beneath you. Feel your energy extending from the base of your
spine, deep into the earth. And as you connect with the earth, feel your
body relax. Feel your grounding to the earth getting stronger and
becoming as wide as your body. Notice any tension in your body and give
it permission to release. Breathe. And let your grounding expand further
until it’s as wide as your outstretched arms. Now imagine that you’re in
a round glass elevator inside this large grounding. You’re going to ride
this elevator down to the center of the earth. So press that down button
now and feel the elevator, and feel that bubble of energy starting to
move. Feel your awareness moving down through your body, past your feet
and down into the earth. Continue moving down deeper and deeper into the
earth, and notice any thoughts which distract you from this journey and
just let them release. Breathe. Feel yourself arriving at a large cave
in the center of the earth. See a soft light radiating from the walls of
the cave, illuminating the space around you. Feel the pulsating energy
of the earth all around. Ask the earth to give you a deep healing right
now. Let yourself relax and receive this healing. Feel any old long-held
pains releasing from your body. Feel your anxiety and worries release.
Feel your doubts about yourself sinking into the earth, releasing from
you forever. And ask the earth if there’s anything else that can help
you heal. Be grateful to receive this healing from the earth. Breathe.
Feel the earth’s energy getting stronger beneath you. Feel it lifting
your elevator, pushing you up through the earth again. As you travel
upward, notice the earth energy filling and cleaning your grounding.
Feel yourself arriving again in your body. Moving past your heart and
your throat, and let your awareness be gently right behind your eyes.
See that elevator fade and disappear and feel your grounding become as
wide as your body again. Notice how your body feels being strongly
connected to the earth, and feel your spirit being fully present and
deeply anchored into your body. Give yourself a deep breath. Smile. Be
confident, relaxed, and clear. Wiggle your hands and feet. Stretch. Open
your eyes and come out of trance. So take a few moments by yourself to
get used to this strong grounding in your body. Enjoy.

LESSON 5: Grounding: Exercises and Applications

<v ->Welcome back, give yourself a deep breath and remember your
grounding cord connecting your body into the earth. It can be this easy
to ground, just remember. Today’s our final talk on grounding and
personal presence. You’re already getting the hang of it, but I want to
give you some exercises and ideas for integrating grounding into your
daily life. Already, I’ve really been enjoying watching your energy and
reading your stories and a lot of fun success stories. And I want to
read you a few of my favorites from the very first Duality group. You
can practice grounding yourself while I read these. So here’s a good
one. This is from Yolandi. She posted, “I’ve been grounding myself in
especially buildings. I find people around me seem happier. There’s
constantly somebody singing at work, not even softly. At one time, two
were singing from different corners. The other lady that works with me
said she could sense the change when she walked in, after not being
there for two weeks. We also had a meeting about misusing of generosity
that the company provides. And previously, the employees would have been
very upset and grumpy after such a meeting, but this time, however, they
were laughing and joking. It’s amazing how clear and light the air is
now.” And that’s great. That’s a great example of how grounding affects
other people and how grounding affects a space. All right, let me read
one more. So this is from Don who’s a CrossFit athlete. She said, “We
had a fundraiser this morning, which included 20 inch box jumps. And
before going in today, I grounded myself really well and it showed up as
I tried to jump. I normally do 24 inch box jumps straight up with both
feet coming off the ground simultaneously. Today, I struggled to make
this happen. My legs felt like they had magnets attached to them and
were filled with lead. Suddenly I remembered my grounding. I mentally
ungrounded my grounding cord and instantly the jumps went back to their
normal flow.” Yeah, that’s really fun. So I guess I’m going to have to
take box jumps off the list of grounding benefits . Now, seriously, this
is a great example of how powerful grounding affects the body. So some
of you also mentioned falling asleep either during the meditations or
even during class. And don’t worry about that, it’s okay. We’ll actually
talk about that in the next chapter, but for now just be grateful for
the extra sleep. A few people also posted, “I’m not feeling it,” or, “I
haven’t felt any different.” And it’s possible that you were naturally
very grounded already, which is great. It’s also possible that you’re
still struggling to get present enough, to feel a change. And in this
case, just be patient. It takes some practice, but your skills can
actually go from zero to a 100% very suddenly. It feels like nothing,
nothing, nothing. And then suddenly, oh, it feels like you’ve always had
it. The truth is that you’re all doing just fine energetically. Even if
you have a little unconscious energy, that’s blocking your awareness
temporarily. Just keep at it, trust me, this will become clear. And
we’ll keep using all the tools in each chapter so you’ll get a lot more
practice too. And everything gets easier with practice. A few people had
comments about self doubt or growing pains. “I can’t do it,” or, “I’ll
never get it.” And these thoughts are just energy too. So you have to
remember, we’re all working at different levels. So you can’t really
compare your results to other people and different tools are easier for
different people. So if you keep going through the program, you’ll find
the tools which are the easiest for you. And as I said before, we’ll
keep practicing all the tools as we go. So it’s not important that you
master everything right away, just keep going and trust the process. So
I hope you’ve enjoyed the grounding meditation and I suggest doing it
for at least two more days. You can also practice grounding on your own.
Every morning, I like to ground myself and stretch. Sometimes I imagine
my body is like a sleeping bag and I’m stretching my legs and arms down
into this bag. Now, this is a great visualization for kids. I also
recommend you practice grounding yourself and your room and people and
your projects and your pets. Just be a grounding maniac and see how your
life changes. Of course you can see grounding in other people too.
Notice how effectiveness and personal presence are related to being
present in the body. Today I really want you to notice your personal
presence throughout the day. Notice how present you are in the body.
Notice what causes you to be more present. This could be a stretching
exercise, deep breathing, smiling, laughing, gratitude. And notice what
causes you to be less present, fear, pain, it could be low blood sugar,
lack of interest, certain people or places or anything else. And
remember your list of less grounded or not fully present activities. For
example, for me, that’s playing on my iPhone, which is why I turn it off
from 8:00 PM to 8:00 AM. Or blood sugar, if I’m not eating enough, often
enough, it’s easy for me to get ungrounded. And of course I feel better
when I ground my office or ground my computer energetically, or if I
meditate or ground myself and get in my body. So today look out for
these symptoms of not being in the body. Small impact and small
influence. If you’re not in your body, your impact on the world is weak
even if your mind and ideas are strong. Focus and attention
difficulties, like not paying attention during conversations. Not being
productive. It’s hard to get things done if we’re not here. Impatience,
because you’re in the future rather than in the present. Low awareness
of your body, where suddenly you notice, “Ooh, I’m really cold.” Or
maybe you have to check your watch to see if you’re hungry or difficulty
waking up or falling asleep. Or if you’re feeling reactionary or startle
easily. Now, one funniest symptom of not being in the body is boredom.
Because if you’re not really here, life is not very interesting. I
remember this sign I saw in Paris, which summed it up really well. It
said, “You’re not bored, you’re boring.” And this really made me laugh
because it’s true. We’re pretty boring when we’re not in our bodies. If
you can find a partner to practice with in person, I have some really
fun exercises that’ll make grounding more real for you too. The first is
a grounding push exercise it just takes five minutes. You stand facing a
partner and you put your hands on their shoulders, with permission of
course. And just give them a gentle push and tell them first, give them
that little push, notice how they feel. And then just have them imagine
a tree trunk, grounding them into the earth and give them a little push
again. Notice the difference. You can have them imagine that waterfall
grounding or beam of light grounding, or no grounding at all and just
see, how does this change their body when you push them. And then switch
roles and have your partner do the same thing for you. You’ll notice
yourself changing very easily as they push on you. You can also try
picking somebody up when they’re grounded or ungrounded. This is really
fun. And you’ll notice a difference in how easy it is to pick somebody
up. And here’s a great one that you can do on a video chat. So while the
other person is talking just ground yourself and then be fully present
right behind your eyes. And just look them in the eyes while being fully
present. And they’ll notice that change too, might even start a fun
conversation about grounding. Now, if you’re at work, remember to ground
the room or ground the building, just imagine a grounding cord attached
to the center of that space. Or sometimes I like to put a grounding cord
in each of the four corners of the room. You can play with it and see
which one works better for you. And if you want to ground a project,
just imagine anything which represents your project. It could be a logo
or a sign or some object, or even just a bubble of energy is fine. Just
ground, whatever comes to mind, and that will ground the project. It’s
your intention that matters not the specific practice. Now, of course,
the more you ground, the more benefits that you’ll find. You’ll feel
more engaged, feeling, present and focused and interested and safe. And
you’ll feel more effective being caught up and relaxed with plenty of
time, getting more done with less time and effort, and you’ll feel more
conscious. You’re acting instead of reacting to life. You’ll feel more
aware. You start to sense the energy around you, and you’ll also feel
more powerful like that speaker or athlete or performer. And one of the
surprise benefits is the longer now, because time perception is actually
relative to your personal presence. So your now moment is like a little
sliding window of awareness. It can be a split second long or a few
minutes long, or even a few days. And if you’re super present in your
body, you can feel things in the longer now. It’s a very cool
experience. Now, I’ll give you a funny example. When I was in high
school, I had to set my alarm to get up and I hated my alarm clock. So
without knowing how I did it, I just decided that I would wake up just a
few seconds before it went off. And this would happen every day. I’d
wake up, open my eyes, reach over, push the off button. And then the
clock would switch to 7:00 AM. And this happened every day. Now I
understand why it’s because I made my now about 10 seconds wide. And
these days, if I’m really present, my now extends to about two years.
This is how I do energy readings. My wife’s is naturally about 10 years,
it’s fascinating. Now of course, these are extreme examples, something
to aspire to perhaps. But for today, you’ll notice that if you’re more
present in your body, you feel like you have way more time to get things
done. That’s the longer now kicking in. And if you have questions, which
I haven’t answered, I recommend that you experiment first. Try to find
the answer yourself. It’s much more fun to share an insight or an
experience with the group. And that usually starts a much deeper
conversation. I’ve also posted many of my FAQ answers to the group too.
So feel free to check those out if you want more hints. But honestly, I
recommend looking for your answers within. This is much more powerful
and a much easier way to learn. And of course, remember, you’re not
alone in this journey, the group energy is supporting you. So let’s end
today’s session by connecting with each other and sharing our progress
and enthusiasm, energetically. So give yourself a deep breath and close
your eyes. Feel everyone in the Duality training. Everybody from present
time, any past students and any future students too. Send them all a big
hello right now. And let yourself receive all those hellos. You are an
important part of this group energy. And ground yourself. Notice someone
else’s grounding that you really admire and match that grounding for
yourself. Ground the room that you’re in. Ground the bubble around the
group. Put everything you’ve learned so far about grounding and personal
presence into that bubble. All your insights, all your aha moments,
share them all with the group. Let yourself absorb all that learning
from others. Release any stress or unanswered questions from this
chapter down that big group grounding. Know that you are entirely on
track for chapter one. Just feel confident and relaxed and clear, ready
to keep growing and learning. And remember your intention for yourself
in this training and put it into the group energy now. Here’s mine, may
all that happens here be in alignment with each of our highest good. May
I be a clear channel for all energy and information, which comes
through. May we all have fun, grow and feel great together. Send one
more hello and smile to the group. You are in the right place. On your
next breath, open your eyes. If you are connected to the group, you will
never fall behind. You might not feel confident yet, but that’s okay.
Just stay with the group. No healer left behind. And remember, your
grounding meditation today. Have fun practicing your personal presence,
enjoy.

====================

LESSON 6: Energy Awareness & Personal Presence: Self-Practice Day

<v ->Welcome back, today is your self-practice day. You have all the
information and tools you need, and now it’s time to apply them. We’re
going to listen to the practice meditation together right now. Then take
the day to really use your energy tools in your life. This is your
chance to refine and integrate your practice. Let’s begin. Find a point
across the room where your eyes rest naturally. Focus on this point with
a relaxed and present gaze. Give yourself a deep breath and be very
present behind your eyes. On your next exhale gently close your eyes,
maintaining the same strong presence behind your eyes. Smile and feel
your energy in your body. Call back all your attention from other times,
places, people, and events. As you inhale, draw your energy into your
lungs. As you exhale, feel your energy, filling your entire body. Notice
your root chakra near the base of your spine. Feel your energy pulsing
there. Extend your energy downward from your root chakra, like a tree
growing roots or a waterfall cascading down into the earth. See it going
down, down, down all the way to the center of the earth. Breathe. Let
your grounding expand until it’s as wide as your body deeply rooting you
into the earth. Feel your presence getting stronger in your body. Feel
your energy pulsing in your heart and your hands and your feet. Feel
your awareness right behind your eyes. Notice any pain or tension in
your body. Let it release now down into your grounding, away from your
body and into the earth. Breathe. Give yourself permission to maintain
this strong presence in your body. Smile and be grateful you have this
body. Say to yourself, “I love planet earth. I love being in my body.”
With your eyes closed, remember the point across the room. On your next
inhale, gently open your eyes.

====================

Part 2: Gain Mental & Intuitive Clarity

====================

LESSON 7: Cultivating Intuition & a Balanced Mind

<v ->Welcome, everyone. It’s Jeffrey Allen again. Before we begin,
please remember your grounding and say hello to the earth energy. Send
smiles and hellos to your fellow students. And feel the group energy and
intention supporting you. Very good. In this chapter, we’re talking
about mental and intuitive clarity, about cultivating a balanced mind.
Now, of course, we all want clarity, but sometimes it’s difficult to
find. So what can we do energetically to find clarity? Well, first we
need to realize that finding answers is different than finding objects.
To find something in the physical world we usually become active, and
put in effort, and we’re searching. So we might be looking around for a
lost wallet or looking for a new pair of shoes, and if we don’t do
anything we’re less likely to find the object. By contrast, to find
something in the energy world we just ask. And then we wait, and we
listen, and we trust the timing. If we don’t do anything we’re actually
more likely to find the answer. There’s a great parable from “Crying
About This,” where there’s a man walking down the road and he sees this
fork in the road up ahead. And he knows, “Ah, this is really important.
I need to know which way to go, but I don’t know what to do.” So he’s
walking toward it, he’s getting stressed out, and at some point, he
stops. And he’s just thinking, and thinking, and analyzing, you know,
“Which way should I go, which one’s the right way?” And eventually, he
keeps going, there’s no answers, and finally sits down and he meditates,
gets really calm. Meditates, tries to find that answer. Still nothing.
No answer. So at this point, he’s running out of time. He kind of gives
up and in despair, he’s walking up toward the fork in the road. And then
when he gets to the fork, there’s a little sign that just says, “Go this
way.” And this is how energy works. All that effort didn’t help because
he didn’t have the right timing. And our answers come when we need them
not before. So this frustrates a lot of people who want to get the
answers right away. You might be wondering, why are these things so
different? Why are finding objects and finding answers so different?
Well, we’re not physically connected to all objects, but we are
energetically connected to all energy. And we’ll try out that connection
today, but you might be thinking, aren’t objects energy too? Okay, yeah,
pretty clever. And as it turns out, these energy tools and energy tricks
do work in the physical world too. So, for example, if you lose your
wallet, you can look for it energetically. You just ground the wallet
and then look for the grounding cord instead. Or you might go shopping
and just ask for the shoes ahead of time. And then you’re out, you’ve
forgotten about it, and they kind of magically appear in the store
window. Have you ever had that happen? You can also ask your parking
angels to find a great parking spot for you or to change the stoplights
to green for you, and these things work. But most people don’t think to
try them out. Keep in mind, intuition and sensing energy requires deep
listening, and it requires trust and patience, but intuition and sensing
energy doesn’t require effort or stress. It doesn’t require a perfect
track record or perfect abilities. You can just start doing things
differently now and you’ll find a new awareness comes on pretty quickly.
Some people ask me, “When did you start using your intuition?” And it’s
funny because I remember thinking, “I can’t do it. I can’t do it. I
can’t do it.” And then one day I just noticed, “Oh, I’m doing it.” And
then I realized, “Oh, I think I was always doing it, I just wasn’t aware
that I was doing it.” And this brings me to this chapter’s big question,
which is, what’s the number one reason why we can’t hear our intuition?
So what do you think? Maybe talent, or training, or practice, or because
you don’t live in Sedona. Actually, the number one reason why we can’t
hear our intuition is too much noise. So I’ve trained many students who
said, “I can’t see,” or “I can’t hear,” and this is not a skills or
sensitivity problem. It’s almost always a too much noise problem. So if
you imagine you’re with a friend in an intimate quiet setting, and
you’re having a conversation, it’s easy to hear them, right? And now
imagine that same friend, you’re in a crowded elevator with other
people, and everybody’s talking, it’s kind of hard to hear that friend,
isn’t it? Is possible, but it’s hard. Now imagine a live concert and
it’s impossible to hear anything, but the music. Your internal noise is
very similar. It’s often blocking your calm, quiet, intuitive voice. So
what’s the biggest source of internal noise. It’s your brain and
overthinking. Like the live concert, it’s too much of a good thing. Now
I know from experience, I’m a chronic overthinker. My mind can be very
loud. I can give you many examples from my life. When my mind gets
whirling, I start to notice details and unimportant patterns like the
floor tiles, or the ceiling tiles, which one’s out of place, or how they
could be better. It’s kind of like a monk on a TV show, but, you know,
not as brilliant. And I might get stuck in extreme precision where
everything has to be precisely arranged or perfectly done. When we’re
overthinking, we want the right way or the perfect answer for
everything. Like where exactly is the root chakra? How many centimeters
wide is my grounding? I get these questions a lot. And such precision is
actually not important for energy work and for many other things too. If
you don’t know what I’m talking about, like hand chakras or so on, don’t
worry about it. Just kind of go with it. Don’t think. Another example of
overthinking is overplanning your words. So you’re not really listening
to anyone else in the conversation. You’re just kind of waiting for a
break in the conversation so you can start talking again. Or sometimes
we imagine a long series of negative cause and effect. Like one time my
wife, Hisami, had a shoulder injury that was healing. And I was really
worried about her moving it around. And so my mind got a little crazy
and I told her, “You know, if you move your arm, it’s not going to heal.
And if it doesn’t heal, you’re not going to be able to work and if you
can’t work, you’re not going to be able to make money. And if you can’t
make money, you’re going to be homeless.” And I guess, you know, I
thought this was going to motivate her somehow, but it just made me seem
kind of crazy. And, of course, she was just laughing at me. When our
minds are overactive, sometimes we tell stories like this. We tell
stories about people that we don’t know. Now, this is not me personally,
but I’ve had several clients that will tell me, “I saw the same man
three times, maybe he’s following me or maybe he’s secretly in love with
me.” And you can probably think of some fun examples in your life too,
right? Maybe some songs playing in your head, or you can’t stop thinking
about something, or you’re obsessing about some small detail. We all do
this sometimes. Overthinking may not seem like a big deal, but the
results can actually be very big. It can lead to difficulties in
personal or work relationships. Maybe it’ll be viewed as critical or
judgmental, even though it’s not intentional. Or maybe you tend to see
things as black and white, right and wrong, good and bad. You might find
yourself arguing about unimportant things. My friend and his girlfriend
used to have huge fights about whether the drawers in the kitchen were
100% closed or not. This is not an important detail. Overthinking also
makes it hard to make decisions and to finish projects, it can create
stress-related health concerns, and my adrenals were it shot by the time
I was in my mid-30s, you also might become a poor listener and tend to
think that you’re always right, or he might have trouble visualizing or
sensing energy. Sound familiar? It’s hard to sense energy if you’re
always thinking about things. Now, there’s nothing wrong with using your
brain, thinking is great, but you want to balance intuition with your
thinking. So tell your brain then, instead of balancing pros and cons,
and rights and wrongs, it can start balancing thinking with intuition
because balanced thinking has huge benefits, like improved clarity. Your
mind and intuition working together opens you to new ideas and
opportunities. Many times when my mind is stuck on some question, if I
give up thinking about it, the answer will suddenly appear. When your
mind is balanced it’s easier to sense energy. If you stop thinking what
you should see, you’ll be amazed at what you do see. For example, I had
this student in LA and I was teaching about how to see the world. And
she’s, you know, working with this other student. And she says, “I can’t
see any energy in the aura.” So I went around behind her, and I just
looked over her shoulder, and I looked at her reading screen. This is
kind of a little teacher’s trick, right? So I could see what she was
seeing intuitively. And I said, “Well, what about all those flowers,
that beautiful floral print around the person?” And she said, “Oh, well,
you didn’t tell us to see that. Is that the aura? I see that all the
time.” So balanced thinking really helps get through these preconceived
notions. And balanced thinking can also improve our relationships. We
become a better listener with deeper understanding. For example, you
might be listening to your partner about some detailed frustrations, or
worries, or complaints. And then suddenly because you’re using your
intuition, boom, you get the bigger picture. My partner needs to hear
three things. I love you. I’m not going to leave you and it’s not your
fault. And even though they’re not talking about those things at all,
you try it out and you say them, and it works, and they feel better.
This is a real example from my life. Balanced thinking also creates less
stress in your body. As my mind calmed down, I began recovering from my
adrenal fatigue. So how do you do it? How do you turn down the analyzer?
So we can make this really simple because energy follows your intention.
Try this out while I’m talking, either with your eyes open or closed.
Without any effort, notice how active your mind is right now. And now
imagine there’s a little light switch or a volume knob on your analyzer.
You can just see it or feel it. It doesn’t matter. Just turn it down to
about 50%. And notice what’s happening. Okay, try turning it down to
30%. Turn your analyzer down to 10%. Try turning it off. This is a very
simple way to turn your analyzer down. You don’t need to see the switch
or the knob visually, I don’t. Just know that you can turn things down.
Bzz. Zzz. Zzz. Zzs. It’s that easy. So I remember a funny story from a
friend of Mindvalley who tried this. She was studying the Tibetan
language, and someone asked her to decode this specific Tibetan verse,
and then define the English equivalent in one of these three big
translated books. And she said she’d been searching for 10 days without
any luck. And then she listened to my teaching about the analyzer and
decided to try it. So she turned down her analyzer, asked her intuition
to guide her. And when she was calm, she just picked up one of the three
books, open it up in the middle, and flipped two or three pages, and
found the verse in less than three minutes. So it’s a great example of
adjusting that analyzer to get something done. There was just too much
information for her mind to process, but her intuition could do it
easily. So let’s try it again. Without any effort, notice how active
your mind is right now. Just give it a number from zero to 100%. And now
imagine a light switch or a volume knob for your analyzer. And adjust it
to about 50% and notice what happens. Now try 80%. Back to 50%, Try 30%.
10%. Just try turning your analyzer off. Just let it be fast and easy.
Now let it adjust automatically to your most comfortable setting. Any
setting is okay. And keep in mind that on and off are both good settings
for the analyzer, just like lights in your house. Sometimes you want
them on. Sometimes you want them off. With the analyzer, we’re looking
for balance. So when they’re on, we get details and precision, you see
the trees. When it’s off, we’re seeing the big picture. We see the
forest. When it’s on, we’re assembling information. When it’s off, we
get a holistic understanding. This is why thinking alone can result in
poor decisions because we’re not seeing the big picture. When the
analyzer’s on, we can plan how to get somewhere. But when it’s off, we
know where to go. When it’s on, it’s great for writing software, but
having it off is great for learning a language. When you have it on,
you’re going to look smart. “Wow, that person is smart.” But when you
have it off, you’re going to look wise. “Ah, that person knows some deep
secret.” So both settings are great. You can learn when to use each one
and then use them in balance. So now you can see why the analyzer is
great for physical perception, but not so good for energy perception. So
physical perception feels real. It’s specific, and detailed, and static,
and like text and a book, you know, it’s the same each time. And
physical perception helps you assemble parts into a greater
understanding and you have tons of practice at it. That’s why it feels
so real. Energy perception on the other hand is more like a dream, like
in a dream, you’re driving a car, and then you’re riding a bike, and
there’s no clear boundaries or transitions. Kind of like the “Inception”
movie, things don’t follow the normal physical rules. So energy
perception is subtle. It’s deep and it’s always changing. It’s like
clouds. Every time you look, they’re a little different, but with
practice, just like the clouds, you can start to see more useful
patterns. Like my friend’s a good example. He’s a hang glider. And he
has lots of experience looking at the clouds. So where I don’t see
anything but pretty clouds. He can see updrafts, downdrafts, heat,
moisture, all these different things because he’s practiced a lot. And
you’ll begin noticing energy patterns too as you practice. So energy
perception is also holistic. You know the whole answer all at once
rather than assembling clues. And energy perception is often not what
you expect, so you think you can’t do it. I remember my student from LA,
she’d been seeing auras her whole life as beautiful flowers and patterns
around people. But when I asked her to see an aura, she said, “I can’t
do it.” It’s not what she expected. Your energy perception is probably
the same way. You’re already doing it, but you don’t know it. Your mind
has convinced you otherwise. So today is all about overthinking. So I’ve
been filling your mind with all kinds of new information and this should
make it easier for you to feel yourself thinking. So today, try to be
more aware of your thoughts. When are you overthinking? And be aware of
your analyzer, try turning it up and down as needed, and notice what
happens, and have fun with this simple exercise today. And please share
your results with the group. Enjoy.

LESSON 8: Learn How to Clear Your Mental Distractions

<v ->Welcome back. Give yourself a deep breath. And as we begin, please
remember your grounding. Turn down your analyzer, and say hello to the
group energy. Send smiles and hellos to all your fellow students, and
feel the group energy and intention supporting you. Great, today, I want
to answer the most common question I hear, which is, how can I read
energy? And as usual, I have a long answer, so I made a little animation
for you to make it more fun. Now, I love drawing energy cartoons because
they help you keep your analyzer turned down. Let’s take a look. How can
I read energy? First, I’ll say that sometimes it does help to think of
energy like an object. So imagine all the information in the universe is
available in a big book in the sky. We’re going to call this book the
Akashic records, where all information is available, where everything is
connected. This is an inaccurate analogy, but it helps. In truth, these
answers are available, not in one place, but in every place. With
energy, all information is available all the time, everywhere. That’s
why I love questions and answers. If someone in class asks me a question
about energy, I just look up the answer and respond. I was doing Q&A one
time for my intuition training, and a long-time student asked, “How do
you know all this stuff?” And I just started laughing. And I said, “Did
you forget which class you’re in? I don’t know these answers. But when
people ask me questions, it’s like someone hands me a card with a
question on one side and the answer on the other. I just flip it over
and read it. It’s easy. That’s intuition.” So what gets in the way of
tuning into this infinite information and intelligence? We talked about
the big one already: thoughts and overthinking. You can’t stop thinking
about the past or you’re worried about the future, or there’s a critic
or judge that’s narrating your life. This is too big or too small or too
stupid or too smart. This is very distracting. What else gets in the way
of tuning into your intuition? Other people’s words and ideas, social
norms. Am I liked and accepted? What should I be saying and thinking? It
can be fun to fit in, to say and think the same things, but that doesn’t
mean they’re true. When we start using intuition, we often ask
ourselves, does what I see energetically match the group norm? And if
not, we doubt ourselves. We sense that we’re being judged by other
people and this makes it hard to sense energy. So, what else gets in the
way of tuning into your intuition? Your memories. They can seem so clear
and so real. Let’s say you remember a conversation with your friend from
years ago. And you remember that she was pregnant and you remember you
said something brilliant. And you remember that you were petting her
cat. But then if you think a little bit more about it, you realize, oh,
wait a sec, that friend didn’t live in the same place as that cat. And
actually, maybe my friend said the brilliant thing and not me. And then
this is the problem. When we remember things we do just that: we
re-member them. We reassemble pieces of information, and then we pretend
that they all happened together. But sometimes they don’t. Have you
noticed that? I first noticed when I was in college. I lived in Socorro,
New Mexico, and I was bragging to my girlfriend, trying to look smart.
And I told her “socorro” means health in Spanish. And I know, because I
saw this cartoon where there was this nurse and she was saying,
“Socorro, socorro.” And my girlfriend nodded her head. She said, “Yeah,
that’s fascinating. But I actually speak Spanish and socorro means help,
not health.” And on the spot, my memory changed. This cartoon nurse
turned into a little girl who was calling for help. “Socorro, socorro.”
And I was shocked. It’s like, my brain is unreliable. So sometimes it’s
good to doubt yourself a little bit. Your memories are unreliable, too.
And police say this about eyewitnesses, that they’re notorious for
conflicting stories. It was a blue car, it was a gray bus. There were
three people, there were four people, etc. And it’s because we’re
remembering or reassembling partial information. And of course, we
forget things, too. Many times, our memories are missing important
pieces. There’s little holes in our stories. And that’s why it can be
misleading to base our perception on our memories. So, that’s a lot of
distraction and noise: thoughts and beliefs, other people’s words and
ideas, your inaccurate memories. With all this distraction, how can you
tune in? So the first step is to focus your attention. So if you have an
intention to tune in, instead of thinking, and just simply move your
attention into the center of your head, that’s behind your eyes where
you’ve been practicing, but between your ears. So try it gently right
now. Move your awareness to the center of your head. Notice how that
feels. Step two is to turn down the noise. You can do this by turning
down your analyzer, or you can move your awareness to a place called the
higher mind. This is a place of observation where you can watch the
thoughts and noise, but you don’t participate. This can be very
enlightening. So, where is the higher mind? It’s actually behind the
third eye. So it’s near the back of the head. And I recommend you just
feel the location, and we’ll do that together in a minute. From this
place of the higher mind, everything else fades away. You feel calm and
clear and peaceful in your awareness. You don’t need to get rid of all
the distractions, but they’re very far away. They’re in the background.
The third step for tuning in is to just be curious. Wonder about
something. You don’t need to chase it or ask, ask, ask. Just be patient
and let it come to you. If you still have some distractions, just
continue letting them go. And then without effort, let the answers and
insights come to you. So you just stay in the center of your head or
your higher mind. And don’t start thinking about the answers. That
happens later. Just let the answers come in. It’s really that simple.
So, let’s try this out. It’s easier than you might think. So get in a
relaxed position and ready to meditate. Remember to let it be easy. And
do what feels right. Don’t worry about being perfect or in exactly the
right spot. Go ahead and close your eyes. Give yourself a deep breath.
Smile and ground your body. Remember that you’re a grounding master now,
even if you don’t feel like it. Let yourself be very relaxed and present
behind your eyes. Now center your awareness in your head, behind your
eyes, between your ears. For now, give your brain permission to think.
It’s okay to think and don’t try to stop it. And start to be aware of
what’s happening in your mind. Take a little inventory. What problems or
ideas are your mind thinking about recently? Are there difficulties or
unplanned aspects? And how are you planning to solve them? Is there a
timeframe or a deadline? Do you feel any doubts or fears and
frustration? And we’re just take taking inventory. Don’t try to fix it.
Does anyone around you have opinions about these ideas? And whose
opinions are important to you? And which are not? What past experiences
are you drawing on to solve these problems? Can you remember them
clearly or are you filling in the blanks? Let yourself be aware of all
that information processing in your head. You probably have a busy mind,
and that’s okay. This is an example of what’s really happening in your
brain. Now think of one topic you want more clarity on today, and very
simply let’s turn down the volume on everything else. So imagine a
switch or a volume knob on your analyzer. Turn it down to 50%, and 20%,
10%, then off. Give your mind permission to take a little break. Hmm,
that’s good. Now, imagine your topic again and notice if it’s more
clear. Okay, now I want you to remember something different. Remember a
time or place where your mind felt completely relaxed and peaceful.
Perhaps on vacation or somewhere in nature. Remember that feeling of a
calm, quiet presence. And imagine you’re there right now. Feel that
relaxed, peaceful mind, and breathe it in. Be in the center of your head
again. And imagine that same feeling of calm and peace is available in
your head. Let yourself drift up a little and back a little from the
center of your head. And let yourself move your awareness there with
ease. Feel that same feeling of peace, relaxation and calm. This still
point is called the higher mind: the calm, peaceful point of
observation. Breathe. And remember your topic and notice your thoughts
floating by. Just one by one, let the thoughts float by. Don’t attach to
them. Just let them float on by. Observing, but not thinking your
thoughts. Notice any opinions or thoughts from others, if they’re real
or imagined. And see them floating by and floating away. Notice your
memories, either real or imagined. See them floating by and floating
away. Breathe. All these thoughts and opinions and memories are floating
away, and notice the information that remains. Feel yourself opening to
that infinite intelligence and energy. It’s all around you in this quiet
place. Now remember your topic. And just be curious about your topic.
With no effort, no hurry, notice what insights you receive. Don’t think,
just let yourself receive. Sometimes it takes a moment. Just be patient
and curious. Let yourself receive. And breathe. And let your awareness
return to the center of your head. Notice if you feel more present, less
anxious than before. This is your normal awareness when the noise is
turned down. And decide what volume you want to keep your analyzer: 50%,
100%, off, any setting is okay. You decide. And give yourself another
deep breath. Feel grounded and present in your body. And say to
yourself, I love my peaceful awareness. I love my balanced mind. And
when you’re ready, open your eyes. Welcome back. How are you feeling?
Maybe calm and relaxed, slow and present, aware and tuned in? This is
just a taste. We’ll get deeper in this chapter. Maybe you feel a little
spacey or you fell asleep during the meditation. Or maybe my voice was
really far away. I call that sleep-itation. It’s actually your
unconscious energy releasing. It’s totally normal and it’s okay. There’s
a big difference energetically between being unconscious and noticing
unconscious energy. In one case, you’re not present. In the other,
you’re noticing how hard it is to stay present. This is a big
difference. Try to notice that yourself. Sleep-itation is actually a
good thing because you’re clearing your unconscious energy. And this has
huge healing benefits, even if you don’t remember anything at all. Your
practice meditation for this chapter is the same meditation we just did
with relaxing music. So if you like it, I recommend listening once a day
until you can get through without falling asleep. So clearing your
unconscious energy and getting great insights too. But don’t force
yourself to listen. We have very sleepy meditations in this chapter
because we’re laying the foundation for the whole program. If doing
another meditation feels overwhelming, just do the daily video lesson.
You’ll be fine. But if you’re excited to clear more quickly, spending
eight minutes on the practice meditation will really help. So thank you
everyone, and enjoy your peaceful mind today.

====================

LESSON 8 - MEDITATION: Practice meditation 2: turning down the noise

- Find a point across the room where your eyes rest naturally. Be behind your eyes focused on that point. Notice your breath and breathe your eyes closed. Notice your grounding, connecting your root chakra all the way to the center of the Earth. Smile and feel yourself getting more grounded and present in the body. Feel all your energy coming back to you in present time. Breathe. Bring your awareness into the center of your head. As you imagine that space, what does it feel like and look like today? Is it busy or calm? Is it clean or crowded? Notice if anyone else is with you in the center of your head. Can you see them or hear them or just feel them? If anyone is there with you, imagine you're opening the door and asking them to leave. Breathe. Notice how many thoughts, opinions, and memories are active right now in your head. Pick one topic to focus on today, something you want more clarity on. And turn down the volume on everything else. Bring your awareness up a little and back a little into the higher mind. Feel the difference as you find this calm, peaceful point of observation. Breathe. Remember your topic and notice your thoughts floating by. Let yourself observe but not think these thoughts. Notice any opinions from other people about this topic. See them floating by, but don't get attached. See these opinions floating away. Notice your memories about this topic, either real or imagined. See them floating by. And see them floating away. Breathe. As all these thoughts, opinions, and memories float away, notice the pure information that remains. Feel yourself opening to that infinite intelligence and energy that's all around you. Remember your topic and notice any new information or new insights coming easily to you now. Breathe. How does this new insight fit into your current plans and ideas? Let yourself integrate this new information now. Give yourself permission to keep receiving new insights today. Give yourself a deep breath. Feel grounded and present in your body. Say to yourself, "I love my peaceful awareness. I love my balanced mind." Stretch and open your eyes.

LESSON 9: Spring Cleaning For Your Mind

<v ->Welcome back. Give yourself a deep breath. And as we begin, please
remember you’re grounding, and be in the center of your head, and say
hello to the group energy. Send smiles and hellos to your fellow
students and feel the group energy and intention supporting you. I want
to start today with some examples of a relaxed mind. So who comes to
mind for you? I think of animals, because they’re not thinking at all,
or deep thinkers, like Rodin, The Thinker. Do you have any friends like
this? It looks like they’re thinking really deeply. And you ask, what
are you thinking? And they say, nothing. That’s my wife Hisami. Slow
talkers don’t say much, but they say profound things. After two years
living in Japan with Hisami, I was surprised how fast-talking my
American friends were, thought, wow, that was probably me two years ago.
So who else has a relaxed mind? People in the moment, like performers
and athletes and so on, lets them respond easily without thinking.
People who feel yummy. That again, that’s Hisami, everybody loves being
around her. Let’s look more deeply at the tools we used yesterday. So
you probably remember the center of your head just behind your eyes, in
between your ears and being there helps focus your awareness. It’s like
grounding for the mind. You’re calm, you’re centered and you’re present.
And there’s an energetic feeling as much as a location. So don’t worry
about the exact physical location. Don’t overthink it. Benefits of this
space are slowing down the mind, clear thinking and receiving insights.
We also explored the higher mind, this place of observation for your
thoughts and it’s up and back from the center of your head. It’s really
behind the third eye, toward the back of the head, it’s 2.25 centimeters
up and 3.3 centimeters back. I’m joking, right? There’s no precise
location. You just have to feel it for yourself. And the benefits of the
higher mind are reducing your internal noise, letting go of attachments,
finding a new perspective. The higher mind may feel unusual at first,
it’s subtle, but you’ll get it. And I’ve had students ask, how do you
differentiate between thoughts and insights? And the answer is really
simple. Thoughts are like pieces that you’re assembling and insights
happen all at once. They’re internal and they’re holistic knowing. So
someone asked me one time, how do you remember what’s floating by if you
don’t think? They talked about this higher mind space. And I said, you
don’t need to. That’s the point, just let things float by. So let’s go a
little deeper. You ready for some serious sleeping? We’re going to do
some spring cleaning for your mind. We’re going to journey into the
center of your head. And some of you will see this more clearly than
others. And some of you will feel it more clearly. And some of you will
just have a nice nap and that’s fine too, just have fun and be curious.
So go ahead and close your eyes. And give yourself a deep breath. Be
grounded, present and relaxed in your body. And callback all your energy
from other times and places. And be fully present behind your eyes.
Breathe in. Now move your awareness into the center of your head.
Imagine the center of your head is a room which contains all your
thoughts and distractions. Just be in that room now and look around the
center of your head. Notice how big your room is. Does it feel familiar?
Is your room clean and organized or is it messy and difficult to see? If
you can’t see much, that’s totally okay. Just feel the space or imagine
a light switch and turn on the lights. What does your room look like or
feel like to you? Have you been here recently or is it old and
abandoned? Give yourself permission to see all the conscious and
unconscious information here. Let yourself see all your old thoughts and
ideas, everything you’re keeping in case you need it again. You might
see these as boxes or cobwebs or just energy. Whatever you see or feel
is right for you. And as you become aware of these old thoughts, decide
if you really need to keep them, are they helping you or are they just
clutter? Create a huge grounding cord in the center of your head, in the
middle of that room, like a drain where all the old energy can release.
Let go of your old thoughts and energy and see them swirling down the
drain. Very good. As the room begins to clear, notice light coming in
from above, lighting the ceiling and filling the room. As your old
thoughts clear, remember any broken records, those thoughts you have
that are playing over and over in your head. What do those broken
records tell you about yourself or the world? What are your persistent
doubts and worries and fears? Do you really need to hear them again?
Just dump all your broken records and all that information into the
grounding cord and let it go. And breathe. So how does your room look
now? Little more clear. Look around the room again and notice all the
stories, opinions and information other people have told you. You might
see piles of old tapes or just feel the old energy. Any way you perceive
is just right for you. Let that information play now and hear all the
advice you’ve received in this life. Hear everyone’s stories you’re
keeping in your head. You really need this now. Is it helpful or just
distracting? Let go of all these old stories and opinions and see them
moving down the drain, down the grounding cord into the earth. Breathe.
How does your room feel now? More quiet and clear. Look around again and
see all the old memories you’re keeping here. You might see old pictures
or movies, or just feel the energy. Ask yourself how many of these
memories are even real. Decide what you can let go of and release those
memories into the grounding. See them going down the drain into the
earth and breathe. How is the room looking now? Notice any people who
are in this room, in the center of your head, do you know them? What do
they want from you? Information or communication or safety? Did you
invite them or did they invite themselves? Check behind you and in the
corners, is anyone hiding out there? Have everyone stand in front of you
now and be seen. And get everyone’s attention and let them know that
you’re changing the rules. Tell them, only I am allowed in the center of
my head. Everyone else must leave. Open the door. Usher everyone out of
your head and breathe. And when everyone is left, close the door, admire
your new space. Ask yourself, is this room the ideal thinking space for
me? If yes, that’s great. If no, imagine what you would like to change.
Does it need to be bigger? Taller, redecorated, make any changes you
want to your room now, and breathe. When you’re finished, give yourself
permission to enjoy this clean, quiet, peaceful room just for you at the
center of your head. Keep this peaceful awareness and return your
attention to your body. Be behind your eyes, feel the room around you.
Give yourself permission to have a peaceful mind today. Breathe, be
grounded, present and relaxed in your body. Smile and be grateful for
your expanding awareness, Wiggle your hands and feet, stretch and open
your eyes. Welcome back. I hope you had a nice journey or a nice nap.
This exercise can bring up lots of questions about what you saw or
didn’t see, about what’s allowed or not allowed in your head. And the
answer is, it’s really up to you. That’s the point. The center of your
head is a space for you. So have fun with it, today, notice when
something is in your head that doesn’t belong to you or that you don’t
want there. Give yourself permission to let it go, really own this space
for you, enjoy.

LESSON 10: How to Access Universal Wisdom

<v ->Welcome back. Give yourself a deep breath. And as we begin, please
remember your grounding and be in the center of your head. Might feel a
little cleaner in there now. And say hello to the group energy, send
smiles and hellos to all your fellow students and feel the group energy
and intention supporting you. Today, we’re going to get deeper into the
Akashic records. I mentioned them before, but what are they really? The
Akashic records is a term used to describe how the universe is
organized, so all information is available from anywhere. Not in a book
or somewhere else, it’s actually inside us because it’s inside
everything. We are each connected to the whole on a quantum level, it’s
a zero point, or like a mini black hole at the center of all atoms,
stars and galaxies, and so on. And in this compressed energy, everything
overlaps in time and space. And this is what mystics referred to as the
Akashic records. Now, the hard science is still out on what exactly is
happening here, but it’s clear that something we don’t understand is
happening. The currently accepted laws of physics, the standard model,
don’t fully explain what’s being observed in large particle colliders.
So, science also knows that entangled particles share information
instantaneously across any distance, with no thought for the speed of
light limit. For me this science is really fascinating and I can’t wait
to see here it goes, but perhaps it’s a lot easier and practical for
most people to simply tune in with their awareness and get an
experiential understanding. And that’s what we do in this training.
Speaking of experiences, you’ve noticed that I like you to go places
with your awareness, so before we start today’s meditation I want to
play with this a little bit more. Think of it like awareness warmups,
loosen you up a little bit. And your awareness is what you consider to
be you, and this awareness moves independently from your body. Your body
is here and now, but your awareness is not bound by time and space. You
normally move your awareness all over the place, the past and the
future, and work, and home, et cetera. So, let’s start moving it
consciously. First let’s practice with your eyes open. It’s a bit like
moving a flashlight around inside you. Start behind your eyes and notice
your ear, and notice your other ear, and move your awareness to that
space by the ear, move it to the center of your head, move it to the
other ear, and then back. Try moving your awareness to the top of your
head, or the back of your head, and back to the center of your head. So,
there are three ways that I like to focus on something. Projection,
which is moving my awareness to it. Remote viewing, which is observing
something from a distance. And reading, which is bringing information to
me. So, let’s try them. Go ahead and close your eyes and bring your
awareness into the center of your head. Think of your hand. Are you
still in the center of your head? Okay, so this time stay in the center
of your head but feel your hand. Good, now be in your hand and move back
to the center of your head. And you can slide your awareness a little to
the left in your head, a little to the right. Very good. Now, imagine
that you’re watching a movie about your hand, so see it in front of you
like it’s a movie and go ahead and rotate your hand around to the back.
Look at it from the top or the bottom. Try rewinding your hand until
you’re three months old. Pretty interesting and brave. Now open your
eyes, ground yourself. Pretty fun, right? So, I’d like you to play with
this today by moving your awareness in different ways. So, don’t try or
think or analyze, just have a fun experience. And the point is to just
loosen up your awareness. Great. So, now that you’re warmed up let’s go
into the higher mind and pop through that zero point, and visit the
Akashic records. If you get lost that’s okay, just hang in there and
have fun. Go ahead and close your eyes. Give yourself a deep breath. Be
grounded, present and relaxed in your body. And call back all your
energy from other times and places, and be fully present behind your
eyes. Breathe. Move your awareness into the center of your head, and own
this space just for you. And think of a question you would like more
clarity on today. Don’t search for the answer just let your mind relax.
Good. Now let your awareness move slowly upward and backward a little
bit from the center of your head. Find that quiet, still point of the
higher mind, that point of observation. Notice any sleepy or unconscious
energy there and just stretch, yawn to release this unconscious energy,
and feel the stillness in the higher mind. So, feel yourself being
pulled into that stillness. You’re traveling deeper and deeper into the
higher mind. Breathe. You’re now approaching the bright light at the
very center of your being. As you go through that center feel everything
expand around you, and continue expanding until you’re connected to the
entire universe. All information is available to you here, all
inspiration is available to you here, you are connected to all that is.
Breathe. Now remember the energy of your question, feel its energy
around you. Notice the answers exist all around you as well, moving and
swirling, dancing in the energy of the question. Everything you can know
is accessible from here, and take a moment to linger in this space. And
keep this expanded awareness and return your attention to the center of
your head. Be behind your eyes, feel the room around you, and feel your
connection to all that is. Give yourself permission to access this space
anytime. Breathe. Now remember your question and answer, and let them
organize into a stream of thoughts and words or images. Take a moment to
listen to them now. Hearing the words, feeling the insides, receive all
the information you need. Breathe. So, let go of your question for now
and know that you can return to it anytime. Remember your grounding and
your body. Smile and be present behind your eyes. Be grateful for your
expanding awareness and for your connection with all that is. Wiggle
your hands and feet, stretch, and open your eyes. Welcome back. Are you
awake? I hope you had a great journey to the Akashic records. If you’re
feeling spacey, this is a good time to write down your experience. You
can share it with the group and help ground it into the here and now.
So, whatever you experienced, trust yourself. Your journey may have been
different from my suggestions, maybe you took a little side journey or
did something completely different, that’s totally okay. Today, try to
stay grounded and in your body while still feeling this connection with
the whole. If you feel really spacey, take a nap and let yourself
integrate. That was quite a journey today and you did great. So have fun
today, remember to stay grounded, stay connected and practice moving
your awareness today. Enjoy.

LESSON 11: Mental & Intuitive Clarity: Exercises and Applications

<v ->Welcome back. Give yourself a deep breath. Remember your grounding
cord. Remember the center of your head. And let your mind be relaxed and
balanced. It can be this easy to calm your mind. Just remember. Today is
our final talk on mental and intuitive clarity. You’re already looking
pretty clear, but I want to give you some exercises and ideas for
finding further clarity in your daily life. Now, remember, it’s totally
okay if you’re not an expert with your Analyzer, and center of the head,
or Higher Mind. We’ll be working with these tools throughout the
program, so you’ll get plenty of practice. We’re still in the early part
of the program and your energy is looking great. You should feel good
about your progress. You’ve been doing a lot of heavy lifting
energetically in the first two chapters, especially if you’ve been
sleeping. And you’re building fantastic momentum, so everything will get
smoother from here. Today, I want you to practice observing your
thoughts from the Higher Mind. Pick something you do often and use it as
a reminder. For example, every time you look at your watch today, pause
for a moment and observe your thoughts. Ask yourself, “What’s happening
in my mind?” And just observe. Don’t judge it or fix it. Just be
curious. You’re learning about yourself. How exciting. If you feel
judgmental or guilty, remember the Higher Mind. Move your awareness up a
little and back a little until you feel that peaceful awareness. Imagine
yourself doing this right now. What’s your reminder? Is it looking at
your watch or clock? Maybe going to the bathroom or getting a coffee or
a smoke. Now, imagine yourself doing that thing later today, and imagine
yourself remembering this exercise. What am I thinking about? And
observe your thoughts from a Higher Mind. Good. I like to do this every
morning as I’m waking up because my mind is always really interesting
then. Try spending two minutes each morning observing your thoughts from
the Higher Mind. What are you thinking before you even start your day?
Today, you can also practice using your awareness. Go to your hand or
your foot or anywhere else. Or observe your hand from the center of your
head. Or watch a movie of your hand and rotate or rewind it. And of
course, look for opportunities for turning down your Analyzer. Notice if
you’re overthinking, noticing unimportant patterns or details or
counting the bathroom tiles. Notice if your thoughts or words are
racing, or you have extreme precision, or everything has to be in the
right place. Notice if you’re feeling judgmental and turn the Analyzer
down. When you see the bigger picture, your judgment usually goes away.
A few more symptoms of overthinking are doing everything the best way or
perfectly. Making up stories about things that didn’t happen yet or
about people you don’t actually know. For any of these, just be amused.
You can turn down your Analyzer, go to the center of your head or your
Higher Mind, and just ask yourself, “Oh, what percentage is my Analyzer
set at right now?” And just have fun with this. Practicing with a friend
is great too. It makes your insights feel so much more real. Anytime
you’re having a natural conversation with a friend, just notice how you
float easily from topic to topic to topic. You might talk about work,
and then a movie you saw, and then some childhood event, and then a
funny story from this week, and so on. When you notice this happening,
try to retrace your thoughts backwards. How did you get to this topic?
What were you talking about before? How about before that? It’s a fun
game to play with a friend. Thinking backwards is great for becoming
conscious of your thoughts and helps you be more conscious when thinking
forwards too. It’s great for negative thought loops too. Just keep
rewinding your thoughts until you find a positive one. Okay, so let’s
move forward now to a new topic. Let’s say you want to practice mental
clarity at work. Just notice when you’re not focused and ground
yourself, move to the center of your head, and this will help bring you
back. You can notice when others aren’t focused too. I worked at Sun
Microsystems for over 10 years, and I love to practice energy work in
meetings. Someone was always getting spaced out, usually me, because I
get bored really easily. So I would ground myself, I would ground the
room, I move into my Higher Mind, observe my thoughts, or observe the
conversation in the meeting from the Higher Mind, and it was
fascinating. It was definitely not boring. It did have one downside,
however. I started getting invited to lots of meetings. At one point, I
had 25 hours of standing meetings every week. And I had hundreds of
useless emails every day. I didn’t have any time for real work. And
finally, when my boss scheduled me to fly across the country to some
meeting which had nothing to do with me, I finally asked, “What’s up
with all the meetings?” And she said, “I noticed that when you’re in a
meeting,”people argue less and more work gets done. “I figure you’re
doing that energy thing, right?” I said, “Yeah. Yeah, I am.” She said,
“Well, this group never gets along”and I’m desperate, so I want you to
go. “You can sit in the back, you don’t have to say anything.”Just
please help them get along.” And so I did, and they did, and I wasn’t
bored at all. It was great. And this is why I want you to practice
energy work in your daily life because it makes life so much more fun.
And of course there are many benefits to clearing the noise too. Improve
mental clarity and creativity. Opens you to new ideas and opportunities.
Seeing the big picture too. Improved intuition. You stop guessing and
you just know where to go. Improved relationships. You’re a better
listener and less distracted, less critical, and more present. Less
stress on your body. Your mind uses 25% of your energy and only has 2%
of your mess. It’s good to give it a break. One more cool benefit is
that people who are not thinking, really feel good to be around. This
really adds to the positive feedback loop. My wife, Hisami, is a great
example. If I’m an expert in overthinking, she’s an expert in having a
calm mind. She is calming and relaxing and just has this yummy presence.
Everyone feels it. Everyone loves Hisami. So what yummy person comes to
mind for you? Don’t you want to be more yummy too? Finally, I have a few
more practical tips for you, so use to practice meditation. This really
helps you develop your skills. Don’t try to do everything perfectly,
that’s overthinking it. And have amusement, that’s the magic elixir for
energy work. If you’re not having fun, you’re taking it too seriously.
And finally, follow a healthy pace. Balance enjoying your learning and
your energy with having a great life in the physical. So practice in
your daily life. Energy work is more powerful as an integrated
awareness, not as a separate meditation space. If you never practice
outside of class, you’ll miss out on many of the benefits. And of
course, practice with your friends. Sharing your insights and tools with
a friend will give you even deeper insights. So speaking of friends,
remember, you’re not in this alone. Your group is supporting you on your
journey. So let’s end today’s session by connecting with each other,
sharing all our progress and enthusiasm energetically. Go ahead and take
a deep breath and close your eyes. Feel everyone in the Duality
training. Present time, past students, and future too. And then, send
them all a hello right now. Let yourself receive those hellos. You are
an important part of the group energy. Notice the center of your head.
Be in the Higher Mind. And admire your mental space. Feel the group
energy and notice someone else’s mental space that you also admire, and
match it for yourself right now. Notice the bright, beautiful bubble of
energy around the group, and ground that bubble in the group.
Energetically, put everything you learned about a balanced mind into the
bubble. All your insights, all your aha moments, share them all with the
group. Good. Let yourself absorb all that learning from the others.
Release any stress, anxiety, or unanswered questions from this chapter
down the big group grounding. Know that you are entirely on track with
chapter two. Feel confident, relaxed, and clear, ready to keep growing
and learning. Notice your current intention for yourself in this
training and put it into the group energy. Here’s mine. May our minds be
in alignment with each of our highest good. May I be a clear channel for
all energy and information. May we all have fun, grow, and feel great
together. Send one more hello and smile to the group. You are in the
right place. On your next breath, open your eyes. Great job, everyone.
Your energy looks fantastic. Remember to practice today and enjoy your
balanced mind.

====================

LESSON 12: Mental & Intuitive Clarity: Self-Practice Day

<v ->Welcome back. Today is yourself practice day. You have all the
information and tools you need, and now it’s time to apply them. We’re
going to listen to the practice meditation together right now. Then take
the day to really use your energy tools in your life. This is your
chance to refine and integrate your practice. Let’s begin. Find a point
across the room where your eyes rest naturally. Be behind your eyes
focused on that point. Notice your breath and breathe your eyes closed.
Notice your grounding, connecting your root chakra all the way to the
center of the Earth. Smile and feel yourself getting more grounded and
present in the body. Feel all your energy coming back to you in present
time. Breathe. Bring your awareness into the center of your head. As you
imagine that space, what does it feel like and look like today? Is it
busy or calm? Is it clean or crowded? Notice if anyone else is with you
in the center of your head. Can you see them, or hear them, or just feel
them? If anyone is there with you, imagine you’re opening the door and
asking them to leave. Breathe. Notice how many thoughts, opinions, and
memories are active right now in your head. Pick one topic to focus on
today. Something you want more clarity on. And turn down the volume on
everything else. Bring your awareness up a little and back a little into
the higher mind. Feel the difference as you find this calm, peaceful
point of observation. Breathe. Remember your topic and notice your
thoughts floating by. Let yourself observe, but not think, these
thoughts. Notice any opinions from other people about this topic. See
them floating by, but don’t get attached. See these opinions floating
away. Notice your memories about this topic, either real or imagined.
See them floating by. And see them floating away. Breathe. As all these
thoughts, opinions, and memories float away notice the pure information
that remains. Feel yourself opening to that infinite intelligence and
energy that’s all around you. Remember your topic and notice any new
information or new insights coming easily to you now. Breathe. How does
this new insight fit into your current plans and ideas? Let yourself
integrate this new information now. Give yourself permission to keep
receiving new insights today. Give yourself a deep breathe. Feel
grounded and present in your body. Say to yourself, “I love my peaceful
awareness. I love my balanced mind.” Stretch, and open your eyes.

====================

Part 3: Heal Your Body Using Energy

====================

LESSON 13: Why Do We Struggle & Get Sick?

<v ->Welcome everyone, it’s Jeffrey Allen again. As we begin please
remember your grounding. Turn down your analyzer. And be in the center
of your head. Say hello to the group energy. Send smiles and hellos to
your fellow students. And feel the group energy and intention supporting
you. Good. In this chapter we’re learning about healing your body, which
is a huge topic. Of course with the body our first thought is usually to
take a physical approach. What’s the magic pill or supplement or diet or
exercise? Now, I’m not a doctor and I can’t help you with that approach,
but here’s what I can do, I can help you understand why you get sick
energetically and how to change that pattern. In my experience, healing
will occur naturally if you make room. So we’ll be learning about
managing your energy in a healthy way, energy tools for staying healthy,
energy tools for healing yourself and others, and using energy work with
traditional medicine. Now this last one is really important, when people
learn energy healing and start getting results, they often think, wow,
this is great, I’ll never need medicine again, or I’ll never need to go
to the doctor again. And I’m telling you now this is not true. Energy
work is not a replacement for physical treatment or medicine, but they
do work great together. Now, I’m not saying this because a lawyer told
me to, I’m saying it because I made this mistake when I learned about
energy healing. I stopped going to doctors, I canceled all my insurance
and years later I regretted it. My life would have been easier had I
used both like I do now, and I don’t want you to make the same mistake,
but I am really excited to teach you about energy healing and help you
find that balance. So the first rule of energy healing is that healing
is natural. Life is naturally healing and organizing and moving toward
coherency. Your body knows how to heal itself. If you clear the energy
miracles can happen. This can be on a small scale, like back pain or a
headache. Oftentimes if you clear the energy you’ll get instant relief.
Or this can be on a larger scale with some acute physical symptoms. I’ll
tell you kind of a fun story. My daughter when she was little, my
daughter, Mariah, she was walking between me and her mom and she walked
right into a pole and it had a little screw on it it just went right
into her forehead, and so right away she had a bump starting to form and
a little cut there that was red, and her mom and I both did energy
healing. So we just sat her down, got on my knee, and just said, you
know, started doing a little bit of energy healing and I didn’t really
know what to do, but I just asked myself what needs to happen here. And
so just intuitively I started kind of moving my hand, pulling out the
energy that said there was an injury, imagining I was kind of stitching
it up with some little energy thread and so on. And within a couple
minutes, the bump went away, the red was gone and there was just like a
tiny line there, where you could see that she’d been hit. So it was
amazing, and this is when I realized how easy healing can be. Anyone can
do this, just imagine that you know how. And in the moment when you need
it, you’ll find that clarity of just, what can I do to help? And the
answer will just come to you, it’s really easy. So if healing is natural
like this, what goes wrong? What’s the number one reason that we
struggle with healing and personal growth? Why don’t we keep up with our
fitness programs and our diets and healing sessions and personal growth
programs? The reason is we don’t know how to handle the growth that
comes from rapid healing. This is why we stagnate our growth. This is
why we drop out of the programs which can help us the most. So how many
of you have taken a new exercise program or a new diet and then felt
fantastic at first and swore that you’ll continue it for life. And you
were so excited and so committed and then two to three months in you
hate it and you drop out, how many times have you done that? I know I
have. So why did this happen? Well, your biggest growth period comes
when your biggest acceleration is occurring. We are great when we’re
feeling up, but we don’t know how to recover when we’re feeling down.
And understanding this can help you not burn out or drop out or blow up.
Energetically we call the situation a growth period. And let me give you
an example of a bad growth period or maybe I should say a normal growth
period, ’cause they’re usually pretty bad if we don’t handle them
energetically. So I was really interested in trying out yoga when I
lived in Denver, and I went for something extreme, some kind of an
extremist, so I went to Bikram Yoga, which is this super hot, sweaty
kind of power yoga, and I was gone just a little bit, you know, kind of
here and there, they were actually teasing me that I had the oldest
punch card anybody had ever see ’cause I had showed up so infrequently.
And then they put out a challenge and I love challenges. They said, if
you go six times a week for 10 weeks, it’ll change your life. And so I
signed right up, I got into it, and for the first few weeks I loved it,
it was fantastic. And then pretty quickly I started to hate it, I was
super angry about the heat, just wanted to kill somebody for not turning
on the fan, and I was just so, so frustrated and miserable, but you
know, I stuck with it and I finished the 10 weeks and I got great
results, but I never went again, like I never, ever wanted to do yoga
again, which is too bad ’cause it was really healthy. And a bad growth
period looks like this. First, you ask for personal growth when you’re
feeling good, and then the easy energy starts to release and you’re
feeling great. And then the stuck energy starts to release, and you get
grumpy and you get overwhelmed. And this is where we often make a big
mistake. We engage our analyzer to solve this. So we feel disappointed
or defensive, so we try to identify the culprit. Was it this person or
something on TV or my job or the doctor, that exercise instructor, then
we quit or attack the culprit, and we feel really self-righteous about
it. So we blame our partner or boss or teacher, etc. And unfortunately
this actually feels pretty good because we’re releasing some energy, so
we keep doing it. And this pattern really wreaks havoc on our body, this
frustration and struggle and illness, and that toxic energy really goes
into your body and your organs and so on, and we recover slowly at best
with a little regret and maybe some embarrassment when we’re out of the
growth period, does this sound familiar? So I’ve done this so many times
and I’m sure you have to, and this can happen with personal growth
programs too. So let’s look a little deeper at what are the results of a
growth period like this? So in general your life gets more difficult
with big ups and downs. You reinforce your pain instead of releasing it,
your body gets sick because this unreleased energy is toxic to your
physical body. It’s stored in your organs and tissues and hormones, and
you get more colds and flues and immune disorders and so on. Growth
periods can also damage your relationships with fights and breakups and
communication shutdowns and so on. Your strong energy leads to really
strong words and hurt feelings, And unfortunately you can’t take these
words back, and it’s difficult for people to trust you and to like you
again, you’re in that negative feedback loop and you’re spreading your
pain, we’ve all done this. Now, fortunately there is a better way, and
this works for simple grumpiness or full on illness. First, just
remember that this is just energy, it’s just pain and confusion, it
wants to come out and it wants to be healed. Personal growth doesn’t
have to be difficult, if you’re in this class you really need to learn
this because you are seeking growth. And I should warn you though that
the process is simple, but it’s not easy. So even after I tell you now
you won’t want to do it. So I’m going to ask you first, can you commit
to handling your growth periods differently? This will powerfully change
your life if you apply it. Yes? No? I’ll take that as a yes. So here’s
my process for handling a growth period. Step one, stop analyzing and
blaming. This will reduce your negative energy and your negative
thoughts. You can stop analyzing because your growth period is not about
what you think. Your brain can’t see the big picture, it sees the
details. So you’re just driving yourself crazy. I’m still impressed by
how badly I can fool myself when I’m upset. You can stop looking for
someone or something to blame. Blame always sends you down a negative
energy spiral. So remember, it’s not your fault, it’s not someone else’s
fault, you’re simply dealing with moving a lot of energy. I remember a
great insight from Jack Groverland at the Unity of Boulder, someone
asked him, why do bad things happen to good people? And he said, they
don’t, bad things happen to all people. I thought that’s a good point.
So why not learn how to deal with them in a healthy way. Step two, stop
talking about it. Stop spreading your pain and confusion. Stop talking
about what you think the problem is. Stop emailing, texting, and posting
on social media about it. It’s just your pain and confusion talking.
Even if you’re 100% sure you’re right, this is the simplest way to avoid
wreaking havoc in your life. Now, I admit it, this can be hard, I like
to process verbally myself, and I’ve paid the price for the stupid
things I’ve said. So don’t be like me. Remember, your answers will come
from inside and you need to be quiet to hear them. Step three, admit
you’re in a growth period. This creates neutral ground. When you notice
yourself feeling this way, just admit it out loud, tell people I’m
grumpy today, or I’m sick or I’m having a rough day, please don’t take
me too seriously. And people will give you a break, they can relate, and
have compassion for yourself, you’ll start feeling better already. Step
four is to run your energy. Now I’ll teach you this soon, this is an
energy tool for shifting yourself into the positive flow of energy. When
you run your earth and cosmic energy, you give the stuck energy
somewhere to release to, this revitalizes your physical and energy
bodies and speeds up your healing process. This is the fastest way I
know to shift into the positive flow if you remember it. Usually I
resist for a long time, I just feel kind of grumpy, and then finally I
remember, oh yeah, I have energy tools, I start to run my energy, and
five minutes or 10 minutes or 20 minutes later, everything is okay. All
you have to do is focus on healing yourself until the energy shifts out
of that negative state into a positive state. You’ll feel relief instead
of feeling grumpy and you start finding a deeper understanding. And
you’ll know when you can stop running your energy because you’ll hit
step five. And step five is gratitude and amusement. Congratulations,
you’ve made it, Whoo. You’re feeling lighter. You’re feeling gratitude
and amusement. Now you’re feeding the positive energy loop. It’s safe
again to talk to other people, you can share your gold and your insights
and your mistakes and your learning. Whoo, I really thought it was all
about blah, blah, blah, but it turns out it wasn’t about that at all.
It’s also time to apologize if needed, to be humble and authentic. I’m
feeling better, I’m so sorry I was a pain in the ass , but here’s what I
learned. And keep in mind, however, that other people might be in a
growth period now too, you might’ve caused a chain reaction. So you
feeling better doesn’t mean that they should feel better. Like they may
not have the same energy tools. So be patient and have compassion. And
we’ll talk more later about other people’s growth periods as well. But
first you have to learn to have a healthy growth period for yourself. So
let’s review the process. A big energy starts to release and you feel
grumpy and overwhelmed, so then you just be aware and cautious, warning,
I’m toxic, warning, warning. You stop analyzing and blaming and stop
that negative energy loop for yourself. And then you stop talking at
step two, stop the negative loop for others. Step three, you admit your
growth period and create neutral ground. Step four, you run your energy,
which starts the positive loop for yourself. And step five, you find
gratitude and amusement, and that starts the positive loop for others
too. Like I said, it’s simple, even if it’s not easy, but this will
change your life. Today I’d like you to notice any growth periods around
you, either in yourself or in other people, and notice your natural
habits. What do you do when you get grumpy or overwhelmed? Do you blame
or argue or shut down or punish someone or something else? And then use
the tools that you already have, ground yourself, turn down your
analyzer, get into your higher mind, it’ll help you observe your habits.
Also notice what do you do when other people get grumpy or overwhelmed?
You try to fix them, you try to avoid them, do you just blame them? Do
you feel superior or something else? Now again, don’t judge yourself,
just be aware of your habits. I’ll give you more energy tools to help
you next time, so just find a little compassion today. Enjoy.

LESSON 14: How to Energize & Clear Your Body

<v ->Welcome back, give yourself a deep breath. And as we begin, please
remember your grounding. Relax into the center of your head and say
hello to the group energy. And the smiles and hellos to all your fellow
students and feel the group energy and intention supporting you. Good,
today let’s talk about running your energy for clearing and energizing
your body. Of course, you already know your physical body has
circulation channels like blood and spinal fluid and lymph and even your
lungs and these carry away waste and replenish your nutrients. Your
energy body has circulation channels too. We see these in acupuncture or
chi from eastern medicine and they also carry away waste and replenish
your energy or replenish your light. So what determines your health and
longevity and vitality? It’s how much and how easily energy is flowing
through you. Let me tell you a funny story, so when I was 28, I was kind
of obsessed with longevity and I was always working out energetically.
And what I was doing is I was looking for that body clock in the cells,
I told the cells you’re getting older and I was trying to disconnect it
or slow it down, somehow change the body clock. And I was also pumping
light directly into the cells to see if I get energized them, kind of
rejuvenate them. And I didn’t tell anybody, I was just messing around.
And I went into my chiropractor who I’d been seeing for about six months
and I didn’t realize that she was clairvoyant too. And she told me one
day, she said, “I have to tell you something kind of funny and I don’t
usually tell people about this but,” she said, “I see the energy in the
body.” I’m kind of smiling and she said, “And something’s different in
you ’cause I don’t know what’s going on, but I think you’re going to
live for a long time.” I was kind of smiling and she said, “I don’t mean
normal long time, I mean, like a really weirdly long time.” And I kind
of chuckled and I asked her “Why?” and she said, “Your cells are slowing
down and I’ve been watching you for the last six months and to be honest
I don’t even know why you’re still alive.” She said, “The only thing I
can guess is it looks like you’re pumping light directly into cells and
you’re feeling that way.” And I just started laughing and I said, “Oh,
Maryanne, you’re right, that’s exactly what I’m doing.” And this was
really validating because she could see what I was doing energetically,
it was really fun. Now, of course, now I’m in my early 50s and I’m kind
of enjoying getting older. I’m healthy, but I’m not obsessed with youth
anymore, but I do still love to run my energy and to play with the cells
and so on. So the first energy channel that we work with here is called
Earth energy. It’s a loop of energy which connects your body to the
Earth. So remember your grounding cord goes from your root chakra down
to the center of the Earth. So energy also comes up from the Earth and
into your body. It goes in through your feet chakras and up your legs
and through your knees and up into your root chakra, near the base of
your spine. And this is really clearing and energizing for your root
chakra. And the excess energy just goes right back down the grounding
cord. So let me say that one more time, I want you to really feel it as
I describe it. First, notice your grounding cord and notice that energy
at the center of the Earth, feel it coming up into your feet chakras,
you can kind of open them like they’re little flowers in the bottom of
your feet, the Earth energy travels upward filling your legs, cleaning
out your knee chakras, all the way up into your root chakra at the base
of your spine. Then it turns around and goes right back down the
grounding, this simple energy loop has great benefits. Earth energy
helps validate and heal the physical body, it improves health and
vitality, helps you feel even more present and grounded and it speeds
your body’s natural healing. Earth energy also keeps the root chakra
really clean, which is great for money and health issues. You feel
grounded and light together, not heavy or dragging. The second big
energy channel is Cosmic energy. So it connects your body to the higher
realms. So see if you can feel it as I describe it. Cosmic energy comes
from the cosmos, so just summer up there, anywhere is fine. Goes in the
top of your head, energizing the crown chakra, goes down the back of
your head, all the way down the back to the root chakra. And then it
makes a U-turn and it comes up the front of the body, all the way at the
center of the body. A little Cosmic energy flows down each arm and out
the hands. And some also continues up the front of the head and then
just out the crown chakra and showers down all around you in all
directions and this is cleansing the aura. The Cosmic energy also has
many benefits, it’ll clean your energy body, like a circulatory system.
It’d be less grumpy, less fatigue, more energy. You’re going with the
flow and it’s easier. Cosmic energy can supercharge your vitality and
energize your body. You feel energized and alive and inspired, you can’t
really overdo it with Cosmic energy. So I’ve got a funny story, when I
was in Sedona, I met this guy named Jesse, he was in his 80s and he came
over to our house and he noticed that my roommate Ken had this dumbbell
set out and he had 40 pound dumbbells, Ken, is this really burly guy.
And Jesse this 80 year old, he said, “Oh, this looked pretty heavy,
let’s see what the old man can do.” And he picks up 40 pounds in each
arm and he busts out like 16 sets of curls with 40 pound dumbbells. I
couldn’t believe it. Now, of course he was sweating, but he put them
down and he said, “Okay, why did I do that?” He said, “I didn’t do that
to show you that I’m this burly old guy.” He said, “Cause, I’m not.” He
said, “I did that to teach you about energy. The way I was running my
energy allows even this old body to be full of strength and vitality.”
The next weekend I was back country snowboarding up in Silverton,
Colorado. And a group of us are all hiking with snowboards in our backs
and boots in the pack and they were up at about 13,000 feet. And I
started getting tired because this is hard work and then I remember
Jesse and I thought, “Oh, let me practice what he taught me.” So I
started running my energy more and filling myself up energetically and
all of a sudden my fatigue goes away and I feel totally energized. And
I’m running up to the front of the line and talking to my friends,
running back to the back and talking to my other friends and laughing
and my friend Daniel finally says, “What is wrong with you? Are you just
in incredibly good shape or something?” And I started laughing, I said,
“No, no, I’m probably in the same shape as you, but I know about
energy.” And this is just a fun example, when you start playing with
energy in your life, that’s when it really feels real to you. Now,
running more energy also means more impact and more creativity. You can
run more energy for improved healing and kind of speed things up in your
body, you get less achy or creaky in the body, Running Earth and Cosmic
energy this way also helps you feel grounded and clear and energized.
And it can’t harm you, even if someone tells you, “Don’t run your energy
that way, or you’ll hurt yourself,” don’t believe it, I’ve run energy
every way you can imagine and I’ve never hurt myself. I’ve had some
funny results, I’ve never been harmed. So of course it’s totally okay If
you want to keep with another teaching and run your energy differently.
This is just the way that I was taught and it’s always worked for me.
Okay, let’s try it. Get into real exposition and ready to meditate. Just
let it be easy and feel the energy. Don’t worry about perfection. All
right, so it’d be right behind your eyes and breathe your eyes closed.
Focus your attention in the center of your head. Feel all your energy
coming back to you in present time. Think of a growth period, some
frustration or grumpiness that you’ve been in this month. And turn down
your analyzer and let it be okay that you don’t know how to fix it.
Good. Now, move your awareness to the higher mind, a little up and a
little back. And detach from any blame or negative thoughts. Remember
your grounding connecting you to the center of the Earth and feel that
flow and feel that flow going down from your root chakra into the Earth.
Stay in your body and feel the Earth energy flowing below you. Open your
feet chakras and feel that energy coming up into your feet, into your
lower legs and into your knees and all the way up your legs into the
root chakra. And just imagine the energy is filling up that root chakra,
like water filling up a bowl. Very good. Let the Earth energy completely
fill this root chakra, giving your physical body all the power and
strength and stability it needs today. When you’re 100% full, let the
overflow go right down your grounding. Notice any worry, fear and pain,
and just give it permission to be carried away by the Earth energy. And
let that Earth energy keep running automatically without any attention
from you. Good. Now, focus your attention gently in the center of your
head, feel your crown chakra like a crown or halo on top of your head.
Feel the Cosmic energy entering the crown chakra activating the crown.
Breathe and feel that Cosmic energy running down the back of the body
all the way down the back into the root chakra, the base of the spine.
Feel it turn and come right back up the front of the body, right in the
center, all the way up into your head and then showering out the crown
chakra in all directions around you. Good. And then notice some of the
Cosmic energy dividing at the neck, going down each arm and out the
hands right out of those hand chakras. And now try turning that Cosmic
energy up by about 20%. Try and turning it up to 50% stronger, 100%
stronger or more. Give your energy body permission to drink in all the
energy it needs. When you’re full, feel the extra energy picking up any
foreign energy which is ready to release, just carrying it out of your
body. Remember your growth period and give permission for it to be
carried away in the Cosmic energy. Breathe. Feel the energy release.
Feel your frustration and confusion release. Feel any leftover blame
releasing. Let your entire growth period release right now and get
carried away by the Cosmic and Earth energies. Let’s your awareness be
gently in the center of your head. Feel the Earth and Cosmic energy
flowing effortlessly through you and leave it turned on to keep
proactively healing your physical body and energy body. Smile and say,
“I love my health and vitality.” Give yourself a deep breath and open
your eyes. Wow, how are you feeling? Hope it’s clear and energized and
less stress and lighter. Did you feel any anger, anxiety, or discomfort
or pain? Sometimes we feel things as they release and that’s okay, just
let them go, don’t hang onto them or resist, just give yourself
permission to release easily. Do you remember your commitment to handle
growth differently? Now you know how. The big question is, will you do
it? Only you can stop yourself from growing gracefully. You no longer
have an excuse, so when you’re down, I want you to see my face saying,
“There’s no excuse, do the five steps, run your energy ,” and then
laughing. You only have three choices for dealing with stuck energy.
One, let it stay inside you and make yourself sick. Two, let it out
unconsciously and spread your pain to others. And three, let it out
consciously and gracefully with the five steps and running your energy.
So which will you choose? Please remember this choice. Today let your
Earth and Cosmic energy keep it running in your body and notice how this
helps you keep up with your growth today. Ideally, if we’re running our
Earth and Cosmic energy, we’ll avoid any big growth periods, but that’s
not always possible. So I’m giving you two open-ended meditations that
you can use any time you find yourself in a big growth period, both
meditations start with grounding and getting present and then running
your Earth and Cosmic energy. And then you have plenty of time to work
on your own and I come back after 30 minutes or 60 minutes to gently
guide you out in the meditation. And these are just bonus meditations
for anytime you need that extra help, these are not daily meditations.
Great, so have fun today running your Earth and Cosmic energy. I know
you’ll feel the difference, enjoy.

LESSON 15: Heal Yourself With Energy

<v ->Welcome back, give yourself a deep breath. And as we begin, please
remember your grounding. Relax into the center of your head and notice
your earth and cosmic energy running. Say hello to the group energy and
send smiles and hellos to your fellow students, and feel the group
energy and intention supporting you. And so far, we’ve been learning
about prevention, which is great, but what if you’re already sick? Then
I recommend you augment your traditional treatments with energy work.
Again, please don’t try to replace your treatments with energy work.
Western medicine is really powerful, and Eastern medicine is really
powerful, and herbal medicine is really powerful, and energy medicine is
too. Energy work can augment all of these. Being anti-anything is not a
healing solution. It’s adding resistance and problems. For many years I
was anti-medicine. I treated everything myself and this was a mistake.
I’ve seen powerful healing come from things I once judged like surgery
and traditional medicine. A wise person uses all the useful tools. So
let’s take a look at the main energy tools for self-healing. First one
is getting your space. So grounding, center of head, turning down your
analyzer. This just helps you be present and balanced so you’re not
resisting your natural healing. And number two, you clear your growth
period. Which is running your energy from the Earth energy and Cosmic
energy, because it’s very hard to heal yourself when you’re in a growth
period. And the third is channeling healing energy into your body. And
you can do this with your healing energy channel, or an energy ball, or
with hands-on healing. So let’s talk more about your healing and
creative energy channel. It has two different purposes, but it’s the
same energy channel. So how do they work? First you start by pulling in
energy from the earth healing grid, which is all around the planet. And
this is available to anyone, anytime. Attach yourself to an end of this
healing grid right now. You might feel it like charged energy, like an
aurora, or as a vibration, or a white or a blue light, or just a deep
yummy feeling, or a gold lattice of light all around the planet. That’s
how I see it. However you feel it, you simply tap into that energy and
let it flow naturally into the top of your head, your crown chakra, down
the back of your head to your neck and then down each arm and out the
hands. Right out the hand chakras. To practice feeling this you can face
your hands together and let a ball of healing energy build up between
your palms. Try it right now. You’ll know it’s running when you can feel
it. And then you just direct the energy into the body. So you put your
hands on your body or someone else, and just let the healing energy
continue to flow through you from the healing grid down into your hands
and into your body. So hopefully you’re feeling it already, but let’s
keep practicing with our eyes open. So if you’re not feeling it yet
between your hands, just stretch your hands open a few times like this,
that’ll help open your hand chakras, and then relax, take a deep breath,
and let that energy buildup between your palms. Now people usually feel
this as a tingling, or a pressure, or heat, or even motion right there
between your hands. Good. Looks like most people are starting to feel
it. So just keep that energy building and think of one place in your
body where you could use some healing. Go ahead and close your eyes, and
notice if the energy changed when you closed your eyes. Sometimes it’ll
amp up and get stronger. And just turn your analyzer off. Ground
yourself. Feel the earth and cosmic energy is still running. Good. And
turn your hands now and press that ball of energy into the place in your
body where you want some healing right now. Keep breathing, and feel the
healing energy continuing to channel from the healing grid into your
head, down and out your hands, continuing to blast away at any disease,
or stuck energy, or resistance. And as it does, the energy releasing is
automatically going into your cosmic energy loop and getting carried
away. This is important. You don’t want to just move the energy around
in your body, you want it to move out of the body. And the cosmic energy
gives this energy somewhere to go. It can also release right down your
grounding. That’s fine too. Just feel the energy moving through you. And
notice one more place in your body, somewhere you didn’t consciously
intend, it’s also receiving healing energy as you do this. And just hold
it there one more moment. Give your body permission to continue healing
itself. Good. So you can relax your hands or keep them on your body.
Either way is okay. And open your eyes. Great. So how are you feeling?
Could you feel the healing energy running? My hands actually vibrate as
it’s running through me. That’s how I know when to stop, because my
hands stop vibrating. Could you feel your body receiving the healing
energy? It’s subtle, but with practice you’ll feel it more and more
clearly. Energy healing can be this simple. With energy healing
sometimes you see dramatic instant results. You might surprise yourself.
Like my daughter Maria’s forehead healing. Or I had a friend at work,
Scott, one time who asked me for a healing. And it was kind of funny. He
didn’t believe in energy work, but he was having some problems, so he
said, “Oh, you offered. I think I’ll try it out.” And he sat down in the
chair and I didn’t tell him what I was doing but I went around behind
him. He had a bunch of chakra cords in the back of his chakras, and I
just gently grabbed them all and let them release. And he arched back
like, “Ah, what happened?” He couldn’t even see me, but he instantly
felt the release. And I just told him, “Oh, I’m just clearing some
energy.” And later he told me that he often found himself in strange
situations and wondered how he ended up there, happening his whole life.
And I said, “Oh, well, all these cords in your back makes you look kind
of like a little puppet just being moved around by these energies.” Kind
of fascinating. And it changed for him. And so sometimes it can be very
fast like that. But of course, sometimes energy healing is slow and
heals things in layers just bit by bit over a long period of time. And
when this happens, and it happens to me too, try to be patient and just
keep at it. You’re not failing. Energy moves very quickly, but your
physical body takes a little more time, moves more slowly. It’s
important though to be open to miracles, either from prayer, or energy
healing, or meditation, or just your intention. And be okay that the
healing might not always happen how and when you want it to. So let’s
look at some of the benefits and applications of this energy ball. It
builds your energy awareness. Feeling is believing. It clears your hand
chakras and improves your sensitivity. It gathers energy for healing,
and you can use it for creative projects too. Think of it as channeling
raw creativity. Creativity and healing are actually the same thing. You
can create an energy ball and send energy into your creative projects.
This is great. Anything you’re working on with your hands, or if you’re
on the computer, this is a great practice. And of course, please
remember that energy work and traditional medicine are most powerful
when used together. Just run your energy to stay healthy, and channel
energy into your body as needed. Clear out the fear and resistance from
your body. Just push light into the body and release the fear. And you
can also channel energy and intention into your medicine and just
visualize the outcome you desire. It’s kind of fun. So just be creative
with this. You can create your own healing methods. Just work on finding
that energy that’s the perfect solution or perfect cure for you. And as
always be patient. I know you can heal yourself. It’s also great to use
energy work with medical procedures. You just set the energy before the
medical procedure and ground your room, ground yourself, ground the
doctors, ground the table, and this will help clear any fear and
resistance from your body too. And then fill your body in the room with
healing energy and light, and just visualize that outcome that you
desire. I also like to ask a friend to hold space for procedures like
this. They just sit and run their energy lightly, just during the
procedure. There’s no effort, just running their energy. And this really
helps keep the energy in the room clean as well, even if they’re far
away doing this during your procedure. And finally remember to clear
your growth period after the procedure. I had quite a few clients in
Sedona who had a chemotherapy treatment, and they would come afterwards
and we would clear the energy out. So it looked kind of like little dots
or like a little static energy in their aura, and we would just clear
that remaining chemo energy out because they didn’t need it anymore. And
it would really help with their recovery times. They said big difference
from clearing the energy after and not clearing energy after. So these
are the tools for healing yourself with energy. I’d like you to get in
the habit of running your energy and healing your body every day. To
make this easy you have a new practice meditation which includes
everything you’ve learned so far: grounding, mental clarity, running
your energy, and healing yourself. It’s about 11 minutes. And I
recommend you use it once a day and then just leave your energy running.
Just let this be easy. Now, hopefully your energy is already running
right now, but if you need to top it off you can use this meditation
later today. So have fun running your energy and healing your body.
Enjoy.

- Focus on a point across the room where your eyes rest naturally. Be right behind your eyes and breathe your eyes closed. Bring your attention to the center of your head. Feel all your energy coming back to you in present time. Turn down your analyzer and let your mind relax. Bring your awareness up and back into that peaceful place of the higher mind. Let yourself detach from any negative thoughts or any blame that you're feeling today. Remember your grounding. Stay in your body and feel the earth energy beating beneath you. Imagine you can open your feet and breathe that earth energy into your legs. Feel it filling up your lower legs. Feel it moving around in your knees, finding the perfect balance for your body. Feel it pouring into your root chakra near the base of the spine, giving your physical body all the power and strength and stability it needs today. When you're 100% full, feel the overflow going back down your grounding cord into the earth. Notice any tension or pain in your body. Give it permission to release out of your body, down your grounding, into the earth. Notice any worries you have about money or health or dying. Let these energies release down your grounding, into the earth. Breathe. Focus your attention again in the center of your head. Feel your crown chakra on top of your head like a crown or a halo. Feel the cosmic energy coming in from above and activating your crown chakra. Breathe. Bring the cosmic energy all the way down your back to the base of your spine. Invite that energy to turn your root chakra and come back up the front of your body. Feel the energy going all the way up the front of the body, through your head, and showering out your crown chakra in all directions. Feel that energy flowing all the way down the aura and into your grounding. At your neck, notice the cosmic energy dividing and going into each shoulder, down your arms, and out your hands. Let your cosmic energy flow at 100% volume through your body. Give your body permission to drink in all the energy it needs. When you're full, feel the extra energy picking up any foreign energy which is ready to release and carrying it out of your body. Breathe. Be in the center of your head. As your arms charge up with cosmic energy, notice your creative and healing energy channels automatically engaging. Feel healing energy flowing down from the healing grid around the planet, into your crown chakra, down your neck, down your arms, and out your hands. Wake up your hand chakras by opening and closing your palms. Breathe. Face your palms toward each other and begin collecting energy between your hands. Move them closer and further apart. As the energy builds, notice any sensations in your palms, tingling, pressure, or heat. What does this energy feel like to you? Notice where in your body this energy is needed today. As you think of this place in your body, notice the ball of energy getting stronger. Feel it pulsing between your hands. When you have a nice strong ball of creative energy, send it into your body in the place that needs it most. Breathe. Feel this light penetrating into your body, healing and pushing out any foreign energy. Feel that foreign energy getting carried away automatically by your cosmic and earth energy. Continue channeling energy into that place in your body. Feel it getting warmer and healing itself. Smile and be grateful that you're healing your own body. Breathe. Relax your hands and let your awareness be in the center of your head. Feel the earth and cosmic energy flowing effortlessly through you. Feel it proactively healing your entire physical body and energy body. Say, "I love my bright energy. "I love my health and vitality." Give yourself a deep breath and open your eyes.

====================

LESSON 16: Deepen Your Healing Powers

<v ->Welcome back, give yourself a deep breath. And as we begin, please
remember your grounding, relax into the center of your head. Notice your
Earth and Cosmic energy running and say hello to the group energy. Send
smiles and hellos to your fellow students and feel the group energy and
intention supporting you. Great. One of my favorite questions that I
hear in so many forms is how do I keep my energy clean and balanced
forever? Now I always think this is funny because we all know that our
physical body requires maintenance. If we’re really tired, we sleep
more. If our hair is getting dirty, we take a shower. If we’re out of
shape, maybe we exercise or change our diet. And this seems totally
normal, yet we forget to maintain our emotions and our energy too. Just
like your physical body, your energy body requires maintenance. If
you’re not present, you need to ground. If you can’t focus, you need to
move into the center of the head or clear your mind. If you’re feeling
grumpy, you want to run your energy. You can’t stay perfectly centered
forever. This is unrealistic. It’s like asking, how do I take a shower
so well that I never need to shower again, right? That’s absurd for the
physical body and for your energy body too. You require maintenance.
Life will knock you off your center sometimes. But fortunately, you’re
learning how to get centered again, that’s the purpose of learning these
energy tools. For today’s meditation, I want to lead you on a guided
journey to explore your Earth and Cosmic energy more deeply, and to
visit the Earth’s healing grid. You’ll explore where you’re pulling
these energies from and see if there’s an update available for you. The
Earth has been changing pretty quickly since 2012, grounding into a new
location can help you detach from your old thinking and old social
constructs. This journey will also help you feel more comfortable and
powerful running his energies. And when the meditation ends, you’ll see
a few suggestions for sharing your experience with the group. This helps
anchor your experience more deeply. So get comfortable and ready to
meditate. And let’s begin. Go ahead and close your eyes. Give yourself a
deep breath. Just kind of relax and be present right behind the eyes.
And for now, just notice that grounding, that is your Earth energy, that
is your Cosmic energy And just be really relaxed and present in the
body. Okay, and as you remember your grounding, feel it connecting your
root chakra down into the Earth. And just let yourself follow that
grounding energy as it flows downward from your body and feel yourself
starting to sink slowly down into the Earth. And breathe. Just feel
yourself going deeper and deeper into the Earth. And arriving right at
the center of the Earth. And feel the Earth welcoming you. And notice,
where are you drawing your Earth energy from right now? Where in the
center of the Earth is that energy coming to you? And very simply just
ask, is there another place that’s more powerful for me, that’s stronger
or healthier for me to draw my Earth energy from? Just let the Earth
show you this place. You might light up. You might feel where it is And
just right now, just move yourself to that place, that new place in the
center of the Earth. Now I want you to look down at your feet in the
center of the Earth and notice that there’s a little shape or a symbol
right there beneath you. Just set your intention to ground your body
directly into this symbol in the center of the Earth And breathe. Feel
how that changes. What’s different about this place, this center of the
Earth energy for you. Okay, now just let yourself be in the center of
your head, very simply. And feel that Earth energy flowing up from that
symbol and into your feet, Open your feet to receive that new Earth
energy, and just feel it filling your legs, filling up that root chakra,
and activating you with that perfectly tuned Earth energy. Very good.
And just feel the overflow going right down that grounding cord, right
into that symbol, in the center of the Earth. And breathe. Now, from the
center of your head, I want you to remember the Cosmic energy flowing,
feel it flowing in from above, down the back of the body, into that root
chakra. And feel it flowing up the front of the body, down and out each
arm and out the hands. And then out the top of the head. And move your
awareness to the top of your head, right where the Cosmic energy is
coming into you. Just imagine that you’re getting lighter and lighter,
and you’re going to start to float up that stream of energy up into the
sky And just breathe. And notice yourself continuing up, further and
further into the sky. Until you arrive at the source of your Cosmic
energy. And just feel universe welcoming you there. And notice where it
is for you. Are you on a planet somewhere? Are you in the stars? It
might be in the center of the universe. Where do you pull your Cosmic
energy from? And see if you can notice, why is this place special for
you? Now notice, is there a different place that would be even more
powerful for you right now? Reach out with your awareness, see or feel
that place lighting up And move your awareness to that new place, that
new source of Cosmic energy for you. And breathe. And in this new place,
wherever it is, it might just feel completely abstract, that’s okay.
You’re going to notice the shape or a symbol in this place. And set your
intention to draw your Cosmic energy directly from this symbol and into
your body And breathe. Be in the center of your head again. Feel the
Cosmic energy flowing from that symbol toward you. And give yourself
permission to fully receive this energy in your body. Feel it flowing
down your back, up the front of your body, and out your hands. Feel it
flowing out the top of the head and showering out in directions. And
just notice, how does this Cosmic energy feel different to you? Okay,
now be aware of that Cosmic energy and Earth energy flowing through the
body. And just give him permission to be on automatic, to continue
rejuvenating you, continue healing you. Let your body have full
permission to receive this Earth and Cosmic energy. Okay, good. Now I
want to go one more place. So feel that healing energy building up
between your palms, just put your palms together. And from the center of
your head, notice, where is that healing energy coming to you? Watch
yourself start to drift upward, into that healing energy above. I want
you to find that place that you already occupy on that healing grid
around the planet. Feel yourself sitting on that healing grid. Feel all
that powerful energy coming through you. And from that healing grid,
just imagine you can look down at your body, and see that powerful
energy, that powerful healing grid energy going directly down into the
top of your head and out into the hands. And just notice how familiar
this feels. You already have a place on the healing grid that’s just
right for you. And breathe. Let yourself be the center of your head
again. Decide where you want to send that healing energy into your body,
or into a project, and just send it out from you right now. And give
yourself permission to draw this healing energy anytime you need from
that healing grid, to heal yourself and to heal others. Let it be easy
and comfortable for you. And breathe. Okay, now just go ahead and
stretch your body a little bit. Wiggle your hands and your feet. When
you’re ready, open your eyes.

LESSON 17: Exercises and Applications - Running Energy

<v ->Welcome back. Give yourself a deep breath. Remember your grounding
cords. Remember the center of your head. Remember your Earth and Cosmic
energy running, and let your body begin to heal. It can be this easy to
run healing energy, just remember. Today is our final talk on healing
your body and channeling energy. And you’re looking pretty shiny
already, but I want to give you some exercises and ideas for further
working with your energy and everyday life. I’d also like to answer a
few of the most common questions that I’ve been asked over the years.
But first, I want to thank you for sharing your success stories. I want
to read you a few of my favorites. So this one comes from Milan, says,
“Last night’s class was awesome. Even though a larger part of me
believes in energy work, the engineer analyst part of me still has some
skepticism. And during the class I work to heal the lower back pain that
I always get after my gym workouts, amazingly 90% of the pain went away.
This morning I felt none of the usual pain when I bent down to feed the
cat, you’re starting to make me a hundred percent believer. Thank you.”
Yeah, that’s great. So, when you have an experience like this, this is
what makes energy work real for you. And I also use this kind of healing
on my back too. Anytime I feel a little back pain, it seems to just move
it right out. We’ll talk about it loose, a little bit more in the chakra
chapters. Okay. Here’s another one. This is from Katie, she says, “Wow,
what a fantastic class. I felt so much energy and love. My knee pain is
completely gone and my son was able to move his neck for the first time
in a week after a neck sprain. Absolutely amazing.” These are real
student stories, but everyone has different results. If you’re not
feeling the energy, don’t worry. Many people don’t feel energy right
away. You’re not doing anything wrong. Even if you can’t feel it, your
intention is increasing your Cosmic energy flow. Just trust the process.
We’re only three chapters in. We had five to go. When I look at the
group energy, the energy is starting to smooth out and get faster and a
little bit easier for the growth you’re having. And personal growth is
kind of like going to the gym. If you do too much too soon, you’re going
to be in a little bit of pain. So, just take it easy, go at a good pace.
It gets easier as you build up your strength. I’ll make it as fun as
possible, but you still have to do the work. Now, a few of you are still
overthinking too. I want you to try to relax the analyzer and everything
will get easier. Don’t think, or try too hard. Just follow the energy.
Today I want you to play with the energy ball. Just kind of let it build
up between your hands, and notice how much energy can you build up. What
does the energy feel like to you? And are you getting more sensitive?
Just play with this throughout the day and then experiment with
different ways to use this energy ball. You can use it for self healing,
like we practiced before. You can use it for healing others. It’s the
same way, just build it up between your hands and then place your hands
on their body and feel the healing energy continuing to run in through
your crown, down your arms, at your hands and into their body. This is a
great way to do healing for others. You can use this energy ball for
sending energy to your creative projects. So I might imagine the project
I’m working on right now with this Duality filming and just send energy
right from that energy ball into the project. And again, you just have
to be creative on how you’re going to send it and where you’re going to
send it to. You can use the energy ball for healing different places or
situations on the planet. If there’s some place that you feel called to
help out, just draw that healing light down through the back of your
crown chakra, down your neck and out your hands and build up that energy
ball and just send it out to that place in the planet that you want to
help heal. This really helps. Just be creative with it and you’ll find
all kinds of fun places to use this energy healing ball. Also, I want
you to watch out for growth period early warning signs. If your body
feels weak or achy, or you’re getting grumpy or impatient, or everyone
else looks like an incompetent idiot and you’re blaming people. Or if
you’re thinking, “I’ll show them”. These are all symptoms that a growth
period might be coming on. Maybe you’re writing a huge email where
you’re defending yourself or explaining yourself. Never send these
emails by the way, always clear the growth period first and then read it
again and you’ll find, “Okay, maybe that was a little bit too much.” If
you have these symptoms, remember to read my five steps for healing a
growth period, and then do the growth period meditation. If someone
around you, either a friend or a partner, a coworker, is having a growth
period, you can actually follow these same five steps. First, stop
blaming. It’s not their fault that they’re grumpy and it’s not yours.
Two, stop talking. You can assume that you don’t really understand. And
three, admit it. Are you having a bad day? And then just be patient.
Don’t take them too seriously. And number four, run your energy so that
you don’t match their growth period. Maybe offer them a healing or even
a hug. And five, find gratitude and amusement. You can laugh together
when it’s all over. Of course, please keep it running your energy every
day, even for a few minutes is okay. This is great for proactively
healing yourself. You don’t have to wait until you’re sick or in a big
growth period, you can run your energy anytime. Running energy is also
great for speeding up your physical healing. It clears out that
energetic waste and revitalizes and recharges your body. You can’t
overdo it. As I keep mentioning, running energy is great for healing a
growth period, improving your mood or shifting your understanding. You
can also practice building an energy ball with a friend. This is really
fun. Just create a little circle with them, it could be two people or
more, and just put your hand, your left hand up and your right hand
down, like this, above theirs, so two people standing together. And as
you run the energy, you’ll notice it running around through both of you.
It’s kind of fun. Just another way to make it real and notice, “Wow,
this energy thing is real.” And you can try switching the other
direction and notice the energy will change or bringing more people into
it too. This is really fun. Alright, the more you run your energy, the
more benefits you’ll see. Your body feels better and better. Your
relationship problems begin to fade away because you’re having healthy
growth periods. Your creative projects and work projects will benefit
too. Now I’ll explain in chapter five, why this happens, but for now, if
you’re feeling stuck at work, just ground yourself and run your energy
for four or five minutes, you’ll be surprised at the difference this
makes. Speaking of future chapters, we have so much more learning and
healing coming up. Chapter four is about energy boundaries, so you can
stop feeling like a sponge. Chapter five is about chakra healing for
your relationships and your business. And chapter six is about clearing
your beliefs, which is really about turning your world right side up.
Chapter seven is about intuition and timing, so you can be graceful and
effective with your decision-making. And chapter eight is about higher
self and guides, so tapping into that higher guidance. So all these
amazing things are coming up. All the work you do now will make those
chapters more powerful. So please keep practicing. I recommend doing a
slow deep practice once a day with the practice meditation, for example.
And then during the day, just remember your energy tools quickly, like
we do at the beginning of each video. And this will really help you
develop your skills more deeply with that slow practice and also make
them an easy habit with the fast practice. So have fun healing yourself
today. Remember the five steps. If you start feeling grumpy, remember to
share an energy ball with a friend, feeling is believing. Just have fun
and experiment. And remember you’re not in this alone, the group is
supporting your journey. Let’s end today’s session by connecting with
each other, sharing our progress and enthusiasm energetically. So go
ahead and take a deep breath and close your eyes. Feel everyone in the
Duality training. Present time, past students and future students too,
and send them all a hello right now. Let yourself receive all those
hellos. You are important part of this group. You are an important parts
of this group energy. Remember the center of your head. Notice your
Earth and Cosmic energy running and admire your own energy. From the
group, notice someone else’s energy that you also admire and try
matching it for yourself. How does it feel? Switch back to your own
energy now. Notice the bright, beautiful, bubble of energy around the
group, and ground that big group bubble. Energetically, put everything
you learned about running energy into that bubble. All your insides, all
your “Aha” moments, share them all with the group. And let yourself
absorb all that learning from everyone else in the group. Release any
stress, anxiety, or unanswered questions from this chapter, down that
big group grounding. Know that you are caught up energetically with
chapter three. Feel confident, relaxed, and clear, ready to keep growing
and learning. Notice your current intentions, for yourself in this
training, and put that into the group energy. Here’s mine. May our
energy be in alignment with each of our highest good. May I be a clear
channel for all energy and information. May we all have fun, grow and
feel great together. Send one more hello and smile to the group. You are
in the right place. On your next breath, open your eyes. Wow. That feels
great. The group energy is really growing beautifully. Just let that
group energy lift you through any difficult times you have, and you’ll
never feel left behind. Remember your practice today. Enjoy.

LESSON 17 - BONUS VIDEO: Energy healing fast start guide

- The good news is that everybody is a healer on an energy level. So inside you, there's a very powerful and amazing healer that knows how to take energy that's kind of confused or in this old unwanted pattern, knows how to change it into something that's really clear and create a new pattern or a healthy pattern in your life. In fact, you're doing this all the time. This is a big part of what personal growth is really about, is finding those patterns where things aren't working so well for you, learning some tools or techniques to adjust that, or I would say to heal that energy, and getting new results in your life. So as you learn techniques to adjust your energy and heal your energy, you going to move out of these old patterns. And you get to create new patterns in your life that are much more exciting and much more aligned with who you want to be and where you want to go in your life. And this is what I call energy healing. Let's look at some specific ways to start to engage that energy healer. And I like to call this the seven cycle healing method. And what you do when you're looking at energy is you want to go through a few cycles of attention with your energy. The first thing, is what I mentioned already, is you want to identify what the problem is. So this is the thing I'm working on. If it's physical, it's a little bit obvious. You know, I'm working on this cut or some pain in the body. If it's emotional or just a pattern you're trying to change in your life, you can still identify it. You can say, "I've got this pattern around money and that's the one I really want to change." So you know, you identify that. Second step is you give yourself permission to see what's really going on because these patterns are unconscious, and oftentimes, they're unconscious because there was some pain that happened and so now you've surrounded that whole event with a little unconscious energy to stop your attention from going there and getting in pain again. So healing is not always this kind of feel good journey, right? If you've got a deep pattern that's difficult for you, there's probably some difficulty in there. So you got to give yourself permission to experience that. It's okay. I'm going to go in, and I'm going to look deeper. And oftentimes, what you'll find is that when you go, look, you've grown up since you had that injury. Things that are traumatic when you're 10 years old don't seem as traumatic when you're a little bit older, from an adult perspective. You look back, "Yeah, I can see how that was traumatic, but I can kind of also see some of the other circumstances, and it's not as big a deal as it was back then." You'll find the same thing. So give yourself permission to really look at that honestly for yourself and find out what's happening inside. So the third part there is you're going to want to expand your awareness of this topic. So let's use this money example. So I've decided I'm going to focus on money. Why isn't my money going to where I want it to go? And then I'm giving myself permission to really see what's happening there. And then I'm going to let my awareness just kind of expand to what's the backstory, what could be happening? Just let that information come in. I might start to notice, "Oh, my uncle had a lot of money and my uncle was kind of a jerk. So I made an association somewhere that having money meant that I was going to be like my uncle, and I don't want to be like him 'cause he is kind of a jerk." I'm not talking about my uncle. This is a hypothetical story. And that association started that pattern, and it was unconscious, okay? So you get that awareness. Now, the next thing you want to do is you want to start moving that energy. So you want to say, "I am ready to let that go." I can see that that's unnecessary example there of... An unnecessary coupling of that energy and I'm ready to change it. So you start just imagining whatever comes to mind, whether you're working with your hands, imagining you're separating those things out, or maybe you're seeing your uncle and you're kind of like saying goodbye to him, or making two versions like the rich uncle and the jerk uncle and saying, "I want to be like this guy, but not this guy." Whatever comes to you. Remember, you've got this intelligence inside. You know how to do energy healing already. So now that you've done this healing work and got that information, you want to do a little expansion. So what I mean by that is you want to get the stuff that's nearby. So these energy patterns, they're not quite that cut and dry, right? So if you've got a pattern around money, it's not just because your uncle had money and he was a jerk. That might be the core thing or the thing you start with. There's going to be a lot of information around that that's built up over the years where you've sort of validated that or, you know, added new layers of information into that pattern. So you want to clean those up too. If you just get that first one, it's kind of like tipping over the dominoes. The others will start to fall, but it may take some time for your healing to complete. If you want your healing to go quickly or this change to go quickly, you want to look around, what are the other things? So you kind of expand your awareness and get the things that are nearby. In this case, with money, it might be as simple as, here's the all the people that I've thought about that I thought that person with money is a jerk. So I'm just going to kind of go through that list one by one. And as I'm expanding that list in my mind and exploring it, I'm just going to let go of that judgment on all those people, right? So I'm just going to expand that beyond that original source into all the energy that's around it. Now that I've done that, I want to release that energy. So I'm going to imagine some way where I'm going to take all that energy, all those people, all that judgment, all those decisions that I made that aren't serving me and I want to put that somewhere else outside of me. And what we're going to do here is we're actually going to create a little space for that to be like a little bubble outside of your aura. And you're going to imagine that you're just pushing that energy out into that bubble and then you're going to pop it and let it go. And this seems very abstract that you're just saying, "I want the energy to go out there and move." But you'd be really surprised that that's why energy moves in your life is because you want it to move. So when you're conscious of something and you give it somewhere to go, it can move very easily. This was a little bit different from resistance, right? If I resist something and I have to kill it or blow it up or somehow make that energy go away, that's very difficult. It's hard to stop energy, but it's very easy to move energy to a different place. So we're just going to move it out of your space, and we're just going to kind of pop it, which releases your attention from it and let it go somewhere else. As long as it's not bothering you. Then the the final step is that you want to get completion. So it's easy when you're doing healing work to get a little bit carried away and to get into a new cycle, which is I'm going to keep healing the same pattern over and over and over. And I've seen this because people get really excited. They've got a problem, they've been stuck in the cycle for a long time, and then they get empowered to change it. They use this energy healing, they change that pattern, and it's so exciting that they get a little buzz off of that change. So what they do is they recreate the same pattern, relive it again so they can change it again, 'cause they know how. And now, it's really the same pattern happening over and over. But the ending is, I got stuck and then I fixed it, and then I got stuck again and I fixed it. I got stuck again and I fixed it. So you don't want to get stuck in this healing cycle. What you want to do is complete. And that's a matter of just knowing that that's where you're going and your intention. So saying, "Okay, now that I got it, I've got everything that's there for today, and I'm finished for now. I don't need to think about this anymore. I don't need to obsess about it. I did a good job." You know, pat yourself on the back and then let it go. So I want to walk you through a guided meditation when you do this for yourself, that's the basic steps we're going to go through. And in the meditation, you are going to pick something in your life that you want to change. So think about that right now. Is there something you want to change that's in your personal life? Like something with your personality or some pattern there? Is there some pattern that you have in the body that you want to change? Maybe like an ache or a pain or some recurring tension you have somewhere? Or is it with your money or a relationship? Anything is okay that you want to work on for this meditation. And I encourage you to work on something that is important to you, but maybe not the biggest thing you've ever worked on in your life, right? 'Cause you're just starting, and to get success, you want to start with something where you can move the energy a little easier, kind of get yourself used to this energy healing. Once you've done it a few times with yourself, with other people, then you're ready for the big leagues. You're ready to go and hit those really big patterns that have been bothering you forever. But for now, pick something that you can succeed at. Something where it's not going to be too stressful for you and you really are okay and you're ready to change it. Okay, so think of that now and then join me in this meditation. So now that you have the thing that you want to work on, I want you to close your eyes. With your eyes closed, I want you to draw your energy and attention into your body right now. Just feel all your attention coming back from all of the times, places, people, and events. And just draw all your focus right now right behind your eyes. Okay, good. And now, think about the thing that you want to change. What is the pattern you want to work on right now in your life? Get really clear about that pattern. And ask yourself one question about that pattern. And this question is, is this really what you want to work on? Is there something a little bit deeper? Is this pattern representing something that's a little bit deeper? Could you go one step in? Okay, good. So we're going to work on that thing that just a little bit deeper thing than before. So give yourself permission to look at this. And when I say that, I want you to smile, and I want you to feel that energy of that smile 'cause your body kind of lights up, and it's a little more easy and graceful. And smiling is the same energy as permission. So think about that thing, that pattern you want to look at. Instead of judging it and thinking that there's something wrong with you or it's a bad pattern, I want you to smile and think, "It's just energy and I'm ready to change it." Okay, good. Now, I want you to open your awareness to receive information about what is this pattern about? Where did it come from? And as you do that, I want you to tune into your body. So notice, where in your body are you holding some tension or pain around this pattern? Even if you're working on something around work or your relationships, there's somewhere in your body where there's some tension related to that pattern. So notice where that is right now. Okay, good. So now that you have that area and you know where it is, we're going to dive a little deeper. What does that energy of that block or that pattern feel like in that area? Does it have a color to it? Is it dark or light? Is there a texture with it? Is it soft or kind of prickly? Or maybe it's cold or hot? Notice how that pattern makes you feel. Is it kind of funny, like an entertaining pattern? Or does it really make you angry? Or maybe there's a little sadness around this pattern? Just notice the emotions there. You're just tuning in to where's this stuck and really getting clear on where you're storing that in the body. Okay, good. Now you've got this location of where that energy is. We want to give it somewhere else to go. We're going to gather that energy and put it somewhere else. Something to imagine in your mind's eye that there's a soap bubble. And you're going to put it right out in front of you, about arms length in front of you, and you can make it pretty big, about as big as your hands. And I want you to, with your intention, take that energy and let it move out of your body from wherever the place you found this, and see it moving out into that bubble in front of you. You can visualize it like it's sort of pouring out of the body, or you might see it move all at once out of the body. Let yourself notice that in any way that you can. Good. And as that energy moves, notice what's happening in the body. Is there a little more motion in that place? Or a little freedom or a little bit of opening that's happening where you move that energy? And notice, did it all go? Did you let go of 80% of it, but 20% of it you kind of hung onto? Let that other 20% go. Give yourself permission to release this aspect of it by 100% right now. Good, and just take a deep breath while you're releasing. Let that energy come out. Move all the way out of your space and into that bubble. Okay, very good. And now, I want you to explore a little bit what's nearby. So as you open your awareness, notice, are there any other places in the body where there's some tension? Are there any other ideas that come up in your mind? So if you have a clear idea of when the original pattern started, you're going to use that or start expanding on it. What are the times when it happened again? Maybe it's a relationship pattern. You want to look at what are the three times this happened in a big way, why are you wanting to heal it? So let all those come up. And just breathe. Let this be easy and fun, you know, not too traumatic for you. And let that energy of these expansions, these other layers, move out into that bubble as well. And you're going to do this all at once. You're just going to let the energy release and move it out of your space and into that bubble. And again, as it's moving, you just kind of see it moving or feel it moving. And notice that as you breathe, you've got a little more space. You've got a little more room in your body to breathe now that energy is moved. Okay, good. Now, I want you to release that energy. So you're going to see that bubble. And let's go ahead and imagine we're pushing that bubble all the way out to the edge of the universe. So just give it a little push. See it flying away, all the way out to the edge of the universe. It's not going to bother anybody out there. And then just really far away, you're just going to imagine it's popping, that energy is dissipating, that that pattern is going away for you. Good. Now, be right behind your eyes again and have your awareness in your body. I want you to take a deep breath and imagine this original pattern that you wanted to change and give yourself permission to be finished with this pattern for now. So all the layers that you cleared today, you're done with. You don't have to go back and reclear those layers. If new layers come up later, you'll deal with them then, that's fine. But for now, this part is really complete. So energetically pat yourself on the back. And just know you did a great job moving energy. Okay, go ahead and open your eyes. I hope you could feel that energy moving as you're moving that energy, because that technique where you're just gathering the energy together and moving it out of the body is a very powerful technique. And you might be asking yourself, is this real? It's just something I did with my imagination, right? I tried to find it in the body, but why would my relationship stuff be in my body? Or why would my money issues be in my body? Well, all energy is stored in your body in some place. It's also stored out in other people, in situations. But there's always a location in your body. And for you, that's the most personal and powerful place for you to heal it, is to get into the body. And you might be thinking, "I don't know it. I felt something, but did I make it up," right? "Did I make up that it was moving out?" And that's actually how energy works. When you imagine something, you're making it real in the world. You're creating a pathway for that energy to follow and to change. So hopefully, you're feeling better right now. And you'll notice as you go forward that your pattern is different. Next time when it comes up, there's some layers of it that you healed today that are completely moved out that you don't hit. Now, keep in mind that it may take a couple times. If you pick something really big and really deep, like when I was working on this emotional pattern with anger, this was a deep pattern for many years. So it took me several rounds of self energy healing before it all came off and it all moved. So I had to get excited about the little progress I made. Like, "Wow, this part is better. I'm really doing something, and I'm going to do it again and again and again. As long as it takes for me to move that energy out completely in all different forms that's manifesting in my life." As you were doing that meditation, you might have noticed that you were losing consciousness or falling asleep at some point. And that's very common when you're doing energy healing. Because, remember, you're going into this pattern where there's unconscious energy. Unconscious energy is just a little buffer or a little kind of fuzzy energy we put around things where there's pain. As our attention starts to go to that place, we sort of veer off and go somewhere else. So if you're doing that meditation with something that was really big or had a lot of energy around it, you'll notice that there are probably times where you got lost, right? Where your attention just disappeared and all of a sudden you came back and you thought, "Okay, I'm not sure where we are. You know, I could hear that guy talking, but maybe I made a mistake, or I'm doing it wrong." And right there, I want you to change that perception. Because if you're going into the unconscious energy deep enough that you're falling asleep or you're losing your focus, you are healing yourself, right? You're going in directly the right direction. You're moving right into the unconscious, right into the place you need to go. Now, as an unconsciousness clears, you may have to do the exercise a few times before you can break through that unconscious energy and feel like I made it through, I got to the other side, and I found out what the real answer was. So don't feel bad at all if you went unconscious. That just means you were going for something big. So I want you to get that 'cause a lot of people give up. They try once or twice, they're like, "I fell asleep. I dunno how to do it. Maybe I'm not good at this." And I'm telling you the opposite. If you're falling asleep, you're going in the right direction. Just keep going. I want to give you one more example of how to use this for other people. And the same technique applies where you're going to go through those same seven cycles, but you're going to do it with a different person. So if you've got a person like a friend or a loved one where there's something happening in their body, for example, and you want to help 'em with that thing in their body, even if you have no training as an energy healer, you can do that. You can bring powerful healing energy through you to help that person even if you have no experience whatsoever. This is a normal part of being human. It's a normal part of your awareness. You just have to try and turn it on. So let me walk you through it. So what you're going to do first is you're going to identify what is it you want to do. So you get together with your friend, they tell you, "I've got this problem with my arm, where, you know, it's..." Maybe something happened or there's some difficulty there in the arm. So you identify what it is. Okay, now, the second thing you do is you're going to get permission, but this time, instead of permission for you to see yourself, you're giving yourself permission to allow energy to come through you, permission to access that healer that's inside of you that you didn't even know was there, okay? And the way you're going to do this is you're going to just imagine that there's healing energy or healing light coming in from the top of your head, pouring down through your body. You can just imagine it while we're doing it here, and pouring down your arms and then out your hands. And you don't have to know what this healing light is or where it comes from, or you don't have to know what the name of it is, just to have this energy, healing light flowing through. So you're giving yourself permission to heal somebody else to bring the healing energy through. Okay, now, you want to let your energy really fill up with that. And keep in mind, as you start to work on your friend, you're going to let the energy that's flowing through go into them. You're not pushing your energy into them, right? This isn't you healing them. This is you being a channel for healing energy to come through, okay? So give yourself permission to let that come through and give yourself permission to just notice, what do I do next? "Okay, I'm working on their arm. It feels like I need to put my hands, one on their hand and maybe one on their shoulder." Okay, if that's what you feel, go for it. Try it out. Then let that energy healing or that healing energy flow through you into their body. And again, feel that energy coming through, feel it moving into them. And keep in mind, this isn't me. I'm not doing it. There's just healing energy coming through me. Okay, good. So what you're doing is you're moving that energy, you're helping to shift that pattern in their physical body. Okay, now, you want to get the things that are around that. So you want to do is, notice, "Oh, what's the next step? We did this healing work on the shoulder, in the hand, what else do I feel like I need to do? Like it feels like it stopped and it feels like I need to... Maybe I need to work around their heart. I don't know why." That's okay. Go to their heart, put your hands on their heart or in front of them or whatever it feels like is the right thing to you. And again, let that energy flow through. Let your inner guidance guide you to be this healer. You don't have to know what the proper steps are. Okay, good. So you're going to let that energy expand inside that person until it's ready for the next thing. And then you're just going to know, where do I go next? Do I move over their feet? Do I do something on their head? Like, go from place to place and give yourself permission to let that expansion happen without a whole lot of thinking or rationalizing in the process. Just let the energy flow. Okay? And now you want to finish that process. So you're going to turn that energy off, just going to kind of imagine it's turning off. It's no longer flowing through you. And then you can let your attention to energy come back to yourself and you're going to let it be complete. Meaning that I helped this person in this moment in whatever way I could, but now I'm finished. I'm not going to take the healing home with me. And this is really important because, if you're starting to do healing work for other people, even in this casual way where you're just going through these different cycles of energy healing, then you want to be very careful not to overdo it, not to pick things up, not to take responsibility. Like, "Now, I have to fix their arm. And if they don't get better, it's my fault. I wasn't a good healer." Or, you know, don't take it on like a big challenge like that. What you're doing is you're offering your help right now. And so when that's done, the energy isn't flowing, it feels like you're finished. Really, let it be complete. I like to do this with a... I even say a couple of words like, "I may have been everybody's best good, but this healing be complete." You know, and as you say that, you kind of separate from their energy. So that's another way to use this seven cycle healing, to apply it to the physical body, and to work with somebody else. So I invite you to explore this in your life. So on your own, keep working on whatever the patterns are for you. When you notice a pattern, look at the energy and go through these seven cycles and see if you can address it and peel off a few layers. Remember that you're not going to get immediate results on everything. Some things will be miraculous. Like you can't believe how much difference you made in one 5-minute or 10-minute session working on your energy. But some things that are really deeper persistent, you might work on it five times, six times, and notice, it's changing, but it's changing kind of slow. Let that be okay. It doesn't mean that you are a bad healer. What it means is that you're healing in a graceful way, right? If you have an energy pattern that's really deep inside you, and you just suddenly took it and plucked it out of your existence completely, that's pretty disturbing. So if this has been there a long time, it's much more graceful and gentle to take it off layer by layer and let your body and your life kind of adjust to that new cycle that you're creating. It's actually a very gentle and appropriate way to heal yourself. So it's not going super fast, just know I'm working deeply, and I'm working in the right timeframe. And also experiment with your friends. Find somebody where you can work on their energy and do a little change and see what happens for them. You'll be surprised by the results, and you'll get that nice feedback when other people tell you, "Wow, that really made a difference in my life." You know, "Okay, it's, it's real for me. I'm not just making it up." And I encourage you to keep practicing with this. The more you practice, the more confident you'll be, the better it's going to work for you. And you're really going to discover that there's a powerful healer inside of you that's just waiting to come out, waiting to improve your life, to help you and to help other people too. Thanks for listening. I look forward to seeing you again.

====================

LESSON 17 - MEDITATION: Bonus: energy healing fast start guided meditation

- So, now that you have the thing that you want to work on, I want you to close your eyes. With your eyes closed, I want you to draw your energy and attention into your body right now. Just feel all your attention coming back from all of the times, places, people, and events, and just draw all your focus right now right behind your eyes. Okay, good. And now, think about the thing that you want to change. What is the pattern you want to work on right now in your life? Get really clear about that pattern and ask yourself one question about that pattern. And this question is, "Is this really what you want to work on? Is there something a little bit deeper?" Is this pattern representing something that's a little bit deeper? Could you go one step in? Okay, good. So, we're going to work on that thing that just a little bit deeper thing than before. So, give yourself permission to look at this. And when I say that, I want you to smile, and I want you to feel that energy of that smile. It's 'cause your body kind of lights up and it's a little more easy and graceful and smiling is the same energy as permission. So, think about that thing, that pattern you want to look at. And instead of judging it and thinking that there's something wrong with you or it's a bad pattern, I want you to smile and think, "It's just energy and I'm ready to change it." Okay, good. Now I want you to open your awareness to receive information about what is this pattern about? Where did it come from? And as you do that, I want you to tune into your body. So, notice where in your body are you holding some tension or pain around this pattern? Even if you're working on something around work or your relationships, there's somewhere in your body where there's some tension related to that pattern. So, notice where that is right now. Okay, good. So, now that you have that area and you know where it is, we're going to dive a little deeper. What does that energy of that block or that pattern feel like in that area? So, does it have a color to it? Is it dark or light? Is there a texture with it? Is it soft or kind of prickly? Or maybe it's cold or hot? You notice how that pattern makes you feel. Is it kind of funny, like an entertaining pattern? Or does it really make you angry? Or maybe there's a little sadness around this pattern. Just notice the emotions there. You're just tuning in to where is this stuck, and really getting clear on where you're storing that in the body. Okay, good. Now, now you've got this location of where that energy is, we want to give it somewhere else to go. We're going to gather that energy and put it somewhere else. So, I want to imagine in your mind's eye that there is a soap bubble. And you're going to put it right out in front of you, about arms length in front of you, and you can make it pretty big about as big as your hands. And I want you to, with your intention, take that energy and let it move out of your body from wherever the place you found is, and see it moving out into that bubble in front of you. You can visualize it like it's sort of pouring out of the body, or you might see it move all at once out of the body. Let yourself notice that in any way that you can. Good. And as that energy moves, notice what's happening in the body. Is there a little more emotion in that place? Or a little freedom or a little bit of opening that's happening where you move that energy? And notice, did it all go? Did you let go of 80% of it, but 20% of it you kind of hung onto? Let that other 20% go. Give yourself permission to release this aspect of it by a hundred percent right now. Good. Just take a deep breath while you're releasing. Let that energy come out. Move all the way out of your space and into that bubble. Okay, very good. And now I want you to explore a little bit what's nearby. So, as you open your awareness, notice, are there any other places in the body where there's some tension? Are there any other ideas that come up in your mind? So, if you have a clear idea of when the original pattern started, you're going to use that or start expanding on it. What are the times when it happened again? Maybe it's a relationship pattern. You want to look at what are the three times this happened in a big way? Why are you wanting to heal it? So, let all those come up. And just breathe. Let this be easy and fun, you know, not too traumatic for you. And let that energy of these expansions, these other layers, move out into that bubble as well. And you're going to do this all at once. You're just going to let the energy release and move it out of your space and into that bubble. And again, as it's moving, you just kind of it moving or feel it moving. And notice that, as you breathe, you've got a little more space. You've got a little more room in your body to breathe now that energy is moved. Okay, good. Now I want you to release that energy. So, you're going to see that bubble. And let's go ahead and imagine we're pushing that bubble all the way out out to the edge of the universe. So, just give it a little push. See it flying away all the way out to the edge of the universe. It's not going to bother anybody out there. And then just really far away, you're just going to imagine it's popping and that energy is dissipating, that that pattern is going away for you. Good. Now, be right behind your eyes again and have your awareness in your body. And I want you to take a deep breath and imagine this original pattern that you wanted to change and give yourself permission to be finished with this pattern for now. So, all the layers that you cleared today, you're done with, you don't have to go back and reclear those layers. If new layers come up later, you'll deal with them then. That's fine. But for now, this part is really complete. So, energetically pat yourself on the back and just know you did a great job moving energy. Okay, go ahead and open your eyes.

====================

LESSON 18: Healing & Energizing Your Body: Self-Practice Day

<v ->Welcome back, today is your self-practice day. You have all the
information and tools you need, and now it’s time to apply them. We’re
going to listen to the practice meditation together right now, and then
take the day to really work with your energy in your life. This is your
chance to refine and integrate your practice. Let’s begin. Focus on a
point across the room, where your eyes rest naturally. Be right behind
your eyes and breathe your eyes closed. Bring your attention to the
center of your head. Feel all your energy coming back to you in present
time. Turn down your analyzer and let your mind relax. Bring your
awareness up and back, into that peaceful place of the higher mind. Let
yourself detach from any negative thoughts or any blame that you’re
feeling today. Remember you’re grounding. Stay in your body and feel the
Earth energy beating beneath you. Imagine you can open your feet and
breathe that Earth energy into your legs. Feel it filling up your lower
legs. Feel it moving around in your knees, finding the perfect balance
for your body. Feel it pouring into your root chakra, near the base of
the spine. Giving your physical body all the power and strength and
stability it needs today. When you’re 100% full, feel the overflow going
back down your grounding cord into the Earth. Notice any tension or pain
in your body. Give it permission to release out of your body, down your
grounding, into the Earth. Notice any worries you have about money or
health or dying. Let these energies release down your grounding, into
the Earth. Breathe. Focus your attention again in the center of your
head. Feel your crown chakra on top of your head, like a crown or a
halo. Feel the Cosmic energy coming in from above and activating your
crown chakra, breathe. Bring the Cosmic energy all the way down your
back, to the base of your spine. Invite that energy to turn your root
chakra and come back up the front of your body. Feel the energy going
all the way up the front of the body, through your head, showering out
your crown chakra in all directions. Feel that energy flowing all the
way down the aura and into your grounding. At your neck, notice the
cosmic energy dividing and going into each shoulder, down your arms and
out your hands. Your cosmic energy flow at 100% volume through your
body. Give your body permission to drink in all the energy it needs.
When you’re full, feel the extra energy picking up any foreign energy
which is ready to release and carrying it out of your body. Breathe. As
your arms charge up with Cosmic energy, notice your creative and healing
energy channels automatically engaging, Feel healing energy flowing down
from the healing grid around the planet, into your crown chakra, down
your neck. Down your arms and out your hands. Wake up your hand chakras
by opening and closing your palms. Breathe. Face your palms toward each
other and begin collecting energy between your hands. Move them closer
and further apart As the energy builds, notice any sensations in your
palms, tingling, pressure or heat. What does this energy feel like to
you? Notice where in your body, this energy is needed today. As you
think of this place in your body, notice the ball of energy getting
stronger, feel it pulsing between your hands. When you have a nice
strong ball of creative energy, send it into your body in the place that
needs it most, breathe. Feel this light penetrating into your body,
healing and pushing out any foreign energy. Feel that foreign energy
getting carried away automatically, by your Cosmic end Earth energy.
Continue channeling energy into that place in your body. Feel it getting
warmer and healing itself. Smile and be grateful that you’re healing
your own body. Relax your hands and let your awareness be in the center
of your hand. Feel the Earth and Cosmic energy flowing effortlessly
through you. Feel it proactively healing your entire physical body and
energy body. Say, I love my bright energy. I love my health and
vitality. Give yourself a deep breath and open your eyes.

====================

Part 4: Empathy & Healthy Personal Boundaries

====================

LESSON 19: Why Is Energy Contagious?

<v ->Welcome everyone. It’s Jeffrey Allen again. As we begin, please
remember you’re grounding. And be in the center of your head, and notice
your earth and cosmic energy running. Say hello to the group energy and
send smiles and hellos to your fellow students, and feel the group
energy and intention supporting you. Good. Today we’ll be exploring
empathy and healthy personal boundaries. Empathy is one of the most
interesting and most misunderstood areas of intuition. From an energy
perspective, we are constantly emerged in a sea of thoughts, ideas,
emotions, and feelings from other people. Yet, just like the fish in the
sea, we are often completely unaware of the water we swim in and how
much it affects us. Empathy is the energetic skill we use to match and
merge with this sea of energy that’s all around us. Our personal
boundaries determine if this is a healthy process, which we feel good
with, or if we feel overwhelmed by this out of control empathy. In
simple terms, boundaries mean you get to choose. In the physical world,
sometimes you have to do things that you don’t want. You have to follow
the rules, even the dumb ones, and people with size or power can push
you around. But this is not true in the energy world. In the energy
world, you get to choose which energies you experience. No one can
impose their energy on you if you understand boundaries and seniority.
The term seniority just means that you understand that this is true,
that you get to choose your energy. Think about how we transfer energy
in the physical and energy worlds, they’re very different. The physical
world deals with finite objects. If I give you an object, now you have
it and I no longer have it. If I talk you into carrying my suitcase and
guitar, now I don’t have to carry them, and maybe this is okay because
you wanted to help me. By contrast, the energy world deals with the
infinite. It’s more like transferring frequencies or transferring energy
and than transferring objects. If I give you some information, now you
have a copy, but I still have the original. Let’s say I talk you into
carrying my emotional baggage, now we’re both carrying it. You didn’t
really help me or yourself. Empathy is about learning to match or use
another energy, and energetically we really have infinite potential. We
can learn or become anything. A good analogy is to imagine that you are
the guitar, right? And you can play any song. If I teach you my song,
you can play it and so can I. So how does energy travel from person to
person? You can think of energy like waves or sounds rather than
particles or objects. You are a beautiful guitar with infinite potential
and you vibrate your song out in the world. Good and bad, fears and
pains, happiness. These songs are like tuning forks ringing at a precise
note. Other people also have infinite potential. They have matching
tuning forks. When you play your song, the energy travels to them and
they vibrate at your song. Your vibration is now part of them and vice
versa, at least temporarily. They have learned to play your song. It
doesn’t matter if it’s a good song or a bad song, that’s empathy,
matching the energy around you. It’s not simply thinking I can relate.
Empathy isn’t a mental understanding, it’s actually becoming the energy
temporarily, and we all do this, mostly unconsciously. Our energy
boundaries determine how often and how it affects us. The technical term
for this is sympathetic resonance. It happens when there is harmonic
likeness. You can see this if you have two guitars too. Just pluck a
string on one guitar and the corresponding string vibrates, and the
other. Pretty cool. There are some really fun benefits of empathy. Great
social skill, people like you if you’re similar to them and you can
blend into any environment. Empathy is great for learning, understanding
the world deeply and truly knowing how people are feeling. Empathy helps
you be a good listener or counselor. People like to tell you their
secrets and problems and your resonance helps them understand
themselves. You’re like a mirror or a movie screen they can project on,
which brings me to the downsides of empathy. Good projector screens tend
to get projected on. People might share too many problems with you.
People can more easily project their emotional baggage onto you as well,
and we’ll learn to fix this in this chapter. If you’re highly empathic,
it’s easy to get caught in other people’s priorities, you’re going to
lose sight of your own boundaries and your own priorities. You may have
a tendency to be taken advantage of. You might get easily overwhelmed by
feeling too much of the world, and it can be easy to lose track of
yourself. You’re just helping others, but not helping yourself. So keep
in mind that while everyone is empathic, some people are experts. And if
you’re a highly empathic, you’ve been nodding your head here, you
already get it. If this is not like you, it may be like someone close to
you. So this can help you understand your friend or your spouse. Now a
fun example of empathy gone bad is matching other people’s moods. For
example, so let’s say you’re feeling really happy and you’re having a
perfectly nice day and then Oscar the grouch comes by and, everything is
terrible, blah, blah, blah. And they’re very negative. And now you feel
grumpy too. And you might even be mad at Oscar for ruining your mood.
But consider why this happened. You unconsciously matched their energy.
This is completely optional. If you had better boundaries, this wouldn’t
have happened. It’s not all Oscar’s fault. This is also how you get
pulled into an argument. You’re feeling okay, someone starts to argue
with you and pretty soon you’re arguing and getting frustrated too. And
you might think this isn’t even like me. I’m only like this when I’m
with this particular person. That’s a good sign that you’re
unconsciously matching their energy. Again, it’s not their fault, they
just have a different style than you do. If you stop matching their
style and mood, you’ll start feeling better. Think of one person right
now that you argue with. And next time it happens remember maybe I’m
matching their argumentative or analytical thinking energy and see if it
helps. Now, blame is a dangerous trap. You all know this, but I’ll say
it anyway. You might be thinking, I feel bad when Oscar’s around so it’s
his fault. This seems completely logical and reasonable. But if this is
true, you’ve lost your seniority. You no longer believe that you have a
choice. You’re no longer able to respond, you are a victim. You’re not
responsible means that you’re not able to respond, right? And if you
think this way, it will be true for you. You cannot master your space
without seniority, without ownership of your space, without knowing your
energy always has priority. It’s true that they’re responsible for the
original energy and you are responsible for your copy. This
responsibility can be hard to swallow, but if you’ve been using the
energy, it’s yours now. Remember the tuning forks, sympathetic
resonance, right? You can only match things that you have a little bit
of in yourself. If you really want to see empathy gone awry, try
matching other people’s desires. Let’s say you’re at a party and you’re
sensitive so you’re feeling a little overwhelmed. You have a few drinks
to loosen up and this works. Your boundaries are now loose and your
guard is down, you have no boundaries. And then you meet someone who’s
really interested in you and you go home together, and then you wake up
the next day thinking, why this person? I’m not attracted to them at
all. So what happened here? Their attraction and desire energy was
strong, your boundaries were weak so you became their attraction and
desire energy. You played their song instead of your own. And again,
it’s not their fault, you had poor boundaries. If you blame them, you
are helpless to change it in the future. Now let’s look at another silly
example. You know, maybe a friend says, what do you want to eat? And
you’re thinking inside, I want something cheap and fast, maybe just a
sandwich. But you say, I don’t know, what do you want? Right, and your
friend who has more certainty says, I’d like an expensive, long lunch.
And you go along with it but you feel frustrated with your choice. You
didn’t get what you want because you matched their desire and you have
weak boundaries. Now, if you’re starting to get depressed, just hang in
there I will give you some tools to help. But first you have to
understand that you have an empathy problem in these situations, only
then can you change it. So let’s look at one more unfortunate example
and you realize all these examples are from my life, right? Okay, so
this one is the worst. Couples with unconscious energy can bring out the
worst in each other. For example, let’s say your partner has an old
drama. Maybe their stepdad was really stingy and they have some pain
around it, and you unconsciously absorb this drama energy because you
have poor boundaries. You start vibrating at the stingy energy. Now,
when your partner looks at you, they see their old drama. You kind of
look like my stepfather and this drama energy starts to build as the
energy builds. And you might think of this as a them projecting on you,
but you could stop it if you’d be a less effective screen, right? So
next you begin acting out their drama. You actually start being stingy,
and you’re thinking, I don’t know why I’m doing this it’s not even like
me. So it’s not my fault. But unfortunately it is, right, because your
boundaries. And then eventually your partner decides you are the
problem, you really are like my stepfather, and it’s kind of true. So
you break up and you start to return to your own energy and behavior.
You stop being stingy because you’re by yourself, you’re not matching
that energy anymore. And as you reset to your energy, you feel a bit
better, but you still retain a little bit of that old stingy energy, but
a little bit less you each time you do this. And then the next time you
see your old partner, you’re now attracted to each other again, because
the energy has gone and you get together and you start the whole cycle
over again, but it doesn’t last because you haven’t really dealt with
your unconscious empathy so you’re just going to repeat this cycle over
and over. So if unconscious empathy can be so troublesome, what about
conscious empathy? Can you match people consciously? Yes, you can. If I
admire somebody’s ability to make money, I can match their energy. This
is why people suggested your income is the average of the five people
you spend the most time with, empathy can really help you here. Or maybe
you’re shy and you admire your swinging single friend, so you try to
match his energy. This is a great way to learn something. I’ve used this
for money, for new skills, for confidence, but be careful because you
might succeed. If become just like that other person, you might no
longer be yourself. You might not really enjoy their lifestyle as much
as you thought you would. And honestly, you probably really admired that
they were just being their authentic self. Authenticity is a great
energy to match. So think about your own examples right now. And is the
light bulb going on? Where is unconscious empathy causing problems in
your life? It can be simple, like just matching their mood, or matching
their energy, or matching some particular trait, or it can be something
bigger. Any example you can think of. Where have you taken on someone
else’s moods, fears, goals, or lifestyle? I saw this so often with
clients, it’s a big confusion with energy. If you’re highly empathic,
this chapter will really change your life. If we sum up all these
stories, you can see the results of poor boundaries. You’re easily
affected by other people’s moods, kind of like an energy sponge. You’re
feeling overwhelmed because there’s too much energy. You’re not
succeeding at your own priorities or you’re distracted by everybody
else’s priorities. Maybe you’re having experiences that you don’t want,
or it feels like people are dumping things on you. Maybe there’s endless
drama at work or home or in your relationships because you’re passing
this drama energy back and forth unconsciously. Life might feel really
uninteresting or meaningless because you’re not living the life of your
dreams. Maybe you’re too busy with everyone else’s lives, unconsciously
merging and matching with others, or there’s too much energy going into
that drama loop. Or you don’t even know what is you anymore and what’s
not you. This isn’t really good for anyone, but it’s especially not good
for you. Now, fortunately, there is a better way. When you understand
empathy and have healthy boundaries, you can know what’s yours and not
yours because you know yourself, and you can release from what is not
yours because you have your certainty, and you can choose which story
you are living in because you have great boundaries and you can live the
life of your dreams using your energy to fulfill your dreams. And with
practice, you can even begin to make your own rules. Maybe you know
someone like this who seems to live by their own rules or creates their
own reality. They’re not matching everyone else and you can do this too,
I’ll show you how in this chapter. The first step to change is always
awareness. Today, notice when you are matching other people or taking
care of others but not taking care of yourself and notice your
unconscious empathy. Or if this doesn’t sound like you, notice this
pattern in other people. When are people matching you or following your
lead, and do they really want to? Or are your boundaries simply stronger
than theirs? And how does that feel? Either way, notice your habits
around empathy today and you’ll already begin to have more compassion
for yourself and others too. Enjoy.

====================

LESSON 20: Create Healthy Boundaries & Use Your Aura

<v ->Welcome back. Give yourself a deep breath. And as we begin, please
remember your grounding. Relax into the center of your head. And notice
your Earth and Cosmic energy running. Say hello to the group energy. And
send smiles and hellos to your fellow students. And feel that group
energy and intention supporting you. This is a beautiful use of your
empathy. When we talk about boundaries energetically, we’re talking
about your aura. So, what’s your aura? It’s your personal energy which
extends beyond your physical body. It’s a bit like the atmosphere around
the Earth. Lets in some light and it blocks out some radiation. Your
aura determines which and how much energy you absorb. It’s how you
adjust your empathy. And your aura is very dynamic; it’s always
changing. Different size or color or density or position. And
surprisingly, most people can actually feel someone’s aura with their
hand chakras. This is a great first introduction to energy. And before I
tell you more, though, I really want you to feel the aura first. So,
we’ll start with some aura stretching and warmups. Go ahead and close
your eyes. Notice your grounding and Earth energy. Turn your analyzer
off. And just be in the center of your head. And feel your Cosmic energy
running through your body. As it showers out at the top of your head,
the Cosmic energy flows down the outside of your aura. This gives you a
good sense of where your aura is. Now, imagine you can feel your skin.
It can be anywhere: your hands or the front of your body. And now, let
that awareness expand a little just beyond your skin, maybe one
centimeter. And let it expand a little further. And as it keeps
extending out from your body, notice when it changes. When does it feel
like it’s not you anymore? In other words, what size is your aura right
now? Might be arm’s length. It could be a mile or a kilometer away. Just
get your initial feeling. Any answer is okay. Now, get a sense for where
you are in your aura. Are you right in the center of the aura? Or a
little to one side? Maybe you’re right at the front? Just notice. And
just for fun, let yourself be centered and adjust your aura to arm’s
length from your body. Arm’s length behind, to the sides, to the front,
above and below. Is there a color that comes to mind for your aura? Or
maybe a brightness? Does the outside feel soft or rigid? If you were
outside your aura pressing up against it, what would it feel like? Any
answer’s okay. And notice how well-defined is your boundary? Does your
energy extend up to the boundary and then stop? Or does it fade away
gradually, less and less and less, as it gets further away from you?
Just notice what’s true for you. Finally, notice how easily does energy
float into and out of your aura? Does it flow in more easily or out more
easily, or is it balanced? And remember, your aura changes. Just notice
what’s true right now. It might be different tomorrow. And just for fun,
see if you can balance the flow in with the flow out. You can do that by
making the outside of your aura a little more crisp. Good. Now notice,
does this feel like you? Does the energy inside your aura feel like you?
Be in the center of your head again. Grounded. And feel your aura around
you. And when you’re ready, open your eyes. Great, that was just a
little warmup to see what you notice about your aura. And really trust
yourself. What did you feel for the size, position, brightness and
color? Was it soft or rigid or well-defined? How was the energy flowing
in and out? Did it feel like you or was it another energy? Or maybe just
a new experience for you? Maybe you didn’t feel anything. That’s okay,
too. Just asking the questions was clearing unconscious energy from your
aura. So it’ll be easier to sense next time. Now let’s look at what each
of these traits means. As I describe them, think about how they apply to
you. Feel free to adjust your aura as I talk, too. You can try out a
couple of different settings. So, the size of your aura varies from
arm’s length to a room or a city or even a country size. And sometimes a
small aura is better. Sometimes a large aura is better. Let’s look at
some scenarios. So, when you’re in the city or indoors, it feels better
to have your aura small. And when you’re in nature, it feels better to
have it big. I lived in Sedona for a long time, and I was used to having
this large expansive aura because I was hiking all the time. And then I
came to Tokyo, and I felt very crowded in the city. And Hisami, my wife,
said, “Why don’t you just make your aura a little smaller?” I thought,
oh, good idea. So I shrunk it down to more city-size, you know, kind of
arm’s length from my body, and I felt better. And I started noticing the
little beautiful things around me that I couldn’t feel before when I
felt overwhelmed. So a small aura is great for a local perspective. And
a larger aura is great for a global perspective. Smaller is good for
concentration and a large aura is good for a broad understanding. A
small aura is great for feeling yourself, and a large aura is great for
feeling others. A small aura is good for sorting out what’s yours. And a
large aura is great for teaching and speaking because you want to feel
all the students’ energy. A small aura is also good for focusing and a
large one’s good for relaxing. So, how well-defined your aura boundary
is determines how clear your boundaries are. A less defined aura fades
away gradually, and a more defined aura is more crisp. A less defined
aura is going to feel like you’re a little unclear about your
boundaries. People don’t really know where you stand. If your aura’s
more well-defined, you have very clear boundaries. When it’s less
defined, you’re going to take on other people’s priorities. And when
it’s more defined, you’re going to follow your priorities. If your aura
is less defined, you’re going to be less selective. Like that example,
what do you want to eat? I don’t know, what do you want to eat? And when
it’s more clearly defined, you’ll be more selective. When your aura
boundary’s less defined, you’re going to feel unsure of what’s yours,
’cause you’re kind of merging with everything. And when it’s more
defined, you’ll know yourself from other people. Now, less defined
boundaries can be a really fun way to get lost in a crowd. So let’s say
everybody’s dancing together. It’s really fun to get lost in that
energy. Or if you’re at a live sporting event and everybody’s cheering
and the crowd’s all together, it’s really fun to get lost in that
energy. But for most situations, having a more defined aura will feel
good for you. How about permeability? How much energy comes through your
boundaries? Here, we’re really looking for balance. If you have low
permeability, it means energy can’t get in. So you feel insensitive or
protective or defensive. You might be seen as aloof or demanding. And
you don’t really feel your impact on others. So you’re understanding
yourself, but not other people. Now, if your aura is highly permeable,
energy gets in easily. So you’re too sensitive, no boundaries, energy
sponge. You’re very allowing, you’re a doormat. You’re understanding
others, but losing yourself. The goal is to be somewhere in the middle
where your energy is balanced; it’s just right. I’m okay and you’re
okay. I’m feeling the world, I’m knowing and respecting myself and I’m
understanding myself and others. So let’s talk about some of the other
attributes of your aura. There’s a location within your aura. So where
are you? Are you in the middle, in the side, the front? And this is just
a personal preference. I had a really good friend who was always the
very front of his aura. He was just right here, he was super excited,
enthusiastic about life and curious. But everybody had the same response
when they met him. Everybody thought, why is he standing so close to me?
’Cause he would come up right here and talk to you. But because he was
at the front of his aura, that didn’t feel too close to him. Or you can
think of the opposite example. People that are really cool tend to kind
of hang out at the back of their aura. They’re being really cool. A lot
of space in front of them. Color is another trait of the aura that
people talk about a lot, and it’s actually always changing. I don’t use
it very much myself, but everybody wants to know what color is my aura?
So for me, the aura is not really a fashion statement, but it’s more
like a radio dial that you can use. That’s kind of how I use it. But
color can be fun too. Another trait is brightness. So your energy versus
foreign energy. Foreign energy’s going to look kind of dark, where your
own energy is going to look brighter in your aura. Your aura can also be
soft or rigid, which determines how friendly you feel to other people. A
good boundary doesn’t mean that your boundary is rigid. If you think of
someone you know who feels really good or really yummy, they don’t have
a rigid aura, they just have a really nice aura. And of course, we
talked about energy flowing in or out of your aura. Are you a giver or a
taker? Or are you balanced? And this is just a personality preference.
Please don’t judge people for this trait. You can also have a shared
aura with people. So maybe you’re having an intimate moment and you want
to merge with somebody’s energy. Sometimes it feels really good to get
lost in someone’s energy. So today, I want you to start noticing your
aura. Get a better sense of who you are energetically right now. And
notice any ways you want to change your aura, but don’t judge yourself
too much. The goal today is to just get to know your natural tendencies.
I’ll give you more tools for adjusting your aura later. So don’t try to
be perfect. Just have fun learning about yourself today; enjoy.

Any answer's? Okay. And notice how well defined is your boundary. Does your energy extend up to the boundary and then stop? Or does it fade away gradually less and less and less? As it gets further away from you, just notice what's true for you. Finally, notice how easily does energy flow into and out of your aura? Does it flow in more easily or out more easily? Or is it balanced? And remember, your aura changes. Just notice what's true right now. It might be different tomorrow. And just for fun, see if you can balance the flow in with the flow out. You can do that by making the outside of your aura a little more crisp. Good. Now notice, does this feel like you? Does the energy inside your aura feel like you be in the center of your head again, grounded and feel your aura around you? And when you're ready, open your eyes.

====================

LESSON 21: Who’s in Control of Your Life?

<v ->Welcome back, give yourself a deep breath. And as we begin, please
remember you’re grounding and relax into the center of your head. Notice
your Earth and Cosmic energy running and notice your aura around you and
the say hello to the group energy, to send smiles and hellos to your
fellow students and feel the group energy and intention supporting you.
I’ve mentioned Seniority a few times in this chapter, but I want to make
sure you really get this concept. To me, Seniority really means three
things. The first is knowing that you always have a choice in your
energy. This is simply true. There’s no effort or struggle required.
Yes, it’s not always true in the physical world, but it is always true
in the energy world. So occasionally a student will ask me, “But what if
somebody puts a curse on me and it really affects me?” And the answer is
easy, they just gave away their Seniority You can do that, but it’s
optional. Seniority also means letting go of what is not yours. Stop
trying to fix other people’s problems. That’s their responsibility, not
yours. And this is not a cop-out, you can’t fix them anyway. And it’s
invasive to try. If you’re struggling with somebody, focus on your own
boundaries and your own Seniority, and that’s the best way to help.
Finally, Seniority means taking responsibility for your energy and your
boundaries. Responsibility sometimes gets a bad rap, but if you look it
up, it actually means accountable for something within someone’s power.
It’s not about obligation or blame. And we’re just talking about your
energy and your boundaries. So obviously you want to be in charge of
those, right? Seniority has some great benefits. When you have your
Seniority, you get to choose your reality. What experiences do you want
to have or not have? You decide. And when you have your Seniority, you
tend to focus on your priorities. You’re not caught up in other people’s
priorities. And when you have your Seniority, it’s easy to remove
foreign energy from your space. There’s no effort. You just decide and
it moves. Energetically, you have Seniority in your space. This is
simply true. The only way not to have it is to misunderstand, to forget
or to give your Seniority away. So how does this happen? The three main
ways people give away their Seniority are blame, it’s your fault and I’m
helpless. Now if you think you’re a victim, you can’t change it. Second
way is submission. They know better than me and you just give away your
power. And the third is lack of confidence. I can’t do it. And it’s
important to understand that no one will maintain your boundaries for
you. No one will respect your boundaries if you don’t. Fortunately, as
you practice with Seniority and boundaries, your confidence will grow.
You’ll stop giving your Seniority away. It’s great. So what does it feel
like when someone crosses our boundaries or crosses a line with us?
Usually we get angry. In fact, I think anger is actually a natural
internal response to a boundary being crossed. It’s natural and it’s
automatic. Just like you feel pain when you stub your toe. But before we
make this internal response, this internal anger, external, we should
really ask ourselves four questions. First, did you understand your
boundary in the situation? Maybe it’s a new situation for you and you
didn’t know you were sensitive there, so you’re surprised, you’re
shocked. Second, did you communicate your boundary clearly energetically
and verbally. Third, did the other person understand and agree?
Sometimes people misunderstand or even disagree. You only get to decide
for yourself. And finally, did you respect your own boundaries? Remember
no one will respect your boundaries if you don’t. Now, if you get a yes
to all four questions, I understood my boundary. I communicated it
clearly. It was understood and agreed upon. And I respected my boundary,
then yes, definitely you can stay angry. But it’s usually not that
clear. Maybe we didn’t know we were sensitive in this area or we knew
but were too embarrassed to mention it. Or someone simply misunderstood
us. It’s natural to feel angry, but probably better to run your energy
and clear it instead of spreading it around to other people. This is
part of having your Seniority and having good boundaries. Now I should
say here, I’m talking about energetic boundaries and non-personal
physical boundaries. If someone mentions a topic that you’re sensitive
to, or maybe it makes light of something that you don’t like, or it is
painful for you, or maybe someone plays some music you don’t like, or
wears something you’re allergic to or uses your favorite coffee cup. I’m
talking about these things. I’m not talking about your personal physical
boundaries. So we must all be respectful of each other’s physical
boundaries. There’s no excuse here. If someone forces their will on you
physically, that’s their fault, that’s not your fault. But practicing
with your energetic boundaries will make this less likely to happen. A
strong energetic boundary can communicate just as clearly as a physical
one. So next let’s talk about clearing foreign energies. What if some
energy gets in or you absorb some energy that you don’t like, how do you
get rid of it? You can try it right now and I’ll talk you through the
steps. So just think of an energy which might not be yours, something
that you’d like to get rid of. Okay, you got it? Now first, notice it’s
not yours. For example, if you start feeling grumpy, but you don’t know
why you can just ask yourself, is this mine? Or maybe you just suspect
it’s not, I don’t think this is mine or you can even decide, this isn’t
mine. All those work. Second, remember your Seniority. You always have a
choice. It’s your energy. And third, give the foreign energy permission
to exist. A 100% permission to exist, just not here in my space, in my
aura. If you resisting, it’s a way of hanging on to foreign energy. And
four, forgive others for sharing it with you, it may not have been
malicious. It was probably accidental. And if it was malicious that
person’s in a lot of pain, probably more pain than you are. So have a
little compassion. So just forgive anyone else who’s involved in this
energy. This fifth step may seem overly simple, but just let the energy
go. You know it’s not yours and you have your Seniority. So just let it
go. Just let it release into the Cosmic energy or down your grounding
and leave your space. It’s that simple, there’s no force needed. If that
doesn’t work. If you have low Seniority in this situation, or if you’re
still developing your Seniority, try declaring that the energy is
leaving your space. Might sound like this. I declare that this energy
leaves my space, or this is not my energy. You can even command it to
leave. I command this energy to leave my space. Now, if you try
commanding, remember, it’s just a statement. There’s no explanation
point at the end. It’s not a demand like, this energy has to leave,
right? That’s called resistance. You’re just saying I command this
energy to leave my space. I know I have my Seniority and this is my
space. And so it leaves. This is very simple, but it may take a little
practice. Just have fun with it. I remember years ago, I was in a sweat
lodge with the Lakota in Colorado. And someone had an illness that they
wanted to heal. And the chief said this beautiful intention. He said,
“Great spirit, please take this energy and put it somewhere where it
won’t bother anyone anymore.” It was just a beautiful intention, no
judgment, no resistance, just Seniority. You can also use Seniority for
clearing a person from your energy. Say, you’re frustrated with somebody
and you’re thinking he is in my space or she’s in my space or they’re in
my space. And you’re getting bent out of shape about it. So think about
somebody, you know like this right now, you feel is in your space. So
step one, declaring this is to notice that you lost you’re Seniority and
be a little amused. If they’re in your space, you let them in, right? If
it’s totally their fault, you’ve lost already. So just laugh a little
bit at yourself. Ha, ha, I lost my Seniority. You can fake it if you
need to. And step two is to take back responsibility. No one is
attacking you energetically. In fact, very few people have the skills to
do that. And people that do have those skills, aren’t foolish enough to
use them because they know there are consequences. So it’s safe to
assume that no one is attacking you energetically. And honestly it
wouldn’t matter anyway, if you have your Seniority, even a skilled
practitioner, can’t harm you with energy. Step three is to check and
adjust your aura boundary. You can imagine doing that right now. Just
bring it in to arms length, make it well-defined and a nice balance
between sponge and resistance. And very good. And now that you’ve dealt
with the other person, you just have to clear the foreign energy, just
like you learned before. So, if you think about it, there wasn’t really
a person in your space at all. You simply matched their energy, but you
have your Seniority and know your boundaries so it’s no problem, right?
You just declare this isn’t mine and let it float away into your Cosmic
energy. You were probably doing this as I explained it, but let’s go
through it again in a meditation space. So go ahead and close your eyes.
Check your grounding, make sure your analyzer’s off and your energy is
running. Think of a problem you have, maybe something you’re angry about
or someone who crossed your boundaries and ask yourself, do you believe
that you have a choice? I want you to start to feel your aura, vibrating
and Seniority. For now, just know that you have Seniority. You have a
choice. Feel that energy of Seniority all through your aura and all
around you. Very good. Now say to yourself, I declare that I have
Seniority in my space. I declare that I have Seniority in my space.
Notice how that changes your energy, really own it and take
responsibility. In this situation or with this person, notice how was
your aura when you absorbed this energy, Get a sense for the size and
definition. Don’t think, just feel, what was your aura like when this
energy came in? And what would you adjust to make it different? Maybe a
little closer, more well-defined, a little more or less permeable. And
do that right now. Make your aura the setting you would have liked to
have had with this person or situation before. Good. Now notice the
foreign energy in your aura. You might just feel it or maybe you see a
little dark patch or some color. Where is this energy, which is not
yours. And if you’re feeling unsure, you might just decide, and that’s
the energy that’s not mine. Give that energy permission to exist. If
you’re resisting it, let go of that resistance now. We’re going to move
it out soon and then you won’t care if it exists ’cause it will be
outside of you. Next forgive anyone else who shared this information
with you. Who shared this energy with you. It’s not really their fault
any more than it’s yours. Good. Now let that energy go. Just release it
into your Cosmic energy or down your grounding and out of your space.
Say to yourself, in accordance with my Seniority, I command all foreign
energies to release now. In accordance with my Seniority, I command all
foreign energies to release now. Just feel, just feel the energy
leaving, feel yourself returning to your true energy. And take a deep
breath. Feel your aura boundary around you. Really well-defined with
your Seniority and your ability to choose. Just admire your own boundary
and say, I love my Seniority and boundaries. I love choosing my space.
And smile. Very good. And open your eyes. Welcome back. So how are you
feeling? How does it feel to have your Seniority? Were you surprised?
Maybe a little afraid, maybe asleep. Did the energy release easily? Did
you take responsibility for your energy? I hope this helped you feel
more clear and confident about your space. Seniority is just an
energetic trade. You don’t have to earn it. Just claim it. I’d like you
to keep practicing with your Seniority today. Just notice when you have
your space and when you give it away. Notice when someone crosses your
boundaries and how you respond and notice any foreign energies in your
space and let them release easily. Ah, this isn’t even mine, I’ll just
let it go. This simple practices let you choose your experiences
throughout the day. Enjoy.

====================

LESSON 21: MEDITATION: Meditation: clearing foreign energy

- Check your grounding. Make sure your analyzer's off and your energy's running. Think of a problem you have, maybe something you're angry about or someone who crossed your boundaries, and ask yourself, do you believe that you have a choice? I want you to start to feel your aura vibrating at seniority. For now, just know that you have seniority. You have a choice. Feel that energy of seniority all through your aura and all around you. Very good. Now, say to yourself, "I declare that I have seniority in my space. I declare that I have seniority in my space." Notice how that changes your energy. Really own it and take responsibility. In this situation or with this person, notice how was your aura when you absorbed this energy? Get a sense for the size and definition. Don't think, just feel, what was your aura like when this energy came in and what would you adjust to make it different? Maybe a little closer, more well defined, a little more or less permeable, and do that right now. Make your aura the setting you would've liked to have had with this person or situation before. Good. Now, notice the foreign energy in your aura. You might just feel it, or maybe you see a little dark patch or some color. Where is this energy, which is not yours? And if you're feeling unsure, you might just decide, "that's the energy that's not mine." Give that energy permission to exist. If you're resisting it, let go of that resistance now. We're going to move it out soon and then you won't care if it exists, 'cause it'll be outside of you. Next, forgive anyone else who shared this information with you, who shared this energy with you, it's not really their fault anymore than it's yours. Good. Now let that energy go. Just release it into your cosmic energy or down your grounding and out of your space. Say to yourself, "in accordance with my seniority, I command all foreign energies to release now. In accordance with my seniority, I command all foreign energies to release now." Just feel. Just feel the energy leaving. Feel yourself returning to your true energy. Take a deep breath. Feel your aura boundary around you, really well defined with your seniority and your ability to choose. Just admire your own boundary and say, "I love my seniority and boundaries. I love choosing my space." Smile. Very good. And open your eyes.

LESSON 22: Be A Healthy Boundary Ninja

  ---------------------------------------------
  <v ->Welcome back, give yourself a deep
  breath. And as we begin, please remember
  you’re grounding and relax into the center of
  your head. Notice your Earth and Cosmic
  energy running. Feel your aura around you and
  say hello to the group energy, send some
  smiles and hellos to your fellow students and
  feel the group energy and intention
  supporting you. Last lesson, you learned how
  to clear foreign energy. This is great for
  when you notice foreign energy in your space,
  but wouldn’t it be better if you didn’t
  absorb that energy in the first place? So
  permission is the key concept for making this
  happen. So our focus today is the permission
  rose. A permission rose helps you
  automatically maintain your aura boundary and
  Seniority. It helps you keep yourself from
  absorbing other people’s energy and it helps
  you stay sensitive to communication and
  understanding. To create one, you just
  imagine a rose at arm’s length from your
  body, right out here at the edge of your
  aura. This is a good aura boundary distance
  and it can be facing up, it could be facing
  out either way is okay. And this rose
  symbolizes permission. You have a hundred
  percent permission to have all the energy
  inside between you and the rose. You have
  your Seniority. And when you meet someone
  else, they have a hundred percent permission
  to have the energy outside the rose. The
  permission rose is all about non-resistance.
  I have my space and you have your space. I
  want this much space in my aura, but you can
  have the rest of the universe. This is a very
  generous offer. If you encounter someone, you
  do have resistance to, you can just imagine
  this rose is out here. It’s kind of like a
  polite way of saying talk to the rose. You
  don’t have to match or absorb their energy.
  The permission rose is also flexible. When
  someone comes close, it stays halfway between
  you and them. And as they leave it springs
  back to arm’s length. In this way, you always
  have your space. And even though it’s in
  front, your permission rose works 360 degrees
  all around you. I also like to set my
  permission rose so that others get a copy of
  it when we meet. This helps spread permission
  throughout the world, in our work and
  relationships and so on. So what happens if
  the rose starts to get old or it starts to
  fade or filled with energy that you want to
  release? You don’t have to water it or try to
  fix it. You just kind of pop it, let it
  release. And then you create a new one with
  your imagination. And when I teach this live,
  it’s really easy to see the results. I’ll ask
  for a volunteer from the audience. I’ll say,
  “is there anybody that’s sensitive and
  doesn’t like it when people stand too close?”
  A few people raise their hands and I’ll say,
  “Great, you’re my volunteer”, which of
  course, they wish they hadn’t raised their
  hand then. And then they get on stage. And I
  have them just kind of be their normal
  energy. And I stand back maybe 10 feet or 15
  feet or a few meters. And then I walk up to
  them bit by bit and ask them how they feel.
  And usually by the time I’m even two arm’s
  length away, the person is starting to lean
  back, look tense, maybe kind of a little bit
  rigid. And everybody in the audience can see
  it. It’s just automatic because they’re
  sensitive. And then I have them imagine they
  have a rose and it’s set to a hundred percent
  permission for them to have their space and a
  hundred percent permission for me to have my
  space. And then I walk up and in the same
  way. And it’s remarkable that you’ll notice
  that I can walk all the way up to the person,
  even very close, walk around them. And they
  don’t have that response at all. Now, of
  course you might be thinking that’s ’cause
  it’s the second time I walked up, right? So
  then I have them get rid of the rose. I go
  back and we do it again. And they’re still
  just as sensitive as they were before. So
  it’s a great demonstration. Now, I’ve also
  had some really fun results from my Tokyo
  students on the train. Some people say, “I
  hate being on the train.” It’s just too many
  people. It’s so crowded and they just can’t
  stand it. And I say, “No problem, just put
  that rose right up against you. In fact, you
  could put two or three all around you and
  just report back and let me know how it
  feels.” And it’s really fun. I’ve heard so
  many stories that, oh, that worked great. Now
  I have a rose and I don’t mind being on the
  train at all. So really good tool. And a rose
  works great when you usually feel over
  sensitive, when you put up that rose, now,
  all of a sudden you feel safe. And of course
  it works the other way, too. If you’re
  overbearing energetically, that rose will
  help you find your balance. So how else does
  a permission rose change your experience?
  Let’s take a look. So without a rose, you’re
  becoming their energy, but with the rose,
  you’re just perceiving energy. So you’re
  getting all the communication, but you’re not
  merging with that other person or energy.
  Without a rose you automatically match
  somebody else’s space. But with the rose, you
  hold your own space. This is a very different
  feeling. Let’s say you meet a woman at work
  and she is enthusiastically talking to you.
  She wants to share some information, wants to
  impress you with something. And as she’s
  talking to you, if you don’t have good
  boundaries, that’s exactly what will happen.
  She will impress her energy on you. And then
  when she leaves, you’ll be thinking, wow, she
  really impressed me. Now, rewind now imagine
  the same scenario, but you have a permission
  rose. So you have permission to have your
  space, your feelings, your understanding and
  she has permission to have hers. When this
  woman comes up and has the same conversation
  when she leaves, you’ll be thinking something
  like, well, she really wanted to impress me.
  See, you got all the same information, but a
  very different feeling. You didn’t become her
  energy. This is a really subtle but important
  difference. Also without a rose, you tend to
  react unconsciously. And with the rose you
  act consciously. Without it, you might feel
  like a victim energetically and with it, you
  have your Seniority. Now keep in mind that
  permission is the key concept here. If you’re
  sensitive, you probably feel like you need to
  protect yourself. But if you’re imagining a
  protection rose instead, you may get very
  different energy. So let’s look at the
  differences. So protection is very rigid and
  permission is very flexible. Protection is
  temporary. It breaks very easily and
  permission is lasting and durable. Protection
  takes effort and stress. It’s lots of work to
  maintain protection, but permission is easy
  and graceful. Protection feels guarded so you
  can stop some of those positive experiences
  from coming in too where permission is very
  allowing. Protection is really based in
  scarcity and permission is based in
  abundance. There’s plenty of energy and
  plenty of space for everyone. And using a
  permission rose will gradually help you
  increase the abundance in your life. So next,
  I want to share an exercise that I think
  you’re really going to enjoy. And I want you
  to try it out throughout your day. It’s
  really fun. It’s called Being the Energy
  Ninja and the inspiration from this comes
  from those old movies with ninjas. So just
  imagine there’s this old guy, this ninja and
  he’s kind of relaxed and calm, but there’s 10
  other people around him trying to attack him.
  And there are younger and bigger and stronger
  and have bigger weapons but he doesn’t seem
  concerned at all. He looks like he’s
  completely unbothered. Like he hasn’t have a
  care in the world. And as a blow comes in, he
  just kind of steps aside and someone falls or
  it turns a little bit and the weapon misses
  him. Maybe he ducks and someone goes flying
  over. It might give somebody a little gentle
  nudge and they go flying across the room. And
  no matter what they try and no one can touch
  this ninja. And what I love about this scene
  is that the ninja isn’t attacking anyone and
  he’s not even really defending himself. He’s
  just vibrating internally and externally at
  permission and Seniority. This is the best
  example I can give you. And he knows that he
  is senior in his space and is expressing it
  physically too. No effort, very graceful, not
  angry or mean or judgemental. It’s just a
  beautiful vision. And this is what I want you
  to feel like with your energy. You are an
  energy ninja and your weapon of choice is the
  permission rose. So people’s energy just
  stops at the rose as they get close, Your
  rose naturally comes close and as they leave
  your rose naturally springs back, you always
  have your space. Gracefully and without
  resistance. To help you feel this experience,
  I want to do a guided journey together. So
  just get comfortable and ready to meditate.
  Let’s begin. Again close your eyes. And
  remember your grounding. Feel that aura
  boundary around you. And let your awareness
  be in the center of your head with your
  analyzer, turned off. Okay, good now feel
  your Cosmic energy running. Just decide that
  it’s running even if you don’t feel it. And
  create a brand new permission rose for
  yourself, right in front of you, arm’s length
  from your body. As you look at that rose, let
  it remind you of your Seniority. You get to
  choose your experiences. Let this rose also
  vibrate at permission, you have a permission
  to have a hundred percent choice in the
  energy between you and that rose. Other
  people have a hundred percent permission to
  choose what happens outside of your aura. And
  as you do that, notice you’re just that
  setting with permission, suddenly your energy
  gets much stronger. It’s like you kind of
  come back ’cause now it’s safe. Very good and
  just feel yourself being very centered in the
  center of your aura for this exercise. And
  let that permission rose be flexible. So it
  can automatically adjust as needed between it
  can get closer to you. It can move around to
  the sides. Just flexible and automatic. And
  when it’s not needed, it’ll just kind of move
  back out to the front of your aura in front
  of you. Very good, now feel your aura
  adjusting to that rose. So it’s very
  well-defined, you know your boundary. And set
  your intention, that you are going to feel
  energy, you’re going to receive information
  from the world, but you’re not going to
  become it automatically. Very nice. Now
  imagine a typical day for yourself, who is
  the first person that you see? Just imagine
  seeing that person. And see a rose halfway
  between you and that person. As that person’s
  talking, see your rose vibrating at their
  energy, receiving that information and just
  decide, do you choose to match this energy?
  If it’s a yes, then feel energy coming in
  into your aura. And if it’s a no, just notice
  that energy stopping at the rose and not
  coming into your aura. Good, now see that
  person walking away. As they do so, your rose
  goes right back to the edge of your aura,
  arm’s length in front of you And a little
  copy of your permission rose goes with that
  other person. And now fast forward to some
  other time in your day, really see yourself,
  imagine yourself going about your day. And
  see somebody coming to you that’s not very
  happy. Maybe they’re frustrated or angry or
  sad. And as they come close to you, notice
  your rose adjusting. They come in really
  close, just still halfway between you and
  them. You still have a hundred percent
  permission to have your space. Notice that
  your rose is vibrating it’s Seniority, but
  it’s also vibrating their energy. So you can
  easily understand them without becoming them.
  Okay and just remember your Seniority,
  hundred percent permission to choose what
  comes into your aura. And see that person
  moving away. Your rose going back in front of
  you. And see them getting a little permission
  rose copy. Okay, breathe. Now, imagine that
  you’re walking in a busy place. There’s many
  people around you and they’re moving by you.
  And your permission rose is adjusting. You’re
  like that ninja, people are coming close, no
  problem. Your permission rose adjusts
  automatically. It’s no effort, no stress.
  Even if people get really close, you still
  have your space. As they move away, your
  space gets larger and adapts. So now let it
  get really busy. Maybe there’s a lot of
  people. Again, you’re just being that energy
  ninja, permission rose. Maybe you’ve got
  several of them just adjusting around your
  body. And you’re kind of amused. You’re
  feeling good. You’re still feeling like you,
  you can’t believe it. You have your space,
  even in this environment. And notice that
  you’re giving yourself a hundred percent
  permission to have your space and everybody
  else, a hundred percent permission to have
  theirs. And in this environment, rather than
  having a nothing coming into your aura, see
  if you can adjust for the energies that you
  like. Like, I want to be a little happier. I
  want to be a little more abundant. I want to
  feel a little sexier, whatever it’s that you
  want to absorb from your environment, set the
  rose, set your boundary so that that energy
  can come in and you can match that from the
  crowd. Just notice people around you and just
  observing only the parts that you want. Very
  good. Also see each person that gets near you
  getting their own permission rose, spreading
  that permission to the world around you.
  Okay, now let that visualization go just fast
  forward till the end of your day. Really
  congratulate yourself on having good
  boundaries for that day. Just imagine right
  now you’re tuning in and just noticing did I
  absorb anything that I don’t want or anything
  I don’t need? Because no matter how well you
  set your boundaries, some stuff is going to
  get in. You’re not going to be perfect and
  that’s okay. Just be that whatever is with
  you that you don’t want. Notice that it’s not
  yours. Give it permission to exist and
  permission to release. And just let it go.
  Now very good. So just breathe. Just let your
  aura return to all you just feels like you.
  Feel your Seniority. Just be excited about
  your ability to choose. When you’re ready,
  smile and open your eyes. Welcome back,
  you’re amazing. Now that you’re overflowing
  with permission, just enjoy your day. No
  effort, no tasks to perform. Just have fun
  exploring this new you. Enjoy!
  ---------------------------------------------
  <v ->Welcome back. Give yourself a deep
  breath. Remember your grounding cord.
  Remember the center of your head. Remember
  your Earth and Cosmic energy running.
  Remember your aura boundary and permission
  rose. It can be this easy to have your space
  and to have boundaries. Just remember. Today
  is our final talk on energy boundaries.
  You’re already looking more confident with
  your energy, but I want to give you some
  exercises and ideas for practicing with your
  boundaries in everyday life. And of course, I
  want to answer a few of the most common
  questions that I’ve been asked over the
  years. First, I’d like to thank you all for
  sharing with the group. It is so great to
  hear that the tools are working for you.
  That’s why I’m sharing them. So here’s one I
  received from the very first Duality group.
  So Maria said since creating my rose, I’ve
  had two very difficult days. Like the
  universe was testing me on a permission
  concept. Before, I was always trying to
  protect myself, as I’m very sensitive. This,
  however, is quite different now to everything
  I’ve tried before. And I love it already. I
  noticed today that people react to me
  differently, somehow more softly and
  friendly. And I didn’t feel like I needed to
  protect myself from them. I also noticed that
  I can stay calm with people that are agitated
  or stressed, and I’m able to stop some
  communication when I don’t like it without
  feeling guilty afterwards. Yeah, that’s
  great. We all have difficult days, and that’s
  when the energy tools really shine. That’s
  also why it’s important to practice so much
  on the easy days, so that the tools come
  naturally and easily when you really need
  them. I know some of you may still be worried
  that you’re not doing well enough with your
  tools, but please remember, you’re not
  expected to master every technique in a few
  days. Yes, I can teach them to you quickly,
  but it takes time and practice to master
  them. It’s like carpentry. I can teach you
  how to use a hammer and a saw and a paint
  brush or measuring tape, but I wouldn’t
  expect you to become a master carpenter
  overnight. The goal is really just to try out
  the tools so that you know what’s possible,
  and you’ll get better and better using them
  over time. So just relax and follow the
  program, and you’ll get better with the
  energy work as we go. A good daily practice
  is to notice how your aura responds to other
  people and places. You can try out different
  sizes and definition and permeability. And
  you need to practice to get some awareness,
  so just keep playing with it. At first, you
  may not be completely sure what you’re doing,
  but that awareness will come with time. I’d
  also like you to notice when you forget or
  give away your seniority. And no shame here,
  just simply reclaim your seniority. This
  always happens sometimes and it’s okay. And
  of course, be an energy ninja. Use a
  permission rose throughout your day and see
  permission spreading to everyone around you.
  Permission is contagious. It’s great. If you
  have a partner to practice with, you can try
  feeling each other’s aura, too. This is
  really easy. You just start by creating an
  energy ball between your hands to kind of
  open up your hand chakras and increase your
  sensitivity. And then you stand about 10, 15
  feet away. It’s like three or four meters.
  And just have your palms facing outward
  toward your partner like this. And just
  slowly walk toward your partner and notice
  what you feel. Most people feel a little
  tingling or some heat or some pressure in
  their hands. And just notice, when do you
  start feeling their aura? You can also notice
  if their aura is well-defined. Is it rigid or
  soft or uncertain? Did they adjust their aura
  as you moved? Try again with a rose and a
  well-defined aura boundary, and you’ll notice
  a little difference. If you can’t feel
  anything, you might actually need to back up.
  Some people have really large auras
  naturally. And then of course, switch with
  your partner and have them try it too. This
  is a really fun exercise that’ll really help
  you understand the aura on a different level.
  I also like you to start noticing when you
  have poor boundaries and adjust accordingly.
  If you’re feeling uncomfortable, adjust your
  aura. If you’re feeling angry, like your
  boundaries have been crossed, ask yourself
  those four questions. If you’re holding a
  grudge against somebody, just let that energy
  go. If you’re feeling some drama, just stop
  passing around the drama energy. If you’re
  feeling kind of wishy-washy, take a stance,
  and if you’re easily affected by others,
  think, that’s not like me, that’s a good sign
  that you’re matching somebody else. You can
  also notice if you’re talking or addressing
  like your friend and remember to be yourself.
  Now, this one really makes me laugh, because
  I did this in Sedona. My good friend John
  Dumas is an amazing shaman and musician and
  sound healer, and he’s got these amazing
  clothes to go with it. And so I tried to
  mimic this, but it didn’t really match my
  energy. It’s better to admire his style than
  admire my own style too. And as you do this,
  you’ll start to experience all these benefits
  of good boundaries: better understanding of
  yourself, feeling empowered with seniority,
  having more experiences that truly fulfill
  you, and less things are bothering you. You
  get to live your dreams more quickly, because
  you’re living by your own rules, less
  struggle and drama and wasted energy. Having
  good energy boundaries can improve your work
  situation too. Just notice how clear your
  communication gets with your colleagues, or
  you’re having less time spent on other
  people’s tasks. And try using a permission
  rose for your email and phone calls and video
  chats. It works great there too. And as you
  get the hang of using your permission rose
  and having strong boundaries, you’ll notice
  one surprise benefit too. People will find
  you more approachable. You know, where you
  stand, so they feel more comfortable, and
  they’ll find you more attractive too. Nothing
  is sexier than being yourself. And speaking
  of sexy, many students have asked about
  merging of auras. So when you’re hugging or
  maybe an intimate moment, or even in a family
  situation or when you’re sleeping. And this
  is fine too, but it’s something that will
  happen automatically naturally, when you’re
  close with people emotionally. You don’t have
  to try to merge your aura in these
  situations. And even if you are in a deep
  embrace, I recommend having a permission rose
  between you. It just makes it easier to
  return to your space with clarity. Big
  gatherings are a great place to use a
  permission rose too, especially if someone
  insists on that awkward,
  let’s-all-go-around-and-introduce-ourselves
  thing. Have you ever noticed yourself getting
  more and more nervous as you wait for your
  turn? That’s because you’re matching and
  merging with everyone else’s nervousness. You
  might want to hand out a rose to everybody
  there and just see what happens. I should
  mention too, that it’s okay to use another
  flower or another symbol if a rose doesn’t
  feel good to you. A rose is an ancient symbol
  of having your space and being part of the
  whole. But it’s the energy and intention that
  matters, not the rose. So you can create a
  permission tulip, if you like. Now, if you do
  change this, please choose something which is
  flexible and graceful. Don’t make a
  permission battle shield. One final reminder
  to practice, practice, practice, one slow,
  deep practice per day to deepen your skills
  and then quick reminders throughout your day
  to build easy habits. I promise you if you
  really use these tools, you can expect big
  results in your life. Seniority, permission,
  clear boundaries. These are life-changing,
  especially if you’re sensitive like me. These
  tools completely changed my life, and I hope
  you’ll have fun with them too. And also
  remember, you’re not in this alone. The group
  energy is supporting your journey. So let’s
  end today’s session by connecting with each
  other and sharing our progress and enthusiasm
  energetically. So go ahead and take a deep
  breath and close your eyes. Feel everyone in
  the Duality training. Present time, past
  time, and future students too, and send them
  all a hello right now. Let yourself receive
  those hellos. You are an important part of
  the group energy. Remember your grounding,
  center of your head, and your Earth and
  Cosmic energy running, and create a brand-new
  permission rose in present time. And admire
  your beautiful boundaries. And from the
  group, notice someone else’s rose that you
  also admire and let your rose say hello to
  their rose. Feel their energy, but maintain
  your own. Notice the bright, beautiful bubble
  of energy all around the group, and ground
  that bubble in the group. Energetically put
  everything you’ve learned about boundaries
  and seniority into one more rose out in front
  of you. All your insights, all your aha
  moments, share them in a rose. Go ahead and
  give this rose to the group and let yourself
  receive all the permission roses from
  everybody else. Feel free to keep them or put
  them back in the circle. Now release any
  stress, anxiety, or unanswered questions from
  this chapter. Just release them into the
  group grounding. And know that you are caught
  up energetically with chapter four. Feel
  confident, relaxed, and clear, ready to keep
  growing and learning. Notice your intention
  for your boundaries and add your intention to
  the group energy. Here’s mine: May we each
  have our space. May I be a clear channel for
  all energy and information that comes
  through. May we all have fun, grow and feel
  great together. Send one more hello and smile
  to the group. You are in the right place. On
  your next breath, open your eyes. Amazing.
  Look at all those roses. Permission,
  permission, permission! I love it. Have a
  beautiful day. Enjoy.

====================

LESSON 22 - MEDITATION: Practice meditation 4: choosing your space

- Find a point across the room where your eyes rest naturally. Focus on the point and breathe with your eyes closed. Notice your grounding cord connecting you deep into the earth. Feel that earth energy returning up into your feet, and your legs, and your root chakra. Turn your analyzer off and be in the center of your head. Feel the cosmic energy flowing down the back of your body, up the front of your body, down each arm, and out the hands, and showering out the top of your head in all directions. Without changing it, notice where your aura is right now. Is it large or small? Is it well-defined or gradual? Does energy flow easily in and out of your aura? Don't judge yourself, just notice. Adjust your aura now to arm's length from your body on all sides. Be relaxed and centered in your aura. As your aura gets more defied, feel your boundaries becoming more clear. Notice how easy it is to tell the difference between yourself and others. Notice if you're feeling defensive, feeling like an energy sponge, or somewhere in between. Adjust your aura to a nice balance where you can feel the world, but not lose track of yourself. Create a brand-new permission rose at arm's length in front of you right at the edge of your aura. Let the rose vibrate at permission and seniority. Give yourself permission to have a hundred percent of the space between the rose and your body. Give everyone else a hundred percent permission to have all the space outside your aura. Breathe. Notice any energy in your aura, which doesn't feel good to you. Did you forget that you have a choice? Where did you give away your seniority? Smile and remember that you have a choice. Gently say, "I declare that I have seniority in my space." Feel your aura with vibrating at seniority. Forgive anyone else involved in this energy and take complete responsibility for your space. Breathe. Give the foreign energy permission to exist outside your aura. Let it release into the cosmic energy, or down your grounding. Feel this energy leaving as you get more relaxed and more clear. Smile. Bring your awareness to the permission rose in front of you. Let it be flexible and spring-loaded, adjusting automatically halfway between you and anyone close to you. Feel your clear aura boundary all around you. Visualize yourself meeting someone today. See your permission rose greeting that person, giving them a hundred percent permission to have their space. As they get closer, feel your rose adjusting to maintain your space. while the person talks to you, feel your whole aura vibrating at seniority. You get to choose your experience today. Notice how good and easy that feels. Breathe. As the other person leaves, feel your permission rose adjust back to arm's length from your body. See the other person receiving a copy of your permission rose. Allow them to carry this permission out into the world. Bring your awareness back to present time. Remember your grounding, your earth, and cosmic energy running. Feel yourself powerfully present in your body, in your aura, with your seniority. Say, "I love my seniority and clear boundaries. I love choosing my space." Be in the center of your head. Find that point across the room. When you're ready, breathe and open your eyes.

LESSON 22 - MEDITATION: Guided journey 4: being an energy ninja

- Go ahead and close your eyes and remember your grounding. Feel that aura boundary around you. And then let your awareness be in the center of your head with your analyzer turned off. Okay, good. Now, feel your cosmic energy running. Just decide that it's running, even if you don't feel it. And create a brand-new permission rose for yourself right in front of you, arm's length from your body. As you look at that rose, let it remind you of your seniority. You get to choose your experiences. Let this rose also vibrate at permission. You have a permission to have a hundred percent choice in the energy between you and that rose. Other people have a hundred percent permission to choose what happens outside of your aura. And as you do that, notice just that setting with permission, suddenly your energy gets much stronger. It's like you kind of come back because now it's safe. Okay, very good. And just feel yourself being very centered right in the center of your aura for this exercise. And let that permission rose be flexible so it can automatically adjust as needed between. It can get closer to you. It can move around to the sides. It's just flexible and automatic. And when it's not needed, it'll just kind of move back out to the front of your aura in front of you. Very good. Now, feel your aura adjusting to that rose. So it's very well defined. You know your boundary. And set your intention that you are going to feel energy. You're going to receive information from the world, but you're not going to become it automatically. Okay, nice. Now, imagine a typical day for yourself. Who is the first person that you see? Just imagine seeing that person and see your rose halfway between you and that person. As that person's talking, see your rose vibrating at their energy. Receiving that information. And just decide, do you choose to match this energy? If it's a yes, then feel that energy coming in into your aura. And if it's a no, just notice that energy stopping at the rose and not coming into your aura. Good. Now, see that person walking away. And as they do so, your rose goes right back to the edge of your aura, arm's length in front of you. And a little copy of your permission rose goes with that other person. Okay now, fast forward to some other time in your day. Really see yourself. Imagine yourself going about your day. And see somebody coming to you that's not very happy. Maybe they're frustrated or angry or sad. And as they come close to you, notice your rose adjusting. If they come in really close, it's just still halfway between you and them. You still have a hundred percent permission to have your space. And notice that your rose is, it's vibrating its seniority, but it's also vibrating at their energy so you can easily understand them without becoming them. Okay, and just remember your seniority. Hundred percent permission to choose what comes into your aura. And see that person moving away. Your rose going back in front of you. And see them getting a little permission rose copy. Okay, breathe. Now, imagine that you're walking in a busy place. There's many people around you and they're moving by you. And your permission rose is adjusting. You're like that ninja. People are coming close with no problem. Your permission rose adjusts automatically. There's no effort, no stress. Even if people get really close, you still have your space. And as they move away, your space gets larger and adapts. And so, now let it get really busy. Maybe there's a lot of people. Again, you're just being that energy ninja. Permission rose, maybe you've got several of them just adjusting around your body. And you're kind of amused. You're feeling good. You're still feeling like you. You can't believe it. You have your space even in this environment. And notice that you're giving yourself a hundred percent permission to have your space and everybody else a hundred percent permission to have theirs. And in this environment, rather than having a nothing coming into your aura, see if you can adjust for the energies that you like. Like, I want to be a little happier. I want to be a little more abundant. I want to feel a little sexier. Whatever it is that you want to absorb from your environment, set the rose, set your boundary so that that energy can come in and you can match that from the crowd. And just notice people around you. Just absorbing only the parts that you want. Very good. Also, see each person that gets near you getting their own permission rose, spreading that permission to the world around you. Okay, now let that visualization go. Just fast forward till the end of your day. Really congratulate yourself on having good boundaries for that day. And just imagine right now you're tuning in and just noticing, ah, did I absorb anything that I don't want or anything I don't need? Because no matter how well you set your boundaries, you know some stuff is going to get in. You're not going to be perfect, and that's okay. Just be amused at the whatever is with you that you don't want. Notice that it's not yours. Give it permission to exist and permission to release. And just let it go. Ah, very good. So just breathe. Just let your aura return to all you. Just feels like you. Feel your seniority. Just be excited about your ability to choose. And when you're ready, smile and open your eyes.
====================

  LESSON 24: Healthy Personal Boundaries:
  Self-Practice Day
  ---------------------------------------------

<v ->Welcome back. Today is your self-practice day. You have all the
information and tools you need, and now it’s time to apply them. We’re
going to listen to the practice meditation together right now, and then
take the day to really enjoy practicing your energy tools in your life.
This is your chance to refine and integrate your practice. Let’s begin.
Find a point across the room where your eyes rest naturally. Focus on
the point and breathe your eyes closed. Notice your grounding cord
connecting you deep into the Earth. Feel that Earth energy returning up
into your feet and your legs and your root chakra. Turn your analyzer
off and be in the center of your head. Feel the Cosmic energy flowing
down the back of your body, up the front of your body, down each arm and
out the hands, and showering at the top of your head in all directions.
Without changing it, notice where your aura is right now. Is it large or
small? Is it well-defined or gradual? Does energy flow easily in and out
of your aura? Don’t judge yourself, just notice. Adjust your aura now to
arm’s length from your body on all sides. Feel relaxed and centered in
your aura. As your aura gets more defined, feel your boundaries becoming
more clear. Notice how easy it is to tell the difference between
yourself and others. Notice if you’re feeling defensive, feeling like an
energy sponge, or somewhere in between. Adjust your aura to a nice
balance where you can feel the world but not lose track of yourself.
Create a brand new Permission Rose at arms length in front of you right
at the edge of your aura. Let the rose vibrate at permission and
Seniority. Give yourself permission to have a hundred percent of the
space between the rose and your body. Give everyone else a hundred
percent permission to have all the space outside your aura. Breathe.
Notice any energy in your aura which doesn’t feel good to you. Did you
forget that you have a choice? Where did you give away your Seniority?
Smile, and remember that you have a choice. Gently say, I declare that I
have Seniority in my space. Feel your aura vibrating at Seniority.
Forgive anyone else involved in this energy and take complete
responsibility for your space. Breathe. Give the foreign energy
permission to exist outside your aura. Let it release into the Cosmic
energy or down your grounding. Feel this energy leaving as you get more
relaxed and more clear. Smile. Bring your awareness to the Permission
Rose in front of you. Let it be flexible and spring loaded, adjusting
automatically halfway between you and anyone close to you. Feel your
clear or a boundary all around you. Visualize yourself meeting someone
today. See your Permission Rose greeting that person giving them a
hundred percent permission to have their space. As they get closer, feel
your rose adjusting to maintain your space. While the person talks to
you, feel your whole aura vibrating at Seniority. You get to choose your
experience today. Notice how good and easy that feels. Breathe. As the
other person leaves, feel your Permission Rose adjust back to arms
length from your body. See the other person receiving a copy of your
Permission Rose. Allow them to carry this permission out into the world.
Bring your awareness back to present time. Remember your grounding, your
Earth and Cosmic energy running. Feel yourself powerfully present in
your body, in your aura, with your Seniority. Say, I love my Seniority
and clear boundaries. I love choosing my space. Be in the center of your
head. Find that point across the room. When you’re ready, breathe and
open your eyes.

Part 5: Use Your Chakras to Communicate & Manifest Better

====================

LESSON 25: Why Do We Get Stuck In Old Patterns?

<v ->Welcome, everyone. It’s Jeffrey Allen again. As we begin, please
notice your grounding. Be in the center of your head. And notice your
earth and cosmic energy running. Create a brand new permission rose in
front of you. And say hello to the group energy. Send smiles and hellos
to your fellow students and feel the group energy and intentions
supporting you. Good. We are officially halfway through the training.
Great job. I just want to acknowledge how far you’ve come already.
You’ve already learned how to ground and be present in your body. You’ve
learned how to balance your analyzer and calm your mind, and you know
how to heal and energize your body, and you’re building healthy
boundaries and seniority. This is great. Each of these big topics has
broad applications in your life. And from here on in, we’re going to get
deeper into the details. I’m really excited. So some of you have asked,
how do I see the group energy? What does it look like to me? And it’s a
little hard to describe, but today, using a new technology, we took an
actual image of the duality group energy. And I want to share it with
you right now. Let’s zoom in a little, try to find your own face. Does
this look familiar? Personal growth is like riding a roller coaster. In
the beginning, you’re going up a big scary hill and in the middle
there’s this big exciting drop. And the ending is very fun, but it goes
really quickly and you think, wow, that was so fast. I wanted to keep
going. So right now, 80% of the train is headed down that big hill. The
big scary climb is behind you and it’s faster and more fun from here.
But 20% of you are still in those last few cars. You’re still climbing
up and you’re being pulled along by the group. And you might feel like
you’re being dragged through your stuff if this is you, but all you have
to do is hang on and the group momentum will lift you over the top. Now,
if you’re in those back cars, I encourage you to hang in there. If you
give up now, you’ll just sink backwards down the hill and have to start
all over again. I don’t want to see that happen. I want you to get to
that fun last third part and I want you to know I can do it. So don’t
worry. If you’re in the last few cars, just the luck of the draw. And
it’s always a little crazier ride in the back car, so just hang on and
enjoy. In this chapter, we’re talking about your chakra energy, in
particular, you’ll learn how working with your chakras can be key to
changing your old patterns. Now, we all know that changing our old
patterns is hard. Once we’ve established a pattern, it tends to repeat.
And despite our best efforts, we tend to see the same problems over and
over with our relationships and our money and our health. And the more
times something repeats, it’s harder to change. This can be incredibly
frustrating because we desperately want to change, but we don’t know
how. It’s like a river digging a deeper and deeper path each time until
sometimes it feels like we’ve dug the Grand Canyon. So think about your
life for a moment. What old patterns do you feel stuck in? What canyons
have you dug for yourself? Working with your chakras can definitely
help. So let’s look at some of the most common deep patterns for
relationships and for manifesting. Let’s say you get into a new
relationship and the beginning is great. It’s just easy and fun. And
your new partner is different. They’re really attentive. They’re buying
you flowers and texting and giving you their undivided attention. And
you’re feeling confident about yourself and you’re just glowing. You
think, ah, this, maybe this is the one. And of course, you know that you
tend to rush into things, so you take it a little slower this time and
you even suggest a weekly friend’s night to hang out with your other
friends. And it’s working. A few months later, you don’t notice, but you
start unconsciously slipping in your old patterns. What you do notice is
your partner’s old patterns. They’re paying less attention to you.
Always working, no more flowers, less text messages, and they’re not
really listening when you’re talking. You start to get a little insecure
and ask, do you love me? Do you love me? And you start wondering, wonder
what they’re really doing on that friend’s night. Maybe they met someone
else. Maybe it’s a good idea for me to check their phone or do a little
drive-by just to make sure. As this progresses, they get more distant.
And the more you chase, the more they run. Aha, I was right, something
must be happening. And then your partner suggests taking a break to
think about things, and your heart is broken. You have a big fight and
you break up and you’re left thinking, what’s wrong with me? Why is this
happening again? They’re just like all the others. Why do I always
attract the wrong person? Has anyone seen this pattern maybe in your
friends? So let’s look at the other side of this equation. Let’s imagine
you are the other partner, okay? So you get into a relationship and the
beginning is great and it’s easy and it’s fun and you really like this
person. They have this glow about them and you really want it to work.
But even though you’re a workaholic, so you put in a little extra effort
at first, you take some time off, you send flowers, you send little text
messages, and you really pay attention to them and you’re having fun and
it’s really working. You think, wow, they’re different. They seem really
cool. They don’t mind that I’m spending time with my other friends. This
is great. Then a few months later, you don’t notice, but you start
unconsciously slipping into your old patterns. Your work is really busy
and you miss a few dates. You don’t have time for flowers and texting
anymore. You figure that doesn’t really matter because the relationship
is really good. And you notice you’re starting to get distracted during
conversations. You’re having a hard time focusing on your partner and
you think, maybe I’m not really into them anymore. They seem to have
lost that glow that I really love. And then out of the blue, your
partner starts getting needy and suspicious and asking you funny
questions. Your friends even see them doing a drive-by on friend’s night
and you’re frustrated and you think, I’m too busy for this. Why didn’t
it just stay easy? So you suggest taking a couple weeks off while you
finish your project so you can sort this out when your head is more
clear, but your partner breaks down, accuses you of having an affair and
you have a big fight and you break up and you’re left thinking, why
didn’t I see this coming? They’re just like all the others. Why is this
happening again? Why do I always attract the wrong person? What’s wrong
with me? So has anybody seen this pattern? Or if you’re highly empathic
like me, maybe you’ve been on both sides of this pattern. So what’s
happening energetically? This is not a gender problem. It’s not a
personality problem. This is an energy problem. You were both initially
aware of your energy pattern. I tend to rush in or I’m a workaholic, and
you compensated for it physically. Why? Because you’re both motivated,
but you both slipped back into your old patterns. Why? Because you
didn’t understand and address the energy. You just tried hard to be
different, which never lasts. You also both thought that it was about
the other person. You misread the warning signs and thought it’s them.
But you thought the same thing last time. This perception is your
pattern too. You got the same results because you didn’t change your
energy pattern and it’s going to happen again unless you understand your
energy and change that pattern. This is where a little chakra adjustment
can really help. Let’s look at another common pattern which relates to
your chakras. This one in business. Let’s say you have a great business
idea. It’s brilliant. You can’t believe no one has done this yet. And
you think through all the details, doing some research and getting
inspired and really brainstorming, and you write down a bunch of notes
and you talk to your friends and you really understand clearly how this
can happen. And you’re super excited about it. You are sure it’s going
to be a huge success. You can visualize all those happy customers and
success and money, and you take an exciting first step. You find that
perfect domain name or get an awesome logo made, and then nothing. You
get distracted by another brilliant idea. And a year later, the domain
name is expiring and you’re wondering if you should renew. And you’re
looking at your list of 20 domain names for awesome ideas, and you’re
thinking, why did this happen again? So you take a business class and
then you repeat the same cycle and repeat it again and again and again.
Has anyone done this? So this is not a business expertise problem. This
is a chakra and energy problem. And there are several variations of this
pattern too where we can’t bring our ideas into fruition. And we’ll
address these all in detail as you learn about the chakras. So why is
changing so hard? A couple reasons. First, you have momentum. Remember
that river flowing through that previous path just digging a deeper and
deeper channel each time? Your energy is the same way, leaving a path.
And the clues are in your chakras. Two, you try to change physically
instead of energetically. You address the external symptoms instead of
the internal cause because you don’t know about energy. This is a very
slow way to create change because you’re doing things backwards. The
physical is always the result and the energy is the cause. So it’s
energy first and then physical. Keep in mind that physical changes are
slow. It takes a long time to know if you made the right change. It also
requires more effort and unnatural action. You’re fighting your energy
pattern. Energy changes are faster and easier and you get a faster
turnaround time to success. You just need awareness and intention and
things can be quite easy. Now I’ll admit, even when you change the
energy, you don’t always get immediate results. It depends on the
opportunity, if the energy is available now or it’s available later.
Often it takes more than just one adjustment, but at least you can see
and feel your progress. Changing your internal energy naturally leads to
external change because your pattern has changed. Unfortunately, if you
don’t understand how to use your chakras, you tend to stay stuck in the
same frustrating patterns in your body and in your life. And this is
true for your body, emotions, relationships, money, and so on. You tend
to repeat the same miscommunication patterns with others. Why do I
attract the wrong person? Why do I get into power struggles? Why is it
hard to connect with other people? Why do people think I’m aloof? The
chakras are a really fun way to get deep, meaningful answers to all
these questions. You also tend to repeat the same difficulties with
manifesting your projects and your dreams. Why do I have tons of great
ideas but they never get started? Or why do my projects always start out
great but they never finish? So if you’ve ever wondered why is it
happening again, understanding your chakras can give you the answer.
When you understand how to use your chakras, you can change your
patterns. You can clear your deepest and most difficult energy blocks,
even if you couldn’t find them before. Getting out of the ruts in the
road feels great. And you can fundamentally change how you feel in and
out of relationships. You can change your relationship pattern, have an
easier connection and flow, be okay by yourself, less lonely or
dependent on others. And you can finally understand where your
manifestation is getting stuck and how to fix it. If you know your
weakness, you can learn to either change it, heal it, or delegate that
to somebody else. So you can receive all the abundance and flow that’s
waiting for you. This lets you start creating new, happier patterns in
yourself, your relationships, and your business. Truly, if you can
change your chakras, you can change your life. Whatever patterns you’re
struggling with, you can find the energy and start to change it. Now,
I’m not saying it’ll be easy or painless or instantaneous, but it will
be possible. Change can take some attention and time, but you’ll know
where to start and you can begin making progress. For big things, I find
that gentle change is actually okay. Fast can be kind of radical and
disruptive. So today think about your patterns, which things happen over
and over that you would like to change. And for now, just use the tools
you already have, ground yourself, ground the pattern, ground your
energy, and release your resistance. Give the pattern permission to
exist because it does and have compassion for your old patterns. It’s
okay, we all have them. Soon you’ll have the tools to change them.
Enjoy.

====================

LESSON 26: What Are The Chakras?

<v ->Welcome back. Give yourself a deep breath. And, as we begin, please
remember your grounding. Relax into the center of your head, and notice
your Earth and Cosmic energy running. Say hello to your permission rose,
and say hello to the group energy. Send smiles and hellos to your fellow
students, and feel the group energy and intention supporting you. Ah,
very good. To understand your chakras, first, think about your physical
body. Your physical body is organized with organs for complex functions,
like the liver, the heart, the brain, each with a different function,
and with glands, or simple organs, that synthesize and store fluids.
Your energy body is organized, too. Chakras are like the organs of the
energy body. We have seven main chakras in the body, and each one
processes a different kind of energy. You’ve already worked with the
root and the crown chakra. We also have minor chakras in our hands and
our feet and our knees that help adjust our energy flow. So what are
these chakras anyway, and why do we have them? To me, chakras are like
your personal orchestra. They’re listening attentively and sensitive to
the energy all around you. And they’re changing and adapting, adjusting
based on your programs. And they’re broadcasting energy, sending your
song back to the world. In this analogy, chakras are like speakers and
the aura is like music coming from the speakers. Chakras worked best in
harmony, like the strings on a guitar. They can sound fantastic if
tuned. Just imagine that really yummy person. They probably have tuned
chakras. And they can sound kind of horrible if they’re not tuned. Have
you ever thought, “Something’s off with that person”? It’s likely they
have a little stuck energy in a chakra. It’s probably not just a
personality problem. Just like having a string out of tune, if you’re
chakras are off, it just sounds wrong. But, like a guitar, it’s fixable.
Your chakras are always sending your song into the world, so you want
them to sound good, right? When we look at the seven main chakras, each
has a different function. As I describe them, just put your hands in
front of your chakra. Let yourself feel it as I talk and get an
experiential understanding. Okay, so the seven chakras are numbered from
bottom to top. The root chakra is down by the base of the spine, and it
has to do with physical survival, health and money. You really want to
have a solid foundation here, which is why we started with grounding,
working on that root chakra. Your second chakra is right here, kind of
in the navel, and it deals with emotions, sexuality, and vitality. And
as you tune into this chakra right now, just ask yourself, “Do I have a
powerful fire burning in me? Do I have that motivation and passion that
moves things forward?” That’s second chakra energy. The third chakra is
in the solar plexus, and this has to do with manifesting, personal
power, taking action, and control. As you feel it right now, notice what
your third chakra feels like. Does it feel like you can accomplish your
goals? Do you have the power needed to take action in the world? Your
fourth chakra is your heart chakra, and it has to do with love for
yourself and others. And as you feel it, just ask yourself, “Am I fully
able to give love? Am I fully able to receive love?” That’s the dominant
energy in the fourth chakra. Okay, moving up toward the throat, you’ll
find the fifth chakra, which governs communication. And as you feel it,
ask yourself, “Can I speak my truth? Do I feel free to say what I want
and not be afraid what others think?” That’s what a strong fifth chakra
feels like. The sixth chakra in the forehead is about intuition and
guidance. And, often, it’s called the third eye. So just feel it for
yourself right now and ask, “Do I feel confident that I can see energy
and understand energy and receive my guidance?” That’s all coming from
the sixth chakra. Your seventh chakra is your crown chakra. We work with
this for the Cosmic energy, and it has to do with inspiration and your
spiritual connection. So do I feel connected spiritually? The crown
chakra is also the gateway to the upper dimensions. You actually have 12
energy centers, but five of them are out of the body. And we don’t talk
about those very much, because we’re still trying to get a grasp of
these seven that are in the body, but you can explore those upper
chakras on your own if you like. Just feeling them. The seventh chakra
is also a little different because it faces upward, like a crown or a
halo, but you can also feel it front to back, just like the other
chakras. So, hopefully, you could feel the differences between your
chakras already, because they have different energies. Some might feel a
little stronger or a little weaker or be a little more clear or more
vague. And maybe you felt some that were a little out of tune. At this
point, just be curious about your chakras and we’ll learn to adjust them
later. While I personally think feeling your chakras is the best way to
master them, I want to share a little more detailed too, just to satisfy
your minds as well. But keep in mind that my cartoon sketches are not
meant to be accurate energy anatomy diagrams. I’m just pointing you in
the right direction so you can feel the details more easily on your own.
You might feel something different. Trust yourself. Your chakras are
energy centers for processing and storing information. They determine
how energy flows through you and show your energy flow history, like a
stream bed that channels and records the direction of the water. Your
chakras are like this, too. Each chakra is a spinning vortex of energy,
like an eddy in a stream. And, in general, they spin clockwise from the
front. So if you took your hand and ran it up your right side, you would
see them spinning in the right direction. So just remember right hand,
right side, right direction. But keep in mind that the chakras actually
spin in both directions. Just like everything in nature, every spin has
a counter-spin. So the inside of your chakras spin the other way. To me,
it feels like the energy kind of goes out with one spin and then back in
the counter-spin. Now, energy also radiates from the body in both
directions from your chakras, so out the front and out the back. It
tends to be a little smaller and stronger by the body and it gets larger
and more diffuse the farther away it goes, kind of like sound coming out
of a speaker. And like your aura, your chakras can reach very far away
from your body. But, mostly, you’ll feel them close to you. Remember, as
you feel your chakras, you might feel something different, which is
great. Just pat yourself on the back for feeling what’s really happening
and not being stuck in preconceived ideas. Do you remember the Cosmic
energy running down the back of the body and then up the front of the
body? I didn’t mention that the Cosmic energy is actually a two-lane
highway, because you could use it just fine without knowing that. But if
you look in more detail, you’ll see two energy channels moving down the
back and then two moving up the front of the body. Your chakras are
energized and cleaned by the Cosmic energy which connects to each side
of each chakra. So new energy goes in and refuels and old energy comes
out for healing. Again, a big warning here, don’t get hung up on all
these details. Your actual energy flow may vary. My artist’s depiction
is not meant to be taken literally. In general, energy flows this way,
but please don’t try to look exactly like my cartoons. Like you’re not a
cartoon, right? Just feel your energy and don’t think about it too much
and don’t force it to move in a particular way. So feeling your chakras
is really the best way to learn, so let’s try it. Just get in a
comfortable position and ready to meditate. Give yourself a deep breath
and close your eyes. Ground yourself, and feel your Earth energy running
and be in the center of your head with your analyzer off. Let your
awareness move up and back a little to the higher mind, and feel the
Cosmic energy coming into the crown chakra on the top of your head. And
notice, what does this seventh chakra, your crown chakra, feel like,
energetically, to you? Notice if it’s relaxed or tight or clear or
foggy. Is it bright or dim? Any answer is okay. You don’t need to fix
anything today. Just start being aware of your chakras. Now, notice your
Cosmic energy running down your bank in two channels, flowing all the
way from the seven chakra down the back and into the root chakra, or the
first chakra near the base of the spine. And notice, how does your first
chakra feel to you? Is it relaxed, bright, clear? Don’t guess the
meaning, just feel the energy and let a little Cosmic energy flow
through this chakra, clearing and healing it. And feel the Cosmic energy
moving up the two channels and into the second chakra by the navel. And
how does this chakra feel to you? Is it relaxed, bright, clear, or
something else? The second chakra rules emotions, sexuality, and
vitality. Let a little Cosmic energy flow through, healing and clearing
the chakra. And feel that Cosmic energy continuing up to the third
chakra, the solar plexus. And notice how this chakra feels to you,
relaxed, clear, bright, powerful, something else? The third chakra
relates to action and personal powering. Let a little Cosmic energy flow
through the chakra, healing it and clearing it, energizing it. Feel the
Cosmic energy continuing up to the fourth chakra, the heart chakra. And
notice how this chakra feels to you. Your fourth chakra relates to love.
How does this chakra feel? Let a little Cosmic energy flow through your
heart chakra, clearing it and recharging it. And feel the Cosmic energy
continuing up into your fifth chakra, your throat chakra. And notice,
how does this chakra feel to you, relaxed, bright, clear, stuck,
something else? Your fifth chakra relates to communication. Let a little
Cosmic energy flow through it now, healing it and recharging the chakra.
Feel the Cosmic energy continuing up into the sixth chakra, your third
eye. And notice how this chakra feels to you. The six chakra relates to
intuition and guidance. Let a little Cosmic energy flow through the
chakra, clearing it and recharging it. And feel that Cosmic energy
flowing upward, out the crown chakra again, showering down all around
you on all the sides of your aura. Very good. Now, let’s harmonize your
chakras and put your right hand down by your right hip and just spin all
seven chakras with your hands. So move your hand upward along the side
of your body spinning all the chakras right now. Feel your unique song
radiating from you, and feel the Cosmic energy amplifying your song.
Yeah, I love my chakras. I love being in harmony. Give yourself a deep
breath and open your eyes. Welcome back. I hope you’re getting a taste
for your chakras and how they feel, first, with your hands, and second,
during the meditation. I’d like you to keep tuning in gently to your
chakras today, just where they are and how they feel and how they
respond to others. Just be curious and enjoy learning about yourself

LESSON 26 - MEDITATION: feeling your chakras

- Ground yourself and feel your earth energy running. And be in the center of your head with your analyzer off. Let your awareness move up and back a little to the higher mind, and feel the cosmic energy coming into the crown chakra on the top of your head. And notice what does this seventh chakra, your crown chakra, feel like energetically to you. Notice if it's relaxed or tight or clear or foggy. Is it bright or dim? Any answer is okay. You don't need to fix anything today. Just start being aware of your chakras. Now, notice your cosmic energy running down your back in two channels, flowing all the way from the seventh chakra down the back and into the root chakra, or the first chakra, near the base of the spine. And notice, how does your first chakra feel to you? Is it relaxed, bright, clear? Don't guess the meaning. Just feel the energy and let a little cosmic energy flow through this chakra, clearing and healing it. And feel the cosmic energy moving up the two channels and into the second chakra by the navel. And how does this chakra feel to you? Is it relaxed, bright, clear, something else? The second chakra rules emotions, sexuality, and vitality. Let a little cosmic energy flow through, healing and clearing the chakra, and feel that cosmic energy continuing up to the third chakra, the solar plexus. And notice how this chakra feels to you. Relaxed, clear, bright, powerful, something else. The third chakra relates to action and personal power. Let a little cosmic energy flow through the chakra, healing it and clearing it, energizing it. Feel the cosmic energy continuing up to the fourth chakra, the heart chakra, and notice how this chakra feels to you. The fourth chakra relates to love. How does the chakra feel? Let a little cosmic energy flow through your heart chakra, clearing it and recharging it, and feel the cosmic energy continuing up into your fifth chakra, your throat chakra. And notice how does the chakra feel to you? Relaxed, bright, clear, stuck. Something else. Your fifth chakra relates to communication. Let a little cosmic energy flow it now, healing it and recharging the chakra. Feel the cosmic energy continuing up into the sixth chakra, your third eye, and notice how this chakra feels to you. The sixth chakra relates to intuition and guidance. Let a little cosmic energy flow through the chakra, clearing it and recharging it. And feel that cosmic energy flowing upward, out the crown chakra again, showering down all around you and all sides of your aura. Very good. Now let's harmonize your chakras. You can put your right hand down by your right hip and just spin all seven chakras with your hand. So move your hand upward along the side of your body, spinning all the chakras right now. Feel your unique song radiating from you and feel the cosmic energy amplifying your song. Hey, I love my chakras. I love being in harmony. Give yourself a deep breath and open your eyes.

====================

LESSON 27: How To Heal Your Chakras

<v ->Welcome back. Give yourself a deep breath. And as we begin, please
remember your grounding and your Earth energy. Relax into the center of
your head, and say hello to your permission rose. You can create a new
one if you need to. Notice your Cosmic energy running and energizing and
healing your chakras. And say hello to the group energy. Send smiles and
hellos to your fellow students, and feel the group energy and intention
supporting you. Nice. So today, we’ll talk about healing, your chakras.
So why is it important to heal your chakras? First, it’s great for
changing your momentum. Your energy tends to follow the same flow each
time like water running in a stream bed. And your chakras store this
momentum, so if you can change your momentum, you can change your life.
If you want to get different results in life, changing the flow of
energy in your chakras is the best way to do it because new energy
patterns lead to new results. Healing your chakras also helps restore
your natural harmony or your natural rhythm. Energy blocks can disrupt
this natural, balanced energy so things don’t work as smoothly as you
like. Now remember, your chakras are also connected to your body and
your organs. So if you keep your energy body clean, your physical body
will stay healthier too. And as I mentioned in chapter one, coherence
and resonance is healing. So all you have to do is get aligned, and
you’re automatically creating healing for yourself and for others too.
For healing the chakras, I like to use the following seven steps. Step
one, identify the underlying symptoms. So start with what you’re feeling
on the surface, and ask yourself, “Is this really my problem, or is it
something deeper?” So sometimes anger might be hiding sadness or maybe
some fear and so on. Step two, find an explore the energy behind it.
Just feel around in your energy. Where’s the problem? You might look for
color or texture or a shape or an emotion or a message or a timeframe,
or who’s the original owner of this energy. For example, I might just
feel, I’m feeling of sad. Where is it? Ah, it’s kind of down here, and
feels kind of maybe dark and fuzzy or a little hard, you know, something
like that. You don’t have to know the exact details. Just what does it
feel like to you? Now, step three is to give yourself permission to
heal. Can you let this go, or are you resisting or wondering if others
will approve? Step four is to clean the chakra with a rose. So similar
to the permission rose, you just create a little rose in front of you,
and it collects up the energy. So you can put that rose out in your aura
in front of you, and it’ll just kind of pull the energy out into the
rose, or you can take the rose and kind of move it into the chakra, into
the place in the body and like a little feather duster in the place that
you want to clear the energy. I like to make these kind of like a little
gold sticky rose, move them in and pull them out. So either way works
fine. Step five is to collect up any related energy, so any similar
energy or energy in a different place. And this really helps you expand
the healing and get it some places that are ready to release but maybe
haven’t turned into symptoms yet. So you just do the same thing; you
create that rose out in front of you, and let any related energy move
out into the rose. And then when you’re done, this is step six, you need
to release that energy. So you want to take this rose, and put it
outside your aura, and then just kind of pop it or blow it out, and let
the energy release. And let this be a really easy. You don’t have to
worry about the energy coming back or harming somebody. You just kind of
popping it and letting it go. Step seven is to fill in with Cosmic
energy. So just breathe in that self-love and compassion and gratitude
and joy. And this fills in all those valleys of those ruts in the road,
so that you can take a new path next time. Now you might be wondering,
why do we use a rose? So the rose is actually an ancient symbol for
having your space and being part of the whole, but it’s also the perfect
geometry of an expanding vortex, which naturally collects energy. But
it’s a lot easier for me to say, “Imagine a rose,” than to tell you,
“Imagine a rotating isometric vector matrix,” right. If I say that,
you’re just going to get confused. So I just say create a rose. But if
you don’t like roses, if you’re allergic to roses, you can just create a
big soap bubble out in front of you, just a little bubble of energy, and
let that absorb whatever’s releasing too. That’ll work just as well. All
right, now with chakra healing, it’s also important to clear any chakra
cords. So these are one-way chakra connections between two living
people, and they come into different flavors. You have the sort of
pulling energy or learning flavor where you’re trying to pull energy
from someone. You might think, “Wow, that person is so successful. I
want to be just like them,” so you put out a little cord unconsciously
and try to pull that energy from them. And if someone is doing this to
you, this flavor can feel like someone is kind of reeling you in or
draining your energy. The second kind of chakra cord is kind of a
pushing energy or a teaching flavor where you’re wanting to put some
energy into somebody. So that could be like, I really want you to
change, be happier, something, so I’m really cording you in a chakra,
trying to push that energy. And if somebody is doing this to you, this
kind of cord can feel like someone’s being pushy. Now, I want you to
keep in mind that chakra cords are rarely intentional or malicious.
People are not actively plugging into your chakras and pushing or
pulling energy. It’s happening automatically because we want something
or they want something. Now of course, it usually feels like it’s
intentional malicious, right? We think, “Oh, that person’s pulling on
me. They’re terrible, or they’re a mean person,” but that’s just a great
way to give up your seniority, right. So maybe you started this chord
and you don’t know it, or maybe you both agreed to it. It doesn’t really
matter. Just let go of that judgment. Another interesting thing about
cords is that chakra cords in the front are usually more conscious. So
maybe somebody is trying to help you. Might be a parent trying to push
you into being a doctor because it’s good for you, or it might be a
partner trying to pull on you. I want more love from you. I want more
energy and attention. Cords in the back of your body, the back of your
chakras, are more sneaky or kind of unconscious. So I want something
from you, but I don’t really know how to ask. Maybe I like you, but I’m
too embarrassed to say it. So I’m going to send a little cord to your
second chakra, fourth chakra in the back. And again, these are rarely
intentional. They’re just unconscious. People are not aware of what
they’re doing energetically most of the time. So don’t think, if you
find a cord, that the other person is a bad person in any way. In
general, adults don’t really need chakra cords so it’s safe and healthy
to remove these. A child to a parent is a little special case. Your
child really does need you to survive so they’re going to plug into you
in the root chakra, the first chakra, but don’t worry about that. It’s
fine. It’s automatic. Even if you did pull it out accidentally, it’s
just going to come right back because it’s natural for this to happen.
And usually about in the teenage years is when children start pulling
this back away from their parents, and you’ll know what’s happening
because if you have teenagers about that time, they’re going to be
saying, “I don’t really need you, Mom. I don’t really need you, Dad.”
And this is really healthy. What they’re doing is they’re just pulling
out that root chakra cord so they can continue to live their life on
their own. It’s a great thing. Just to let them go. Let them do it.
Again, if a chakra cord is a healthy agreement between two people, your
spirit will just recreate it anyway. So you don’t need to be worried
about over removing chords. It’s okay to just remove them when you find
them. Now, as I describe these, did you get a sense for any chakra cords
you might have? Is there someone pulling on you or pushing on you
energetically, or are you pulling on somebody else or pushing on them?
Who do you have unbalanced energy with? Does it feel like you initiated
that or that they initiated it or both? It’s kind of interesting to
consider, right? So it doesn’t really matter who started it when you’re
talking about cords because there’s always agreement. If you didn’t have
agreement for this cord to come in, it wouldn’t stick, right? Remember,
you have seniority. So if you find a chakra cord, how do you remove it?
It’s pretty simple, really. You just kind of put your hand on the chakra
cords and just feel them really gently. And then just give them a little
bit of time, and just let them release. And this works great for healing
yourself or healing others, too. And once it releases, you just kind of
let it go. So again, first you’re going to ask yourself which chakra is
affected here, or where do you feel the energy is moving. And you can
also kind of feel it with your hands. If you move your hand down like
this, sometimes you’ll feel like it feels like there’s a little
something funny here. Maybe there’s a little chakra cord here. And
again, you just kind of gently grab it with your hands and then pull it
out. Now, if you’re working with somebody else, you can do this
directly. So you can stand beside them, put one hand on each side, and
feel the cords and pull them out. And you can also do this with
yourself. You can imagine that there is a little you out in a front.
This is how I do it. And just kind of feel the chakras on both sides,
and just gently grab the chords, give them a moment to release
gracefully, and then just kind of let them go. And you can just do that
on the front and the back. It’s really easy. It just takes a few
moments. So the reason I say to pause and kind of let it release is that
you want to give these cords permission to exist and permission to
change. So don’t be really resistant or angry or frustrated or insulted
if somebody corded you. It’s just kind of an unconscious natural thing.
Just give it permission to exist. It’ll come out naturally. And this is
really a great way of forgiving yourself and forgiving the other person
too. It’s no big deal. You’re just getting unconscious and cording each
other. Okay, great. Yeah, you never want to really just yank a cord out.
You just want to do it gently. Once the cord comes out, I like to put it
in a rose, which gives it somewhere to go, and then just return that
energy to the center. So just let it go back to wherever it came from.
And you’re not harming anyone if you do this. You’re just returning
their energy, which is always a gift and always a healing. That’s it.
It’s that simple. Now, occasionally I’ll see a grounding cord
attachment, which is kind of similar. So this is where somebody wants to
borrow your grounding cord, and they’ve just plugged in to your
grounding. If you find this, you don’t want to have a tug of war for
your grounding and try to like, you know, hold them out of it. The
easiest thing is to just give them your grounding cord and then create a
new one for yourself because, you know, grounding cords are free, right.
And this happens a lot in emergencies. So if something scary happens, if
you’re in an Earthquake, or even sometimes if a loud noise happens in
the room, people will naturally reach out and grab the strongest
grounding cord. And if it’s you, just take that as a compliment. That
means you’re a grounding master, right? All right, so let’s give this a
try. Just get comfortable and ready to meditate. And I’ll guide you
through a healing for each chakra, and we’ll release any chakra cords,
which are ready to release too. So give yourself a deep breath, and
close your eyes. And first ground yourself. Feel that energy going from
the root chakra into the center of the Earth. Feel that Earth energy
coming back up through the feet chakras, that root chakra. Turn that
analyzer off. And then feel the Cosmic energy coming down the back of
the body. This time notice it’s in just those two channels, one on each
side of the spine. And as the energy comes into the root chakra, feel
the Cosmic energy is starting to fill up that root chakra with new life
for us. And feel it clearing out any old blocks, any the old patterns
that you have around survival or the physical body and your health or
around money. And you can create a rose right in front of that chakra.
Just move it in and start clearing out that chakra so the rose is taking
up the old energy, the Cosmic energy is filling in where that energy is
releasing. Let’s use those two together. Okay, good. And then pull that
rose out of the front chakra. out of the front, the root chakra. Just
let it go. Very good. And then feel that root chakra just spinning into
perfect balance. Really nice foundation for you. All right, good. Now
feel that Cosmic energy coming up to the next chakra. It’s right in the
navel. You can even put your hands there again if you want. And feel it
filling up with Cosmic energy, feeling the balances, emotions, and
sexuality and vitality. And again, bring a rose in, clean that chakra
out. Just take out any old patterns, any stuck energy that’s causing you
to repeat some behavior you don’t want to repeat. Good, and take that
rose out. Just put it out in front of you. Healing is very fast. Just
let the energy go. And let that second chakra really radiate with that
powerful feeling, like your own passion and motivation. Very good. And
then feel the Cosmic energy making it’s way to the third chakra, the
solar plexus. As it moves in, it’s clearing the energy out in that
chakra, clearing any blocks around manifesting or action or personal
power. And bring a rose into the front of this third chakra. Just clean
it out with a rose. Hold that energy balance. The rose just gives it
somewhere to go. There you go, perfect. Now pull that rose out, put it
in front of you, and let it go. And feel that Cosmic energy continuing
up to the fourth chakra and the heart, starting to clear out any old
patterns, any old blocks you have about love. So can you give or receive
love, or any blocks to that. And bring in a rose to help, to help clean
that out, to give all that stuck energy, those old patterns somewhere to
go. Clean them out of that heart chakra. Very good. And then just take
that rose out. Again, healing is very fast. Doesn’t take time. Put the
rose in front of you, just pop it, and let it go. And as this fourth
chakra balances, let it really open up that full loving space. You can
love yourself, you can love others, and you can be loved by others. Let
it feel very full. Okay, nice. Now bring that energy up from the Cosmic
energy up to the throat chakra. See it connecting on both sides of the
throat. That energy is swirling in. It’s starting to clean out your
throat chakra, any blocks, any old patterns around communication. You
can bring a rose in to help give that energy somewhere to go, collect up
that old patterns, that old history, any old arguments or difficulty
from that throat chakra. Collect it all up in that rose. Pull the rose
out, and put it in front of you, and just let it go. Good, now as the
Cosmic energy fills that throat chakra, feel it balancing to where you
feel like you can really speak your truth. Okay, very good. Let that
Cosmic energy continue up the front into the third eye and the forehead,
sixth chakra area. And as you feel that Cosmic energy coming in, just
let it cleanse that area of any old doubts, any ideas that you’re not
doing it right, you don’t know how to use your intuition. Just let that
all clear away. And as that energy clears, you can bring in a rose to
collect up the energy. Feel completely full and clear in the third eye.
And just bring that rose out, put it in front of you. Just release it
and let it go. All right, very good. And feel that Cosmic energy is
going up one more step into that crown chakra on top of your head. This
one looks kind of like a ring pointed or a halo pointed upwards. And
feel that crown really absorbing that Cosmic energy. Just resetting and
balancing itself. You can create a rose and just move it all the way
around in a circle, all the way around the crown, dusting it off,
releasing any old patterns about your inspiration and your connection to
spirit. And breathe. Okay, good. Now just let that energy continue out
the top of the head. Just feel it showering in all directions, all the
way down the outside of the aura, and also out this road, down each arm,
and out the hands. Okay, very good. Now just be in the center of your
head again, And I want you to visualize yourself out in front of you. So
just see a little chakra man like the little diagram, the cartoon I
drew, and just see one that represents you. And I want you to just
notice, are there any chakra cords connected to you in the front or in
the back? You can use your hands out in front of you and just kind of
feel the energy. See if you can feel a cord there, a little resistance
And just gather all those cords up from the front and the back at the
same time. And just kind of gently give them a light tug, a little pull
of energy. Just let go of any resistance, any judgment. A little
amusement for these chords. There you go. And the just wait until they
release, you’ll notice that they just kind of come off into your hands,
and put those all into a big rose, and just send that energy back to
where it came from. Wow, and just noticed how different that feels in
your body. Really powerful way to heal yourself. Okay, good. Now be in
the center of your head again. You’re going to use your right hand, put
it down by your hip or your waist, just kind of move it slowly up the
right side of the body all the way out past the top of the head. And
you’re just going to spin all those chakras. You can do that a few
times. Just spin the chakras in that direction. And notice them all
aligning and coming into perfect harmony. Just feel that unique song
that’s you radiating out from your chakras into the world. And feel that
Cosmic energy amplifying that song. Okay, and you can say, “I love my
chakras. I love being in harmony.” Very good. And when you’re ready,
just breathe and stretch and open your eyes. Welcome back. Good job. How
are you feeling? More clear, maybe lighter or refreshed, a little bit
better flow? Maybe your body and your life are starting to heal. Maybe
you feel a little more harmony and more synchronicity and abundance or
empowered like you’re not stuck anymore. You can do it. If you didn’t
feel as much as you want, just keep practicing, and your sensitivity
will always increase. So just have fun with it. While we’re working with
the chakras, I recommend doing this style of chakra healing every day.
You’ll find a practice meditation in today’s materials, which helps
replenish all your chakras and do a deep clearing on one chakra in
particular. It’s great for setting the energy for your day and for
clearing your energy before bed. Either one’s just fine. So have fun
with your shiny chakras today. Enjoy.

LESSON 27 - MEDITATION: Practice meditation 5: chakra healing

- Find a point across the room where your eyes rest naturally. Be in the center of your head and breathe your eyes closed. Notice your grounding, connecting you deep into the earth. Feel that earth energy returning up the legs into the knees and into your root chakra. Feel that rich chakra absorbing all the energy it needs to be a strong foundation for you today. Feel the cosmic energy coming in from above your head, coming down the back of your body all the way to that root chakra at the base of the spine. Feel this cosmic energy, cleaning and clearing the root chakra, releasing any stuck energy around survival or health or money. Feel that root chakra as a strong foundation for all your physical needs. Feel the cosmic energy coming up the front of the body into that second chakra at the navel. Feel it clearing and cleaning out any stuck energy around emotions or sexuality or vitality. Feel that second chakra full of motivation that fire inside you, that fuel for all you do. Feel the cosmic energy continuing up the front of the body into the solar plexus and the third chakra. Feel it clearing out any stuck energy around manifesting or personal power. Let this chakra breathe strong, knowing that you can accomplish all of your goals. Breathe. Feel the cosmic energy continuing up to the heart chakra, clearing out any stuck energies around love for yourself or for others. As this chakra clears and fills up with new energy, feel yourself fully able to give and receive love. Feel the cosmic energy continuing up into this throat chakra, clearing and refueling this chakra, and let yourself release any stuck energies around communication. And as the chakra clears, know that you can speak your truth. Feel that cosmic energy continuing up into the sixth chakra behind the forehead, refilling this chakra and clearing any stuck energy around intuition or guidance. And as it clears, give yourself permission to fully understand and see your energy and guidance. Feel that cosmic energy continuing up into the crown chakra on top of the head, lighting up that chakra for new inspiration and spiritual connection. And feel the cosmic energy showering out the top of your head and down the aura on all sides. Be in the center of your head and pick a chakra to focus on today. Let your intuition guide you. Move your awareness into that chakra right now. Feel this chakra's unique energy today. Create a rose in front of that chakra. Bring it in through the front, cleaning out the chakra, giving it a deep cleaning for today. Let yourself release any foreign energy into the rose. Release any stuck energy in the . And fully released from any old patterns or pain. Feel the cosmic energy refilling this chakra so it's a 100% full of vitality and life and energy. And put this rose outside your aura and let it go. And let that energy release. Breathe. Check the front and the back of the chakra for any energy cords to others. Just let yourself be aware of them and smile and forgive anyone involved in these cords, including yourself and with your hand imagine you're gently grabbing all these cords into your hand and lightly pull on these and wait for them to release. Take a deep as the energy releases, feel all those chords coming out of you, and feel the chakra going into perfect balance. Be in the center of your head. Be aware of all your chakras. Run your right hand from the waist all the way up to your head, spinning all those chakras in perfect harmony. Move that hand one more time from the waist all the way up to the head, up the right side of the body, and feel your unique song radiating out from you. Feel the cosmic energy amplifying the song and say, "I love my chakras." "I love being in harmony." Remember that point across the room? Find it with your eyes closed. When you're ready, stretch and open your eyes.

====================

LESSON 28: Chakra Talk To Master Communication With Others

<v ->Welcome back, give yourself a deep breath. And as we begin,
remember your grounding, and Earth energy. And relax into the center of
your head. Turn down your analyzer. And say hello to your permission
rose. Notice your Cosmic energy running, energizing, and cleansing your
chakras. And say hello to the group energy. Sends smiles and hellos to
your fellow students. And feel the group energy and intention supporting
you. Great. So we’ve learned a lot about chakras already, and how
clearing chakras can help you. But chakras aren’t just about you. Every
time you meet someone, your chakras talk. This is one of the most
obvious places to feel energy. Your chakras light up instantly when you
feel strong attraction, right? Surely you’ve felt it. You’re feeling
second and fourth chakra energy. Have you ever met someone and felt
instantly drawn to them, or repelled from them, or like maybe you’ve met
them before? In all these cases, you’re feeling chakra energy. You do it
all the time. And this kind of chakra talk is a spontaneous two-way
energy flow. It’s very different from chakra chords, which are just one
way, and tend to last longer. So let’s see what this looks like
energetically. This is you and your chakras. And let’s say you meet
somebody new. The first time you meet, your spirits say hello, from the
crown chakra. It’s kind of like, oh, what’s up since last life? Can we
help each other, teach each other something in this life? This is your
spirit’s version of, where are you from? Do you come around here often?
Sometimes you just feel a big rush of spiritual energy as you exchange
any karmic energy. And this feels great, because you’re getting your
energy back. Sometimes you might even see a little light around someone
you have a lot of karma with. Okay. So the first time you meet, your
bodies also say, hello, but this sounds a little more like, hey, baby.
Right? This is a second chakra hello. And your bodies are just checking
for opportunities to make babies. Should we have kids together? Is her
body young and healthy? Is he stable, and safe, and secure? You may even
get a big rush of sexual energy when you meet somebody like this. Has
anybody felt that? Great. So you know what I’m talking about. You might
even see the elevator eyes, where they’re scanning you from the seventh
chakra down to the second chakra and back. When this happens, don’t take
it too seriously, this is just your chakras catching up. It’s natural,
and it will pass. It doesn’t mean that you should marry this person, or
even start a relationship with them. You know, if it lasts for more than
five minutes or so, then, okay, maybe there is a longer connection
that’s available. And as you start to talk, ideally, your conversation
will get deeper, and more chakras will connect, for a more diverse
communication. If someone’s talking, and you’re not connecting
energetically, you can seem like you’re not listening, or you’re aloof.
Or if you’re talking and not connecting, it can seem like you’re
self-centered. If many of your chakras are connecting, you’ll have this
great conversation, with lots of information sharing on different
levels, on different things between different chakras. Now, of course,
eventually, even a great conversation starts to wind down. And when this
happens, you’ll notice that less of your chakras will connect. You can
actually feel this. When this happens, this is your cue to finish up. If
you stay too long when you’re not connecting, things will start to get a
little boring. And it can even leave kind of this awkward last
impression in the conversation. So feeling the energy like this really
helps you have a graceful exit instead. Now, once the person leaves, if
you’re feeling a little bit lonely, it just means you’re still trying to
connect. So your chakras are still reaching out to the other person, but
nobody is there. What you want to do is just bring your attention back
to yourself, and you’ll start to feel good again. And just be grateful
for the fun connection, but let it complete. Great. This is an example
of healthy chakra communication. You’re in connecting mode. So energy is
flowing between you. You’ve got two way communication, balanced talking
and listening. And both people feel connected, and interested, and
engaged. And if you want this to get even better, you can add a
permission rose. So then you have clear understanding, without absorbing
their energy, or getting triggered. So what happens when you’re by
yourself? Your chakras shift into a self sufficient mode like this. Your
energy is centered around your body, and not trying to connect with
somebody else. You’re just being yourself. So people in this mode tend
to look attractive and confident from the outside. Since your chakras
are self sufficient, you don’t feel lonely either. Now, we all do both
these patterns at times, but you’re probably more comfortable with one
or the other setting. You may be an introvert, or an extrovert, but it’s
not really a personality trait. It’s actually an energy pattern, and you
can learn about it, and you can change it. Now, if you’re always using
just one style of chakra talk, you may experience some unhappy chakra
communication too. If you’re in self-sufficient mode and you don’t
connect with others, you may have come across as self centered, or
aloof. Like you’re doing all the talking, and you’re uncaring about
others. Or if you’re in self-sufficient mode while others are talking,
you may appear aloof, or be thinking about something else while they’re
talking. Either way, you’re not really connecting or listening. Your
energy is not engaged with the other person. So what does the opposite
look like? Let’s say your chakras are trying to connect with somebody,
but there’s no one there. Might feel lonely, or insecure. So you’re
looking for somebody else to complete you. Or you feel desperate, which
doesn’t really feel good to you, or anyone else either. You might even
have both of these patterns together. I was like this for most of my
life, actually, I was very isolated and protecting myself, because I was
really sensitive, and I didn’t have any energy tools. I didn’t have a
rose. And so, I seemed really aloof with other people, but I felt lonely
and insecure when I was by myself. So I really wanted to connect with
other people, but I was too shy, and I was too overwhelmed by the
energy. The exception was with my close friends, where I felt really
safe and connected, and I felt great. Now, I was really surprised when I
started using energy tools, because all of a sudden, I could feel great
in any situation. It was truly amazing. It’s actually pretty common to
see relationships where one person has one of these communication
imbalances, and the other person has the other communication imbalance.
Where one person is being the seeker, and one is being the sought. One
person feels great being self-sufficient, and tends to isolate when
overwhelmed. Thinking, oh, why are they pressuring me? Or, why are they
stalking me? And the other person wants more connection and wonders, why
are they ignoring me? So the sought thinks, I’m okay by myself, I don’t
need anyone. And the seeker thinks, I’ll die without you! When you’re in
a relationship like this, you’re not really connecting with each other.
You’re not really in relationship with each other most of the time.
You’re just interacting with your own energy patterns. And both people
feel kind of uncomfortable. So, what’s the solution? Ideally, you want
to master both patterns. Connecting with others, and being
self-sufficient by yourself. Learning these two patterns really changed
my life. I enjoy socializing so much more, and it’s easier to connect
with new people. And I was surprised, I actually enjoy my alone time
too, which I used to really dread. So if you start playing with this,
you’ll find some other happy combinations too. It can be really fun to
be self-sufficient together. Like, for example, sometimes I’m just
hanging out with my wife, Hisami, and we’re focused on two totally
different things. So we’re enjoying being self-sufficient even though
we’re together. Or maybe if I’m just politely engaging in some small
talk, I might want to use the self-sufficient mode, because I don’t
really want to have a deep connection or long conversation. Like you
don’t have to connect deeply with everybody. That’s your choice, right?
In each of these situations, just notice what you’re doing with your
energy. And if you want to change it, just visualize a different flow.
Your energy quickly follows your intention. Just let it be that easy.
Alright, so let’s try it out. Get comfortable and ready to meditate.
Give yourself a deep breath. And close your eyes. And feel that energy
still running in your body, touching each of the chakras. And for now,
just be in the center of your head, and turn your analyzer off. So
whatever you were thinking about, or trying to do, just let it all go,
and be very relaxed, with the analyzer off. All right, good. Now,
imagine that you’re getting ready to meet a friend. Someone that you
always have really nice communication with. And if nobody comes to mind,
just imagine somebody. And just imagine that you’re in a really
comfortable place, and you’re waiting for this person. Notice, what are
your chakras like while you’re waiting? Does it feel like they’re
self-sufficient, going out the front, back to the center, out behind,
and back to the center? Or does it feel like your chakras are already
trying to connect, they’re reaching out in front of you in that
connecting mode. Anything’s okay, just notice. And now, notice what
happens when this person arrives, see them coming. Sitting down, and how
do your chakras change? And see yourself getting deeper into that
conversation, you’re really, really enjoying yourself. And again, how do
these chakras change? How are they connecting? Okay, now, fast forward
to where the person is leaving. Just notice, do your chakras stay open,
in that connecting mode, or do they come back into self-sufficient? And
then imagine maybe later in the day, where you’re at home, you’re by
yourself, and you’re missing this friend. Maybe you’re feeling a little
lonely. And just check now, what do your chakras look like right now?
And they in connecting mode, are they in self-sufficient mode? And, for
the chakras that are in that connection mode, I want you to just imagine
you’re pulling them back into you, centering that energy loop around
yourself. So all your chakras have the energy coming out the front,
looping back to you, and then out the back, and then looping back to
yourself. And just let it be very easy, and notice how it feels. And
give yourself permission to really enjoy being alone. Okay, now, imagine
one more scenario, let’s imagine that you’re at a party, where you don’t
know anybody. There’s a lot of people around, but you’re standing by
yourself. And notice what your chakras feel like right now. Are they
self-sufficient? Are they waiting for a connection? And just like
before, adjust them so they’re self-sufficient, so that loop of energy
is going out in front, and back to you, out the back, and then returning
to you. Even though you’re in public, you’re in that self-sufficient
mode. And this is how you shift into being not the seeker. Create a big
permission rose out in front of you. And fast forward to where you’ve
met somebody, they came over, and you’re having a little small talk. And
again, feel your chakras, what are they doing? Maybe they’re testing
out, like kind of connecting, and then coming back to you. Maybe trying
again and connecting. And as the conversation continues, and the small
talk’s wrapping up, just imagine you’re sending a little hello from your
heart chakra into that permission rose, and over into their heart
chakra. Feel that hello, if it’s coming back to you. And start to shift
into these connected chakras with that loop of energy from each chakra
moving out to them, and then back to you. And just notice how that
feels. And notice, are all your chakras connecting? Or are there some
chakras that you’re a little reluctant to connect with? And just let
yourself connect with those too, so all your chakras are connected.
Notice how that feels. Okay, and then just notice the energy changing.
Conversation’s wrapping up. And feel your chakras automatically coming
back to that self-sufficient mode. So you’re enjoying the conversation,
and then letting yourself enjoy the finish as well. When all your
chakras are self-sufficient, just say goodbye to that person. Feel them
walking away. And notice how you feel. And, notice if any of your
chakras are trying to trail behind that person. Maybe you’ve even got a
chord you stuck into that person. And just laugh, let it release. Come
all the way back to you, self-sufficient with your chakras. All right,
perfect. So just congratulate yourself for having a good time, that
scenario. Let that vision dissolve. And open your eyes. Welcome back.
What did you notice? Which chakras were easier? Could you switch
patterns easily? What was different for you? What was difficult for you?
What was easy? Just notice, it all gets easier with practice. Sometimes
you prefer not to connect, and that’s okay too. It’s also fun to notice
which chakra connected first. So people tend to lead with their dominant
chakra, and you can actually see this in people’s postures. Imagine that
friend of yours, who’s a big thinker, and they walk with her forehead
first. Or that swinging single guy, who has their second chakra first,
like John Travolta. Or that heart-centered person, whose heart and chest
are really open. Or the opposite, somebody that’s feeling bad, and has
their heart really protected in the slouch. You can also see the power
person, or control person, who really leads with the solar plexus first,
or maybe has that power gut out in front of them. So just notice which
chakra do you say hello from. And if you want to have some fun, try out
different ones, and see how people respond. You might actually discover
a new way to lead. Now, remember your relationship pattern from before?
Things start out really great, and you’re initially aware of your energy
pattern. Like, oh, I fall in love right away, so I’m going to be cool,
and give a little more space this time, go slow. Or, I know I’m a
workaholic, so I’m going to pay more attention this time, send flowers,
and listen more. But you know, eventually you slip back into your old
pattern. Started wondering, why aren’t they paying attention to me? Or,
are they cheating? Or maybe you’re stalking them, or looking in their
phone. Or maybe you’re feeling interested on the inside, but you’re not
really showing it on the outside anymore, because you’re feeling kind of
smothered, or feeling like your partner is needy. And of course, you
thought it was the other person, right? And so you got the same results.
You were left thinking, why did this happen to me again? Now the answer
is that you’re attracted to people who match your relationship patterns
energetically. So either karmically, where you actually are repeating an
old pattern from a different life, or just energetically, where their
energy fits yours, it’s kind of like a key that fits your lock
energetically. And this attraction happens so that you can understand
your pattern, and you can grow, and you can change it. So we’re all
motivated by spiritual growth and learning. And relationships are a
fantastic school. You will attract a lesson over and over until you pass
it. And this is a good thing, but you might want to learn and pass these
lessons a little more quickly. So you don’t have to repeat these same
relationship patterns over and over. And now you know how. You
understand your chakra energy patterns. If they’re self-centered, or
aloof, or lonely, and insecure, or both. And you can notice the warning
signs in yourself and in other people, because you understand your
chakra energy. And then you can proactively adjust your chakras, just
like we did in the exercise. And you can change the pattern, finally.
You get to grow happily ever after, Not just live happily ever after,
because great relationships will provide many opportunities for growth.
So there are so many benefits of learning chakra talk. It’s easier to
connect with people, you’re more graceful, and conscious, reduces your
miscommunication and misunderstanding. You’re not saying one thing with
your words and doing something else with your energy. Like if I’m
talking to Hisami about her day, but I’m really still thinking about
work. When this happens, she just laughs at me, and she says, I can hear
your words, and those are nice, but I also know that you’re not really
connecting with me at all. You’re just pretending. Learning chakra talk
can help you be less needy, or dependent. And being self-sufficient can
feel great. This can also help you notice and change your energy
patterns before repeating situations. And you can even practice ahead of
time. Like if you have an interview or a seminar, you can play it in
your head, in a meditation, and just notice, ah, how will I use my
chakras in this situation? What’s a natural way, and where are my
patterns, and how can I change them? And of course, chakra talk helps
you to create healthy new patterns too. You can stop being the seeker
and the sought, you can connect when you’re together, and enjoy your
alone time too. So today, I’d like you to notice your chakra talk with
others. Just try to feel your different chakra connections, and play
with some new settings. And don’t worry about all the details. Just let
it be fun, and let the results surprise you. I know you’re going to love
it. Enjoy.

LESSON 28 - MEDITATION: chakra talk

- And feel that energy still running in your body, touching each of the chakras. And for now, just be in the center of your head and turn your analyzer off. So whatever you were thinking about or trying to do, just let it all go and be very relaxed with the analyzer off. All right, good. Now, imagine that you are getting ready to meet a friend, someone that you always have really nice communication with. And if nobody comes to mind, just imagine somebody. And just imagine that you're in a really comfortable place and you're waiting for this person. Notice what are your chakras like while you're waiting? Does it feel like they're self-sufficient? Going out the front, back to the center, out behind, and back to the center? Where does it feel like your chakras are already trying to connect, they're reaching out in front of you in that connecting mode? Anything's okay, just notice. And now, notice what happens when this person arrives. See them coming, sitting down. And how do your chakras change? And see yourself getting deeper into that conversation. You're really, really enjoying yourself. And again, how do these chakras change? How are they connecting? Okay, now fast forward to where the person is leaving. Just notice, do your chakras stay open in that connecting mode, or do they come back into self-sufficient? And then imagine maybe later in the day where you're at home, you're by yourself and you're missing this friend. Maybe you're feeling a little lonely. And just check now, what do your chakras look like right now? Are they in connecting mode? Are they in self-sufficient mode? And for the chakras that are in that connection mode, I want you to just imagine you're pulling them back into you, centering that energy loop around yourself. So all your chakras have energy coming out the front, looping back to you, and then out the back, and then looping back to yourself. And just let it be very easy and notice how it feels, and give yourself permission to really enjoy being alone. Okay, now just imagine one more scenario. Let's imagine that you are at a party where you don't know anybody. There's a lot of people around, but you're standing by yourself. And notice what your chakras feel like right now. Are they self-sufficient? Are they waiting for a connection? And just like before, adjust them so they're self-sufficient. So that loop of energy is going out in front, back to you, out the back, and then returning to you. Even though you're in public, you're in that self-sufficient mode. And this is how you shift into being not the seeker. Create a big permission rose out in front of you and fast forward where you've met somebody, they came over and you're having a little small talk. And again, feel your chakras. What are they doing? Maybe they're testing out, like kind of connecting and then coming back to you, maybe trying again and connecting. And as the conversation continues and the small talk's wrapping up, just imagine you're sending a little hello from your heart chakra into that permission rose and over into their heart chakra. Feel that hello if it's coming back to you. And start to shift into these connected chakras with that loop of energy from each chakra moving out to them and then back to you. And just notice how that feels. And notice are all your chakras connecting, or are there some chakras that you are a little reluctant to connect with? And just let yourself connect with those two. So all your chakras are connected. Notice how that feels. Okay, and then just notice the energy changing, conversation's wrapping up, and feel your chakras automatically coming back to that self-sufficient mode. So you're enjoying the conversation and then letting yourself enjoy the finish as well. And when all your chakras are self-sufficient, you just say goodbye to that person. I'm walking away. And notice how you feel. And notice if any of your chakras are trying to trail behind that person, and you've even got a cord just stuck into that person. And just laugh, let it release. Come all the way back to you, self-sufficient with your chakras. All right, perfect. So just congratulate yourself for having a good time in that scenario. Let that vision dissolve and open your eyes.

====================

LESSON 29: Break Your Manifestation Blocks

<v ->Welcome back, give yourself a deep breath. And as we begin, please
remember your grounding and Earth energy, and relax into the center of
your head. Turn down your analyzer and say hello to your permission
rose. Notice your Cosmic energy running and energizing all your chakras,
and say hello to the group energy. Send smiles and hellos to your fellow
students and feel the group energy and intention supporting you, very
good. In this lesson, I want to share how our chakras help us manifest
our ideas into physical form. So what’s happening energetically when we
manifest easily and what’s happening when we don’t. Now, you may
remember in the common manifesting pattern that I mentioned earlier,
where you get a fantastic idea and you can’t stop thinking about it. And
you talk to your friends and you have lots of enthusiasm and passion and
planning, and then you buy a domain name and then nothing. So what went
wrong? Let’s look at the energy. Now, energy actually manifests from the
seventh chakra down all the way through to the first, going through
chakra by chakra. So it’s pure energy or spirit manifesting into solid
form into the physical world. Each chakra plays an important role and
you need all your chakras working to manifest well. If your energy gets
stuck or stops in a particular chakra, your manifestation will stop
there too. This is why your projects always get stuck in the same place.
They’re stuck in the same chakra. So all your chakras are needed for big
success. So the real question is which chakra are you getting stuck in?
If you understand this, you can address that chakra’s block. So take a
guess. Which chakra would you think you’re stuck in? You might be
surprised. I know I was. Like I said, everything you create manifests in
seven distinct phases, so one per chakra. And each stage is important
and it has to happen for you to successfully manifest something in the
world. So let’s go through the stages. So first is the crown chakra at
the top of the head. So you receive inspiration and ideas, and this is
pure energy and spirit and opportunity coming in. Then it travels down
to your sixth chakra, which is in the head. This is when you’re filling
in all the details and dreaming and thinking and getting guidance and so
on. And then the energy comes down into the throat, the fifth chakra.
And this is where you’re communicating, where you’re writing or telling
people or talking about it. And the energy comes down into the heart, to
the fourth chakra. And this is where you’re getting all this enthusiasm
and passion and motivation. And you’re just loving it so much that you
have to do it. And the energy keeps going down into your solar plexus,
into the third chakra. And this is really where you’re planting the seed
and you’re taking action. So you’re making it possible for this idea or
inspiration to manifest in the physical world. Then the energy comes
down into the navel, into the second chakra. And this is where you get
your fuel for building and energizing and nurturing, like all the steps
that are needed to burn this idea into physical reality and to nurture
it to life. Finally, the energy moves down into your root chakra, near
the base of your spine. And this is really for rooting and sustaining.
So once your project is rooted, it has a life of its own and it’s
sustainable even without you. And this is when you’re completely done.
You’re actually free at this point to walk away and to do something new,
which feels great. Now, keep in mind, these stages are not completely
linear. It’s common to be working on more than one stage concurrently,
but if you get stuck somewhere, your project will stall and you can get
stuck in each of these phases. If you gets stuck up here in the crown,
you’re not going to feel inspired. You have no clue what to do. Maybe
you’ve got writer’s block. If you gets stuck in the sixth chakra, you
can’t imagine how to do it. Or maybe you think it’s impossible. If you
get stuck in the fifth chakra, in the throat, you might be afraid to
talk about your ideas, maybe someone will judge you or you’ll get in
trouble. And so it stays a secret desire. If the energy gets stuck in
your heart chakra, you just can’t motivate yourself. You can’t really
decide you’re going to go for it. So you keep playing small. If energy
gets stuck in the solar plexus, in the third chakra, you don’t take real
action. Maybe you talk about it, but you don’t actually do it. And
buying a domain name doesn’t actually count. That’s not real action.
That’s actually planning. I know because I own many unused domain names.
If the energy gets stuck in the second chakra, in the navel, you will
start a project, but you can’t complete it. So you don’t take all the
steps that are needed to birth it fully and nurture into life. You may
have some judgment or some fear about your second chakra from either
religious or cultural beliefs. This is often why the energy gets stuck
in the second. And then finally, if the energy gets stuck in the root
chakra your idea will manifest just fine, but it always needs you. So
maybe you create a great company which drains all your time and energy
because you’re the fuel. This is much easier if you can root and let it
go and walk away. If you can get through all these phases, you’ll be
able to walk away and the project is self-sustaining. But if you’re like
most people, there’s a chakra or two where the energy is stalling out
for your manifestation. And to help you find where you get stuck, I have
a fun guided journey for you. So relax and get ready to meditate. I’m
going to guide you through each chakra so you can discover where you’re
getting stuck and then we’ll adjust the energy so you can manifest more
easily, let’s begin. As we do this meditation, you might get like a big
aha in the meditation. And if that happens, I want you to keep going in
the meditation. So don’t open your eyes and write it down. And it is
tempting to want to do that, but just finish with the meditation and
write it down afterwards. If you forget afterwards, all that means is
that you got the lessons so well that you don’t need to write it down
anymore, I’m serious. Okay, so we’re going to feel that energy flowing
through each of the chakras. So first, just imagine an idea that you
would like to manifest. And I want you to see this idea as a big bright
ball of energy above your head. And just make it about what maybe four
inches across, or maybe 10 centimeters across. Let that idea be just
energy. And move your awareness right now, up until you’re right inside
that idea. So you’re in the middle of that ball of energy, you’re going
to follow it as it flows down to the chakras and feel each place so you
can find out where you’re stuck and where you’re flowing. Okay, so first
let that ball of energy, that idea, move down into the crown chakra. And
just ask yourself, does it feel like this energy is welcome here? Is
there enough room for all inspiration? If there’s any fogginess in this
crown chakra, just let that fogginess clear. And when it clears, just
notice, are you excited to move to the next phase? Is it okay to go to
the sixth and the seventh? Feel that idea, that ball of energy moving
into the sixth chakra, the forehead. How does this chakra feel? Is it a
peaceful space? And all the details come in easily and clearly? Just
feel that happening now, as you know, all the steps, all the people, all
the timing, all those details are coming easily into this chakra. Notice
any other guidance about this idea. And again, just notice if you’re
excited to move to the next phase. And let your energy flow into the
fifth chakra, that idea is coming down into the throat. Notice if it’s
open and clear. Can this idea be fully expressed in this throat chakra?
As it activates, just see yourself sharing it with other people. Notice
if you feel certain or if it’s difficult. And feel that idea being
beautifully, fully expressed. Notice if you’re excited about moving to
the next phase and then feel that ball of energy moving down into the
heart chakra. Notice, is this idea. welcome here? Can you love this idea
into being? Can you love yourself enough to allow it to happen? Feel
this heart filling with enthusiasm and motivation. And again, notice are
you excited to move to the next phase? Feel that energy ball moving down
into the solar plexus, the third chakra. Just ask, is this idea ready
for action? Let yourself be completely confident. Your personal power is
shining out from this chakra. And notice if there’s anyone else you need
to connect with here and say hello to those people. Let your chakras
talk. And feel that idea really starting in the physical world. Give it
permission. Notice if you’re excited about moving to the next phase.
Feel that energy ball moving into the second chakra, in the navel.
Notice how it feels here. You have all the energy and endurance and
passion you need in this second chakra. And just see everything
organizing perfectly so this idea can be realized in the world. Feel how
bright and powerful this chakra is and feel it nurturing and feeding
your energy. And notice if you’re excited to move into the next phase.
Feel that energy moving into the root chakra. Notice if it’s stable and
grounded here. Does it feel comfortable and secure? And feel the Earth
energy starting to fill up this chakra, getting ready to carry this idea
out into the world. And really trust that you’ve done all you can for
this idea. And when you’re ready, just let the Earth energy carry it
away. Energy is becoming, that idea is becoming self-sufficient in the
world. And breathe. And just be right in the center of your head again.
Give all your chakras a 100% permission to manifest. And give yourself
permission to have a new experience with what you create. And just say,
“I love manifesting. I love my abundance.” Okay, very good. Now just
stretch and open your eyes. Welcome back, how are you feeling? Could you
feel that energy in each chakra? Did any of those chakras feel difficult
for you when you’re manifesting? Were you able to change it? Do they
feel different now? Could you feel your chakras being in harmony? Feels
so great. So remember, if you were a week somewhere, you can also let
others help you too. Each phase can be done by yourself or with some
help from other people. So you get to decide, which is best for you. Do
you want to own this weakness and really work on it and get stronger? Or
do you just want to share this phase with somebody else? Or maybe
delegate it completely? You get to decide which is more effective for
you. Today, I want you to notice all the things that you’re manifesting
in the world, both big things and small things, and try to see what
stage are they in? What chakra energies are they needing right now? And
are they flowing or are they stuck? And then just play with adjusting
your chakras. You can clean them out with a rose or ask someone else for
help. And just have fun with it and you’ll notice really fun results. If
you get too serious, all the energy will slow down. Seriousness is
actually like cement, so unless you’re pouring a driveway, it’s better
to stay light or amused. Have fun today, enjoy.

LESSON 30: Chakras: Exercises And Applications

<v ->Welcome back. Give yourself a deep breath and remember your
grounding cord. Be in the center of your head and feel your Earth and
Cosmic energy running. Say hello to your permission rose and remember
your chakras naturally balancing themselves. It can be this easy to be
in harmony, just remember. Today is our final talk about your chakras.
You’ve already taken them for a spin, but I want to give you some more
exercises and ideas for working with your chakras in your everyday life.
So let’s start with a few success stories. This one’s really fun, this
is from Amy and she said, “I chose my throat chakra to focus on”before
heading off to my NIA dance class. “By the time I got to class,”I had
forgotten all about this intention “and one of the things we do and NIA
is sound,”using voice to exercise the abdominals. “In my experience day
of sounding was so rich”and deep and really coming from my true self,
“as opposed to following the teacher.”Just got to say the experience was
full of yummy.” That’s great, so here’s another one from Simon. He said,
“Last week or so was awful at work.”Yesterday before sleeping and this
morning, “I pulled some heavy cords out of my chakras”and the difference
is like night and day.” Yeah, that’s great. So I’m always happy to hear
that you’re feeling the difference because feeling is believing. If you
really want to understand your chakras deeply, I recommend that you
focus on them one at a time in depth. So you can practice today with one
chakra, but I encourage you to continue your exploration on your own. So
you might focus on a different chakra each day of the week. You know,
Monday is my root chakra. Tuesdays my second and so on. Or you can
explore one chakra per week or one chakra per month, whatever is a fun
schedule for you and just use the practice meditation for this chapter,
where you’re cleaning out that chakra and then notice how this chakra
feels to you, throughout the day and notice how it adjusts to the people
and situations around you and try saying hello to people from the chakra
and see what happens. Of course you want to remember your permission
rose too and stay amused and notice any chakra talk or chakra chords
that you have for the chakra. Are you connecting easily? Are you
self-sufficient and as needed, just clean the chakra out with a rose.
Now, anytime you feel discomfort or pain or stress, try using a rose to
clean the energy and the chakra. The more practice you get, the better
that you’ll get at it and the better you’ll feel. You’ll start to
discover your own chakra tricks too if you keep practicing. There are so
many different chakra adjustments that you can really just explore them
and find them on your own. You don’t need a comprehensive guide. Of
course, you’re welcome to read other information and teaching and
opinions too, but I suggest that you feel the energy for yourself. This
is a far more powerful and personal way to learn, and you really find
out what works for you. Let me give you some suggestions to get you
going. These are some fun ones. So if you’re having trouble falling
asleep, if you understand the chakra energy, it’ll help. So your
chakra’s naturally close down at night when you fall asleep. The Cosmic
energy actually disconnects and they just close down. But if something
is stuck, then they can’t close and you can’t sleep. It’s kind of like
having a shoe stuck in the door and you can’t close the door. So what do
you do? Just try opening all of your chakras, wide open all at once. So
all those shoes fly out and then your chakras can close and this is
really funny because when I try this, this is the last thing I remember
is opening the chakras and then boom, I’m waking up the next morning.
Pretty fun, here’s another one. If you’re moving, you’re carrying a lot
of boxes, you might try adjusting your chakras for heavy lifting. You
could ground your lower three chakras, one, two and three, instead of
just the first one and this will add some physical stability, or maybe
you want to reduce your body sensitivity. You can try turning down
number one, two, and three to about 50%. This is actually what I do when
I’m doing a clairvoyant reading. It helps me stay up in the upper
chakras. It makes me less sensitive to the body signals from my clients.
So you can discover tricks like this for yourself if you start exploring
your chakra settings. There are lots of fun things to play with. Maybe
they’re fast or slow. Your chakras are loud or quiet or open or closed,
just experiment and learn for yourself. You can also play with your
chakra talk too, so if you’re feeling too much, hey baby energy from
somebody like maybe you like the person, but not in that way. Just try
using self-sufficient chakras for those lower three chakras and you can
still connect in the connecting mode with the upper chakras. This will
reduce the body chakra talk, which you know, it feels a little more
appropriate at work and other times, but allows you to keep
communicating on a higher level. Of course, you can also check that
permission rose and notice are you letting their energy into your aura
as you communicate, that can help. How about if you’re ready to finish a
conversation, you want to be polite, but the other person just wont stop
talking. Just try changing yourself into self-sufficient mode with your
chakras and energetically, this indicates that you ready to go and
usually they’ll feel it. You can also put up a permission rose, it’s
kind of like saying talk to the rose, talk to the hand and if you give
yourself permission to just experiment with all these different
settings, you’ll really have fun. You can also watch out for chakra
talk, which is between different chakras. So somebody is third chakra to
your first chakra, or maybe the sixth chakra down to the fifth chakra
and this feels like somebody is talking down to you when this happens,
or it feels like a power struggle. I recommend straightening these out.
So third chakra, third chakra, six to six, five to five and so on, this
feels much healthier and more balanced. Oh, and by the way, I’m not
talking about your physical height here, so that’s no issue. So tall
people and short people still connect first to first, second to second,
third to third and so on. It’s no problem. So if you have a partner to
practice with, I also recommend feeling the chakras together. This only
takes a five or 10 minutes. You just stand facing your partner’s left
side. So your hand is behind them, your right hand behind them and your
left hand’s in front and they could either be standing up or sitting in
a chair. It really doesn’t matter and just create a little ball of
energy between your hands, which helps you activate the hand chakras,
put it around their chakra. So without touching your partner, put your
right hand behind them, maybe behind their neck and then your left hand
in front of them about throat level and then you can just gently move
your hands together and apart until you can feel that energy, the throat
chakra, you can move your hands up and down and feel the energy of each
of their different chakras. Now, of course you might want to skip any
chakras that they’re not comfortable with you feeling. That’s just fine
and just notice which chakras feels stronger to you. Are their chakras
in self-sufficient mode or in connecting mode and see if your partner
can change the energy in their chakras and if you can feel it when they
do. Sometimes they’ll actually adjust their chakras just because you’re
feeling it. Then of course you want to switch roles and repeat and
notice, oh, can I feel my partner feeling my chakras? Kind of
interesting. Now, if you want to do some healing, you’re right there. So
all you have to do is open up those healing channels, which come in the
top of the crown, down the head, the neck, arms out the hands and just
send healing energy in through the back of their chakra and out through
the front. You can also feel for any chakra cords, like we talked about
and just gently remove those, just kind of hold onto them until they’re
ready to release. So here’s a few chakra symptoms to watch out for in
your own life. If you’re thinking, “Why is this happening again?” That’s
your cue to break the pattern. If you can see the pattern, you can find
it and you can change it. If you’re having relationship difficulties,
check your chakra talk. Are you connecting or self-sufficient or are you
kind of confused? Also look out for any unbalanced energy exchange and
check for cords, so no judgment here, we’re all learning. It’s unlikely
it was intentional. Just kind of clean them up and let them go. If
you’re not making progress at work, you might ask or just feel, “Hmm,
which chakra is stalled right now?” And don’t judge your chakras, just
adjust them and have fun with it. If you feel like you’re putting in too
much effort, you can ask, “Oh, where’s the energy stuck here?” Because
if the chakras are clean and healthy, the energy moves very easily. You
don’t need a lot of effort. There are so many benefits to mastering your
chakras like this. You can change your momentum, so you can go in a new
direction. You can finally break your old patterns, so you don’t repeat
your old pain and you can clear your deepest energy blocks, so you have
better harmony and resonance. Of course, you have better communication
with others too, for improved relationships and you can be more
self-sufficient and really enjoy your time alone. When you get good with
the chakras, you can manifest everything much more easily, and you can
break through those old barriers you couldn’t pass before, and of course
you can create happier patterns in your life too. That’s the main
purpose of chakra healing for me, because you deserve to be happy. Now,
as you play with the chakras, you’ll notice one surprise benefit too.
You are becoming more fun, because you’re resonating with permission and
harmony and playfulness, and people respond to you differently. Many of
you have mentioned that in this group, you’ve said, “My husband is more
enthusiastic now.” Or, “My coworkers are happier.” Or, “My family is
more relaxed” And it is, you’re adding to the positive feedback loop and
that’s great. You might also enjoy exploring cultural chakra traditions.
Someone asked me, “Do your chakras really look like this,”like those
chakra diagrams, “with the little symbols and all the colors?” And it’s
kind of funny, the only time that I’ve seen this is when I was watching
the Dalai Lama one time. He was teaching in LA. He had a conference for
his, I think his 108 top monks and he was teaching, it was all in
Tibetan. There’s no interpreter and my friends and I went for a couple
of days and basically everybody was just falling asleep over and over
because the energy was so intense, while getting such a strong healing
and most of my friends went to the beach after lunch the first day,
they’re like, “I’m out of here.” But I thought, “Hey, this is a great
time to grow.” You know, I understand unconscious energy and so I just
sat there and, you know, did my best to release and release and release.
But the interesting part was that the Dalai Lama’s chakras actually
looked like that. They were the different colors and they had those
little beautiful symbols in the middle. That’s the only time I’ve seen
that before, it was great. There are a lot more details about chakras. I
just gave you the functional description. Now what you can adjust to get
obvious results, ’cause I like to focus on how to use them, but anything
you see or feel is great. Just kind of integrate everything you like
together and use what works for you. Now, remember to just have fun and
not put in too much effort, don’t try to be perfect. Don’t try to get
everything right, or learn everything. We’ve covered a ton of material
each week and you could just study the chakras for an entire year if you
wanted to. So just take what comes easily to you right now and just let
the rest come later, when you’re ready, mo problem. And also remember
you are not alone. The group energy is supporting you in your journey.
So let’s end today’s session by connecting with each other and sharing
our progress and enthusiasm energetically. So give yourself a deep
breath and close your eyes. Be grounded and relaxed in the center of
your head. And notice your Earth and Cosmic energy running. Feel your
chakras spinning as your Cosmic energy runs through them. Say hello to
your crown chakra. Notice that beautiful glow. And let your awareness
expand to feel everyone in the Duality training. Present time, past
students and future students too. And from your crown chakra, send a
hello out to everyone in the group. Let yourself receive all those crown
chakra hellos. So many unique songs, all singing in harmony. This is
what connection is all about. Create a big permission rose out in front
of you and very gently feel your chakras in connecting mode. Let all
you’ve learned about chakras radiate out from you to the group, all your
insides, all your aha moments. Let yourself receive all the insights and
aha’s from others too. Know that you are caught up energetically with
chapter five. Smile and bring your chakras back to self-sufficient mode.
Feel confident, relaxed, and clear, ready to keep growing and learning.
Notice your intention for your chakras and add your intention to the
group energy. Here’s mine. Maybe we align our chakras with our highest
good. May I be a clear channel for all energy and information. May we
all have fun, grow and feel great together. Send one more crown chakra
hello and smile to the group. You are in the right place. And on your
next breath, open your eyes. Wonderful, everyone, your energy is so
amazing. Have a beautiful day, enjoy.

LESSON 31: Chakras: Self-Practice Day

<v ->Welcome back. Today is your self practice day. You have all the
information and tools you need, and now it’s time to apply them. We’re
going to listen to the practice meditation together right now, and then
take the day to really use the energy tools in your life. This is your
chance to refine and integrate your practice. Let’s begin. Find a point
across the room where your eyes rest naturally. Be in the center of your
head and breathe your eyes closed. Notice your grounding, connecting you
deep into the Earth. Feel that Earth energy returning up the legs, into
the knees, and into your root chakra. Feel that root chakra absorbing
all the energy it needs to be a strong foundation for you today. Feel
the Cosmic energy coming in from above your head. Coming down the back
of your body. All the way to that root chakra at the base of the spine.
Feel this Cosmic energy cleaning and clearing the root chakra. Releasing
any stuck energy around survival or health or money. Feel that root
chakra as a strong foundation for all your physical needs. Feel the
Cosmic energy coming up the front of the body into that second chakra at
the navel. Feel it clearing and cleaning out any stuck energy around
emotions or sexuality or vitality. Feel that second chakra full of
motivation, that fire inside you, that fuel for all you do. Feel the
Cosmic energy continuing up the front of the body into the solar plexus
and the third chakra. Feel it clearing out any stuck energy around
manifesting or personal power. Let this chakra breathe strong knowing
that you can accomplish all of your goals. Breathe. Feel the Cosmic
energy continuing up to the heart chakra. Clearing out any stuck
energies around love for yourself or for others. As this chakra clears
and fills up with new energy, feel yourself fully able to give and
receive love. Feel the Cosmic energy continuing up into this throat
chakra, clearing and refueling this chakra. Let yourself release any
stuck energies around communication. And as the chakra clears, know that
you can speak your truth. Feel that Cosmic energy continuing up into the
sixth chakra behind the forehead. Refilling this chakra and clearing any
stuck energy around intuition or guidance. And as it clears, give
yourself permission to fully understand and see your energy and
guidance. Feel that Cosmic energy continuing up into the crown chakra on
top of the head. Lighting up that chakra for new inspiration and
spiritual connection. And feel the Cosmic energies showering out the top
of your head and down the aura on all sides. Be in the center of your
head and pick a chakra to focus on today. Let your intuition guide you.
Move your awareness into that chakra right now. Feel this chakra’s
unique energy in today. Create a rose in front of that chakra. Bring it
in through the front, cleaning out the chakra. Giving it a deep cleaning
for today. Let yourself release any foreign energy into the rose.
Release any stuck energy in this chakra. And fully release from any old
patterns or pain. Feel the Cosmic energy refilling this chakra so it’s
100 percent full of vitality and life and energy. And put this rose
outside your aura and let it go and let that energy release. Breathe.
Check the front and the back of this chakra for any energy cords to
others. Just let yourself be aware of them. And smile and forgive anyone
involved in these chords, including yourself. And with your hand,
imagine you’re gently grabbing all these cords into your hand. And
lightly pull on these and wait for them to release. Take a deep breath
as the energy releases. Feel all those cords coming out of you. And feel
the chakra going into perfect balance. And be in the center of your
head. Be aware of all your chakras. And run your right hand from the
waist all the way up to your head, spinning all the chakras is in
perfect harmony. Move that hand one more time from the waist all the way
up to the head up the right side of the body. And feel your unique song
radiating out from you. Feel the Cosmic energy amplifying the song. And
say, “I love my chakras.” “I love being in harmony.” Remember that point
across the room. Find it with your eyes closed. When you’re ready,
stretch and open your eyes.

Part 6: Clear Your Limiting Beliefs

====================

LESSON 32: What Is Stuck Energy?

<v ->Welcome everyone. It’s Jeffrey Allen again. Give yourself a deep
breath. And as we begin, please remember your grounding and Earth
energy. Relax into the center of your head and say hello to your
permission rose. And create a new one if you need to. Notice your Cosmic
energy and Earth energy, healing all the chakras. And say hello to the
group energy. Send smiles and hellos to your fellow students and feel
the group energy and attention supporting you. Nice. Today, we start
looking at the energy of your beliefs, not your beliefs about energy,
but where all your beliefs about anything are stored energetically. This
will add an extra layer of understanding to everything you’ve learned so
far. We’ll also use all the energy tools that you’ve learned so far and
start shifting your beliefs and shifting your reality. You’re finally
getting a little peek behind the curtain to understand what’s really
happening with your energy. Let’s begin by looking at what does stuck
energy really mean? What does it look like energetically and how does it
get that way? And how does it affect your perception? This is important
because when you understand what’s really happening with stuck energy,
you’ll get stuck less often and you’ll stay stuck for less time. This is
so empowering. You’ll be less irritable and more tolerant of life’s
speed bumps. You’ll be more easygoing in life and you’ll understand the
world more deeply, which is great because with this understanding,
everything starts to look beautiful. And as we know, being less stuck
means we can get along with people more easily, our family and friends,
or our partner, a coworker and so on. So the big goal of this chapter is
to stop wasting your time feeling bad, which is a huge time and energy
drain with no tangible benefits to anyone, and to spend more time
enjoying life and feeling good. Because if you’re feeling good, all
those little details don’t really matter. You can live life more easily,
even in difficult times. To get to this goal, you need to understand
more about a stuck energy. Now I’ve spent over 25 years studying energy.
And in that time I learned how to see energy, to understand what’s
really happening behind the scenes. And this is really fun because it
gives a much more clear understanding of what’s happening. This is not a
new mental model. What I’m sharing with you is just what I’ve observed
about energy. And as it turns out, it looks a lot like many theories
too, which is a great validation. In general, energy is naturally
dynamic. It’s moving and changing, evolving. It’s always accurate right
now. But stuck energy is stopped. It looks kind of like a picture or
photograph, an unmoving the piece of energy frozen in time. With
practice, you can look at these and see when and where they came from,
what they’re a picture of and how they’re affecting someone. And this is
mostly what I do in an energy reading. I look at your pictures. This is
helpful because your pictures are usually where you get confused. They
can get outdated very quickly because they’re frozen in time and they
don’t really keep up with reality. So you might be wondering why does
energy stop? And there’s only one reason, you decide something is true
and important. It doesn’t mean it actually is important or true. You
could have just made it up, but you decide that it’s true. This could be
anything, positive or negative. The world is a lonely place. Take a
picture. We’re all beautiful light beings. Take a picture. While we’re
not light beings. There’s another picture. It could be something like,
Ah, Jeffrey said there are seven layers of the aura. I like that idea,
I’ll keep it. So I take a little picture. You decide something is true
and take a picture of that energy, and then you store it, so that you
can see it again later. You have your own personal copy of the energy,
complete with any modifications, any little notes that you’ve made. And
each picture actually looks more like a little story. So sometimes it
can be a little movie too. All right, your pictures are the energy
behind your belief system or what I like to call, your BS. These are
your models about how the world works. Everything you decided is true
about yourself, about other people and about the world. So from here
forward, when I say picture, what I mean is belief. Pictures are simply
how beliefs manifest as energy. Now for me, this is really interesting
to see, where your pictures and your beliefs are getting stored
energetically, because this really shapes the reality we live in. Your
pictures can be stored in your chakras. These are your core beliefs
about yourself and the world. Like, I have to work hard to make money.
That’s a little picture in your third chakra. Your chakra store
pictures, which are fundamental to your world, your beliefs about money
and sex and power and love, and so on. Everything you learn is compared
against pictures for consistency. Chakras also store your hot buttons.
Those highly charged pictures might be something like, the government is
totally evil or something easier like, my sports team is the best team
ever. You are easily triggered by these and people that know you well,
know just which buttons to push, to make you jump, or which buttons and
topics to avoid to miss out on your favorite rant. So your pictures,
beliefs, are also stored inside your aura. These are your filters and
expectations. And to me it looks like a big collage of images all
throughout your aura, might be something like, everyone expects me to
work hard. So these are pictures in that third layer of your aura. Oh,
this is a good time to mention that your aura has seven layers, similar
to the seven chakras with very similar flavors as the chakras. The first
layer is closest to your body, the physical layer. And then they move
outward from there, with the outer layer being your aura boundary. Now,
we didn’t talk about this before, because you didn’t need to know about
it and you didn’t know about the chakras yet. Okay, so back to pictures.
Similar pictures are often clustered together. I have to work hard, the
world is difficult, money doesn’t come easily, and so on. This makes
them seem more real and creates a stronger filter. So I saw this really
strongly the first time, when I was camping at a festival and my
friend’s girlfriend asked me for a healing. So I just, I stood behind
her and put my hands on her shoulders and I was grounding her and all
her pictures lit up. It was crazy. I could see them all throughout her
aura, just a picture after picture, after picture, and layers of
information that she was filtering all her experiences through. She was
really worried about the world and really depressed because these
pictures were really tainting what she saw. That’s the first time I
really saw it energetically, where it wasn’t just a concept. So this
filtering effect is why our beliefs can cause so much confusion. Since
all information coming in, goes through these filters, your perception
is biased. And since all information going out goes through these
filters too, your communication is tainted. So pictures, beliefs, are
also stored on the outside of your aura. This is a bit like a group
bulletin board about you. So someone thinks, Hmm, Jeffrey’s a really
hard worker. And then they kind of pin that picture to the outside of
your aura. It’s like many little post-it notes with everyone else’s
opinions about you. And the same opinions are kind of clustered
together. Energetically, these pictures are your reputation and first
impression. This is why people tend to see who you’ve been rather than
who you are now. They’re seeing your pictures, which are out of date.
Very few people take the time to look deeper at the present time you.
Since the pictures are stored in your chakras, in your aura, in your
boundary, this means your chakras, your aura and your boundary, can get
congested and confused and outdated. And the more this happens, the more
stuck you feel and the harder it is to integrate new information. The
more pictures we collect in our energy, the more rigid we become with
our beliefs. So let’s look at some examples to make it more real. Think
of someone you know, who lives in their own little world. They have a
very strong opinion, their fantasy bubble or their reality distortion
field. They think the world is a certain way and no evidence can
convince them otherwise, they are a hundred percent right. And people
with shared beliefs are also smart and right, and people with different
beliefs are stupid and wrong and they can take any information and twist
it to support their view. They’re unable to see clearly in this area.
And because they’re unable to be wrong, they’re unable to grow out of
their beliefs, even if it’s frustrating, scary, or harmful for them, if
we can’t be wrong, we can’t change. So we all know someone like this,
right? So here’s the fun part. If I asked everyone you know, who lives
in their own little world, some people would think about you and they
would be right. You live in your own little world too. It doesn’t mean
you’re stupid or wrong. It doesn’t mean that you’re closed minded. We
all live in our own little world. It’s called our Belief System, our
collection of pictures about the world. And we all think that we’re
right, that people with shared beliefs are also smart and right. And
people with different beliefs are stupid or wrong, but we’re no more
right than anyone else. Did you get that? Your beliefs are no more
accurate than anyone else’s. Please consider this. I know it’s a hard
pill to swallow. Your ego is taking a little hit here. Ah, stop Jeffrey.
Please shut up. I’m sorry, I have to break it to you, but your beliefs
are no more accurate than anyone else’s. You simply have different
pictures and it’s okay, it’s normal. This is how learning works. When
you understand this, you’ll become a better learner. And when you really
grasp this deeply, you’ll move into the fast lane for personal growth.
To do this, you need to change the fundamental question, you’ve been
asking yourself. Stop asking, why are my beliefs true? This question is
very closed-minded and leads to arguing, debate and even war. Let’s
imagine a funny example. This one is mostly fiction. So let’s say I get
my first smartphone and I love it. It’s the coolest thing ever. And it’s
an iPhone. So I know that iPhone is the best. And I put that picture in
my aura. And I love to validate my pictures, so I start reading articles
and talking to fanboys and doing anything that helps validate my
beliefs. And then I meet my friend and find out they have an Android and
they had the same experience. It was their first smartphone and they
love it. For them, Android is the coolest thing ever. They’ve got that
picture in their aura. Now, of course, I know they’re wrong because my
pictures say, iPhone is best. Now, keep in mind. Neither of us has used
the other phone, but that doesn’t matter. Before we were friends, but
now I can’t believe how stupid they are, thinking Androids are the best.
And we get in a fight about it all the time. And we try to convince each
other that we’re right, but neither person budges. Maybe I make it my
mission in life to educate them with reams of evidence and supporting
articles. And of course I’m careful to dismiss and throw away any
evidence that supports their case. And I can’t wait for that triumphant
moment where they finally say, you are right, iPhone is the best, but
they’re not convinced. No matter what I say, they love their Android. I
finally get so frustrated with them. and I just want to shake them. And
I tell them, they’re a complete idiot, totally incapable of a rational
thought. Why? Just because they won’t agree with me. And surprise, they
never want to talk to me again. Because I was intolerable, no. It’s
because they’re stupid. Okay, so this is a silly example, but you can
see how common this is. Even with trivial things. We love our pictures,
but we don’t realize they’re just that, just pictures. They’re not
truth. Now, imagine bigger issues like politics, or who is God? Lots of
pictures, lots of charge. Everyone thinks they’re right. This is why we
have wars. So, how do we fix this? Well, it’s simple really. Instead of
asking yourself, why are my beliefs true? Start asking yourself, are my
beliefs useful? This is open-minded thinking, which leads to discussion
and learning and ultimately, peace. This is a concrete way of asking, do
I want to be right or be happy? For example, let’s say I really love my
iPhone and my friend tells me, Android is best. I can notice that I’m
getting agitated. My beliefs have been challenged. My pictures are
vibrating, and I take a deep breath and ask, what do I believe is true?
What belief has been challenged here? Yeah, I found it. I believe iPhone
is the best. Is that picture useful? Mm, no, not really. Is it helping
me or other people? Mm, no. Is it making me happy? Well, sometimes, but
not right now. Can I do without it? Yes, I can. I don’t need this
picture. And then I just release that picture and clear that belief, and
something miraculous happens. Instead of fighting my friend, we now have
a shared belief. Smartphones are great, we love smartphones. Maybe I
want one of each of them. We find common ground. So to recap, it’s
totally okay, and to live in your own little world, we all do. Just,
don’t take it too seriously. I know that my beliefs are not absolutely
right, but I find them very useful. I’m almost always happy. I recover
quickly when I’m down and I learn and grow rapidly. My beliefs are
serving me, not the other way around. So today, start to notice how
often you filter information through your beliefs. Try to notice your
picture’s getting lit up and catch yourself when you’re asking, why am I
right? And instead, ask, what belief am I holding onto? And is this
belief useful? If it is, great, keep it, but if it’s not, let it go.
This will change your world. Enjoy.

====================

LESSON 33: How Do Pictures Affect You?

<v ->Welcome back. Give yourself a deep breath. And as we begin, please
remember your grounding and Earth energy. And relax into the center of
your head. Say hello to your permission rose. Can create a new one if
you need to. Notice your cosmic energy running, energizing and healing
your chakras. And say hello to the group energy and smiles and hellos to
your fellow students and feel the group energy and intention supporting
you. Good. I’m so glad that you’re still here. I thought he might lose
you yesterday. You must be warming up to the idea that your truth may
just be beliefs, are old energies stored as pictures in your energy
body. Let’s look at this in more detail so you really understand what’s
happening. Pictures are actually very, very cool. First, let’s look at
how we filter and process information. What happens with our energy?
When we have an experience, information or energy is coming to us. This
information passes through our aura layers. As it does, it picks up a
little information from our filters. Our perception is what we think
happened, based on our filters. For example, if I’m a little sexist and
I see someone climbing a phone pole, I might assume it’s a man because
that matches my pictures. Even if I’m not aware of them, I might have
pictures which say women aren’t strong or women work at home and so when
I see a woman climbing a phone pole, I may actually mistake her for a
man because that matches my filters. It’s really hard to see information
which contradicts our pictures. This is probably why we say, I thought I
saw blah, blah, blah, or I thought I heard blah, blah, blah. At a
subconscious level, we’re aware that we are filtering our perception.
Now, sometimes we do take time to validate our perception. I think you
were saying, blah, blah, blah, right? Unfortunately, this is pretty
rare. We usually just assume our perception is crystal clear. Next, we
have to reconcile our perception with our beliefs. Does this fit into my
belief system? What do I think about this? And many times we’re not even
comparing the experience, just our perception of it. So, if our
perception is wrong, this comparison may be a little tainted too. Oh
yeah, I saw what I expected. But let’s assume that we’re not that in our
pictures, that’s kind of extreme. When we have a new experience that we
don’t have any beliefs about, we think I’m not sure what to think about
that and we create kind of a neutral picture. So, maybe my advisor says
buying gold is a smart financial move. I think, I don’t know. Just kind
of put a neutral picture in my first chakra about that. If our
perception matches our pictures, it strengthens our beliefs. Yeah, I
think so too, gold is important and a positively charged picture goes
into my pile. Plus one for my beliefs. Sometimes we’re just validating
our perception, not the actual event or information. Maybe I imagined my
advisor invests wisely and has money, so her advice is true. But if our
perception is wrong, we’re just fooling ourselves. If our perception
doesn’t match our beliefs, our pictures, we tend to reject, ignore or
refute it. Ah, that’s not true for me. Let’s say my sports team lost the
season. They weren’t any good at all, but I really believe in them. I
might think, I can’t believe that happened. That’s a fluke, they rock,
or they were cheated and I make a negatively charged picture to add to
my pile. If it’s highly charged, we might get upset or want to argue.
Think about sports or politics. This is where it happens a lot. But the
ideal situation, when we’re confronted with experiences which don’t
match our filters and our beliefs, is that we learn, we update our
beliefs. I like this better than my beliefs, so I’ll adopt it. This
tends to neutralize the charge and bring it closer to zero. That’s why
learning feels so relaxing. Ah, now I get it. If we don’t learn easily,
our beliefs tend to get more charged and we develop hot buttons. There
are no more likely to be accurate. They’re just more volatile. So many
pictures with a big charge, either positive or negative. Energetically,
these look like a little energy bomb just waiting to blow. Hundreds of
pictures, all bunched together, all that energy just wanting to be
released and then something touches it and boom, the bomb gets triggered
and we go off. This could be a big positive charge, like a huge party.
Sports fans often look like this. Everyone just boom, all erupts at
once, all happy and excited. Or this could be a big negative charge or a
blow up. Somebody says something, you get triggered and boom. This can
be intense. It might even feel irrational and we can’t think straight or
we’re super emotional. Might be angry or sad or judgmental. When your
buttons get pushed, you either see red or you fall apart. It’s usually
the same topics and you have some pain and confusion around this topic.
So, what’s one of your hot buttons? Maybe that argument that you like to
have, maybe it’s politics. The democrats are terrible. The republicans
are terrible. They’re both terrible, you hate them. Either way, you’re a
hundred percent right. Or that person that you like to hate. Big
judgment against them. You want to talk bad about them and you can’t
forgive them and you’re a hundred percent sure you’re right. In the
moment, I’m so right feels really good and I feel so smart about my
position because I’m validating my energy. But later, I might be a
little embarrassed, like, ooh, I was kind of being a jerk again or I’m
being too strong with my opinion. The truth is when our hot buttons are
lit up, we’re not actually right. We’re just dogmatically positioned.
We’re pigheaded or stubborn, which means we can’t grow or learn. When
you’re like this, there are only three results. One, people agree with
you and this energy escalates. Two, people disagree with you and you
fight. Or three, you’re all alone because no one wants to be around you.
So, please be amused here. We all have hot buttons and we’re going to
learn how to clear them, but you have to be able to admit that you have
them first. When we hit our hot buttons, we are reacting rather than
consciously acting. That’s usually where we get ourselves into trouble.
We say things or do things that we wish we could take back, but the
damage is already done. So, how do you diffuse your buttons? You take
the charge down or clear the pictures by learning something new.
Energetically, learning is really fascinating. When we learn, the charge
on our pictures goes down. When we have a partial understanding, we have
lots of smaller pictures or smaller beliefs. We might have thousands of
bits of information we’re trying to understand, and this can be really
confusing or even contradictory. But when we truly understand we’ve
collected all of our thoughts, we have this aha moment. Oh, I finally
get it and we consolidate all these little pictures into the big
picture. We throw away all the small pictures and create one new
picture, which encompasses our new understanding and our new belief. And
this is great because less pictures means less charge. We tend to feel
relieved and more mellow when this happens. Ah, now I get it. It’s very
calming to believe we understand the big picture. Doesn’t mean that we
actually do, but that’s okay. So, think for a moment, are you really
charged about something or maybe arguing incessantly about something?
It’s a sign that you don’t have the big picture yet. You still have that
partial understanding, with many smaller pictures, perhaps contradicting
each other. Just knowing this helps take the charge down a bit. You
don’t need to know everything. No one does. I sure don’t. At this point,
you might be wondering, why do we create these beliefs? Why do we create
pictures? It turns out they’re very helpful. Pictures aren’t bad. They
create a structure or a framework for future learning, a model for
understanding the world. A belief system can be great if it’s serving
you. Beliefs also help you have an instant response. You don’t need to
think about things. This is very helpful when quick action is needed.
So, if we have to react immediately to avoid some danger, maybe I hear
some tires screeching, and I assume there’s danger and I dive out of the
way. This is very helpful. Now, fortunately, most of the time we have
the luxury and safety and time to act. Our beliefs also provide
stability or continuity. So it’s really helpful in a slowly changing
world. If we have mostly the same experiences every day, we don’t need
to assess each time. It’s okay to assume that things are the same as
last time. Strong beliefs are probably less useful now, in the
fast-moving information age. There’s so much information coming in now
that we really need to update our beliefs regularly. Pictures are also
related to our creativity. So, people who are highly creative are good
at creating pictures. Think about pictures like mental building blocks
that can be easily connected and arranged. Once you realize that they’re
not true, you’re free to create them, delete them and arrange them
however you like. We call this brainstorming. It’s great for testing out
new ideas energetically, to see how they hold up. Now, with all these
benefits come the inherent dangers of beliefs, the dangers of our energy
pictures. They’re static so they can get dated. The world is changing,
but our pictures and beliefs stay the same. Imagine looking at a picture
of yourself, instead of looking in the mirror. Now try doing your hair.
You’re not going to get very good results. Pictures are an old version
of you and the world, so they can be confusing if you’re not operating
in present time. Pictures are also misleading. They appear to be true.
They just seem to be true because we’re filtering and they’re often
contradictory too. Beliefs are just opinions. They can be an accurate,
even if we believe ours are a hundred percent true. So, years ago I was
having a lunch in Tokyo with a new friend and he was asking what I was
working on and happened to be working on this chapter. And I explained
that everyone has beliefs and pictures and everybody believes that their
beliefs are true. And he thought about it and then he said, I get it,
but my beliefs are true. And I said, I know exactly. I started laughing.
That was our last lunch together. So, life is actually quite funny when
you realize your beliefs aren’t true. There’s a real freedom in not
taking yourself so seriously. Another inherent danger is prejudice,
unfair bias in our perception. The classic, judging a book by its cover.
At best, we miss out on something better, at worse divisive news,
judgment, hatred, even war. Pictures can be very dangerous. Pictures can
also create superstition, where we have unrelated pictures in our aura
or a chakras that seem to be connected, but actually aren’t. So, if two
things happen together, oftentimes we will think that they’re related.
Let’s say you see a black cat run under a ladder and then a man falls
off the ladder and so you think why, cats are evil. They make people
fall, but probably any color cat would have startled him, right? Or
let’s see you do your first grounding meditation and later that day,
you’re almost hit by a bike twice. You might worry, does grounding cause
accidents? Maybe I shouldn’t ground. When we jump to conclusions, we’re
connecting unrelated pictures. If you catch yourself doing this, try
connecting the pictures in a different way just for fun. I think, hoo,
my grounding saved me from a bike accident twice. That’s amazing! Notice
that both statements will feel equally true to you when you say them.
Pretty interesting. That’s how pictures work. They feel true even when
we’re connecting unrelated things. Superstition is based on an
incomplete understanding of real information. So, we assign cause and
effect, which is not true, but it seems true, especially if it’s a
belief that’s shared by many people. I give some silly examples, but
there are plenty of serious ones too, racism and sexism and classism and
so on. Maybe ism is just short for superstition, strongly held,
misunderstood beliefs. Strong beliefs can also be rigid, be stubborn or
dogmatically positioned. If you really think you’re right, it’s very
easy to dogmatically positioned. You have so many pictures, that no
evidence will sway your opinion. This leads to arguments and fights and
arrogance, et cetera. A fun way to know if you’re dogmatically
positioned is that you can’t stand other people who are dogmatically
positioned. I love the saying, people who think they know everything are
really annoying to those of us who do. Now, I’m laughing because I’ve
slipped into dogmatic thinking many times. I create pictures really
quickly. I’m very creative. So, I have to watch myself and stay amused.
These rigid pictures can also inhibit learning. It’s hard to integrate
new information. If you have to be right, it’s easy to get full of
pictures with all the new pictures matching the old ones. There’s no
room for learning. You need to unlearn some things first. The biggest
inherent danger is that pictures tend to self validate. Remember the
tuning forks from chapter four on empathy? You’re more sensitive to
information you already carry inside you. Your pictures or beliefs add
to your tuning forks. They’re part of this song that you’re playing to
the world. You are vibrating all of your pictures and unconsciously
spreading your beliefs. They might be, everyone has to work hard to
succeed, or the world is full of beautiful, kind people, or the world is
full of lousy, mean people. This is a great reason to have a beautiful
belief system because you’re radiating that energy out to the world. We
also attract experiences that seem to validate our beliefs. This is the
energy behind the law of attraction, except we’re not actually
attracting what we ask for or what we say. So, you don’t need to worry
about saying the wrong words or attracting something inadvertently. You
attract what you believe, not what you ask for or say. So for example,
does the saying, I want a violence-free world attract more violence?
Sometimes people worry about this. No, it doesn’t. If you believe the
world is inherently violent, then you will keep seeing violence because
that’s your filter. It’s part of your belief system, right? But if you
believe the world is inherently peaceful and violence is the exception,
you will attract or see that because it’s part of your belief system and
that’s why it’s so powerful to change your pictures. You see the world
differently and you attract different experiences and you seem different
to other people too. So, if we’re all wearing glasses anyway, why not
wear rose colored glasses? It’s another way of being in the positive
feedback loop. Okay, I’ve been talking and talking and telling you all
my beliefs about beliefs. I’ve been trying to overwhelm your belief
system with mine. Is it working? I hope so. But let’s take some time to
tune in to the energy too. When you can feel your pictures, there are
more real to you. So, get comfortable and ready to meditate. And let’s
begin. Give yourself a deep breath and close your eyes. Be grounded and
present in your body. Be relaxed in the center of your head and let your
analyzer turn down. Next, I’ll say a few random phrases and you’ll
repeat them to yourself and notice your pictures lighting up. Pictures
can feel like anything like, I feel pressure in my solar plexus. I feel
tingling in my shoulders. I feel yellow in my aura. I feel confident or
smug. My head feels ready to burst or I don’t know what I feel. Don’t
think or interpret, just feel. After a few phrases, you’ll get it. Ah,
that’s what pictures feel like. Just have fun with this. It doesn’t mean
anything. Now, say to yourself, I love to eat. Notice how how your
energy changes. That’s your pictures lining up. Say it again. I love to
eat. Where do you feel the energy lighting up? Now say I’ll die without
food and water. Where does your energy light up? Does it feel different?
Now say I’ll die without junk food and alcohol and what lights up now?
How does it feel? Now say I can live off moldy bread and rainwater. What
do these pictures feel like? Let’s go deeper. Think about something you
strongly believe in, your religion, politics, your passion or ideology.
Where does your energy light up as you think about this? Is there a
color or emotion or intensity? And the answers okay. Imagine talking
with someone who agrees with you. How do your pictures change? Now
imagine arguing with someone who disagrees with you. Where do your
pictures get triggered? How do they feel? Now find some neutrality. Say
this energy doesn’t mean anything. It’s just pictures. How do your
pictures feel now? Breathe in, relax your energy. Let’s end with a nice
one. Remember an amazing hugs someone gave you and feel them giving you
that hug right now. What pictures are vibrating now? Where are they? How
do they feel? Give yourself one more deep breath and open your eyes.
Welcome back. I hope you had fun and could feel your pictures. Today, be
on the lookout for your hot buttons and your strongly held beliefs. Have
some fun with yourself. No judgment. If you don’t take your beliefs too
seriously, they can easily change. I’ll show you how to do that
tomorrow. Enjoy.

LESSON 34: Energy Tools To Clear Your Limiting Beliefs

<v ->Welcome back. Give yourself a deep breath. And as we begin, please
remember your grounding and Earth energy. And relax into the center of
your head. Say hello to your permission rose. Create a new one if needed
and notice your Cosmic energy running, energizing, and healing your
chakras. Say hello to the group energy, and send smiles and hellos to
your fellow students, and feel that group energy and intention
supporting you. In this lesson, I want to show you how to clear your
limiting beliefs, how to clear your pictures. In my opinion, this is the
most powerful thing you can do to change your life. So how do you do
this energetically? It’s pretty easy, actually. You’ve learned all the
tools already. Let’s take a look. Your grounding cord is great for
clearing pictures. It automatically clears pictures from your root
chakra, keeping your life more stable. So when you’re grounded, you are
less gullible energetically. You can also release pictures by dropping
them down your grounding cord. You can try it right now. Just imagine
some pictures and just drop them like stones going down into a
waterfall, just let them go. You can also ground your pictures to make
them less charged. Let’s say your pictures say, vaccines are poison or
people are trying to kill me. This has a big charge and it might be
true, but you don’t really know. Grounding these pictures can help clear
the charge, so you can sort through which information is real and which
is imagined. Turning down your analyzer is a great way to stop creating
pictures, it helps you find neutrality. The center of your head is a
picture-free place to think. You’ve cleared the old memories, and broken
records, and messages from others. So you can access your awareness from
a neutral place and make decisions from a neutral perspective. Your
higher mind is a neutral place to watch information, your pictures
floating by. This is a great place to go when you’re lit up, when you’re
feeling charged. You can get some distance from your pictures and ask
yourself, “Are my beliefs useful,” as you watch them floating by.
Running your energy helps you clear your pictures. The Earth energy
connects you to a library of information about living in a body on
Earth, so you are less likely to create nonsensical body pictures.
Remember, your body is just a little pinched-off piece of Earth. Earth
energy is your instruction manual. Likewise, Cosmic energy connects you
to a library of information about being a spirit. It helps you
understand who you are as a spirit and helps you be less dogmatic with
your spiritual pictures. Even your religious beliefs will soften and
become more allowing. The Cosmic energy also washes way old pictures
from your chakras and aura. Your permission rose helps you insulate or
cushion yourself from your pictures. People are less likely to push your
hot buttons and you’re less triggered by other people’s pictures, too.
Their pictures stop at the rose. The permission rose also indicates that
everyone’s little world is okay. I have 100% permission to have my space
and beliefs, and you have 100% permission to have your space and your
beliefs. Since the aura filters all your perception and stores many of
your pictures, cleaning your aura helps you see the world more clearly,
which is great motivation to keep it clean. You are chakras hold your
core beliefs that are fundamental to your world. Beliefs about money,
sex, power, love, self-worth, and so on. Having clean chakras means
you’ll have less hot buttons, which is super satisfying. I remember one
time after cleaning out my chakras, I was having a conversation that I
always got riled up about before. And to my surprise, I felt nothing, no
reaction. It felt so great. It’s like, “Wow, I’m growing.” You’re going
to love this feeling too. A cleaning rose is a very effective way to
clear pictures. Just imagine you are putting your pictures in a rose
outside your aura and blow up or dissolve the rose to release the
pictures. Doing this outside your aura is very important, especially if
you’re dealing with a core belief, a core picture. This is a strong
picture with many others connected to it. These are fundamental to our
perception of the world. And when these go it’s like our world is turned
upside down or maybe a right side up. So I got this desperate healing
call one time when I was living in Sedona, and a woman was visiting from
out of town and she was taking a bunch of really powerful healing
workshops. And she woke up one morning and she was totally unable to
function. She couldn’t think, she was having a hard time organizing
anything, getting up, taking a shower. She really couldn’t do anything.
And someone recommended that she call me because, you know, I got all
the hard referrals. And so she came in and I could see right away that
she blew a core picture in her space. There were 1000s of pictures lit
up, looked like the world’s worst growth period. All this information
swirling around in her space. It’s no wonder she was confused. So I just
do a little aura healing and a chakra healing, and she was fine again.
If this happens to you, you can run your Cosmic energy to clear the
pictures. You can also use that clearing a growth period meditation in
chapter three, but keep in mind, however, that if it was huge, it might
take a few days to really clear things by yourself. So just stay with
it, stay amused. It’ll clear. It’s totally worth it. You can also take a
long bath or go for a swim because water works wonders and is amazing
for cleaning the aura. Or if you’re doing deep healing work, just
remember to put your pictures in a rose outside your aura before you
release them. The geometry of the rose will contain that picture blast.
So maybe this is why we fear personal growth. It can be pretty horrible
when this happens, like the worst growth period you’ve ever imagined,
but when it passes, life is different. It feels so light and freeing to
release a bunch of pictures. When working with your pictures and
beliefs, it’s important to practice finding your neutrality. This is
very helpful for seeing your pictures, neutrality fosters permission.
Any answer is okay, and non-judgment, not good, not bad. Neutrality
allows you to see clearly. Without neutrality, you’ll only see what you
want to see, which means you can’t grow or learn. Neutrality is so
important, it’s a major theme in religions as well. Buddha called this
the middle way or the middle road to enlightenment, Christ called it the
straight and narrow, the path to life that few people follow. If you can
find neutrality, you’ve found the secret to learning and growing
quickly. But honestly, it’s pretty hard to tell if we’re being neutral
because we always believe our pictures. So a fun way to check is to
create a neutrality gauge. You can try it right now as I describe it,
just imagine a little gauge, it can look however you like, mine’s like a
little speedometer. So just imagine neutral is up. Negative is one side,
positive is the other. And this gauge always shows you if you’re
neutral, positive, or negative. To make it more engaging, your gauge can
also make sounds. So think of a negative sound, maybe a gong, or a
buzzer, or something else, then think of a positive sound like a bell,
or clapping, or something else. And let yourself feel your gauge too.
What does positive feel like? What does negative feel like? Got it?
Let’s try it out. So imagine your neutrality gauge right now. And I’ll
say a few words and you can see what your charge is, how do you feel
about pineapples, nuclear weapons, love, sidewalks? Let your gauge be
fun. Amusement is the highest form of neutrality. If you’re laughing,
energy is moving. Have you ever been super angry or super sad, and then
all of a sudden you started laughing? The emotions just disappear, it’s
amazing. This is a great reason not to take yourself seriously.
Seriousness is the opposite of amusement. It’s nearly impossible to heal
yourself if you’re serious. After releasing pictures, it’s also
important to replenish your energy, to fill in all the areas where
pictures have been released. You want to fill these areas in with new
life force energy, so not positive or negative, just neutrality or
amusement. The easiest way to do this is with a big gold sun. So filling
in with a gold sun is very simple. Just imagine a big ball of gold
energy up above your head as big as your body, you can do it right now
and fill this ball of energy with new life force for you. And when it’s
full, open the bottom and let it pour down into your body, right through
your crown chakra. It’s going to fill in the places you’ve released
pictures, fill in your physical body all the way down to yourselves, and
let it fill up your entire aura. Filling any holes or weak areas in your
aura. A bigger gold sun is okay. Multiple gold suns is okay. Gold suns
are free so you can fill up any time. You can create a gold sun for
someone else too, but it works better if they’re aware that you’re doing
it. Great, so let’s try out all your tools. Let’s clear some pictures.
Get comfortable and ready to meditate. This is your practice meditation
for this chapter. And I encourage you to do it two or three times this
week. And anytime you’re ready for a deep clearing of your pictures,
let’s begin. Close your eyes. Ground your body, connecting your root
chakra deep into the center of the Earth. Feel yourself being fully
present in your body. Be in the room in the center of your head. Ground
this room and release any old pictures from here. Turn your analyzer
off, you won’t be needing it for this meditation. If there’s anyone else
in the center of your head, ask them to leave now. Breathe. Notice the
Earth energy coming into your feet and your legs. A constant flow of
information about what’s truly needed to be successful in your body on
the Earth right now. Let your body absorb that information and release
any pictures which don’t agree with this Earth energy. See these
pictures dropping like stones down your grounding and into the Earth.
Feel your body relaxing deeply. Breathe. Feel the Cosmic energy coming
down your back, up the front of your body, down each arm and out your
hands, and showering out into your aura in all directions. Let the
Cosmic energy carry away any loose pictures, which you’re ready to
release right now. Notice how much quieter it is in your space. Feel the
Cosmic energy bringing in all the new information you need to be a
spirit on the Earth right now. Let go of any pictures which disagree
with this Cosmic energy. Feel these pictures being carried away by the
Cosmic energy flow. Breathe. Notice one chakra that feels agitated or
lit up right now. Maybe some core pictures are rattling loose. Create a
really big rose outside your aura in front of you. Let the Cosmic energy
pick up these charged pictures from your chakra and carry them out of
your space into the rose. Keep releasing until this chakra feels
completely clear. Breathe. Next to the rose, create a neutrality gauge
with an arrow and a sound in a feeling for negative and positive charge.
Check each chakra to see if it’s neutral to this energy you’re
releasing. Is your first chakra neutral? See that arrow moving to plus
or minus. Hear that sound, that feeling indicates positive or negative
charge. Let any charged pictures release from the chakra into the rose.
Is your second chakra neutral? Let that gauge tell you. Let any charged
pictures release into the rose. Is your third chakra neutral? You don’t
need to understand the energy. Just let any charged pictures release out
of the chakra into the rose. Is your fourth chakra neutral? Let any
charged chakras release into the rose now. Is your fifth chakra neutral?
Let that gauge tell you. Release any charge out into the rose. Is your
sixth chakra neutral? Let any charged pictures released into that rose.
And is your seventh chakra neutral? Let any pictures release into the
rose. As your chakras release, keep your Cosmic energy flowing and move
your awareness into the eye or mind. Find that place of neutrality,
observation, and amusement. From the higher mind, look out at your aura.
Notice all your pictures about how the world should and shouldn’t be,
see them all lighting up in front of you. Decide which filters you can
let go of today, so you can clearly see the world. Let those aura
pictures release out into the rose. Breathe. Now that you’re neutral,
it’s safe to blow up this rose, allowing all that frozen energy to
return to motion and become something newer. With your intention blow up
that rose right now. Create a permission rose at the front of your aura.
Give yourself 100% permission to have your space, your story, and your
beliefs. Give everyone else 100% permission to have their space, and
their stories, and their beliefs. Feel how easy this position is. Above
your head, create a giant gold sun full of new life force energy. Open
the bottom of this gold sun and let that new energy fill in all the
places you released pictures today. Breathe. Create another giant gold
sun above your head, bright and full of neutrality. Open it up and fill
your entire body and aura with neutrality. Create one more giant gold
sun above your head filled with neutrality and new life force for you.
Open this gold sun, and feel your entire physical body filling with new
life force. Feel it going all the way down into yourselves. Breathe.
Smile and be amused. Say, “I love neutrality and amusement.” “I love
owning my space.” And when you’re ready, open your eyes.

Is your sixth chakra neutral? Let any charge pictures release into that rose. And is your seventh chakra neutral? Let any pictures release into the rose As your chakra's released, keep your cosmic energy flowing and move your awareness into the higher mind. Find that place of neutrality, observation, and amusement. From the higher mind, look out at your aura. Notice all your pictures about how the world should and shouldn't be. See them all lighting up in front of you. Decide which filters you can let go of today so you can clearly see the world. Let those aura pictures release out into the rose. Breathe. Now that you're neutral, it's safe to blow up this rose, allowing all that frozen energy to return to motion and become something new. In your intention, blow up that rose right now. Create a permission rose at the front of your aura. Give yourself 100% permission to have your space, your story, and your beliefs. Give everyone else 00% permission to have their space and their stories and their beliefs. Feel how easy this position is. Above your head, create a giant gold sun full of new life force energy. Open the bottom of this gold sun and let that new energy fill in all the places you release pictures today. Breathe. Create another giant cold sun above your head, bright and full of neutrality. Open it up and feel your entire body and aura with neutrality. Create one more giant gold sun above your head filled with neutrality and new life force for you. Open this gold sun and feel your entire physical body filling with new life forms. Feel it going all the way down into yourselves. Breathe. Smile and be amused. Say, "I love neutrality and amusement." "I love owning my space." When you're ready, open your eyes.

LESSON 35: Create A New You

<v ->Welcome back. Give yourself a deep breath. And as we begin, please
remember your grounding and Earth energy. Relax into the center of your
head, your analyzer off and say hello to your permission rose, and
create a new one, if needed. Notice your cosmic energy running, and
energizing your chakras, carrying away your old pictures. Send smiles
and hellos to your fellow students, and feel the group energy and
intention supporting you. You’ve been practicing clearing your pictures
and beliefs, but what if you want to create new pictures? What if you
want to create some new beliefs? You’re actually doing it all the time,
but here’s a simple, effective way to do it consciously. Just imagine
your crown chakra is like your cosmic inbox, where you can put a word or
a feeling, or a color, or a vibration. You can try it out right now.
Just imagine you’re putting happiness in your crown chakra, and let the
cosmic energy distribute it through your space. How’s that feel? This is
a great way to change your perception. You’ll attract experiences, which
validate your new pictures. I recommend you keep it simple, words like
happy, senior, certain, present, powerful, gracious, healthy, vibrant,
loving, loved. Positive emotions and concepts are good choices. This is
not how you manifest objects, don’t put a picture of a new car with a
sunroof in your crown chakra. You’ll only be limiting your reality,
rather than expanding it. I’ve talked a lot about clearing pictures, but
it’s okay to have pictures, you always will, but I encourage you to be
conscious and have helpful pictures. It can also be fun to play with
healthy filters. When I was a kid, I remember my mom telling me
“Everything always works out”. Now she doesn’t even remember this, but
that picture really stuck with me. My whole life, I’ve heard everything
always works out, kind of playing in the background, and maybe it’s not
completely true, but it’s been very, very useful. Here’s another one.
People are beautiful. Sometimes it’s fun to have rose colored glasses,
as long as you don’t take them too seriously. If you’re struggling to
change your perception, try putting the opposite pictures in your aura.
Now just visualize them in your aura. If you’re feeling, “My work is
horrible”, try out, “My work is helping me grow”, or “This is helping
people” or “I’m happy with my work”. Just put those pictures in your
aura. If you’re dogmatically positioned, try out the opposite side,
energetically or in reality, I actually do love iPhones, but then my
wife bought me a Kindle, and I love it. For reading books, it’s actually
better for me. And honestly, I would probably love an Android too, if I
had one, because I love technology. We talked about pictures in your
chakras and aura, but what about pictures on the outside of your aura?
When people meet you, this is the first energy they bump into, and it
says a lot about you. I’ve noticed three types of information here.
First, what you want people to think about you, your conscious
projection of yourself, like “I’m confident and strong. Please look at
these pictures.” Two, what you’re afraid people will think about you,
your unconscious self image. Like, “I’m nervous and shy. Please don’t
look at these pictures”, which makes them just as visible. And three,
what other people have thought about you in the past? So other people’s
opinions of you. “She’s really cute”, or “He’s a bully”, or “They’re
really smart”. The more people who think it, the stronger these get.
This is why famous people seem so attractive, there’s tons of attraction
pictures in their aura. I remember meeting a famous fashion model, at
A-Fest, years ago, and I could barely see her, through all the pictures
in her aura, which was too bad, because the real person underneath was
even more beautiful. All these pictures on the outside of your aura,
affect how people see you. When people meet you, it’s the first
impression they have, is all this information on the outside of your
aura. This is how your reputation precedes you too. If many people
thought you were a bully, new people will get that idea too, even if
you’ve changed. This can be very frustrating, if you’ve been working
hard to change your behavior, but you haven’t updated your pictures. Of
course, people close to you will see beyond your outer layer, but most
people will not. So if this happens to you, how do you clear your
reputation? First, it helps to be neutral and amused. It can be in the
higher mind, it’s an easy way to do this. And next you must be conscious
of your pictures, so you can observe them from the higher mind, and then
simply move a rose around the outside of your aura. You can imagine it’s
like one of those lint brushes made out of tape, just kind of moving it
around the outside of the aura, peeling off the layers of pictures and
opinions. And finally, let your cosmic energy run, to clear and reset
your aura. Remember how the cosmic energy flows out the top of your
head, right? And down outside of your aura, on all sides. With all that
cosmic information about your spirit, which is perfect for making an
honest impression. Let’s try it. Just get comfortable and ready to
meditate. Let’s begin. Close your eyes, and notice your grounding and
your Earth energy running. And be in the center of your head, with your
analyzer turned off. and move your energy up and back a little bit, into
the higher mind. And now imagine you can go back in time, to just a few
days after you were born. To what would you look like? See yourself as
an infant. See your bright energy and bright aura. And now fast forward
to about 10 years old. See your aura. Notice the pictures that are
already collecting there. And what do these pictures say about you at 10
years old? And fast forward again, to about 17 years old, sometimes in
your late teens, and notice all the opinions from other people in your
aura. Notice what you want people to think about you, what people really
think about you, and just everybody else’s opinions. And choose one more
significant time in your life, between that teenage years and now, and
see your aura at that time. What does your reputation say about you
then? Notice how many pictures you’ve collected, on the outside of your
aura. Now, fast forward to present time. Be outside your aura, looking
back at yourself. Notice what your aura looks like, right now, and just
see all the pictures on the outside of your aura. Okay, good. Now be in
the center of your head again, looking out, at your aura from the
inside, and let your cosmic energy light up all the pictures on the
outside of your aura, so they’re really easy to see. And just notice,
how many of these pictures did you put there? Is it like, 20% or 50%?
And how much is from other people? And notice those stories that you
want other people to see about you. And notice the stories, that you’re
afraid other people will see about you. Notice all those pictures that
other people have seen in the past, and just be amused. And notice any
misunderstandings and lies about yourself, that you put on the outside
of your aura. And then just decide, are these pictures really that
interesting? Are these pictures are useful for you? If you’re ready to
let them go, just create a rose, start moving it around the outside of
the aura. A giant lint brush, just peeling away all those pictures.
Might go 10 or 12 times around the aura, it’s working in both
directions. And then put that rose outside your aura, and just blow it
up. And create one more rose, to clear any energy you missed, or any
pictures that are left in your chakras. And turn your cosmic energy up
to full strength, just letting all that information about who you are as
a spirit, flow through you, and see it electrifying the outer layer of
your aura, filling in all the places you released pictures today. And
you see your true self imprinting that outer layer, and all throughout.
And just say, “I see myself for who I truly am. I let other people see
me for who I truly am.” Okay, good. And then just stretch and be present
in your body. Give yourself a deep breath, and open your eyes. Welcome
back. Are you awake? What did you experience? What percentage of the
pictures were yours, and what percentage were other people’s? Kind of
interesting, isn’t it? How did you feel after you cleared these
pictures? More yourself? A little lighter? Clearing pictures like this
can be so easy, because you’re not focused on what they say. You’re not
debating them or thinking about them. You’re just noticing, “Oh, I have
some pictures”, and letting them go. Very easy and neutral. If you want
to further change your reputation, you can intentionally put energy on
the outside of your aura, as well, but be careful with this, people will
assume it’s true, just like they assumed that your old reputation was
true, and people will start to reflect this energy back to you, and
you’ll feel like it’s true too. Now this works really great for some
things, like stage fright is a good example. I’ve actually tried this
myself, and heard many other people use it successfully. So when you see
a confident speaker, they often have a cobalt blue color in their aura.
But even if you’re not confident, you can put a cobalt blue color on the
outside of your aura. So you’ll be radiating certainty and confidence,
and people that see this will assume that you’re confident. And as
people start validating those pictures, you’ll feel more confident as
well. Pretty fun. Nice little energy drink. So today I want you to play
with creating your own pictures. Try putting energy into your crown
chakra, your “cosmic inbox”, happy, senior, certain, present, powerful,
gracious, healthy, vibrant, loving, loved, and anything else you like.
Notice your filters and change them if you like. Everything always works
out. Life is beautiful. Pick something you really enjoy. And notice that
people get a different impression of you now. And also notice when
you’re just seeing their old pictures, and try to look a little deeper
to the real person underneath. You may be surprised by how wonderful
people really are. Enjoy.

Be present in your body. Give yourself a deep breath and open your eyes.

====================

LESSON 36: Pictures & Beliefs: Exercises & Applications

<v ->Welcome back. Give yourself a deep breath, be in the center of your
head, and remember your grounding cord. Notice any pictures which are
lit up right now, and notice them releasing automatically into your
grounding. And into your Earth and Cosmic energy, and into your rose.
And feel your chakras and aura clearing. It can be as easy as this to
release your pictures. Just remember your energy tools. Today is our
final talk on pictures and beliefs. You’ve come so far already. All you
need is to keep practicing. So as usual, I’ll give you some exercises
and ideas for integrating this chapter into your daily life. Let’s start
with a couple stories from the group. So this one is from Jean. She
says, “After doing the pictures meditation, I felt a tremendous shift.
For week prior, I’ve been feeling anxiety and fear from feeling I lacked
a loved one’s attention, and in affection because he was busy with a
project at the time and didn’t communicate as often as he would
usually.” She’s kind of wordy like me. “After the meditation, I was able
to shift my focus from lack and anxiety, to creating a soft space of
gratitude and love that enveloped both of us. I can see the vastness in
his capacity for love, and can let his expressions of affection and
attention bring me happiness. A couple hours after the meditation, he
called me and we had a two hour conversation where he asked me out on
his next available day over the holidays. Talk about results. Thank
you.” That’s a great story because this is what happens when you focus
on shifting your energy. The people in situations around you change as
well. And this is why energy work feels kind of like magic sometimes.
Here’s another story from Yolandi. “I like to listen to the audios over
and over again. Chapter five was tough though, but I kept doing the
meditations. I know that regardless if I understand why it works or not,
it works. Chapter six was even worse. I felt saturated by the
information. I also had sleepitations and zoned out many times as I
listened to it. But I stayed relaxed about it and knowing that I’m
moving unconscious energy. Today, however, it just fell into place on an
even deeper level. I felt like things I’ve learned from different areas,
especially over the last year or two, just clicked. So here’s some hope
for all of you who feel behind on the theory part.” Yeah, I like that,
and it’s true. Chapters five and six were complicated. This is true. And
for the second half of the course, I added a lot more detail. I should
say though, that it’s not really important that you understand all the
theory, that you remember everything. I just needed to light up a bunch
of your pictures so you could clear them. So, if you were sleeping a lot
or felt frustration, or even fear, that’s okay, that means it worked.
So, unless you’re teaching this to others, this deep level of
understanding is not important. Clearing your pictures, however, is
super important. And that was the goal of this chapter. It’s hard to use
your intuition, which we’ll do in the next chapter, if you’re stuck in
your pictures. So, forgive my wordiness and forgive yourself for not
catching it all. It’s totally okay. Like Yolandi mentioned, when you’ve
cleared your pictures, understanding just snaps into place on its own.
So, some great practices for seeing your pictures are to notice your
expectations for the day. So when you wake up, just reflect for a few
moments, and notice what you expect to happen during the day. This is a
great way to see your pictures. I also recommend clearing your pictures
every day. So, hopefully you’ve been doing this with the practice
meditation, but I’d like you to keep going for at least two more days.
If you practice in the morning, you can see the difference it makes in
your day. Don’t expect to be all clear, and clear all your pictures in
one day. This is like taking a shower so good that you never need to
take one again, right? You need to do this regularly. You can also
notice your expectations of people and places. So, each time you go to a
new place, notice what you expect to happen in this new place. You can
use your neutrality gauge to see if you’re neutral or charged. And give
yourself permission to have a different experience than what you
expected. Let yourself be surprised. Seeing your expectations of others
is also a great way to look at your filters and biases and prejudice.
You can go people watching with a friend, or even watch a movie together
online, and just take turns making up stories about the people you see.
What are they like? What do they do in their spare time? What do you
expect from them? Just have fun with it and stay amused, and notice
where these stories come from in your history or your life. How do your
stories reflect your previous experiences or pictures? How did they
reflect your biases or prejudice? Remember, these are your pictures, not
theirs. Then clear the pictures which come up for you, and give others
permission to have a different story. You can also notice any pictures
or judgements you have about your friend’s stories as well. And then
clear those pictures. You can do the same thing at work. Just notice the
stories or pictures that you have about your teammates or about your
company or your industry. And just clear those pictures and notice if
people respond differently to you. And of course, now that you
understand pictures, the energy of your beliefs, be on the lookout for
them. If you’re feeling judgmental or lit up, think of it as an early
warning sign. If you judge something, it’s likely coming your way. What
a great opportunity to clear yourself before problems occur. Also notice
when you have an untested bias or opinion. You dislike something, but
you’ve not even tried it, like a food or an activity or politics. This
is a clear indication that you have some pictures, and it might be time
to try out the other side. And to clear your pictures. Notice if you’re
dogmatically positioned, “I am right.” These are highly charged
pictures. Try to take it down a notch. You’ll feel better, and other
people will too. Also remember you can use any of your energy tools to
clear the pictures, just trust yourself to pick the perfect tool. Now, I
want to give you a quick reminder about core pictures and growth
periods. If you feel like something really big is about to release, it
probably is. You don’t need to understand what it is. Just spend a few
minutes creating roses outside your aura. But then pull out the most
charged pictures from your chakras and auras. And when they feel full,
just dissolve them or blow them up. You can clear literally thousands of
pictures in a short while, as fast as you can let them go, no time and
no effort. The goal here is to get as many pictures as possible out of
your space before they blow up inside your space and create a gigantic
growth period. Again, you don’t need to understand your pictures to
clear them, just start blowing up roses. That’s what I’m doing by the
way, when my hand is going like this, you can probably hear it in some
of the meditations. I am blowing roses, clearing pictures for the group,
and for myself. And my other hand is usually feeding healing energy into
the group to stabilize the energy and support your healing and growth.
I’ve been doing group healing for so long, I’m not even aware I’m doing
it most of the time. It’s just what I do. One last comment on core
pictures releasing. These are actually pretty rare. So, there’s no need
to fear these or worry about them. If you ground and run your energy
regularly, this won’t happen. As you continue your practice, you’ll
discover so many amazing benefits of clearing your pictures. You get
stuck less often, you stay stuck for less time. This is so empowering.
You’re less irritable and more tolerant of life’s little speed bumps.
You’ll be more easygoing in your life. Clearing your pictures helps you
understand the world more deeply and grow quickly from neutrality. You
also attract more interesting and diverse experiences, not just the same
ones that validate what you think you know already. You will get along
with people better, your family and friends, coworkers, and so on, and
have less buttons to get pushed. You’ll make a better first impression
because you’ve cleared your old reputation. You’ll find it easier to be
yourself because your old opinions and reputation have been cleared. And
without your pictures, people will trust you more. As you clear your
pictures and biases and filters, people can feel it. They have a
different experience with you. You feel comfortable and level-headed and
trustworthy. They might even ask you for your opinion, and the surprise
benefit of clearing your pictures is that you can more easily create
your reality. This is really cool. As you get clearer, your ability to
make things happen instantly improves. It’s like magic. You can see the
world more clearly, and so you can see opportunities. And people trust
you and see you so they reach out to you more. You’re no longer stuck in
your pictures. If your life is moving too slowly, just start clearing
your pictures. By the way, today is a little mini graduation. You have
all the energy tools you need for completely healing yourself and your
life. Any difficulties that arise in your body, your relationships, or
work, or anywhere else in your life. You have the tools to heal
yourself. The big question now is “Will you use them?” And that’s up to
you. Chapters seven and eight are opening new doors in your awareness.
Door one is using your intuition and clairvoyance. This is great for
creating synchronicity and abundance, and is an amazing path of personal
growth. Door two is connecting with your higher self and spirit guides.
So, continuing your growth and expansion. There’s an endless, amazing
training that you can get from your higher self and guides. Of course, I
can’t guide you to mastery in just a couple weeks, but I can open the
doors so you can find your own way. And I know you’re going to love it.
As we close this chapter, remember that you are not alone. The group
energy is supporting your journey. So, let’s end today’s session by
connecting with each other, and releasing one more layer of pictures
together. So, give yourself a deep breath and close your eyes. Be
grounded and relaxed in the center of your head. Your analyzer turned
down. And notice your Earth and Cosmic energies running and energizing
your chakras. And let your beliefs and pictures be easy, and fluid and
changing. Let your awareness expand to feel everyone in the Duality
training, present time, past students, and future too. And from your
crown chakra, send a hello out to everyone in the group. And let
yourself receive those crown chakra hellos. Create a big healing rose
out in front of you, and let yourself release any tension, or
frustration, or feelings of “I can’t do it,” or “I don’t understand.”
Just let them all go into the rose. Let go of needing to learn the
details, trying to remember everything. Let it all go into the rose. And
smile and be amused. Take a look around the group and see how amazing
and powerful all your friends are. Admire everything they’re brave
enough to release. Create a big gold sign above your head, and let her
receive all that admiration from the group. Nice. With no effort, all at
once, let’s take all those roses and send them to the edge of the
universe. Just let them dissolve, releasing our pictures and freeing us
to be ourselves. Bring the gold sun in through the top of your crown
chakra, filling you with admiration from head to toe. Know that you are
caught up energetically with chapter six. Feel confident, relaxed,
clear, ready to keep growing and learning. Notice your intention for
your beliefs, and add your intention to the group energy. Here’s mine.
May we each be our authentic selves, clear channels for our highest
good. May we all have fun, grow, and feel great together. Send one more
crown hello and smile to the group. You are in the right place. On your
next breath, open your eyes. Thank you for your bravery, everyone. And
thank you for being your authentic self. Enjoy.

====================

LESSON 37: Clear Your Limiting Beliefs: Self-Practice Day

<v ->Welcome back. Today is your self-practice day. You have all the
information and tools you need, and now it’s time to apply them. We’re
going to listen to the practice meditation together right now, and then
take the day to really use the energy tools in your life today. This is
your chance to refine and integrate your practice. Let’s begin. Close
your eyes. Ground your body. Connecting your root chakra deep into the
center of the Earth. Feel yourself being fully present in your body. Be
in the room, in the center of your head. Ground to this room and release
any old pictures from the area. Turn your analyzer off. You won’t be
needing it for this meditation. If there’s anyone else in the center of
your head, ask them to leave now. Breathe. Notice the Earth energy
coming into your feet and your legs. A constant flow of information
about what’s truly needed to be successful in your body, on the Earth
right now. Let your body absorb that information and release any
pictures, which don’t agree with this Earth energy. See these pictures
dropping like stones down your grounding and into the Earth. Feel your
body relaxing deeply. Breathe. Feel the Cosmic energy coming down your
back, up the front of your body, down each arm and out your hands. And
showering out into your aura in all directions. Let the Cosmic energy
carry away any loose pictures which you’re ready to release right now.
Notice how much quieter it is in your space. Feel the Cosmic energy
bringing in all the new information you need to be a spirit on the Earth
right now. Let go of any pictures, which disagree with this Cosmic
energy. Feel these pictures being carried away by the Cosmic energy
flow. Breathe. Notice one chakra that feels agitated or lit up right
now. Maybe some core pictures are rattling loose. Create a really big
rose outside your aura in front of you. Let the Cosmic energy pick up
these charged pictures from your chakra and carry them out of your space
into the rose. Keep releasing until this chakra feels completely clear.
Breathe. Next to the rose, create a neutrality gauge with an arrow, and
a sound, and a feeling for negative and positive charge. Check each
chakra to see if it’s neutral to this energy you’re releasing. Is your
free chakra neutral? See that era moving to plus or minus. Hear that
sound, that feeling, that indicates positive or negative charge. Let any
charged pictures release from the chakra into the rose. Is your second
chakra neutral? Let that gauge tell you. That any charged pictures
release into the rose. Is your third chakra neutral? You don’t need to
understand the energy. Just let any charged pictures release out of this
chakra into the rose. Is your fourth chakra neutral? At any charged
pictures release into the rose now. Is your fifth chakra neutral? Let
that gauge tell you. Release any charge out into the rose. Is your sixth
chakra neutral? Let any charged pictures release into that rose. And is
your seventh chakra neutral? Let any pictures released into the rose. As
your chakras release, keep your Cosmic energy flowing, and move your
awareness into the higher mind. Find that place of neutrality,
observation, and amusement. From the higher mind, look out at your aura.
Notice all your pictures about how the world should, and shouldn’t be.
See them all lighting up in front of you. Decide which filters you can
let go of today. So you can clearly see the world. Let those aura
pictures release out into the rose. Breathe. Now that you’re neutral,
it’s safe to blow up this rose, allowing all that frozen energy to
return to motion and become something new. With your intention, blow up
that rose right now. Create a permission rose at the front of your aura.
Give yourself 100% permission to have your space, your story, and your
beliefs. Give everyone else a hundred percent permission to have their
space and their stories and their beliefs. Feel how easy this position
is. Above your head, create a giant gold sun full of new life force
energy. Open the bottom of this gold sun and let that new energy fill in
all the places you released pictures today. Breathe. Create another
giant gold sun above your head. Bright and full of neutrality. Open it
up and fill your entire body and aura with neutrality. Create one more
giant gold sun above your head filled with neutrality and new life force
for you. Open this gold sun and feel your entire physical body filling
with new life force. Feel it going all the way down into yourselves.
Breathe. Smile and be amused. Say I love neutrality and amusement. I
love owning my space. When you’re ready, open your eyes. So thank you
everyone for your bravery and thank you for being your authentic self,
enjoy.

Part 7: How to Access Your Intuition

====================

LESSON 38: Are You Intuitive?

<v ->Welcome, everyone. It’s Jeffrey Allen again. Give yourself a deep
breath. And as we begin, please remember your grounding and Earth
energy. Relax into the center of your head. Say hello to your permission
rose. Create a new one if needed. And notice your Cosmic energy running,
energizing and healing your chakras. And say hello to the group energy.
Send smiles and hellos to your fellow students and feel the group energy
and intention supporting you. Yeah, very good. This chapter is all about
using your intuition to flow with synchronicity and abundance. And I
love intuition so I’m really excited to share this one with you ’Cause
using your intuition is really a lifelong process. It’s a different way
of understanding the world, of making decisions, and of living your
life. And I want to open that door for you now so you can understand
what intuition is and know that you can use it so you can start creating
more synchronicity and abundance in your life. So in this chapter, we’ll
cover why is using your intuition important so you can see how it will
change your life, and what is intuition anyway? I’ll try to correct some
of the misbeliefs because if you understand intuition better, you’ll
realize how easy it is to use it. And of course, I’ll show you how to
use your intuition. You’re actually doing it already, even if you don’t
realize it. And I’ll show you how to use the energy tools to improve
your intuition. And if you understand this, you can cheat a little bit
and get better results, which is really fun. And again, intuition is not
difficult. But you can get huge improvements with your intuition with
some simple adjustments to your energy. We’ll also practice using
intuition for making decisions and find a good timing because
synchronicity and abundance is all about taking actions that go with the
flow at a time when the flow is strong. And when your intuition is
strong, this is pretty easy to do. Finally, I’ll share my favorite
exercises and tips for developing your intuition skills so you can get
better and better in using your intuition to flow a synchronicity and
abundance. Now, I can’t promise that you’ll be a professional intuitive
in just a few days, but you’ll definitely turn the corner from not using
your intuition consciously to using it all the time. To me, living life
without intuition is kind of like trying to drive to a new city without
a map or directions. You guess a lot, make a lot of mistakes, backtrack,
and try again. And you have to stop often and ask for directions. And in
general, make kind of slow progress. So if you feel like this, if you’re
making slow progress, now you know why. It’s because you’re not using
your intuition. And not using your intuition ultimately means that you
are living smaller than your potential. You tend to stay on the roads
you already know because you’re afraid to venture into unknown
territory. And this leads to missed opportunities. You can also have
some needless difficulties because you’re driving based on your outdated
assumptions, your pictures, instead of updated information from your
intuition. You are actually using a map of sorts, but it’s your
collection of pictures based on your previous experiences. So it’s
outdated and often it doesn’t apply to your new situations. It’s kind of
like trying to navigate San Francisco with a map from 1950. Not very
useful. Without intuition, people often feel frustrated and unfulfilled
in life either because you’re not navigating your life well, no money or
bad relationships or something else, or you’re navigating great, but
you’re kind of in the wrong city. That’s what happened to me actually. I
was very successful in my software career, but I wasn’t happy. I needed
to move to a new life. And without intuition, that’s a pretty terrifying
endeavor. Now, life with intuition is completely the opposite. It’s like
driving with a fantastic GPS. It is say where you want to go and the GPS
tells you where to turn. And it knows about any construction or
crossroads or anything that’s closed or traffic and it automatically
reroutes you as needed. And even better, it also helps you choose a
great destination, which is great. The result is less mistakes and
better focus on your driving, better focus on your life. You’ll still
miss a few turns, of course, because you’re not paying attention or you
didn’t understand your intuition or maybe overrode it and didn’t follow
directions, and that’s okay. But your overall experience is less
stressful, more relaxing, and you make quicker progress. It’s so
peaceful to know that you don’t need to figure it all out on your own.
Intuition is kind of like this. When you can sense the flow of energy
with your intuition, you feel which direction to go and you can follow
the energy knowing that there’s a plan. It feels like I’m fully
supported and it’s all going to work out in my life. And I don’t mean an
abstract feeling or results. I mean tangible, real-world results with
money and relationships and health and more. To get this feeling, you
may have to let go of control a little bit, that’s probably the hardest
part for most people, because using intuition takes a little while to
get used to it. You can’t control things. You need to just kind of trust
and go with it. And like any new guidance, you’ll probably want to do it
the old way. Here’s kind of a funny example. So in 2006, my spirit
guides bought me a brand new Prius, and I’ll tell you that story in the
next chapter. But it had my first GPS and I really resisted following
it. So I was kind of surprised at first that I had this resistance, even
to the voice. You know, who’s this cold, bossy woman telling me what to
do? And then next I tried to out-think it or compete with my GPS. So I
take the route that I thought was better instead of following her
advice. But time after time, her directions were better than my guesses
and I even tried being rebellious I’d make a wrong turn just to see, you
know, what she would do. Finally, I just relaxed and I stopped trying to
fight or compete with my GPS, and driving got way more enjoyable and
they realized it doesn’t really matter if she chooses the fastest route.
Following her was still less stressful. When I gave up control of all
the little details I could focus on other things like enjoying the
scenery, enjoying the drive. And many of you will have the same control
problem with your intuition. It will be accurate, but you simply won’t
want to follow it. With practice, you’ll get over that. The best part of
living with your intuition is that you start living beyond your dreams,
beyond where your mind can take you, a life better than you can imagine.
It’s really amazing. Because when you’re following the flow in life, you
have amazing synchronicity, which results in fantastic flow and
abundance. Truly, being in the right place at the right time to meet
that perfect person or opportunity. That’s actually how I met Vishen. I
was guided to go to A-fest in Thailand in 2014, and my intuition told me
to fly in two days early, so I did. And the night before anything
started, it was getting late and I kind of wanted to go back to my room,
but my intuition was really clear that I should go to the bar. And I
thought, “Ah, you know, I don’t drink and I don’t really enjoy a lot of
places,” but, you know, “Hey, I’m going to listen to my intuition.” And
of course that’s where I met Vishen and started talking about energy and
intuition. And that’s when the seeds for this duality course with
Mindvalley were planted. Following my intuition opened the door to one
of the biggest experiences of synchronicity and abundance in my life. So
when you think about someone who uses their intuition, what do you
imagine? Surprisingly, most people think of someone else. Many people
think of outdated stereotypes like a palm reader or astrology reader
with charts and tables and some secret information, or they might think
of a crystal ball of fortune teller with turquoise and crystals, or a
mind reader who knows everything that you’re thinking, or maybe even
some charlatan or trickster, you know, just cleverly fooling you,
reading your body language, using the power of suggestion, you know,
like mentalist. Or maybe you think intuition and you envision an energy
healer with, you know, a crystal and a curly hair. These people may
indeed be using their intuition or not, but intuition is much broader
than this. It’s not limited to a certain group or a certain look. The
first psychic I met wore black leather, rode motorcycle, and she swore
like a sailor. She didn’t look psychic, but she was super accurate. And
one of the best healers I’ve met smoked like a chimney and she was in
terrible health, but she was an amazing healer and she helps so many
people. So create a big rose in front of your aura right now and start
to let go of all your pictures about what intuition or psychic means.
’Cause they’re kind of loaded words so you probably have some pictures
there and just let those pictures go and release to that rose. Good.
Because if you want to see what intuition truly looks like, just look in
the mirror. You have intuition even if you don’t know it yet. When I
took my first real intuition training at Psychic Horizons Center in
Boulder in the 90’s, I was surprised to see a bunch of totally normal
people. There were artists and engineers and plumbers and dancers and
men and women, young and old, straight and gay, and everything in
between. And I’ve taught intuition all over the US, Africa, and Europe,
Asia, even Central America to kids and grandparents and everyone in
between. Many faiths and religions and races. And what I learned was
everyone has intuition even if they don’t know it. It’s part of being
human. It’s totally normal. So let’s do a meditation to help you get a
sense of how often you use your intuition right now. You may be
surprised. So get comfortable and ready to meditate and keep in mind
that intuition may not be what you imagined it is. We’ll get into that
later. For now, just be open-minded. Let’s begin. Ground and give
yourself a deep breath and be present behind your eyes. On your next
breath, gently close your eyes. Relax and bring your awareness to the
center of your head. And imagine you have a gauge which shows zero to a
hundred percent similar to your neutrality gauge, but instead of reading
positive, negative, and neutral, it gives you a reading between zero and
100. And as you ask yourself a question, just let this gauge easily give
you an answer. You might see the needle move or hear or see a number or
just feel or know the answer. Any way your intuition works is great. Go
ahead and ground the gauge, releasing any charge, releasing any
expectations. And for this exercise, don’t worry if it’s right or wrong.
We’re just warming up your intuition. So let’s try in. Ask your gauge,
“Show me 100%.” “Show me 50%.” “Show me 0%.” Good. Now, ask your gauge,
“How strong do you think your intuition is on a scale of zero to a
hundred?” Now, let it show you how strong your intuition actually is.
And ask yourself, “How often do I use intuition in business?” 90% of the
time, 2% of the time. Any answer is okay. “How often do I use intuition
for my health?” “How often do I use intuition for relationships?” “How
often do I use intuition with my friends?” “How often do I use intuition
with my family?” “And how often do I use intuition for relaxation or
fun?” Pretty interesting. Now, remember a time when you were absolutely
convinced you are right, and you were. Ask the gauge, “How much were you
using your intuition?” “And how much were you using your mind?” Now,
remember a time when you were convinced you are right, but you were
wrong. If nothing comes to mind, just imagine that energy of thinking
you’re right but you’re not and ask the gauge, “How much were you using
your intuition?”And how much were you using your mind?” Now, remember a
time when you thought something was true, but you didn’t want it to be
true. Ask the gauge, how much were you using your intuition? And how
much were you using your mind? Remember a time when you thought to bring
an umbrella or a book or something else, but your mind overrode it and
later you needed it and thought, “I knew I needed that.” Let your gauge
show you how much were you using your intuition. Always celebrate these
moments of intuition even if you don’t follow them. It’s okay. And now
ask your gauge how strong do you believe your intuition is now? And just
for fun, ask your gauge, “How accurate is my gauge?” And he answers
okay. Just give yourself a deep breath. Put the gauge and the rose out
in front of you. And let any pictures which came up release into the
rose. And when you’re ready, put your rose outside your aura. Just pop
it or let it dissolve. And let all that energy release. Create a big
gold sun up above your head and fill it with new life force for you. And
bring that gold sun into your body filling up any places you’ve released
energy today. Smile and be grateful for your intuition. And when you’re
ready, open your eyes. Welcome back. Good job. I hope you had fun
noticing your intuition. Today, keep an eye out for when your intuition
is active, behind the scenes, guiding you when you don’t even know it.
Start releasing any pictures which say, “I can’t do it,” or “I don’t
know what I’m doing.” It’s true, actually. You don’t know the amazing
things you’re already doing. But hopefully you’ll start to see them
today. Enjoy.

====================

LESSON 39: What Is Intuition?

<v ->Welcome back, give yourself a deep breath. And as we begin, please
remember your grounding and Earth energy. Relax into the center of your
head. Your analyzer off. Say hello to your Permission Rose and create a
new one if needed. And notice your Cosmic energy running energizing your
chakras. Say hello to the group energy. Send smiles and hellos to your
fellow students and feel the group energy and intention supporting you.
So let’s talk a little more about intuition myths. We already talked
about myth number one, which is that intuition is found only in some
special people and you’re not one of them. This is not true, everyone
can and is using their intuition. Myth number two, is that intuition is
an additional dormant sixth sense, kind of like intuition as a special
case. And the opposite is actually true. Physical perception is a
special case. Let me see if I can make this simple. So we all agree that
everything is energy, right? E equals MC squared. And physical matter is
a special case of energy. So certain frequencies that are localized in
time and space. Localized just means focused or restricted to a specific
time and space. That’s all the word physical means, time and space
relative. It follows that physical perception is a special case of
energy perception. Think about your body senses, they’re all localized
in time and space just like physical matter. Sight, sound, smell, touch,
taste they’re all about here and now because your body is your lens into
the here and now. Intuition is a broader case of energy perception. It’s
not localized, it’s not restricted in time and space. It’s actually all
the same senses without this time space restriction. So you can see,
hear, feel, smell, taste energy in the past, the present, the future
here, there, everywhere. Intuition is not really your sixth sense, it’s
your five senses with the gloves taken off. So let’s look at an example
like colors are a specific frequency in the visible light spectrum like
yellow is around 530 terahertz. Yet people consistently see colors in
the chakras and aura, but the aura isn’t in the visible light spectrum,
or we’d all see it with our eyes so what’s happening here? Why can
different people agree that they see yellow, but they aren’t actually
seeing yellow in the physical world? Well, light frequencies are the
physical expression of color per we see in the physical world, but color
is more than just the light frequencies and you can sense it. So is
hearing, taste, smell, and touch. This is why it’s difficult for people
to know if they’re using their intuition. It’s not radically different
from your physical senses. It just kind of seems real even though it’s
not physical. That’s why we say things like, I saw this in your aura or
I heard somebody, you know, talking to their guides or I felt something
energetically. But we didn’t use our eyes, our ears or our hands for
these things. Sometimes you can swear that you did hear something like
maybe your brother is saying something and then you realize they’re not
even home. Or you can swear that you got touched by somebody, but
nobody’s there. It feels so real because it is real. It’s just happening
beyond your body’s limited awareness. So what is intuition anyway? Now,
this is my personal definition so others may disagree. For me, intuition
is just sensing energy without physical body limitations. This gives you
a broad time perspective. You can sense what’s happening right now, both
of your physical experience and your perception of it. With your
intuition you can sense what happened in the past energy leaves a trail.
So it’s easy to see what happened before. Again, both your physical
experiences and your perception and your pictures you can see them all.
You can also sense future possibilities. Where is your momentum taking
you? Imagine someone throws a ball in the air so you can say, it’ll
probably go over there. You can make a good prediction. Looking at the
future is like that. Where are your pictures and beliefs taking you?
They have momentum too. Keep in mind, this is your present time future
it’s a probability of space and it can change. The purpose of reading
the future is to empower change, not to be right. A psychic who is
always right, is probably just really good at programming their clients.
I prefer to empower people and occasionally be wrong. I think that’s
more honest. Intuition also gives a broad spatial perspective here,
there, and anywhere. This goes through the zero point where we’re all
connected. Remember the journey into the Akashic records, you don’t have
to be in the same room or the same state or the same country all
information is available from every point and time. So what about
knowingness, the ability to just know things without seeing, or hearing
or anything else? This seems like a success, right? But knowingness is
just understanding something. We understand things all the time by
thinking. Thought is a special case of understanding. And interestingly,
since thought is not a physical sense, it’s not localized in time and
space. We can think about the past or the future about distant places or
places we haven’t been to. It seems pretty free, but it is fundamentally
restricted in one very important way, can you guess? What are thoughts
localized to? Your thoughts are localized to you, they’re localized to
your pictures, to your belief system. That’s why it’s so difficult to
think things you don’t believe can be true. You have to change your
beliefs first. Knowingness doesn’t have this restriction it’s a broader
case of understanding, and it’s not bound to your beliefs. You can think
of knowingness as understanding without pictures. That’s why you can
know things that don’t make sense to you happens all the time to me,
isn’t that fun? So from my perspective, intuition is simply sensing
energy without physical body limitations and understanding beyond your
belief system or your pictures. So your physical, rational perception
has to do with the physical world. It’s local to your body here and now
in time and space. Your rational understanding is also local to your
beliefs or local to your pictures. Your intuitive perception is open to
both the physical world and the energy world. It’s not bound by time or
space, and it’s not bound by your pictures and beliefs. It has
potentially limitless understanding. Here’s a quote from Einstein, which
I really love. “Imagination is more important than knowledge.” Now, I
thought the quote ended there but when I was writing this class I
discovered the rest which actually fits perfectly. Einstein said,
“Imagination is more important than knowledge for knowledge is limited
to all we now know and understand.” And I can’t claim that I know
exactly what he meant, but it sounds to me like, your rational mind is
limited to your pictures and the rest gets even better. “For knowledge
is limited to all we now know and understand while imagination embraces
the entire world and all there ever will be to know and understand.”
Sounds to me like intuition and knowingness is capable of unlimited
understanding. Now, off course, I’m interpreting Einstein according to
my pictures, but it sure sounds great, doesn’t it? Here’s another great
Einstein quote you may have heard, “The intuitive mind is a sacred gift,
and the rational mind is a faithful servant. We’ve created a society
that honors the servant and has forgotten the gift.” And I totally
agree, you’ve forgotten your gift. These are beautiful words, I love the
photos of Einstein tune. Does he look serious to you or does he look
amused? That’s a little hint. So today was a little intellectual, but I
hope it helped you understand what intuition is. It’s just your normal
senses without a few restrictions. So next I’ll show you how to use it.
But before you try your intuition, I want to do a few warmups, a little
stretching to get you ready. These are just fun exercises so don’t take
that too seriously. All right, let’s begin. Go ahead and close your
eyes. And ground your body and just feel yourself being more present in
the body. And bring your aura to arm’s length from your body. Just
notice how that feels different to you. And be in the center of your
head with your analyzer turned off. And think of a cafe or a restaurant
that you like to go to. And just imagine that you’re there right now. So
what does this place look like to you? Is it quiet, is it loud? And
remember some food or some drink that you’ve had there, just imagine
it’s there with you now. So what does it look like, what does it smell
like? What does it taste like or feel like in your mouth? Is it hot or
is it cold? Just really enjoy that sensation. And notice as you look
around notice one more thing about this place, this restaurant or cafe
that you haven’t noticed before. Okay, good. Okay, so now, I want you to
imagine a different place. I want you to imagine a favorite place that
you’ve lived in the past. It’s an old house or apartment. And just
notice what color was this place? Can you picture that in your mind. And
what did the floors feel like are they carpet or wood? And just imagine
that you can feel yourself standing in that place right now. And notice,
what was your favorite part of this place? What were your favorite
experiences here? Like what kind of music did you listen to here, what’s
something fun that happened to you here? And really let yourself feel
that experience. Again, notice one thing about this place that you
haven’t noticed before. Okay, very good. And now, I want you to imagine
one more place. This time imagine a future vacation you’re going to take
to some beautiful nature spot. And just imagine that you’re on this
vacation right now. And you don’t need your analyzer you can turn that
off. And just let yourself feel, so what do you see around you right
now, in this vacation spot? What do you hear, maybe some birds or some
nature sounds? And can you notice if you can feel the sun or the wind or
the water on your skin? And just notice, where is this place? And how do
you feel in this place? Are you relaxed, are you comfortable? And then
notice one more thing about this place. And now imagine there’s a good
friend with you in this vacation place. And how does that shift, what
does it feel like, when you’re with that friend? Do you notice them
smiling at you? And just imagine, what is this person thinking, what is
your friend thinking as they look at you? Like if they talk to you, what
would they say right now? And just really enjoy that moment. Okay, now,
bring your attention back to the room that you’re in right now with your
body. And with your eyes closed, begin to sense what’s around you. So
what’s the furniture in this room? See if you can feel where the walls
are in this room. Even though your eyes are closed, can you imagine
you’re seeing some of the objects that are nearby? And then imagine what
if your attention was up in the corner of the room by the ceiling
looking down what would that look like? And again, notice one more thing
about this room that you didn’t notice before. Yeah, and let yourself be
present right behind your eyes in the center of your head. Then be
completely grounded in your body right here and now. Very good, just
smile and pen your eyes. Welcome back, what did you experience, what did
the food smell like or tastes like, could you see an old house, could
you hear the nature sounds, could you feel the sun on your skin, what
was your friend thinking? Hmm, seems like you were feeling with your
five senses, but not in the here and now, sight, sound, touch, smell,
taste. It seems like you were understanding things not local to your
beliefs, like your vacation location, your friends thoughts, or one more
thing you hadn’t noticed before. This is what intuition feels like. I
didn’t tell you anything specific to see, hear, smell, taste or feel but
you filled in the blanks. Somewhere past like the restaurant or your
childhood house and somewhere future like a vacation that you want to
take. And somewhere in present time and space sensing room around you.
And somewhere different places an old house, a restaurant or vacation.
If using your intuition is harder than this exercise, then you’ve been
trying too hard or you’ve been expecting something different or your
pictures are in the way. Now, if you didn’t get anything, you’re very
likely focused on the physical world and your beliefs and that’s okay,
this chapter is perfect for you. Just keep practicing and you’ll start
to get it. Intuition often feels like you’re making it up. For this
particular exercise, it doesn’t matter. The goal was simply to perceive
things beyond time and space. So, you know, you can use your senses
beyond your body. Later I’ll talk about how to know when you’re making
it up and know what is your tuition. I hope you’re getting a sense that,
maybe intuition is a lot easier than you thought. In fact, the biggest
part of intuition training is simply unconvincing you that you can’t do
it because you already can. After that, it’s just a matter of practice
to fine-tune your skills. So today, keeping noticing your intuition in
your daily life, notice how amazing you already are, enjoy.

====================

LESSON 40: Release Blocks To Intuition

<v ->Welcome back. Give yourself a deep breath. And as we begin, please
remember your grounding and Earth energy. And relax into the center of
your head, analyzer off, and say hello to your permission rose, creating
a new one if you need to. Notice your Cosmic energy running, energizing
and clearing your chakras. And say hello to the group energy. Send
smiles and hellos to your fellow students, and feel the group energy and
intention supporting you. Good. Today, we’ll explore the different types
of intuitive perception. Maybe you don’t realize it, but I’ve actually
been teaching you intuition since our very first class. So you’ve used
all of these already. Clairvoyance: seeing beyond the body. Our guided
journeys use this ability. Remember visualizing a restaurant or food or
your old house color or friend’s face or vacation? How about the
neutrality gauge? You were using your clairvoyance. Daydreaming uses it
too. Next, we have clairaudience: hearing or listening beyond the body.
In our guided journeys, you’ve listened to nature sounds or restaurant
sounds or a friend talking. The positive and negative noises from your
neutrality gauge. Even when your favorite song is playing in your head,
you’re using clairaudience. Next, we have clairsentience: feeling or
touching beyond the body. You use this anytime you walk into a room and
just know something is wrong. When you’re grounding and getting present
in your body, or when you move your awareness behind your eyes, you feel
these things with your clairsentience. When you feel tingling, heat or
pressure from an energy ball, or you feel Cosmic energy running or your
chakra’s opening. Even our guided journeys when you felt carpet or wood
floors at your old house, or you felt the sun on your skin, you’ve been
using your clairsentience. What about clairalience or clairaudience?
This is smelling or tasting beyond the body. Now, these two are a little
more rare, but you’ve used these two in the journeys where you could
smell a natured scene or where you tasted or smelled food at a
restaurant. You can imagine how coffee smells right now. My most
concrete experience with this was many years ago. I had a friend who
always wore the same perfume. And for me, it was kind of like a psychic
caller ID because I always smelled it just a few seconds before my phone
rang. Kind of fun. You’ve also used your claircognizance, which is
knowing beyond your experience or beyond your beliefs. In our journeys
together, you tuned into what your friend was thinking or what was in
the room around you, or that one more thing that you hadn’t noticed
before. I’ve heard countless stories from people who spontaneously knew
something at a distance. Maybe like a feeling that their sister was in
trouble before getting a phone call that there was an accident.
Sometimes it’s just a feeling that you need to call a friend. And when
you do, they’re in tears about something. And you called at the perfect
time. That’s your claircognizance or knowingness. You’ve done all of
these. You have all of these skills. It’s possible for you to sense and
know beyond your body, but you probably don’t call it intuition. It’s
just life. Intuition also includes reading or understanding pictures. So
pictures of what you think you heard or saw or felt before. Remember how
your perception generates pictures? Intuition senses both actual events
and your pictures. Using your intuition to look at pictures can be very
helpful to read what’s actually happened. Plus, someone’s
interpretation. This is why my clients sometimes think I mind reading,
but I’m not listening to your thoughts. I’m reading your pictures and
your beliefs, but it’s pretty much the same result. I might notice
you’re wondering if your husband is having an affair. Your pictures. But
he’s not. Real events. Or you’re afraid you have a serious disease. Your
pictures. But it’s just a food allergy. Real events. With practice, you
can read both pictures and reality with your intuition. It’s very
helpful. Now, I’m not trying to teach you to do all of these perfectly
in just a few days. It’s possible, but it’s unlikely. I just want you to
recognize them for when they’re happening. Notice what comes to you
naturally. Start noticing when you are using your intuition already.
This will help you break the biggest myth about intuition, the widely
held belief that, “I can’t do it.” I hear this from everyone about
intuition and sensing energy. And then I open their hand chakras and
they feel an energy ball or an aura and think, “What? I can sense
energy. I can’t believe that. Am I dreaming?” And even when people are
doing it, sometimes they can’t believe it. It’s hilarious. That’s why we
spend so much time talking about your pictures. Your beliefs are your
biggest block to your intuition. If you’re stuck in your pictures,
you’ll reject your intuition. So let’s take care of these pictures right
now. Think about it. What are your specific doubts and thoughts? Here’s
some of my favorites. “That was my imagination, not my intuition.” Your
imagination is how you access your intuition. I want you to engage your
imagination. I’ll talk later about the difference between wishful
thinking, which is making things up with your imagination, and
intuition. But for now, let’s just release these pictures. So create a
big rose out in front of you, out in front of your aura right now. And
as I talk, release any pictures or beliefs which come up and put them in
that rose. Let’s start with any pictures like, “Imagination means it’s
not real.” Just let those go into the rose because imagination is just
your ability to create through imagery. It’s how we create everything.
Nearly everything you see around you started in someone’s imagination.
And it’s the doorway to your intuition as well. So just keep releasing
into the rose. Here’s another common one. “I can’t see anything.” If you
feel that way, just let those pictures start to move out of your energy
body and into that rose because clairvoyance is just a tiny part of
intuition. You can use your intuition without seeing anything,
clairvoyant. This was actually my hardest part to develop too. In class,
I felt really jealous of people who could see in such detail,
clairvoyantly. Because in my opinion, I couldn’t see anything. Just
black. So if the teacher said, “Visualize an apple,” I think, unless
it’s a black apple in a dark room, I don’t think I’m seeing it. But with
time, this ability started to fill in. I realized, “Oh, my strengths are
actually knowing this in clairaudience.” But with practice, my
clairvoyance got better too. So just let those pictures go into the
rose. So release any pictures about, “I can’t see anything,” or “I can’t
see enough,” or “I can’t see as well as others.” Just let those go.
Good. So here’s another fun one. “Maybe I’m crazy,” or “Maybe I’m just
making it up.” So again, feel where those pictures are in your aura or
chakras. And start to let those pictures come out and move into the
rose. The truth is you are making up a lot of your perception because
you’re filtering everything, right? Everything is coming through your
pictures. So you’re making up a lot of your life. Your intuition isn’t
different. It’s probably more accurate than what you’re making up with
your mind. What’s different about using intuition, however, is that
you’ll start to notice when you’re making things up. You’ll be thinking
something or saying something and realize, “Oh, I think I’m making this
up.” That’s actually your knowingness kicking in. Practicing intuition
in neutrality helps you stop fooling yourself. So just release any
pictures about “I’m crazy,” or “I’m making it up.” You don’t need these
pictures. Just let them go into the rose. Ah, good. It feels better.
Sometimes when people hear about intuition, they have a strong reaction
like, “That’s just bunch of BS,” or “That’s not real,” or “Don’t be
ridiculous.” You might even feel angry you’re lied to. If you’re feeling
that way, that’s great. Your pictures are getting lit up. And now, you
can release them. Just to let them go out into the rose. That’s my goal
actually, is to light up all your pictures so you can release all that
misinformation and resistance, and start seeing the world clearly. So
right now, just release any agitation or frustration about people
telling you things you don’t believe. Just let those pictures go into
your rose. Good. And now send that rose off to the edge of the universe
and just kind of pop it, blow it up or let it dissolve. Very good. You
released a lot of pictures. And that’ll make it easier to use your
intuition or to realize when you already are. I want to get a little
deeper though and clear some more pictures. So let’s go into a deeper
meditation. So just stretch and get comfortable. And let’s begin. Give
yourself a deep breath and close your eyes. Be grounded, relaxed in the
center of your head. And create another rose out in front of you. If you
like, you can create a little neutrality gauge as well. This one’s
optional. And be in the center of your head wherever your crown chakra
and your third eye. And say, “I can fully access my intuition.” Notice
any tension, doubt, resistance or other pictures in your crown chakra or
third eye. Let any energy which doesn’t agree with this statement
release into the rose. I can fully access my intuition. Breathe. Now be
aware of your throat chakra and say, “It’s okay to talk about my
intuition.” Notice any tension or doubt or resistance or any other
pictures lighting up in your throat chakra and let them release into the
rose. It’s okay to talk about my intuition. Breathe. Now be aware of
your heart chakra and say, “My heart is open to my intuition.” Notice
any tension, doubt, resistance or other pictures lighting up in your
heart chakra and let them release into the rose. My heart has opened my
intuition. Breathe. Now be aware of your solar plexus, your third
chakra, and say, “I can take action on my intuition.” Notice any tension
or doubt or resistance or other pictures lighting up in your third
chakra and let them release into the rose. I can take action on my
intuition. Breathe. Now be aware of your second chakra by the navel and
say, “It’s okay to nurture my intuition and let it grow.” Notice any
doubt or tension or resistance or other pictures lighting up in the
second chakra and let them release into the rose. It’s okay to nurture
my intuition and let it grow. Breathe. Now be aware of your root chakra
and say, “My intuition is real.” Notice any tension, doubt, resistance
or other pictures lighting up in your root chakra and let them release
into that rose. My intuition is real. Breathe. Now be aware of your aura
and say, “It’s okay to see my own filters and biases.” Notice any
tension, doubt, resistance or other pictures lighting up in your aura
and let them release into the rose. It’s okay to see my own filters and
biases. Breathe. Now be aware of the outer layer of your aura and say,
“Other people are okay with my intuition.” Notice any tension, doubt,
pain or other pictures lighting up in your aura and let them release
into the rose. Other people are okay with my intuition. Breathe. Be in
the center of your head and say gently, “I don’t need anyone else’s
permission to use my intuition.” Release any pictures anywhere in your
space which disagree with the statement. I don’t need anyone else’s
permission to use my intuition. Breathe. Create a big gold sun above you
with permission to be intuitive, to have all your natural gifts that we
all have. There’s no reason anymore to not use your intuition. Just let
it be easy. When the gold sun is full, bring it into your body, filling
up any place you released energy. Fill yourself in with permission to
have all of your abilities. Breathe that permission into all your
chakras, into all yourselves everywhere in your body and aura until
you’re bursting with permission. Great. Give yourself one more deep
breath. And when you’re ready, open your eyes. Welcome back. You’re
amazing. Now that you’re overflowing with permission, just enjoy your
day. No effort. No tasks to perform. Just have fun exploring this new
you. Enjoy.

LESSON 41: Energy Tools To Improve Your Intuition

<v ->Welcome back. Give yourself a deep breath. And, as we begin, please
remember your grounding and your Earth energy. Relax into the center of
your head and say hello to your permission rose. Notice your Cosmic
energy running, energizing and clearing your chakras. And, say hello to
the group energy again. Send smile and hellos to your fellow students
and feel the group energy and intention supporting you. Ah, good. So,
let’s explore how energy tools can improve your intuition. All the
energy tools you already know make it easier to use your intuition. Keep
in mind, you don’t need to use or master every single energy tool. In
the moment, just use the ones that come to mind. If there’s a tool that
you need, just trust that you’ll remember it when you need it, no
effort. I’ll go through all your tools right now, and we’ll add a few
little adjustments for improving your intuition, just to try everything
out as I’m talking and see how it feels. So your grounding focuses your
awareness into your body, right. It’s hard to use your intuition, if
you’re spaced out. So out of body awareness is kind of like dreaming. It
can seem very real, but you tend to forget it when you’re back in your
body. So ground yourself more deeply now and feel yourself getting more
present in the body. Turning down your analyzer helps you be less
blocked by your pictures. So you want perception beyond your pictures,
so go ahead and turn it down right now. You don’t need your analyzer for
intuition. The center of head is your body’s intuition center, your
third eye, and this is a natural place to access your intuition from.
So, be in the center of your head now. You can adjust your Earth and
Cosmic energy to make it easier to read too, just mix in a little Earth
energy with the Cosmic energy, as it comes up the front of the body. So,
let’s try it. Just feel your root chakra, with your Earth energy and
Cosmic energy passing through, and just let a little Earth energy mix in
with the Cosmic energy, as it comes up the front of your body, around
10% Earth energy and 90% Cosmic energy is about right, but just, you
know, whatever works for you. This is a little bit like grounding your
intuition. It makes it easier to receive and increases your clarity. So,
how does it feel? A little different, right? Your permission rose helps
you maintain neutrality and see clearly, especially when you’re looking
at energy for other people. So, go ahead and dissolve or blow up your
existing permission rose and create a new one in present time, just
takes a moment. Fresh roses are great . You can also adjust your aura
size to change your focus. When I’m in a group or teaching, I expand my
aura to the size of the group, and you’re already doing this, when
you’re tuning into the group energy. That’s why it feels so expansive.
When using your intuition, having your aura match the size of your
inquiry can really help you tune in. If you’re not comfortable with
this, it’s always okay to keep your aura at arms length. You don’t have
to change the size. In fact, you don’t have to make any of the changes
I’m suggesting, these are just ideas that you can try. Don’t get stuck
on using the tools the way I suggest, just find the right settings for
you. Now, imagine your aura at arms length right now, and notice that
shift in your energy. For intuition, it often helps to turn down your
lower chakras a bit too. I usually turn down the lower three, the first,
second, and third, to about 50%. So, if it feels right to you, you can
try this out right now and just see how it feels. Just imagine you can
turn down the volume or the flow, and this shifts you from body
awareness in the lower chakras to spirit awareness in the upper chakras.
It also reduces your sensitivity to those body pictures in the lower
chakras, so, this is really great, when you’re reading someone else’s
energy, and again, don’t force anything, just do what comes naturally
for you. And, if you’re pregnant, it’s probably easier to just leave
these alone. You’re not going to hurt yourself, but it might not be very
comfortable to adjust those chakras, ’cause your body’s very busy right
now. Your neutrality gauge is great for intuition too. It helps you be
aware if you’re making things up. So, if you’re neutral or almost
neutral, your intuition is pretty accurate. But, if you’re not very
neutral, just be amused and don’t take yourself too seriously. You’re
probably reading your own pictures. Another great energy tool for
intuition is your clairvoyant reading screen. This is like an intuition
movie screen. It’s the front area of your aura, where you naturally
receive visual information. Now, the word screen is just a helpful
metaphor here, so you don’t need to see a screen, and if you don’t see
it, just don’t get stuck on that. It’s really okay, I rarely see a
screen myself, because I’m focusing on the movie. In fact, that’s why
I’m watching, right . There’s actually a second screen too, that’s up
here above the first, where you receive geometry as well. This is kind
of fun. So, your reading screen lets you see information from a distance
or bring information to you, and we’ll practice both of these in a
minute. It’s also possible to travel to information energetically and to
see it that way, kind of like remote viewing, but for most people, it’s
easier to be in your body and bring the information to you. The screen
is really fun this way, because you can bring things in and rotate them
and zoom in and out. You can press pause, fast-forward, or rewind. You
can look at the past or the future. It’s a very, very cool tool that you
can learn to use with practice. Now, if you like, you can also imagine a
little neutrality gauge up in the corner of your screen, just to keep
you honest. All right, let’s take your intuition and your reading screen
for a test drive. Just get comfortable and ready to meditate, and we’ll
try out four different ways to use your intuition. Just have fun with it
and see which one feels most natural to you. Let’s begin. Give yourself
a deep breath and close your eyes. Ground yourself, relax into the
center of your head. Turn your analyzer down and turn it off. Feel your
Earth and Cosmic energy running, and if it feels comfortable, turn your
lower chakras down to about 50%. Let a little Earth energy mix in with
the Cosmic energy, as it flows up the front of the body, about 10% Earth
energy and 90% Cosmic energy. From the center of your head, imagine a TV
or a movie screen out in front of you. And, don’t focus on the device
itself, just the area that you can receive information. And think of a
place you’d like to explore more, favorite restaurant or cafe, favorite
place you’ve lived, or a beautiful nature vacation, and stay in the
center of your head and watch this place from a distance. What colors do
you see there? Is it indoors or outdoors? Are there people there? What
activities are taking place? Take a few moments to notice what else is
happening in this scene. Now, imagine you are leaving the center of your
head and going to that scene right now. Instead of watching, you’re
actually there. Notice what’s happening in front of you, and to the
sides, and behind you. Can you turn around in this space? Can you walk
around in this space? Are there other people here? Can they see you?
Take a few moments to notice what else is happening in this place. Give
yourself a deep breath, return to the center of your head. You’re in
that quiet, peaceful place, very present in your body. Remember that
place you just visited, but instead of going there, stay in the center
of your head and bring it to you. Notice the same details as before, but
without leaving the center of your head. Now, zoom out a bit, so you can
see a wider scene. And rotate the place around, so you’re looking at it
from the other side. Just let this be easy. Try seeing it from up above.
Now, zoom in again and notice more details. Take a moment to explore on
your own. Let go of that information for now and just be in that
peaceful place in the center of your head. And breathe. Now, engage your
knowingness about the place you’ve been exploring. How old is this
place? Why was it created and by whom? What’s the most common feeling
people have in this place? Are there plans to change this place in the
future? What else do you know about this place? Now, give yourself
another deep breath and let that information go. Be relaxed and calm in
the center of your head. Create a big gold sun above your head and fill
this gold sun with gratitude, permission to have your intuition and new
life force for you. When it’s 100% full, smile, and let all the energy
flow, down from that gold sun into your crown chakra and into your body.
Say, “I love my intuition.” Give yourself a deep breath and open your
eyes. Welcome back, great job. I hope you got a good feel for these
different techniques and which one is more natural for you. With
practice though, all get easier. You’ll just notice one day, wow, this
is really easy. So today, let yourself use your natural intuition
throughout the day. You can try adjusting your energy tools a bit, you
know, turn down the lower chakras, or bring 10% Earth energy up the
front. The more you play with these, the more natural they will become.
Have fun with your intuition today. Enjoy.

LESSON 42: Intuition: How To Find Direction & Timing

<v ->Welcome back. Give yourself a deep breath, and as we begin, please
remember your grounding. Relax into the center of your head. Analyzer
off. And say hello to your permission rose. Notice your Earth and Cosmic
energy running, and let a little Earth energy mix in with your Cosmic.
And also notice those lower three chakras turning down slightly, and say
hello to the group energy. Sends smiles and hellos to your fellow
students and feel the group energy and intention supporting you. Very
good. So today, we’ll practice looking at choices with your intuition,
and this is a great practice for working with your reading screen. I’ll
describe what we’re doing first, and then we’ll do it together in a
guided journey. So the technique is actually very simple. If you have a
choice to make, you simply imagine each option as a pathway or a road
out in front of you. And then in your meditation space, you visualize
the possible paths on your reading screen. And again, maybe you don’t
see the screen, that’s okay, just visualize them in front of you. This
can be an abstract visualization representing your choice, like door
number one, door number two, door number three, or it can be real, like
a place that you’re actually going. And sometimes, it’s just a feeling
for me and it’s not visual at all, that’s fine too. Next, you imagine
that you are walking down each path one at a time. As you do, you can
watch your neutrality gauge and release any pictures, if you’re not
neutral. And as your awareness travels down one path, you just observe.
What do you see, hear or feel? Just listen and be curious, without
thinking or drawing any conclusions. Like what else do you know about
this path? And once you’ve traveled down the expected paths, it’s
helpful to ask yourself, are there any hidden paths that I didn’t see?
And this really helps you see beyond your pictures into new
possibilities. And if a new path appears, you just imagine walking down
that path too. And when you’re finished, just simply choose a path with
your intuition, not your analyzer, which one feels right for you. Trust
yourself. And finally, you send the light down the chosen path to light
your way. This can be an energy ball, or healing energy, or anything
that feels right to you. This allows you to see synchronicity along that
path so you can stay on it and stay in the flow. And don’t worry about
remembering all this, I’m going to walk you through it in the guided
journey. Once you’ve made your choice, you’re halfway there. Now you
need good timing, and this is where many people mess up. We’re often too
impatient, but synchronicity includes good choices and good timing. You
need both. For this, I like to visualize a timeline, and think about
when I should take action on the timeline. Just kind of be like a line
stretching out now into the future, and I start by using a rose to kind
of clear off any bias or expectations, because it’s really hard to read
clearly if you’re biased. And next, you simply count forward in time,
like one month, two months, three months and so on, and I feel that
energy, or see it, or hear it, anything works. So depending on your
preference, you can also see like a little visual graph too, or you
might just hear like a little sound going up and down. Or you can have
your feeling changing, you know, just listen for any changes. So for
example, I might put up a timeline and say, when should I submit my book
proposal? And then one month, two months, three months, four months,
five months. Oh, okay, the best timing is in three months. Or I might
ask, how will this investment fair? And it might look like this. One,
two, three about the same. Four, up. Five, six, same. Seven, up. Eight,
nine, same. Ah, got it. It’ll gradually get better and better for the
next nine months. Or if I ask, when will my house sell? It might look
kind of like this. January, yes, no. February, nothing. March, yes.
April, nothing. May, June, July, yes, yes, yes. August, no. Ah, here I’m
just noticing distinct windows of opportunity. A small chance in
January. Might sell in March. Pretty likely in May, June or July. You
might see, feel or hear many other variations too. If you play with
this, you’ll find what works for you. Then trust your intuition. You
have to try following your intuition or you’ll never get feedback and
improve. It’s also helpful to look again periodically. So energy
changes. You might want to check back in a month or so. But a little
warning here, if you’re checking every day, you’re too charged to see
clearly. It’s probably going to change every time you look at it. So you
want to work on your pictures and find neutrality first, and then you
can tune in. And the style of visualization is just a creative way to
communicate with the universe. You can actually make up your own
visualization tools like this, and they’ll be just as effective. So
let’s try this one out. Get comfortable and ready to meditate. And we’ll
look at a choice first and then check the timing. Let’s begin. Close
your eyes and just be present in the center of your head. Notice your
grounding and your Earth energy. And feel your awareness focusing on the
body. Okay, so be in the center of your head. Turn your analyzer off.
And feel that third eye waking up. And notice your Cosmic energy flowing
through your body. And where it comes up the front of the body, let
about 10% Earth energy mix in with that Cosmic energy, so that mixture
is coming up the front of the body. And again, notice that. It’ll
activate your third eye. Good. And create a permission rose arms length
in front of you, at the front of your room. And for now, let your aura
adjust to that size, arms length around the body, on all sides. Okay,
now just smile and let go of any effort. And imagine a reading screen
out in front of you. Just imagine there’s a little neutrality gauge in
the corner to tell you if you’re charged. And if you don’t see the
screen, don’t worry about it. You’re just looking in that area in front
of you with your attention. And think of a choice that you are curious
about right now. Some path, some choice that’s coming up for you. And
imagine there’s two paths in front of you, two outcomes for that choice.
And check your neutrality gauge. Clear any pictures from your chakras,
if you’re not neutral. And go ahead and ground both of those pathways
too. Nice way to find neutrality. Now, very gently turn down your lower
chakras to about halfway. And choose one of those paths and start to
move your awareness down that path. And you’re just listening and
experience. You’re not planning or thinking about it. And just notice,
what do you see? What do you hear? What do you feel? Does it feel good?
Does it feel stressful? And notice one more thing about this path that
you didn’t notice before. Okay, good. Now just rewind your awareness, so
you’re back at the beginning, and then let yourself venture down that
other path. Again, you’re just going to feel and see, just experience
yourself going down that path. Notice any details. And does this path
feel good? Does it feel light and easy? Or does it feel like effort or
difficulty? And notice one more thing that you didn’t notice before.
Good. Now just rewind, so you’re at the beginning, and just ask, is
there a third path? Is there another choice that I didn’t consider
before? And then let your awareness start to travel down that new
pathway. So notice any sights, any sounds, any people on that path. And
then notice, how does this one feel? Does it feel like it’s in the flow?
Does it feel easy or is it hard? And notice one more thing. Good. Now
rewind again to the beginning, and just sensing all three of these paths
in front of you. Just let your intuition guide you. Which path has the
most flow? Maybe it’s the first one, or the second one, or the third
one. And with your intuition, just decide which path you want to take.
Just send a ball of light down that path. And there’s no pressure. You
could always change your decision later, but for now, just decide and
send that light down the path. And this light will help you find your
synchronicity, so that you know you’re on the right path for you. Okay,
very good. Now imagine that timeline for this path. So you can see it
visually or just kind of imagine it in your mind. And think of one
timing aspect of this path. When do I start down it? Or when’s the best
time for some other element? And when you think about the timing, notice
your neutrality. You can use a rose to clear off any charge you have
about the right timing or any kind of worries or fears about timing. You
can use that rose to dust off the timeline as well. Very good. Now just
start counting forward. It can be days, months, years, whatever’s
appropriate for you. Just notice, so one, how does that feel, look or
sound? Okay, two. Three. Did it change? You’re just looking for changes
in perception here. How about four? Or five? Or six? Again, notice any
ups or downs. Maybe you’re expanding or contracting, or you’re hearing a
sound. Okay, how about seven or eight? Okay, let’s do that again. Just
all straight through. Sometimes it’s easier to go quickly. So one. Two.
Three. Four. Five. Six. Seven. Eight. Okay, so which of these was the
best time for you to take action? And if you’re not sure, just kind of
imagine if I did know, which one was the best? And just relax, be
confident with your answers. And breathe. Okay, so bring your awareness
back to behind your eyes. And just relax your energy to their normal
settings. And create one more rose to clear any pictures about this
choice, any fears about deciding or getting it wrong. So let all that
energy move out and into the rose. Good. Put that rose outside your aura
and just blow it up. And then take a deep breath and say, I love my
intuition. I love synchronicity and abundance. Okay, now just smile and
open your eyes. Welcome back. I hope that was fun and enlightening.
Whatever you received, please trust yourself. Taking action on your
intuition makes life a lot more fun. It can feel a little risky
sometimes, but at least the choice is yours. Just that feeling alone is
totally worth it. And remember to try this out today, it doesn’t have to
be a long meditation. Maybe you’re in line for lunch, and you quickly
think, choice A, B or C, then go with your intuitive choice. The more
you practice, the easier it becomes. But don’t get obsessed with getting
the right answer. You won’t be right all the time. You won’t be 100%
accurate. But the more you play with your intuition and have fun with
your intuition, the more clear and accurate it will be. If you do want a
longer practice, I’ll share an audio version of this meditation too.
This is one that you can use over and over anytime you want to improve
your intuition. Enjoy.

LESSON 42 - MEDITATION: Guided journey 7: finding direction & timing

- Close your eyes and just be present in the center of your head. Notice your grounding and your Earth energy and feel your awareness focusing on the body. Okay, and so be in the center of your head, turn your analyzer off, and feel that third eye waking up. And notice your cosmic energy flowing through your body. And where it comes up the front of the body, let about 10% Earth energy mix in with that cosmic energy. So that mixture is coming up the front of the body. And again, notice that that'll activate your third eye. Good. And create a permission rose arms length in front of you, in front of your aura. And for now, let your aura adjust to that size, arms length around the body on all sides. Okay, now just smile and let go of any effort. And imagine a reading screen out in front of you. Just imagine there's a little neutrality gauge in the corner. It'll tell you if you charged. And if you don't see the screen, don't worry about it. You're just looking in that area in front of you with your attention. And think of a choice that you are curious about right now. Some path, some choice that's coming up for you. And imagine there's two paths in front of you. Two outcomes for that choice. And check your neutrality gauge. It is clear any pictures from your chakras if you're not neutral. And go ahead and ground both of those pathways too. Nice way to find neutrality. Now, very gently turn down your lower chakras to about halfway and choose one of those paths and start to move your awareness down that path. Again, you're just listening and experience. You're not planning or thinking about it. And just notice what do you see? What do you hear? What do you feel? Does it feel good? Does it feel stressful? And notice one more thing about this path that you didn't notice before. Okay, good. Now just rewind your awareness so you're back at the beginning. And then let yourself venture down that other path. Again, you're just going to feel and see, just experience yourself going down that path. Notice any details. And does this path feel good? Does it feel light and easy? Or does it feel like effort or difficulty? And notice one more thing that you didn't notice before. Good. Now, again, just rewind, so you're at the beginning, and just ask, is there a third path? Is there another choice that I didn't consider before? And then let your awareness start to travel down that new pathway. So notice any sights, any sounds, any people on that path. And then notice how does this one feel? Does it feel like it's in the flow? Does it feel easy or is it hard? And notice one more thing. Good. Now, rewind again to the beginning and just sensing all three of these paths in front of you. Just let your intuition guide you which path has the most flow. Maybe it's the first one or the second one or the third one. And with your intuition, just decide which path you want to take. Just send a ball of light down that path. And there's no pressure. You can always change your decision later. But for now, just decide and send that light down the path. And this light will help you find your synchronicities so that you know you're on the right path for you. Okay, very good. Now, imagine that timeline for this path. So just you can see it visually or just kind of imagine it in your mind. And think of one timing aspect of this path. Maybe when do I start down it, or when does, when's the best time for some other element? And when you think about the timing, notice your neutrality. You can use a rose to clear off any charge you have about the right timing or any kind of worries or fears about timing. You can use that rose to dust off the timeline as well. And good. Now, just start counting forward. Can be days, concierge, whatever's appropriate for you. Just notice so, one, how does that feel, look, or sound? Okay, two, three. Did it change? Just looking for changes in perception here. How about four? Or five? Or six? Again, notice any ups or downs. Maybe you're expanding or contracting, or you're hearing a sound. Okay, how about seven or eight? Okay, let's do that again, just all straight through. Sometimes it's easier to go quickly. So 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8. Okay, so which of these was the best time for you to take action? And if you're not sure, just kind of a imagine, if I did know, which one was the best? And just relax, be confident with your answers, and breathe. Okay. So bring your awareness back to behind your eyes and just relax your energy to their normal settings. And create one more rose to clear any pictures about this choice, any fears about deciding or getting it wrong, so that all that energy move out and into the rose. Okay, good. And put that rose outside your aura and just blow it up. And take a deep breath and say, "I love my intuition. I love synchronicity and abundance." Okay, just smile and open your eyes.

LESSON 43: Intuition: Exercises & Applications

<v ->Welcome back. Give yourself a deep breath and without effort, find
your space. Remember your grounding, center of your head, your Earth and
Cosmic energy, your aura boundary and permission rose. And turn your
lower three chakras down to about 50%. No effort, no time, no space
needed. It can be as easy as this to tune in, just remember your energy
tools. Today is our final lesson on intuition and you’re already doing
great, but I want to give you a few more ideas for using intuition in
your daily life. But first, let me share a student story. So this one’s
from Lucy, she said “This morning I did the daily meditation on quite a
simple choice, but it felt very obvious which was the one to take. Then
tonight I watched more of the video and did the similar meditation, the
choice and path I meditated on tonight came into my head just before I
started, wasn’t something I’ve thought of for the last two or three
weeks. Again, when I look at the paths, one just felt not right exactly,
but all I can say is easy, not stressful and I was really grinning as I
thought of it. Then the timeline seemed to work as well.” So this is
great. What I like about the story is how easily she let her intuition
come to her. Just one path felt easy, not stressful and made her smile.
Just no effort, no perfect pictures on how to do it. Her intuition was
just there and that’s the idea. So letting things be easy is how you’ll
find synchronicity and abundance, what, did you think abundance took
effort? Think again. There is always a natural flow of energy and
events, and if you’re in that flow, powerful things can happen easily.
If you’re fighting the flow, you’ll be working hard for just a little
gain. Synchronicity is how you know that you’re in the flow. If
everything is going easily, you’re in the flow. If the synchronicity
stops, you’re either on a detour or your timing is off. I have so many
stories about synchronicity, but I want to share my favorite one, this
is from 2010. So I had just finished a teaching tour in Japan and I had
a little unexpected money, and my intuition said buy platinum. And so I
did, and then I just forgot about it. And then, six weeks later, I was
flying back to Japan from Paris to propose to Hisami. To get married,
however, I needed some paperwork from the US Embassy and they were only
available on the last day of my trip, so before I went back to Paris. So
on my last day in Japan, I got my paperwork and we went shopping for
wedding rings and we found these two beautiful platinum rings called 24
hour love wheel. Now, Hisami’s birthday is 4/24 and mine is 10/24, so
the 24 was very meaningful to me. And as I bought the rings, I noticed
the date was 4/12/2010, but my brain saw four, 12 times two, and 10 or
4/24 and 10/24 coming together. Oh, synchronicity! I said, “Let’s get
married today” and we rushed down to the courthouse just in time before
they closed. And we’re actually waiting in the after hours room for our
two witnesses to come and I thought, am I crazy to trust numbers like
this? And I happened to glance at the clock and it said 17:17 and the
second switched to 17 as well. And I was like, okay, synchronicity. Then
the next day I remembered the platinum I had purchased seven weeks
before and I wanted to pay off my credit card, was actually a platinum
American Express, and I had charged the platinum rings on it. So,
remarkably, the price had gone up about 13%, which was enough to
completely cover buying the rings. And when I made the transaction, I
was actually thinking, I kind of wish it had been like 17% or 24%,
’cause those were the sort of special numbers I was feeling that day.
But then I got the closing statement and this is one of the few times
where synchronicity just blew me away. I kept staring at my statement
thinking, is that a real? My platinum sold for $1,717 an ounce, these
are the same numbers that I saw on the clock when I asked am I crazy to
follow the numbers, 17:17. Now I could have made up the 24 is in the
birthday connection and the platinum connection too, especially the
Platinum Amex. Right? But I didn’t have any control over the clock or
the price of platinum. That’s just resonance. For me, all these funny
signs are just an easy way to know I’m going the right way. My intuition
isn’t crazy. Marrying Hisami is with the flow. It’s a sign of harmony,
like all the guitar strings playing in coherence. And in my experience,
abundance comes naturally from being in the flow. Abundance is just a
consequence. You don’t need to focus on it or obsess about it, or even
ask for it. Just find the natural flow. As you keep practicing with your
intuition, you’ll start gaining your certainty. Initially it can feel
like you’re making it up, especially when you’re not neutral, but
certainty comes with time, with practice and with validation, you have
to follow your guidance and see if it’s right and then you’ll get
certainty. Just be patient. Is there anything in your life, that you
became an expert at in one day? I don’t think so. So just listening and
observe and don’t plan or analyze. That’s why we call it energy reading
and not energy writing. I recommend that you start with small decisions
and kind of work your way up to the bigger ones, but just self learn
gracefully and fail gracefully and have fun. Now I know many of you
won’t listen to my advice here. You’re already trying to solve your
greatest dilemmas with something you just learned, but I still recommend
starting small. It really helps your certainty to have small success
stories. It also helps to use the tools which are easy for you, when
you’re unsure. Sometimes I still do the old O-ring muscle test. If I
don’t want to tune in and find neutrality. You’ve probably seen this.
It’s like yes, strong. No, weak. My question, yes. Okay. That’s a yes.
Don’t judge. It’s always worked for me and I use anything which works
and you should too. As you practice, keep an eye on your expectations of
accuracy. If you have unrealistic expectations, you’re only going to
disappoint yourself, which lowers your certainty affects your
neutrality. It makes it hard to read energy. This is an intuition
negative feedback loop. The truth is there is no magic intuition switch,
which makes you a hundred percent accurate overnight. It takes time to
develop your abilities. You got to clear your pictures to gain your
certainty. And you’ll never be a hundred percent. Now, if you’re a
gambler, or want to guess the lottery numbers, intuition may or may not
be helpful for you. Most people have very little neutrality around money
and the lottery has so much energy and attention on it. The numbers are
changing all the time. It’s very hard to read. Now I do have friends who
go to the casino to practice their intuition, but I wouldn’t recommend
it. High stakes are not the easiest way to gain certainty. And there’s
really no need anyway, if you’re in the natural flow, because abundance
will come to you. It’s also important to say that intuition is not
omniscience. Being able to look at energy doesn’t mean you’ve taken the
time or are capable of looking at everything. I mean, you can read a
book, right? But can you read all of them? Probably not. Also, remember
that one mistake, doesn’t mean you’re a total failure. Even the world’s
top psychics are wrong sometimes, when they’re not neutral. The Denver
paper one time, had an article with three psychics predicting the
Superbowl results. Two were right, Broncos won, and one was wrong, the
Broncos lost. And naysayers loved this. See intuition is all BS.
Psychics are liars because one of three was wrong. This is a great
example of people not seeing beyond their pictures and beliefs. And you
can’t fight this, just to be amused when it happens. The best way to see
your progress is actually to compare to your pre intuition results, not
to perfection or a hundred percent. If you’re having some success with
your intuition, that’s great. The goal is to improve your life, not to
become perfect. As you practice also pay attention to your neutrality
and wishful thinking. Excellent neutrality leads to consistent, clear,
and accurate results. This is the best scenario. And over time, as you
clear your pictures and find more amusement, you’ll find this. And it’s
awesome. So-so neutrality leads to fuzzy or no results. This is more
common, but don’t give up, just clear your pictures, run your energy and
try it again when you feel neutral. No problem. Certainty and neutrality
tend to develop together. So have fun and keep practicing. Now when
you’re really not neutral, you get wishful thinking. This is La-la land,
where you’re making up stories and pretending it’s your intuition. And I
should point out that, it’s also the same thing most people do with
their minds. They make up stories or pictures and pretend they’re true.
Saying your pictures are intuition is no more compelling, accurate or
inaccurate than saying they’re logical. Pictures are pictures, beliefs
are beliefs, not truth. And it’s totally okay to be in Lala land
sometimes, it’s a nice vacation. Just come back before making big
decisions. Notice when you’re not neutral, run your energy, clear your
pictures and try again later. No problem. If you’re having a hard time
telling intuition from wishful thinking, here’s a few clues. Intuition
feels grounded. Wishful thinking feels spacey. Intuition feels calm.
Wishful thinking feels agitated or lit up. This takes a little getting
used to, I expected to feel elated by my biggest decisions. But when I
started following my intuition, the big decisions always felt very calm
and neutral. That’s a good clue too. Intuition feels neutral. It’s okay
if I’m not right. Even if I feel that I am. Wishful thinking isn’t
neutral. I have to be right or I’ll die or lose out or something else.
This can happen when you’re holding onto a lot of pain. Decisions feel
enormous and overwhelming So just heal yourself and clear your pictures
and hang in there. For me, intuition also feels amusing. Like maybe I am
crazy, but I’m enjoying myself, and living a life full of great
synchronicity and abundance. It’s a good crazy. Wishful thinking on the
other hand can be pretty serious. Like people don’t agree with me and
those people are crazy. If everyone has to be wrong for you to be right,
you’re probably stuck in your pictures. Try to find some amusement
again. Okay. Let’s talk about practice exercises. I have three easy ones
for you. Number one, just review your day with your intuition. So before
you go to sleep, review your day using your intuition. Imagine it’s
unfolding again. You can see, hear or feel what happened and use roses
to clear any pictures you’re charged energy. Maybe notice one thing you
didn’t notice before. This is a great exercise for developing your
intuitive abilities. Number two, preview your day with intuition. So
when you wake up, imagine how your day will unfold. Just turn off your
analyzer. Don’t plan it or think about it, and try to watch from
neutrality. What’s going to happen today? And then try acting on your
intuition and see what happens. This is a great exercise for developing
your certainty. Number three, start using your imagination. Let yourself
engage your imagination like a child. Just let yourself be curious. What
would they look like with a green shirt? Or what if the sky was orange?
Or what if I could drive to work and never stop at a red light? “What
if” is a great question for tapping your knowing-ness. For understanding
beyond your pictures. If you want to practice with a friend, just modify
the review your day exercise, have them describe their day while you
watch on your clairvoyant reading screen. And just notice if you’re
thinking and stop, just observe and follow along with their story,
energetically. This is a great exercise for learning to read energy. And
it helps you stay in neutrality instead of engaging in wishful thinking
and your friends will really enjoy it too because you are really
engaging with them. I encourage you to really practice with your
intuition. So you can feel all the benefits of using intuition. Seeing
the world with clarity, not just through your pictures. Being less
emotionally charged as you develop your neutrality. Enjoying a deeper
experience of the world, as you peek behind the curtains of the physical
world. Feeling more confident about your choices as you develop your
certainty and accuracy and enjoying amazing synchronicity and abundance.
Because as you follow the natural flow of energy, things just happen
easier. And the surprise benefit is that a magical life will become your
normal life. You can live a life beyond your dreams, beyond your
pictures of what’s possible. My life has been a perfect example of that,
and I’m so grateful. So please keep practicing. Practice is the only way
to develop your skills and certainty. Keep it simple. Just be curious
and use the tools which are easy for you. You don’t have to master all
the energy tools. Even if you forget half of them, you can get great
results. So just have fun and don’t think too hard. Your mind isn’t
needed for intuition. And of course, remember you are not alone. The
group energy is supporting your journey. So let’s do a quick meditation
to connect with each other right now and celebrate our intuition. So
give yourself a deep breath and close your eyes. Just be grounded and
relaxed in the center of your head. Notice your permission rose. Notice
your Earth and Cosmic energies running. Let a little Earth energy come
up the front with the Cosmic. Turn down those lower three chakras and
your analyzer. And see the group energy on your reading screen. Let
yourself see the inner circle, with all the Duality students who are
with you in present time. And see a larger circle beyond that, with all
the past and future students as well. And from your crown chakra, send a
little hello to everyone in the group. And let yourself receive all
those hellos. And take a look around the group, and admire all your
amazing, intuitive friends. You are an amazing group. Breathe that in.
Now notice yet another circle, even larger than before, with all the
bright spirits who are supporting us and helping us. Your personal
spirit guides, your higher selves, the angelic realm, ascended masters
and more. Notice how much support you truly have right now. And everyone
send a huge hello, please join us, and thank you to this bigger circle.
Feel all these supporting spirits walking among the circle right now.
Feel their hello with all your intuitive senses. Sight, sound, touch,
smell, taste. And welcome their presence with you. Know now that you are
truly not alone. Give yourself a deep breath. And give yourself
permission to stay in this space as long as you like. May we all connect
with our highest wisdom and divine guidance. Thank you everyone. Enjoy.

LESSON 44: Using Your Intuition: Self-Practice Day

<v ->Welcome back. Today is your self practice day. You have all the
information and tools you need to use your intuition and now it’s time
to apply them. We’re going to listen to the practice meditation together
right now, and then take the rest of the day to really use your
intuition in daily life. This is your chance to build your confidence
and certainty. Let’s begin. Close your eyes and focus on your breath.
And be behind your eyes in the center of your head. Notice your
grounding cord connecting your root chakra all the way to the center of
the Earth. Feel that Earth energy returning up your legs and into your
body. Let yourself be completely present in your body. Feel your Cosmic
energy coming down your back. Up the front of your body. Out your arms.
And at your crown chakra into your aura. Adjust your aura to arm’s
length from your body on all sides. Create a permission rose at the
front of your aura. Notice your root chakra, where the Earth and Cosmic
energy meet. Let a little Earth energy mix in with the Cosmic energy as
it comes up the front of your body. Feel your third eye activating.
Imagine you’re turning down your lower three chakras to about 50%. Feel
your third eye activating even more. Let your analyzer relax and turn
off. Breathe. Think about the day in front of you or tomorrow, if you’re
listening at night. Imagine you’re watching a movie of yourself going
about your day. What places are you going to? What does it feel like to
be there? Notice any sights or sounds or feelings. Keep playing your day
until you come upon a choice. A point in the day where you need to make
a decision. It can be something small, like where to eat lunch or
something much bigger. See your choices spreading out in front of you
like different pathways in time and space. How do you feel about this
choice? Are you confident or worried? Check your neutrality gauge and
use a rose to clear any pictures if you’re not neutral to this choice.
Breathe. Choose one of the pathways and imagine yourself traveling down
that path. What do you see and hear and feel on this path? Does it feel
light and easy or full of effort? Notice one more thing about this path
that’s important to you. Breathe. Rewind and choose another of the
pathways. Imagine yourself traveling down this new path. What do you
see, hear or feel on this path? Does it feel light and easy or full of
effort? Notice one more thing about this path that’s important to you.
Rewind again and choose one more path. Perhaps a way that’s unexpected
or hidden. Imagine yourself traveling down this new path now What’s
happening on this new path? How is it different from the others? Does it
feel easy or full of effort? Notice one more thing about this path
that’s important for you. Rewind again and look at all the paths in
front of you. Let your intuition guide you. Which path has the most flow
for you? Is this the path you want to take? Make your decision now and
send a ball of light down the path you choose. See that ball lighting up
all the synchronicity so that you’ll know you’re traveling the right
path for you. See yourself later in the day, well after your choice has
been made. Are you feeling good about your decision? Are you wishing you
had taken a different path? Use a rose to clear any charge around the
decision you made. Breathe. Be fully present behind your eyes, in the
center of your head. Relax your chakras. Relax your mind. Create a big
gold sun above your head and fill it with new life force for you. Bring
the gold sun into your body and aura. Completely filling yourself with
neutral life force energy. Fill all the way up till you’re 100% full.
Say, “I love my intuition.”I love synchronicity and abundance.” And when
you’re ready, smile and open your eyes.

Part 8: Access Your Higher Awareness

====================

LESSON 45: Live With Higher Awareness

<v ->Welcome everyone. It’s Jeffrey Allen again, give yourself a deep
breath. And as we begin, please remember your grounding. And relax into
the center of your head and say hello to your permission rose, notice
your Earth and Cosmic energy running. My little Earth energy come up the
front of the body with the Cosmic and say hello to the group energy.
Send smiles and hellos to your fellow students and feel the group energy
and intention supporting you. And remember that larger circle of right
spirits who are supporting us and helping us on our journey. Your
personal spirit guides, your higher selves, angelic realm, ascended
masters and more, and feel them around you right now offering additional
wisdom and guidance, never pushy, but always available to you. Just feel
how much they admire and appreciate you and feel grateful for their
presence too. And know that you are not alone. Give yourself a deep
breath and open your eyes. This chapter’s topic is expanding your
awareness, connecting with your spirit guides and your higher self. And
I hope you got a nice taste of that connection right now. And this is
what I want to give you this week. Just some new ideas and experiences.
I know these topics are dancing on thin ice for some of you. Our
pictures about identity and spirituality are typically strongly held and
fiercely defended. Your scientific beliefs or your religious beliefs
might feel uncomfortable, but don’t worry. I’m not selling you a new
religion or asking you to give up yours. It’s totally okay to believe
what you believe. I’m simply sharing my perspective based on my personal
experiences. And I hope to give you some interesting experiences too,
but it’s up to you to integrate them or reject them as you like.
Fortunately, the concept of higher self and spirit guides is common
across many faiths. So it’ll likely blend in pretty easily with your
beliefs, but if it doesn’t that’s okay too. This is where permission
rose is so helpful. Right now, everyone create a brand new permission
rose at the front of your aura and give yourself 100% permission to have
your beliefs. No one is trying to take that away from you and give
others 100% permission to have their beliefs. Ah, great. So just notice
how relaxing that is. Anytime your feathers get ruffled, just remember
to put up a permission rose so that you can shift from defending your
space or beliefs into consciously exploring them, it’s very powerful.
Also create a big healing rose in front of you for this chapter. As we
work together, let it absorb any old beliefs about identity or
spirituality that you’re ready to release. This is a great time to give
yourself a little update, set the intention that the rose automatically
dissolve and release as needed. Just creating a new healing rose in its
place anytime you need it, perfect. The Duality training has been about
expanding your perspective beyond the physical world and into the energy
world. And along the way, we’ve learned that physical only focus can be
limiting. You’re only using half of your abilities and presence to
perceive and interact with the world. You’ll still make progress, but
it’s slower. And the journey isn’t as fun. We’ve also learned that
energy only focus is limiting. So you won’t have much impact in your
world if you don’t engage both sides. It’s hard to enjoy the journey if
you’re not getting anywhere. And we’ve seen that physical and energy
focus are really great together, really powerful. You know where you’re
going and make great progress and enjoy the journey. You’ve also added
many energy tools to your awareness, grounding, center of head, higher
mind or think Cosmic energy, healing energy, or a permission rose,
chakras, roses and the gold sun. But more importantly, you learn to use
these energy tools in your physical world not separate from it. The last
two chapters you learned about physical perception and energy
perception, how your physical perception is encoded into energy through
pictures and how to reverse it when you need to. And we opened the door
to your intuition to add a new dimension of perception and understanding
of the world. The final step is expanding your identity. So keeping your
physical identity and adding an energy identity as well, not just
conceptually, but experientially. So your energy identity is what I’m
calling your higher self. And this identity gives you a higher
perspective and the ability to connect directly with your energy support
staff, which is your spirit guides, your physical identity is this
life’s body personality. Your higher self is your multi-life spirit
personality. And you can have both, no problem. So why is this
important? You know, both the spirit and body identity. When you’re
living primarily with your physical identity, you are easily swayed in
the physical world. Life goes up and you go up with it. Life goes down
and you go down with it. You don’t have as much internal strength so you
just kind of blow in the wind. You experience consequences of life
instead of co-creating your life. This can feel like you’re reacting to
events that you don’t understand, and didn’t knowingly create. It can
feel like life is happening to me. And I don’t want this, or what am I
doing wrong? Why is life so cruel? If you feel this way, connecting with
your energy identity will help, you’ll begin to understand what’s
happening and break out this thinking. When you’re living from your
physical identity, it’s difficult to elevate above your mundane
concerns. You might feel stuck in the rat race or in life’ traumas. Or
you might feel powerless or broke or physically sick. It might feel like
you’re always behind instead of getting ahead of the game, these are all
symptoms of understanding half of your life, just the physical half. And
unfortunately, if we only have our physical identity, it’s easy to feel
kind of lonely or hopeless or unsupported. I’m all alone or no one
understands me, or I can’t make the changes I want or no one’s helping
me or I give up. Now, sorry to paint such a complete picture here, but
sometimes life feels pretty bleak if you’re just acting from your
physical identity. Now, fortunately, that isn’t your only option. When
you’re living from your energy identity, you feel that your life is
meaningful, no matter what’s happening in your life. You feel you have a
greater purpose, even if you don’t understand it. And you know you are a
part of something greater than your physical concerns. You feel your
life’s events have a purpose, and you trust that you are guiding
yourself even into the difficult situations. These aren’t meaningless
suffering because you’re learning and growing. So life goes up and
you’re grateful for the joyful experience and life goes down and you’re
grateful to be learning and growing. When you’re living from your energy
identity, you feel empowered, not just a victim of circumstance. Things
you want are actually starting to happen in your life. You know you are
co-creating your life. And because you’re engaging your knowingness,
that understanding beyond your intellect and behind your pictures and
beliefs, life’s noise and drama fades away and a beautiful flow emerges.
At its best this almost feels magical. You ask for something and it
happens because you’re asking for things which are aligned with the
bigger picture. Also, when you’re living from your energy identity, you
have a huge support staff. You get a glimpse of this in the group
connection today and before, but honestly, it’s hard to imagine how much
support you have energetically until you start working with them
consciously. Your physical experiences and the planning you do are just
the tip of the iceberg. It’s humbling to experience and super
comforting. You are definitely not alone. And you earn so much more than
you think. One of the most tangible experiences I’ve had with my higher
self happened when I was meditating in Mount Shasta, California, the
energy there is really strong. And I was having an especially deep
meditation. And at some point I was trying to project my awareness
inside the mountain, inside Mount Shasta. And in my meditations, I just
followed along. So I found myself in this amazing cavern of knowledge
and knowingness and love and higher meaning, it felt like a different
dimension, but I couldn’t see anything, I was just feeling it. And then
I began hearing this voice, this wise, powerful, all knowing voice,
telling me about my life, about myself, my growth and all these
different things. And I was super excited, I thought it was talking to
God, but I wanted to see too. Now I’m no different than you. At one
point, the voice said, “Look here to see me.” And as I stared into the
inky blackness, I could see these two eyes peering back at me. So
powerful and so loving and so wise. And then my vision opened up and I
could see the entire cave. And I was standing by the wall, looking in a
mirror at my own eyes and face. And the voice my voice said, “I am you.”
Whoa, that blew me away. Hello, higher herself. And just happiness and
tears kind of burst out everywhere. And just that one experience really
changed me forever. And if you are open to it, you can find this
connection too either in this chapter or on your own, you’ll connect
with your higher self and with your spirit guides too. So today try to
keep that feeling from the group connection that there may just be a
powerful group of loving spirits that are supporting you. See if you can
feel them today. See if you can feel your higher self whispering to you
and talking to you, loving you and guiding you. It’s there, you’re
there. And to keep that healing rose with you today, too. So you can
keep releasing any pictures or beliefs that say it’s not possible that
you’re a small insignificant person or anything else that comes up for
you today. Just give yourself permission to start feeling the more
expanded you, enjoy.

====================

LESSON 46: Become Your Higher Self

<v ->Welcome back, give yourself a deep breath, and as we begin, please
remember your grounding and relax into the center of your head, and say
hello to your permission rose and notice your Earth and Cosmic energy
running. Let a little Earth energy come up the center the body and say
hello to the group energy, including the largest circle of spirits
supporting you. Send smiles and hellos to your fellow students and feel
the group energy and attention supporting you. Today, I want you to
realize that you are more than you think. You are a physical body bound
in time and space, this is true, it’s obvious and natural, but that’s
not all of you. You are also your mind and thoughts bound by pictures
and beliefs. This is also true, but it’s not all of you. You are energy
and consciousness, not limited by time and space or pictures and
beliefs. You’re noticing this already in this training. You can do
things and feel things you didn’t realize you could do before. You are
much bigger than you believe you are. When I was living in Boulder,
Colorado, I was practicing the energy tools that I’ve shared with you,
and when I meditated, I started noticing other spirits around me. Now,
at first it was kind of this big sense of being watched, and I’d
actually had that many times in my life, it always felt a little strange
or uncomfortable to me. But in these meditations, it actually felt good,
more than like I was being watched over. And as the weeks progressed, my
meditations progressed too. I started feeling a presence nearby when I
was meditating, like I saw something that wasn’t there when I looked
over. That kind of feeling. Then I started noticing conversations, but
the weird part, aside from hearing conversations in my head, was that I
was part of the conversation but I couldn’t quite grasp it, I wasn’t
quite there. It was like watching a movie with the sound not synced up
or something. Only, I was in the movie, not watching it. And then, the
next thing is meditations, I began recognizing the spirits. First, it
was Archangel Michael and Rafael and Christ, and I didn’t know why but I
recognized them and I wasn’t even sure I believed it, but inside I still
knew it. This is how knowingness works beyond our beliefs. I had both
feelings, surely I’m making this up from my pictures and my mind, and
this is more real than anything I’ve ever experienced from my
knowingness. So, I was having a conversation with them that I didn’t
understand. It was definitely me, I was in a first person perspective,
and it felt like me, but I wasn’t driving, kind of like in my dreams,
sometimes I’m doing things but I’m not really conscious or driving. Now,
it was both exciting and a little strange. I didn’t really understand,
why am I in this group, why are they talking to little old me, I’m just
an insignificant person, but they don’t seem to see it that way. It
feels more like I’m part of the team, discussing things and planning and
so on. It felt really grandiose, like whoa, who am I when I’m not here?
And it was kind of scary too, I thought, maybe I have some huge life’s
purpose that I’m totally failing to deliver, I must be failing because
I’m not doing anything that’s worthy of their attention. And it was a
weird feeling knowing that I’m much bigger than I ever imagined, yet
failing smaller than I ever had before at the same time. And then as I
continued meditating throughout the days and weeks, the words started
coming in too. I could understand the conversation and take part
consciously for a little while. And when I spaced out, my higher self
would pick up right where I left off, almost like the conscious part of
me was optional, which was a little unnerving since that’s the only part
of me that I really knew until this point. And again, I wasn’t sure if
it was even real, but it was more interesting than any self-help book
I’d ever read, so I kept tuning in to see what would happen next. And
when I asked them, they just said, it’s real, but you don’t understand
it yet, trust us, just keep going, understanding will come later. So, I
did just that, I followed their lead, and the conversations kept going
and going. It’s still going 20 years later, only now it seems normal
rather than surprising. There’s less distance between my physical
identity and my energy identity or my higher self. Over the years, I
realized everyone is connecting like this, I’m no more special than you.
I just have more practice accepting who I am beyond the body. This
awareness is your higher self, that part of you which operates far
beyond your understanding and beyond the limits of your body. It’s you
with all the illusions and misunderstanding taken away. And you are
incredible. You forget that when you take a body, but you can start
remembering. When you consciously bring a little more of you into your
life, you’ll be amazed by the results. You can live that more powerful
and bigger you. That’s the goal of engaging your higher self and spirit
guides, and it’s so much more fun than you can imagine. It doesn’t mean
you have to do anything differently, change careers or anything like
that, it’s just about being conscious and being yourself in any
situation. So, let’s give it a try. Get in a relaxed position and ready
to meditate. And I’ll describe the beginning of this first, so you don’t
get lost. So, we’re going to start in the center of your head and then
move to the higher mind just up and back a little. Then, we’re going to
move to the back of your crown chakra, which kind of looks like a ring
or a halo around the crown of your head. So, you’ll be this small person
kind of standing in the back of your crown chakra, and then you’ll look
across your crown chakra and see your higher self on the other side. And
then we’ll continue from there. So, just let it be easy, feel the
energy, and have fun with it. Don’t worry about getting anything
perfect. Let’s begin. Go ahead and close your eyes and be present right
behind your eyes. Notice that grounding cord that’s connecting you in
the root chakra into the center of the Earth. And feel your aura coming
in around you, it’s nice and focused, nice and strong. Let that Earth
energy run through your legs. Feel that Cosmic energy running all the
way down to the back, up the front of the body, at your arms, and at
your crown chakra into your aura. And really feel that Cosmic energy
activating your crown chakra right now. And say to yourself, I give
myself permission to experience myself fully. Be in the center of your
head, just be very quiet, turn down that analyzer. And let your energy
move up and back a little bit into the higher mind. Notice any thoughts
just floating by. Just find that easy peaceful place in the higher mind.
Okay, now notice your crown chakra on top of your head, a big ring or a
halo. Then move your awareness up and back, so you’re standing right at
the back of your crown chakra. And see if you can feel and see that ring
of light that is your crown chakra. And look across the circle and see
mirror image of yourself on the other side of your crown. Just give a
little wave to yourself. And now, imagine that you’re transferring your
consciousness across this circle, into the other you. So, you’re inside
that mirror image, looking back at the original you. From here, notice a
beam of golden light all around you, like a round elevator shaft that’s
going up into the sky. And feel yourself being drawn upward into that
golden light, and just let yourself go and drift upward into that
peaceful bright light. As you’re moving upwards, just notice above you,
a really bright beautiful golden light. Just feel it welcoming you and
loving you, and know that this light is part of you. Let yourself move
right now into that light, so feel yourself expanding, feel yourself
radiating outward to infinity, and inward to infinity as well. And let
your old identity fade away and let yourself be fully embraced by this
light that is your higher self. Just feel that powerful love, feel that
expansive knowingness, and feel that infinite smile that is you. Open
yourself up right now to receive a message from your higher self. Let
that energy, that information, resonate all around you and through you.
Breathe. From this light of your higher self, look down towards your
body below and just feel that deep love and respect that you have for
yourself and for all your experiences in this life. And just send that
love, that respect, down that beam of light all the way into your body
below. And let yourself, let your awareness begin to drift downward
through that column of light, down toward the body in your crown chakra,
until you’re standing again across the circle, looking with love at that
previous you. And feel that energy still coming from the higher self and
let that energy just wilt away any previous self judgements, any sense
of lack, and look across your crown chakra at the amazing human being
that you are. Then step across that circle and emerge your awareness,
this higher self awareness and your physical body awareness, and just
know that you are both. You’re your higher self and you are your body.
And just bring that merged you into the higher mind, and notice how
different it feels in your higher mind. Bring the merged you into the
center of your head, feel that same love and respect from your higher
self, respective and radiating all throughout that room that is the
center of your head. Give yourself a deep breath and notice your body.
Just wiggle your hands and feet, and say I love my higher self, I love
my human self, and open your eyes.

====================

LESSON 47: Meet Your Spirit Guides

<v ->Welcome back, give yourself a deep breath. And as we begin, please
remember your grounding. Relax, in the center of your head with your
analyzer off. And say hello to your permission rose. Notice your Earth
and Cosmic energy running and let a little Earth energy mix in with your
Cosmic. Notice your lower three chakras turning down slightly and say
hello to the group energy, send smiles and hellos to your fellow
students and feel the group energy and intention supporting you. As you
start to explore your energy identity, you move beyond the bounds of
time and space and beyond the bounds of your pictures and beliefs, in
this new awareness, you quickly notice that you are not alone. There is
more happening out there than is happening right here is, many types of
energy, many types of consciousness or spirits, more than you can
understand, and really more than you need to understand. It’s good
enough to just feel it. Your spirit guides are your personal connection
into this unseen energy world. Whether you’re consciously interacting or
not, they are helping you. Even if you don’t believe in them, they are
helping you all the time. They helped you plan this lifetime before you
were born and they’re with you for your entire life and into your next
journey too. I have seen healing guides come and go as I grew as a
healer, but I’ve never seen personal spirit guides change, they’re with
you for this life. At least, that’s what they tell me. Your spirit
guides are assigned specifically to you. Usually part of your spirit
family, where you’re moving together from life to life. And when you’re
planning this life, you might decide, okay, I’ll be your brother and
you’ll be my mother and so on. And a few of you say, you guys, go ahead.
I’ll be a guide this time, you guys go in. So your personal guides are
different from angels or ascended masters who are available to everyone.
You might think of them as your guardian angels. Your spirit guides are
like trusted friends watching from life’s backstage. They don’t have
bodies. So their perception is not localized in time and space. They
always have your back and always have your best interest in mind. And
their goal is to help you live the life that you want to live, they have
no personal agenda. They’re just helping you. It’s a beautiful
expression of neutrality and your spirit guides fulfill two main roles.
First, they’re advisors, sharing insights and providing options. And
they know both your identities, your current life, body personality, and
your multi life spirit personality, your higher self, and your guides
are helping you, but they’re not responsible for you. You are
responsible for your life and your choices, not your guides. Second,
your guides are like a concierge for planning and organizing and
implementation, and they are coordinating with everyone else’s guides
too. So you’ll cross paths with the perfect people and the perfect
timing for you. To align you with the perfect opportunities to meet both
of your personality’s agendas. And this is helpful because the two you’s
sometimes have different agendas. If your body personality has
conflicting agendas with your higher self, life can get a little
frustrating, which is why I suggest that you get on the same page. It
just makes life easier. Working with spirit guides is helpful in so many
ways. In fact without them, life can feel a little overwhelming. I
remember this, my late twenties and early thirties, I was successful in
my life and my career. Sometimes I wondered why have I been put in
charge of my life? Food, clothing, work, bills, co-parenting, taxes. It
feels like a lot of responsibility. Should there be some instructions
somewhere? And it turns out there is if we know how to tune in, because
I felt so overwhelmed, I would try to control or micromanage things.
When we think our lives are totally determined by our minds, there’s a
lot of pressure to get things right. And instead of letting things fall
naturally into place, we tend to control everything or plan the details
down to the last letter. And this is stressful and often kind of
detrimental as well. In contrast, when working with spirit guides, you
trust that your life is on track, despite the details, you have a sense
that everything will work out, not a blind faith, but one that comes
from experience, my guides are time tested and have repeatedly delivered
great results, better than I could have planned myself. This trust in
life, lets you feel relaxed and excited about the future. Knowing that
you have a fantastic team of experts helping you and spirit guides are
great for relationships and decision making too. When we’re not tapped
into our guidance, it’s easy to misunderstand people which can lead to
poor decisions and difficult relationships. So many times I thought I
understood someone’s intentions or their actions. And when I tuned in
and cleared my pictures and asked my guides about it, I got a completely
different perspective. And pretty quickly I realized how much I was
filtering life through my pictures. Your guides are great for helping
with this because they see reality unfiltered. They don’t have bodies,
so they don’t have pictures. And having access to that clear perspective
can smooth out your misunderstandings before they become real problems.
Working with your guides also to great opportunities and a sense of
adventure. They make unusual suggestions, things I never would have
thought of or been brave enough to try. And this can lead to really
fantastic happy accidents. I’ll give you a fun example. When I was
living in Sedona, I had quit my engineering job and I was working as a
healer and an energy reader and my income had reset to zero. So I was
tuning in talking to my guides and I said, I’d like to make $100,000 a
year and give away 10%. That’s my goal. And my guide said, that’s great.
That’s actually two goals. And you can achieve one of those right now.
Just give away $10,000. Okay, not exactly what I was thinking, but I
thought, well, I could give away 100 healings for $100 each, that’d be
$10,000. And my guide said, yeah, good idea. Give them to a healers in
Sedona. So I made 100 Healings websites and I made a little business
cards so people wouldn’t think I was just kind of crazy. And I started
giving out free healings to healers. And when I did it, I would take a
picture of them, put a little bio about them and put them online too as
a little free advertising for them. And it turned out that Google loved
this. So if you went to Google and typed in Sedona acupuncturist, my
website came up, you typed in Sedona massage therapist, my website came
up, pretty much any healing modality I typed in, my website came up. So
following this guidance gave me a great placement in Google, which led
to me fulfilling the second goal as well. And making that $100,000 a
year, kind of surprising. So as you can see, guides are great for
manifesting too, without them , it’s easy to confuse effort with
manifesting. We make things more difficult than is needed. Here’s a
silly example of too much effort. Let’s say you go to a restaurant and
you order your favorite meal. And then you follow the waiter into the
kitchen and interrupt while they’re talking to the chef. And then you
try to knock the chef out of the way and tell them how to cook and take
over the entire kitchen. This is not going to lead to very good meal or
a fun experience. Now of course, you would never do that in a
restaurant, but you do it all the time and other places in your life.
You try to do everything yourself instead of relaxing and letting your
guides help, your spirit guides also help you understand the timing of
your life. Without them, it’s easy to get impatient and mess things up.
Think of the restaurant again, you’re feeling abundant and you order
their finest dinner and you wait five minutes and it doesn’t arrive. You
haven’t seen any progress. So you call the waitress and you order again,
this time you order a pizza and you wait five more minutes and nothing,
no pizza. So imagine they forgot your order, and you’re frustrated, you
call the waitress again and you order a big fruit smoothie and then you
wait two more minutes and nothing happens and you’re getting angry and
hungry and desperate. And you start grabbing food off people’s plates
and stuffing it in your face. And then the smoothie arrives followed by
your fine dinner and your pizza, but you’re too full to enjoy it. And
you wonder what crazy person who ordered all this food, that was you,
again, you would never do this in a restaurant, but this is how we act
when we ask for things from our guides, we forget our guides are helping
us behind the scenes. And if we don’t see progress right away in the
physical world, we assume failure. We get impatient and we make new
requests. Like we think, I want a million dollars. It doesn’t happen
quickly, so then we think, okay, how about $1000? If we tend to keep
asking, asking, asking, instead of just waiting for what’s already in
progress, and this is inefficient and ineffective, it makes for a very
busy kitchen. So let’s try again with trust in your guides. So you let’s
say you go in a restaurant, you order and you relax, confident that your
meal will come when it’s ready, you trust the waitstaff and the kitchen
will do a great job. And you enjoy your time with your friends, knowing
that extra weight is needed because you have a little special order, and
you’re grateful for this opportunity to rest. And when your meal
arrives, it’s not exactly what you imagined, but you try it out. And to
your surprise, it’s better than you imagined. You enjoy your meal with
no worry about future meals. You feel grateful and satisfied. Trusting
your guides feels like this. I’m not anxious about the future because I
know my team always has my back, life is more graceful, relaxing, and
full of ease. Meeting Hisami was like that too. I’d been trying to
attract my future wife by imagining all the details and it just wasn’t
working. And I’ve seen this a lot in clients, too. They have a list of
95 things that they either want or don’t want in a partner. And we
wonder why the kitchen can’t fulfill that order. I noticed this for
myself and I finally told my guides, obviously I don’t know how to
create a happy relationship. I would have done it already. I give up,
can you help? I just want a happy, lasting relationship. And then I
stopped trying, and soon after I met Hisami, through a series of
synchronicities, thank you, guides. And she was different from anything
I’d asked for. I’d never imagined anyone who fit me so perfectly. My
guides really knew me better than I knew myself. And it’s so comforting
to know that they are always there and always helping me. I want to give
you a feeling for this too, what it feels like to connect with your
guides. So get comfortable and ready to meditate. And let’s begin. Go
ahead and close your eyes. And turn down that noise in the center of
your head until it’s very, very quiet, let that analyzer be off. And
move yourself up and back a little bit into that higher mind. And just
observe your thoughts and find that very peaceful place. Move your
awareness up and back a little bit. So you’re standing again the back of
the crown, standing in that golden circle that’s your crown chakra. And
feel that energy getting very bright and very clear. Remember that sense
from earlier of all the spirits that are supporting you right now. Ask
those guides to come into the circle now. See them and feel them
beginning to appear around that circle of your crown chakra. And say
hello and feel their presence and their joy. And ask one of your guides
to step forward, to communicate with you. And say hello and smile at
them. And let your feeling or your vision of this guide become more
clear. And ask a question to this guide, or simply be curious about
something and open to a response. And notice what that guide is saying
to you, what they’re showing you And also notice how you’re feeling,
what message are you receiving from this guide? Now, notice your guide
and offering you a gift. Now, let yourself receive that gift. It’s a
crystal or a symbol or something else, and use your intuition to know
where should I keep this gift in my energy body, in my aura or in my
chakra? Where should I put it? And just put that gift from your guide in
that location now. And to say thank you to this guy and notice that you
have something, a gift for them in return. Just feel it in your hands
and reach out and give it to that guide. And then just notice any last
words or feelings or communication with that guide. Say goodbye for now
and see that guide joining that large circle again. And really feel the
strength of this inner circle of guides. Step into the middle of that
circle. Look around and see all those guides smiling at you. And expand
your awareness. Notice there’s a larger circle around that first inner
circle. See all these additional spirits that are helping you and
helping others. And expand your awareness again. And just notice
additional circles extending further and further, more and more
supports. More help and circling you. And really feel all that love and
admiration these spirits have for you. Feel how much you’re respected
and honored, how much you’re supported and cared for. Let yourself fully
receive that right now. Send a big thank you out to your support team.
Bring your awareness back into the higher mind. And just notice you can
still feel that support radiating and resonating through you. And be in
the center of your head. Still feeling confident and supported and
loved. And you say to yourself, I love being supported. I accept my
guidance now. And give yourself a deep breath. Open your eyes. Welcome
back, great work. I hope you could feel your guides around you. If you
didn’t, don’t despair, they can still feel you and communicate with you.
Awareness always comes in perfect timing. Just keep feeling your guides
around you today and we’ll connect with them more tomorrow, enjoy.

====================

LESSON 47 - MEDITATION: Meet your support team

- Go ahead and close your eyes, and turn down that noise in the center of your head until it's very, very quiet. Just let that analyzer be off. And move yourself up and back a little bit into that higher mind. And just observe your thoughts and find that very peaceful place. Move your awareness up and back a little bit. So you're standing again at the back of the crown, standing in that golden circle that's your crown chakra. And feel that energy getting very bright and very clear. Remember that sense from earlier of all the spirits that are supporting you right now. Ask those guides to come into the circle now. See them and feel them beginning to appear around that circle of your crown chakra, and to say hello and feel their presence and their joy. And ask one of your guides to step forward to communicate with you, and say hello and smile at them. And let your feeling or your vision of this guide become more clear. And ask a question to this guide, or simply be curious about something and open to a response. And notice what that guide is saying to you, what they're showing you. And also notice how you're feeling. What message are you receiving from this guide? And then notice your guide offering you a gift. And let yourself receive that gift. It's a crystal, or a symbol, or something else. And use your intuition to know, where should I keep this gift in my energy body? In my aura or in my chakra? Where should I put it? And just put that gift from your guide in that location now. And just say thank you to this guide. And notice that you have something, a gift for them in return. Just feel it in your hands and reach out and give it to that guide. And just notice any last words or feelings, or communication with that guide. And say goodbye for now and see that guide joining that large circle again. And really feel the strength of this inner circle of guides. And step into the middle of that circle. Look around and see all those guides smiling at you. And expand your awareness and notice there's a larger circle around that first inner circle. And see all those additional spirits that are helping you and helping others. And expand your awareness again, and just notice additional circles extending further and further, more and more support, more help encircling you. And really feel all that love and admiration these spirits have for you. Feel how much you're respected and honored, how much you're supported and cared for. Let yourself fully receive that right now. Send a big thank you out to your support team. Bring your awareness back into the higher mind. And just notice you can still feel that support radiating and resonating through you. And be in the center of your head, still feeling confident and supported and loved. And just say to yourself, I love being supported. I accept my guidance now. And give yourself a deep breath and open your eyes.

LESSON 48: Talk With Your Spirit Guides

<v ->Welcome back. Give yourself a deep breath. And as we begin, please
remember your grounding and Earth energy. Relax into the center of your
head. And say hello to your permission rose. Notice your Cosmic energy
running, energizing and healing your chakras. Say hello to your
permission rose and say hello to the group energy. Send smiles and
hellos to your fellow students and guides, and feel the group energy and
intention supporting you. So, let’s explore more deeply how your guides
communicate with you. From my experience, spirit guides are very clever
and resourceful. They’ll use any way they can to get through to you. I
remember a student in a seminar saying, “I’m trying so hard, but I can’t
hear my guides.” But clear as day, I could see a guide right behind
them, talking to them and helping them. And the guide noticed me and
laughed and said, “You should see it from our perspective.” And I got
this vision of them trying every way imaginable to get through. So let’s
look at some of the ways our guides can talk to us. The first is
hearing. It might be a conversation, sometimes in our own voice, or a
narration or insights. Or it might be ringing in your ears. Might tell
you to pay attention or to be conscious of something. Occasionally, I
hear “stop” when there’s a danger. Guides also communicate via sight
with a light, visions, or journeys. Important people might have a glow
around them when you see them. Or, you might get a vision of some future
possibility. Sometimes your guides want to show you something, like the
Akashic Records or some other place. This used to happen to me when I
was taking classes like this one. During the meditations, my guides
would appear and take me somewhere else. And my healing clients used to
fall asleep during sessions too, and wake up with fascinating visions
from their guides. Guides also communicate via thoughts and insights, or
a sudden understanding. Do you ever wonder where these insights come
from? Sometimes it’s your guides. Have you ever been trying so hard to
solve something, then you take a break or go to the gym and relax, and
boom, the insight comes. Sometimes it’s your brain that has to relax
first so your guides can be heard over your thoughts. Guides also
communicate via situations, or opportunities to learn and grow. Your
guides will help you train to reach your goals. Do you ever wonder, “How
did I end up in this situation?” Either it’s perfect and you can’t
believe you’re here, or it seems completely out of place, and only later
do you recognize the significance. That’s your guides helping. Guides
also communicate via feelings or a strong draw towards someone or
something. I remember in 1995, this “Kryon, Book 1” just kind of fell
off the shelf as I walked by in a bookstore. And my wife asked, “What’s
that?” And I responded with these exaggerated emotions. “This looks
really good,” but I hadn’t even really looked at it. But that was my
guides telling me, “There’s something important in here for you.” You
might get a feeling like this for a person too. Like, “I really want to
meet them.” It doesn’t mean it’ll be a lifelong relationship, but
there’s a reason why you’re feeling this guidance. Basically, spirit
guides will communicate anyway you’ll listen. Signs, numbers, symbols,
images, friends, synchronicity. If you like tall men, your guides will
send you messages from tall men. Communication may include resistance as
well, or things not going well. Sometimes this is your guides on the
other side of that door you’re trying to open, and they’re holding the
door shut, hoping you’ll get the hint and go the other way. Now, of
course, if you persist, they’ll let you through, but they’re trying to
help you avoid a needless difficulty. They’ll use anything that gets
your attention to communicate with you. Sometimes guidance is really
simple. Like I’ve heard, “Buy Apple stock,” or “Buy Bitcoin.” I was
like, “Buy what?” Probably should’ve listened to that one. Sometimes
it’s very detailed. In 2006, I was in Arizona and I was driving a lot
from Sedona out to Mount Shasta. And, I wanted a cheaper car that got
better mileage. So I asked my guides, and they told me to check out a
Prius. So I called around and they were all sold out. You couldn’t get
one anywhere. And I thought, “That’s not really how I roll.” So I just
started calling around, and the next day I found a dealer that had two
on the lot. And I drove over there and they had three when I got there.
And as I was looking, my guides were saying, “Buy the car, buy the car,
buy the car.” And I was like, “I don’t want to buy a new car. I don’t
want to spend that much money.” “But the car, buy the car. Don’t worry
about the money.” And I thought, okay, I’ll play this game. So, which
one should I buy, this kind of basic one or this top of the line one?
They said, “Don’t worry about the money.” Okay, I’ll go for it. So I
bought the top of the line Prius. I financed it a hundred percent,
’cause I didn’t have any money to put down. So the next morning, I was
meditating and I asked my guides, “I need a little more information
about that, ‘Don’t worry about the money’ part because it sure feels
like I have a car payment now, and I don’t want one.” And my guide said,
“Here’s the deal. You’re going to get laid off in two weeks, and you’re
working half time right now, which means you’re going to get half
severance, even though you worked full time for 10 years. So we want you
to contact your boss and tell them that you want to move up to full time
because you bought a new car and you want to make some payments. And it
won’t seem suspicious, and they’ll accept that. And then you’ll get a
full-time severance package.” So I was like, wow, that’s a lot of
detailed information. So, I sent the email to my boss, and right away I
got a response back, “Let me make the change.” And actually, I was a
little bit panicked ’cause I didn’t want to work full time. I sent back
and said, “Oh, let me think about it for a couple of days.” And they
said, “Jeff, let me make this change. Let me make the change.” I was
like, “Okay, something’s going on.” So, I actually went on vacation the
next day and went to Mount Shasta. And at the end, when I came back,
sure enough, I got laid off. And my severance package came, and the
difference between my half severance and my full severance was the price
of the car. So I paid the entire car off. My guides bought me a new
Prius. That leap of faith really paid off. And, this is a true story,
but it’s kind of an extreme example. Don’t expect that from your guides
right away. This communication gets more detailed with practice, and
when you have less pictures to interfere. So, sometimes I’ll get no
answer at all, which I assume means, ah, there’s no information
available now. And that’s okay too. Now, everyone says, “I want to talk
to my guides too.” Well then, start listening. They’re communicating
with you all the time, even if you don’t hear them. If you’re insisting
on a spoken voice, you might be missing so much more. Get creative with
your listening and start communicating and it’ll come. Hopefully by now
you’re thinking, “How can my guides help me?” So there’s four big ways.
First, they can help you understand yourself. I remember being overcome
with fear one time when I was climbing, it was actually indoors, in
Malaysia. And that seemed really strange indoors, until my guides
pointed out, “This fear is really about business, but you can’t see it
there, so we put it in your climbing space.” I thought, “Ah, very
clever.” I started working on some business stuff and the climbing fear
went away. Your guides can also help you understand other people. One
time a girlfriend was really negative, and my guide said to me, “She
really wants to say, ‘I love you and I’m in pain,’ it’s just coming out
as, ‘I hate you, and it’s your fault.’ But, don’t listen to the words,
focus on her intention.” And I did, and things got better. Your guides
also help you understand situations, like my Prius story. Understanding
that I was getting laid off was it a big help. And they can help
coordinate and organize your life. This is actually happening already,
so you don’t need to do anything to get this started. Your life will
become easier when you trust that you have a fantastic support team. You
have to do your part and take action, but you don’t have to figure
everything out ahead of time. A common question that I get is, “How do I
know if it’s my guides, and not something else?” And this is pretty easy
to feel, actually. Your guides are insightful and kind, and
non-judgmental, never negative or blaming. They have no personal agenda,
just supporting and responding to you. So they’re never pushy or
demanding. And they’re often surprising and light and funny, and amused
and loving. And your guides often feel familiar to you too. You’ve known
them for longer than this lifetime, and it shows. You guides should feel
very comfortable to you. If not, clear any resistance or fear and try
again. One of my favorite ways to connect with a spirit guide is to
invite them into a column of light. You can find a particular guide with
either a location or a name or a feeling, and we’ll try location today
’cause that’s probably the easiest. Names are great too, but it’s easy
to get hung up on them, so those are optional. Anyway, once you have a
guide in mind, you send them a little crown chakra “hello”, like we’ve
been doing in the group connections. And then you visualize or feel a
big column of light in front of you, this nice, clear, high-frequency
light. And ask your guide to appear in that light, and then just have a
conversation with them, just like you would a person, either out loud or
in your head, doesn’t really matter. And then, listen with all your
senses for the answers. You might get words, thoughts, feelings,
visions, or something completely different may happen too. And that’s
okay. I’m just giving you a starting place, not a set of rules. So let’s
try it. Get comfortable and ready to meditate, and let’s begin Go ahead
and close your eyes. And notice your grounding and your Earth energy,
you’re really present in your body. And feel that Cosmic energy running
down the back and up the front of the body. And really feel it
activating your third eye and your crown chakra. Be in the center of
your head. It’s very quiet. And be in the higher mind. At a nice, still
point. Let yourself be aware of your aura and that space around you. And
feel that light of your higher self still radiating down on you. And,
just say hello to your crown chakra. See it kind of radiating out in all
directions, 360 degrees. And notice any points of light around you,
where your guides are responding. And notice one light that’s especially
strong or especially present. And, send a hello from your crown chakra
directly to that place, to that guide. And from your higher mind,
visualize that column of light out in front of you. See it getting
brighter and brighter. And ask your guide to appear in that light right
now. See them and sense them. How does this guide feel to you? How does
this guide appear to you? And smile and say hello. See them smiling back
at you. Ask this guide, why did they come to you today? How long has
this guide known you for? Just let yourself hear or see or know or feel
that response. Does this guide have a message for you today? And, do you
have a question for this guide? Just ask it in your head. Again, just
notice what you get back. Could be words or thoughts or memories or some
insights, everything’s okay. And then just ask another question. Let
that conversation continue a little bit. And notice one more thing about
this guide. Okay, and just let that conversation wrap up. And, thank
that guide for talking to you. And notice if there’s a name or an image
or a symbol that you can use for them in the future. And say goodbye to
that guide for now. And just see that column of light fading away. And
remember that location, and notice you can still notice that guide
there. Very good, so be in the center of your head. Wiggle your hands
and feet. And give yourself a deep breath. And open your eyes.

LESSON 49: Duality Graduation & Continuing Your Journey

<v ->Welcome back. Give yourself a deep breath, and without effort, find
your space. Remember your grounding, center of your head, your Earth and
Cosmic energy running. Your aura boundary and your permission rose. Say
hello to your higher self and feel all the guides around you, loving you
and supporting you. It can be this easy to tune in. Just remember your
energy tools and your higher awareness. Today is our final lesson for
Duality. Wow, what a journey it’s been. Thank you for all the time and
practice and love that you put in. And thank you for trusting me to take
you on this journey. It’s been an honor. There are so many ways to
continue accessing your higher guidance. You can connect with your
higher self by looking at a mirror, or in a meditation of your own
design. You might travel upward from your crown like we did before, or
imagine that you’re sitting on a throne, or anything else, which feels
connecting to you. Just trust yourself and explore and discover the best
ways for you. Just keep expanding, but don’t get lost. Remember, you’re
in this life for a reason. If you start thinking, I only want to be a
spirit or I want to go home or I want to escape this life, these are not
the thoughts of an integrated body and spirit identity. Remember to
ground, run your energy, and clear that growth period. Integrate your
physical and energy identity: your body and your spirit. It’s not one or
the other. Have them both, love them both. Have enough energy presence
to enjoy a higher perspective. That little smile that says, hmm, I know
there’s something bigger. And have enough physical presence to live this
life fully. Remember the end of the meditation? I love my higher self. I
love my human self. This is the essence of Duality awareness. There are
so many ways to connect and communicate with your spirit guides, too.
The two methods we tried, work well for many people, but feel free to
explore and invent your own. With time, it will become easy and natural
as you find and develop your strengths. My strength is my clear
audience. So I don’t try to see my guides, I just talk to them and they
respond. Your guidance might come as pure inspiration, like when I was
organizing Duality. When I’m connecting with my higher self and guides,
it feels easy and flowing, not thinking too much. Or you might connect
with them through guided writing. Just to say hello and begin to write
or type. Don’t think: just keep going until there’s nothing more to
write. I wrote for four full days once, a whole book’s worth of
material. And it was fascinating to read later because I didn’t remember
most of it. Or if clairvoyance is strong for you, you might see your
guides. I was sitting in my car in Boulder one day, and I looked over to
see my guide in the passenger seat. She was so beautiful. I just broke
out in tears; it was so amazing. It’s very rare for me. Journeys with
your guides can be very powerful too. In Sedona, I had a deep meditation
practice for communicating with animals and the angelic realm and the
elemental realm. And every morning, I’d see Pegasus, the winged horse,
and I’d get on his back and we’d journey together. Now, I have no idea
why I was seeing Pegasus, but we traveled everywhere: inside the body,
around the planet, other worlds and dimensions. And all the while with
this verbal commentary. And afterwards, I’d tell my roommate, “Wow, that
was the most amazing meditation ever.” And Ken would say, “Again?”
Because it happened every day. Higher guidance is pretty addicting, in a
good way. My longest stretch was over 500 mornings in a row. I totally
loved it. Now remember, your communication will be unique to you and
your guides. With practice, you’ll discover a style that works great for
you. And then I recommend sticking with it every day. You don’t need a
goal; just one day at a time. I never set out to reach 500 days. I was
just having fun and it went by. If your meditation is fascinating to
you, it’s really easy. Otherwise, it probably won’t last very long. And
even the most fascinating experiences eventually give way to other
passions and endeavors. So don’t be disappointed if that happens. There
are so many benefits of accessing your higher self and spirit guides.
You show up more powerfully in your life. You have a deeper
understanding of yourself in your life. More presence and depth of
character. Your relationships get deeper too. More compassion for those
around you. And you see beyond their pain and their masks. You’re more
sensitive to other people’s needs. You’ll also notice easier transitions
in life and not fighting with the flow. You’re getting advanced news
when you need it. And there’s less stress from unexpected or
misunderstood things. And you’ll have creative ideas with surprising
results. You’ll find solutions you couldn’t even imagine on your own.
Higher awareness also gives this amazing warm feeling of always being
loved and supported. I love this, especially in our times. We’re never
truly alone. You’ll also find a deep sense of joy and amusement, which
comes from peeking behind the scenes, knowing there’s something bigger
happening, and that you’re a part of it. Trusting that it’s all
unfolding beautifully. And one surprise benefit is that you stop feeling
guilty. When you see things from a higher perspective, there’s no need
for guilt. You’ve done the best that you can in each moment, and that
was the point: to shine and learn and grow. Not to be perfect. So, I
have a few final practice tips. I recommend connecting with your higher
self and spirit guides in the morning. And you can use my 10, 30, or
60-minute practice meditations to get started, and then just continue on
your own. And as you get guidance, even if you’re not sure, I recommend
trusting it and following it. The best way to know if it’s valid is to
follow it. Otherwise, you just won’t know. You can also play with higher
mind awareness during the day. Try to be in your higher mind, feeling
love and light coming from your higher self as you do your normal daily
activities. This is really fun. And try asking your guides questions
during your normal day too. Higher awareness isn’t just for meditation.
That’s just to get you started. The real goal is to be always connected
and being the brightest you. As always, be gentle with your expectations
and self-evaluation. Sometimes, it may feel like you’ve failed. Like
your guidance steered you into a difficult situation. Whenever that
happens, I always realize later why the situation was perfect for me.
Maybe a key experience that I was resisting and wouldn’t have found on
my own. All these tips really boil down to one thing: let your higher
guidance be fun and easy. You might be thinking, sure Jeffrey, it’s easy
for you. But remember, I started right where you are. I remember when I
wanted to talk to my guides so bad, but thought I couldn’t do it. And I
remember when it came kind of fleetingly and randomly. And I spent a lot
of time clearing pictures and practicing with my energy tools and
intuition. And I got better. I could hear, but I wasn’t always certain.
And then I decided to try talking to my guides every morning, and as the
days and weeks passed, it got way better. Practice develops skill and
certainty. Don’t worry, you can learn much faster than me. It doesn’t
have to take 500 days. Surprisingly, many students can do it in just the
first try. If you’re struggling, give yourself six months before you
give up. See what your results are then. A few things to watch out for
when you’re talking with your guides are pushy or negative messages. If
you’re hearing, you have to do this, or you’re such an idiot, or it
doesn’t matter, you’ll fail anyway, these messages are not coming from
your guides. That’s likely your pain talking. So just run your energy,
clear your chakras and change the channel. Also watch out for giving up
your Seniority. Your guides are there to help you, but not to make
decisions for you. If you want them to run your life, they’ll likely
talk less and less to you. A student once told me, “I’m giving up my
free will. I’ll just follow God’s instructions.” And I said, “What if
God wants you to decide for yourself?” Also be careful not to lose your
balance between the physical and energy worlds. Don’t worry about being
over-spiritual or over-physical. Work on both sides of you. Being strong
in each area is great. This will create the most fulfilling and powerful
life for you. And keep in mind that listening to guides isn’t always
rosy and beautiful. You might not always agree with them or like what
they say. Your guides are kind and always have your best interests in
mind, but they’re honest too. And sometimes it’s hard to hear the truth.
Guides have a higher perspective, helping you understand, not manipulate
the world. So if you’re thinking, do me some favors, or I want to win
the lottery, or does that girl or boy like me? Your guides probably
won’t be as helpful here because it’s not very important in the big
picture. Now, if you ask to understand and change your patterns around
wealth and relationships, that’s more like it. They’ll be able to help
there. Sometimes your guides may tell you things you don’t want to hear.
They might suggest it’s time to end a relationship or recommend
something that you have a lot of resistance to. I remember in 2005, my
guides told me it’s time to put your house on the market. And I had just
finished renovating and it looked great, and I didn’t want to sell it.
And I didn’t understand where I was going to live. So I resisted like
crazy. But eventually, I followed, and I listed it kind of high, just
kind of hoping it wouldn’t sell. But it did, and the timing was actually
perfect. Both for my surprise move to Sedona that I didn’t know was
coming, and that I sold my house right before the US housing market
collapsed, which was great. If you hear something you resist, instead of
dismissing it or thinking you can’t tune in well, just try clearing your
resistance, finding your neutrality, and then consider their advice. And
check your guide’s track record and your own. When in doubt, it’s often
wise to follow their advice. And honestly, most of the time I love the
guidance I hear. It’s creative and inspiring and insightful and
surprising and loving. What could be better? If you want to practice
higher awareness with a friend, either in person or online, just try
tuning into your higher self and imagine your friend as their higher
self. And just look into their eyes and smile and project your higher
self. It might feel a little awkward or funny, but that’s okay. Just try
it. And say hello from your crown chakra to their higher self. Just
visualize a connecting chakra loop between your crowns. And try having a
higher self conversation. You don’t really need many words. It could
just be energy and feelings. This is a really fun practice. It makes you
feel really close together. Remember to always keep the door open to
higher awareness and remember your higher self connection. You’re always
connected, but you can consciously open that connection even further.
Remember your spirit guide connection. The more you practice connecting,
the more real they will become for you. But even if you never see them
or hear them, taking the time to form clear conscious requests will make
it easier for them to assist you. The trick is to look at the results in
your life six months later. So are things going better overall than
before? This is the best way to measure your efforts. Also remember to
integrate your higher awareness into your normal life. It doesn’t need
to be separate or only during meditation. When you need insight or help,
just ask. You’ll be surprised by how easy this can be. And remember to
experiment and practice. Your relationship with your higher self and
spirit guides is unique to you. I can’t tell you how it’ll be for you,
but the more you explore, the deeper this relationship will become. Just
like your relationships with people, it develops over time. Most
importantly, please remember, you matter. You make a difference in the
world. You are changing the world every day by choosing the negative or
positive feedback loop. As you choose more positive energy, it spreads
to your family and friends and coworkers and to the world. This is how
we’re changing the world. Remember your first day of Duality, that
famous quote from Gandhi: “You must be the change you wish to see in the
world.” This is still true. It’s not the energy tools which change you.
You change you. It’s your choice. Energy tools just make it more fun.
Let’s close the circle with one more group connection. Go ahead and
close your eyes one more time. Ground and run your energy. And create a
permission rose for today. From your crown chakra, say hello to the
group. Present time, as students, and future too. And see everyone
smiling back at you. And say hello to all the people that you can help
in the world. And say hello to that group of spirits and guides. Create
a big bubble of energy in the middle of the circle. And put in all the
learning and information and aha moments. All your curiosity and
motivation and support. All your gratitude and love for each other. And
your intentions for your next steps. Add in a big dose of celebration
for making it through. And create a big gold sun above your head and
fill it with a perfect mixture of energy from that group bubble. Add in
all the energy and motivation and love you need to continue your journey
forward. Open that gold sun and fill yourself completely, from head to
toe, out into your aura and into your cells. As you fill in, feel your
guides forming a circle around you, holding your hands and taking you
forward. Know that you are truly not alone. And admire that beautiful
group bubble again. And let’s send it out to the world as an invitation
for others to join in. For the whole world to move into the positive
feedback loop. Now, all together, let’s pop that beautiful bubble of
energy and release it into the world. One, two, three, pow. See the
amazing impact we’re making individually and as a group. As that energy
spreads around the world, I’ll close with one final intention. May each
of us continue to grow and expand, individually and together, in joy and
in amusement, and in alignment with our higher selves, and with the
loving support of our higher self and guidance. It’s with great
pleasure, now, that I graduate each of you from the Duality energy
training. Give yourself a deep breath and open your eyes. Thank you so
much, everyone. It’s been my great pleasure to be your guide. Keep
practicing and spreading your light. And I look forward to seeing you
again. Enjoy!

LESSON 49 - MEDITATION: Duality bonus meditation: clearing energy blocks

- Close your eyes. Be very focused and present. And call back all your energy and attention from other times, places, people, or events. Call back all this energy to you right now in present time behind your eyes. Notice your body being very grounded to the earth. Feel that tree trunk extending down from the base of your spine into the earth. Helping you be more present in your body. And feel yourself becoming really clear in your mind. And move your awareness up a little bit and back a little bit to the place of observation called the higher mind. You'll know you're there when your thoughts are moving by. You're not thinking them, they're just floating by. And take a moment to watch your thoughts from the day. Any distractions, any worries, any stress, and just see it floating by and floating away. Ask yourself, "What is the one energy block that's most important for you to clear today?" And let that answer come to you, even if it's a surprise. What's the most important thing for you to clear today? Now, with this idea in mind, feel your body. And notice where is this energy block stored in your body. Might be in a chakra, your arm, or your leg. Somewhere in your head. Where is that energy block in your body right now? And notice what color is this block? Any color is okay. Trust your guidance. And notice any other details. Is there a texture? Is it hard or soft? Does it feel tight or is there pressure? Really feel what does this energy block feel like in your body? And notice if this energy has an emotion, could be sad, or angry, or scared. And if this energy block had a voice, what would it tell you right now? What message is this energy block telling you all the time? Breathe. Imagine a rose out in front of you, right in front of that energy block. A big, bright rose. And you're going to move that rose into your body right now, and start to clear that energy block like you're gathering it up, dusting out that part of the body, and just cleaning out that block. And feel that energy moving. Feel your body releasing, and letting go of that block. Now, put that rose outside your body about a meter or yard in front of you, and notice if there's any other places in your body, where there's a similar energy to that block. You don't have to know the details. Just give it permission to release right now out of your body, out of your space, out of your energy, and into that rose. And feel all that energy moving, releasing from you. Now, take that rose and you're going to send it off to the edge of the universe. Pop that rose, let it disappear, and release all that energy as it flies away, knowing that none of that energy is coming back to you. Now, between your hands, start to build up a ball of energy. Feel that creative energy opening in the top of your head, drying in positive, creative life force and healing energy to do the top of your head, down the back of your neck, down each arm and out the hands. And as you put those hands toward each other, just feel that ball of energy building between the palms, so you've got a nice, bright ball of energy. Might feel a little tingling, or pressure, or heat. And let it be very easy until you've got a beautiful ball of energy right between your hands. And now, remember that place where you released the energy block, and you're going to take this ball of energy, and just press it right into that part of the body. See it moving in and filling up that whole area, where you release that energy. And give your body permission to absorb this energy and totally fill up. And feel it moving all the way down into the cells. And spreading out till it's all through your physical body, filling you up completely. Now, imagine in front of you a movie screen where you can see your future path. And now, that this energy block is cleared, what path is available to you right now? See that starting to appear? Let yourself understand how this path is different from before. And it's okay if your mind is creating this path or if your intuition's picking it up, just let that path appear and trust whatever comes to you. Now, move a few steps down that path. Imagine you're walking into that future. What does it feel like? Does it feel good and empowering? Maybe a little stressful? Anything is okay? Feel what would it really be like to live this future for you. Now, let that future go. You're going to rewind back to the beginning. And ask for a second path. What's another potential future that's open to you now that you've cleared that energy block? See that second future opening up and that movie screen in front of you. And just let yourself walk down this path. Just trying it out, seeing how does this potential future feel to you? Is it bright? Is it easy? Is it full of abundance? How does it feel to you? Sometimes, the future we imagine we want is a little different. When we walk down that path, sometimes, it doesn't feel as good as we thought. Or sometimes, we notice that it's just right. Take a few more steps down that path. Good, now, rewind again. Come back to the start. And let a third possibility open up, a third path for you that's available now that you've cleared your blocks. Feel and understand and know the energy of this third path, and take a few steps down that possible future feeling what is this third path like for you? Really let yourself be there. Good, now, rewind again. And see all three paths in front of you. Let your intuition show you which of these three paths is the perfect path for you right now. You might walk down more than one of them in the future, but which is the next one right in front of you right now. And even if it's not what you expect, trust your guidance that this is the right path for now. And create another big ball of energy between your hands. And as you build that ball of energy between your hands, just imagine a big yes energy going into that ball of energy. This is your yes vote to the universe that you're choosing this path right now. Good, now, send that ball of energy down that path, lighting up that future path. And making it very real, attracting all the people, all the situations. All the resources, and finances, and health, and everything you need for that path to become your real future. Send that yes down that path, lighting up all the synchronicity, bringing everything to you in perfect timing and ease. And be present again right behind your eyes. Just let those future paths go, knowing that you've done all you need to do for today. You've identified your best block to heal today. You've moved the energy out. You've filled it in with positive new energy, and you've explored three potential futures that are open to you now that you healed that energy, and you chose which one was right for you right now, and sent light down that path. And all that is going to come back to you in perfect timing. So just let it all go, and be very present behind your eyes. Relaxed, grounded, present in your body. Take a deep breath, and open your eyes.
