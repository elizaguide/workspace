Preparation – Welcome to the Quest
--------------------
<v ->Welcome to your Quest.</v> I'm so grateful you're here. This is going to be an amazing journey. If you hearing my voice right now, then your higher self has been calling you. There's a potential within you that has not yet fully lived, and that's about to come out. Together, we're going to uncover what you need in order to live your fullest potential. We're going to learn how to master your energy so that you have always more than enough energy available at all times. Before we do that, I'd like to introduce myself. My name is Ariya Lorenz, and I'm honored to be your teacher in this Quest. I've been known as a master healer, and I guide people to their higher selves. How I came to that is I've always been guided by angels. I've always been seeing energies and being able to feel energy. But when I was in my teens, I literally neglected that gift, and I thought, "You know what? What if I'm only making this up? And maybe there's nothing there other than what we see?" And I actually started a whole journey into deep depression and into complete darkness. And it led to me being so depressed that I couldn't even get up anymore. I was laying on the floor, and I couldn't get up. I went through a whole story of deaths. My dear grandfather died when I was 12, and then I had two good friends die. And then when I was 18, my boyfriend died in a car accident. And this was about the low level of my life. I was going to go with him. I was at that, you know, there's nothing there that's actually worth living for. But what happened then is I started to explore energy again, and I started to explore what does energy actually do for us? And I saw my energy level, and I saw the energy level of others, and I compared it. And I thought, what if I had gotten myself to that place? What if I had used the tools that are available to us as humans in a way that they actually go against me rather than they work for me? And I just decided I'm going to give it a try. I'm not going to say this is correct, and I'm not going to say this is correct. So I'm not going to say negativity is correct, and that life is really just not worth living. And I'm not going to say life is super; life is awesome. I'm just going to give it a try and see what happens when I apply the energy tools that I came to learn from this moment on and see what happens. And so I started using energy to actually recharge myself so I could get up from the floor. And it worked like a wonder. It worked completely immediately. And then I started working with manifestation, bringing things into my life- because I'd lost my friends; I'd lost my opportunities. But now I'm calling them in. I'm calling in new friends, new opportunities, money, work, more health. And I used the manifestation tools, and it completely worked. Called in my beloved. It was amazing. And then I thought, "Okay, now I have more than enough energy available. There's no problem with depression or anything. I have a way to fulfill my wishes. What do I do with that?" And this emptiness came back. And so I went up in meditation and asked my guides, you know, "How can I mitigate this? How can I make meaning in this life or find meaning in this life?" And that's when I was guided to my higher self. It's a longer story, but just quickly for you here, what happened when I discovered my higher self, I found the peace and the feeling that I'd always been missing. I found that feeling of connection, that feeling of joy, that feeling of bliss and deep fulfillment that I'd always been looking for that's been missing all along. It was already there. All of a sudden I had access to it. And from there I could start asking my higher self, you know, "What's my next step? What is my purpose in life? How do I go about the purpose?" And so I went into this whole expression of this life as the being that I was meant to be. And this is where true self fulfillment lies. Now, I want that for you. This whole journey started me off as a healer because I started using this energy to heal others. I wanted now others to actually experience the same and get out of their misery, right? And when you are a healer, you're actually channeling energy through you. It's not you who's doing the work. So the work is being done through me. Yeah? And in my 20 years of experience, I found that when people come for healing, even when one thing is healed, they develop another issue until the root cause is solved. So I realized I'm actually not really helping people when I heal them. The three most common problems that are actually at the root of any problem that needs healing is first, they don't have enough energy. Number two, they don't know how to manifest what they want. And number three, they don't have the guidance to find and fulfill their purpose. So basically what I went through in my journey, in my story that I shared with you right now, briefly, I found that literally every problem that people have leads to either one of these three not working or all three not working. Once all these problems are solved, that's when everything comes to them. That's when their health, their wealth, their relationships are solved or come to them in the best way. That's where their joy comes back. I experienced that for myself. Everything comes to them, and that's where that true soul level fulfillment lies. Now, maybe you are missing some areas there. Maybe your health isn't perfect. Maybe you're looking for that relationship upgrade or for your soulmate; maybe your career needs an upgrade. Maybe you are also wondering, you know, "I'm doing a lot of things. How do they all fit together? What's really my purpose? And how can I live my purpose?" If any area in your life isn't working, this will help. If you want more than just an area fixed, if you want to get to that soul level fulfillment where everything is working for yourself, this Quest is for you. It'll lead you to that soul level fulfillment. Okay, let's talk more about this Quest. This Quest is divided in three parts. In the first part, we'll teach you how to master your energy. You learn how to protect your energy so that you have more than enough energy available, which means not only you are charged all the time in a good way, but you're also protected against energy robbers and other problems that could cause you to lose energy. Yeah? In the second part, we're going to get your wishes fulfilled. I'm going to guide you through manifestation steps in a way that you may not have heard before. We're going to bust some myths that have been slowing you down in your manifestation, that literally slowed down the delivery of your wishes. And I'm going to tell you about the three most important things you need to know about manifestation for it to work for you. Yeah, I'm excited about that. In the third part, you'll get to your higher self. You will meet your higher self. This will be the most important introduction you could ever have. I'll help you understand how to access your higher self consciously, instead of letting it just talk to you by your intuition or in your sleep. That's an unconscious way of accessing the higher self. We'll get you consciously to your higher self, and we're going to get you into that refined state of being guided by your higher self at all times. You will come to know your purpose and the exact steps of how to fulfill it. Now, how do you prepare for this Quest? Well, first, I want you to let go of any preconceived thoughts you may have about manifesting, about energy, and about your higher self. Come with an open mind. Prepare to receive a connection with your own soul and your higher self. Just be open to that, and allow all possibilities in. So don't restrict yourself. Just be open to the possibilities. Okay? Next, set an intention about the person you will be at the end of this Quest. Sit down and think about it. Visualize who you're going to be at the end of this Quest, and write it down. How would you like to wake up every morning feeling full of life, full of energy? Wouldn't that be wonderful? How would you like to feel this incredible solid connection to yourself? Then I want you to get a journal to write down your thoughts and reflections throughout the Quest as well, so that you are present with what's happening for you. And set aside some time each day which is dedicated to this Quest. You will receive a video lesson as well as some energy work, which consists of tools and meditations designed to open you up to a stronger connection with your higher self. We will get you from here to higher, to higher, to all the way up, and we'll raise your vibration throughout, and each tool that you'll get will actually raise your vibration and will lead to more happiness along the way, more ease, more positive feelings. That's the fun part about this Quest. So everything you do will lead to more happiness, okay? So you get instant rewards at every step. Finally, I'd like to invite you to join the Tribe and introduce yourself to the Mindvalley community. The work we're going to be doing here is an intensely personal thing, but you will benefit from having a community of travelers who will support you in your journey and hold you accountable to your goals. It's good to have like-minded people on your team. So introduce yourself there. Okay? Are you ready? I can't wait to see you in the Quest.

Part 1: The Energy Connection: Transforming Life with Power, Protection, and Positivity

====================

LESSON 1 – Harness the Invisible Power of Electricity and Magnetism for Life Transformation
--------------------
<v ->Welcome to your Quest.</v> This is the first module here, and we're going to master your energy and the energy around you so that you can use it in your favor at any time you need it. Yeah, I'm really grateful that you're here and that you made it because a lot of people on this planet need more energy, and they don't know how to get it. This is not you, not here, not now. Okay. In this Quest, I'm going to show you how to recharge your energy at will, how to protect your energy from outer influences, and also how to create an energy overflow that feeds the world around you. Yeah/ I'm so excited to do this with you because we're going to do something that's totally amazing. By understanding and using and getting those results from these principles, you'll create a basis for you to thrive instead of survive. And let me tell you, there are so many people out there that are just working on surviving. I literally asked a really good friend of mine, few years ago, what he wanted out of life. And you know what he told me? He said, "I'm just surviving. You know, I can't think of what I want. I'm just surviving." And not everybody's that intense or that deep in survival, in the survival mode than he was, but some of it may apply to you. You know, in some areas you may think that you know right now you don't have time to actually think about what you want. You don't have time to put your attention in the right direction, and you may be caught in a survival mechanism. And once you are caught in that survival mechanism, what shuts off is the thriving. It literally shuts off. But right here, right now, this is going to change, and it's going to change forever. This is not something you're just going to do for four weeks, and then you know, you let it go. I hope you implement what I'm going to share with you, because if you do, I guarantee you, and I know this from experience, I've worked with 10 thousands of people on this, and everybody who tells me that they're having lasting results, and that their life actually completely changed, are the people that actually implemented the tools. So everyone who implemented the tools gets the results. And if you do that, I can guarantee you you'll get the results. And once you are thriving, you will be able to give from that overflow. Now, think of a child. You know, I was just at the airport; I just came here, flew at the airport, and I'm telling you, I was sitting in first class, and I'm thinking I'm going to have the best nap ever. I'm just going to relax. Right? And there were three children in first class, and they were yelling; they were screaming; they were jumping on the chairs. And you know, there was just so much energy that nobody could really relax. But what the children actually had going on was they had so much overflow of energy that they didn't know what to do with that energy. And while they were confined to a seat, that didn't work, right? So they started screaming. Now look at the children. Look at anybody who is walking, you know, with little kids. Have you ever seen a little child have not enough energy? Yeah, maybe when they're sleeping, right? You can actually be that way too. My friends, they say to me, "How come you always have so much energy? I never see you tired." And I can tell you it's actually true. I never run out of energy. I always have enough energy available, and it doesn't come from sleep or food. I can tell you this, and I'm going to go into that later. Yeah? But what I'm getting into right now is I am seeing you in my mind's eye, completely thriving. I'm seeing you getting up in the morning and actually having a full-on overflow of energy already. You are as excited as you were as a child for this new day to come. Then you go through your day; you do good work; you know things are happening for you. Any obstacles are moved out of the way- we'll get later into that. And you actually just soar through the day as if, you know, the ocean parts for Moses, as if you were Moses. And you are literally coming to the end of your day where you come home to either your own home for, with yourself or with your children or with your partner. And what you do is you have fun with them. You have time for love; you have energy for love. You have time and energy for joy and for enjoyment. I see you as that. I see you literally thriving. And how do we do this? Well, let's start at the beginning. It's going to be fun. First of all, I want you to understand what energy is. Yeah? So one form of energy that you're probably using right now as you're watching me here on the computer or on your phone, is electricity. Electricity is a form of energy that is invisible. Would you agree on that one with me? If you don't agree, email my assistant. I want to hear about that. Because really, we know electricity is invisible, but we see the results of electricity every day, right? So there'll be nobody here on this planet that denies that electricity exists, right? Yeah? So there you go. And we are moving into an age where nobody will deny that we are made of electricity as well. And you're one of the people that are getting to work with that right now with me. Yeah? Because we are actually made of energy. Our body-and I'm going to speak about electricity now with you- our body is made of electricity. That's one form of energy, and it's made of another form of energy, and that is magnetism. So we are made of an electromagnetic field, or we have an electromagnetic field, I should say. Yeah? And this electromagnetic field has what I just said, two parts to it. We have a magnetic part and an electric part, and they work together. And later I'll talk more about the individual parts. But right now, what we are actually embarking on, you and me, is we are amplifying that electromagnetic field for you. Once this electromagnetic field is amplified, you will have more than enough energy available. Yes. Now, what is really happening in the body? How can we actually influence the amount of power, force, awakeness, joy, health we have with energy? It is because power, force, health, joy, all these aspects of us are energies as well. And we are made out of energy. And because we are made out of that energy, if we have an influence on that energy, we have an influence on our experience. And I can give you a super- cool example about that. I thought that was so interesting when I read about that. And it is, you know how the body consists of cells, right? And then when you go and look at a microscope, at a cell with a microscope, you're actually seeing all these little molecules, and then you go finer with the microscope, and you see atoms, right? But what happens when you go finer again, you see little particles within those atoms. The thing that's interesting about that is not so much the particles; it's actually the space between the particles. Now, anytime you see something under a microscope, you always see matter swimming in a pool of either water or energy. Yeah? So if you look at the molecule, the way the particles are held together in the molecules is a sea of energy. It's with energy. And when you look at the atom, the atom inside has little particles and energy around it. And if you go into the little particles again, which they did actually, now, they were able to do that, look that fine into a subatom. Then they saw again, matter and space. And that space, that energy that's between the matter, is called energy. But the interesting thing about that is they have not found just matter. Maybe there isn't any matter. Maybe everything is plain energy. If you know that you are made of energy, then you can make use of that, right? You can start to understand how to direct energy, and therefore you can fill yourself up with energy and even eventually fill up your environment. So how do we find this energy, and how do we work with this energy, you may ask. Yeah? Normally we think we can only gain energy from sleep or eating. Yeah? That's what I've been taught as a child. You've probably been taught that: you need to sleep so you have more energy, and you need to eat so you have more energy. Well, I thought that too. But then here comes a weekend in 2002 where I went on to a seminar with a lady called Jasmuheen from Australia-has become one of my favorite spiritual teachers since then. And she tells us that she hasn't eaten nor drunk anything since 26 years. I mean, she drank sips of water, but that's all; 26 years. And the lady stands in front of me, beautiful, her voice clear, her appearance, healthy, strong. And I'm like, "What are you doing?" She looked at me and she said, "Let me invite you for lunch." Uh huh, okay. She, she eats. She eats. So she invites me for lunch, and I go there with some other people, and she sits down and asks us all to close our eyes. We close our eyes, and the most beautiful music starts playing. And we end up listening to a whole hour of different versions of Ave Maria. It was magnificent. And once this was over, she said, "Now you know how I eat." So what I learned from that is that we can draw energy from certain things. We can draw energy out of our environment, and we can feed our body and our aura with aspects that are not food. Okay? I didn't embark on, "Okay, I'm never going to eat, and I'm going to learn her method of not eating." But what I did do is I learned how she draws energy into her body. What she did there- and this just on the side-what she did there, she fed her emotional body. Because what's really hungry most of the time, and you I'm sure can attest to that; you're not always eating when you're hungry, when your body's hungry, right? Yeah? What's usually hungry is the emotional body, which is just 30 centimeters, one foot outside of our ener-of our physical body. Yeah? That's what's hungry. That's what wants to be fed. And the emotional body obviously cannot be fed with food anyway; can be fed with love. And how she did it is with that amazing music. Yeah? Which I still use to this day. I love that. But I'm also eating, and I'm assuming you'll be enjoying eating as well. So this is not about not eating, but it's about knowing how to draw energy from the environment so you don't have to eat, and you don't need to lose energy when you're eating. So this is this interesting part about it. When we eat, it actually takes energy for our body to digest the food and turn it into energy. So while we are gaining energy from eating, we're also needing energy. So it's not supereffective, you know? So what we did instead, we learned how to actually draw the energy from the environment. And these energy particles are called neutrinos. And I'm going to show you a very simple, supereasy way of how to draw neutrinos into your body later on today. Okay? And how you know that something is really directed from the divine is when it's simple. Any tool that we get to use when they're really divinely orchestrated, and they're really perfect, they got to be simple. Anything complicated is human made. Yeah? So it's going to be a very simple tool that I'm going to share with you. Yeah? But before we do that, I'd like for you to understand why this tool works and how this tool works. Are you interested? Are you with me? Okay, let's go. It's easy to imagine that if you had more energy, that you would probably do a better job at work, right? It's easy to imagine that if you had more energy, you'd probably be better at your relationships, and you would probably be better at taking care of yourself. Everything improves when you have more energy. Energy is like money. It amplifies everything you do. Yeah? If you have a lot of money, it amplifies your life. It helps you to be free and express yourself. If you have more energy, it amplifies your life. It helps you to be free and live the life you want. You need them both in this day and age. We need enough energy to be able to function, right? We need an overflow of energy to thrive. Yeah? And so how do you direct energy? That's the next thing we need to understand. Because you know you have energy, but how do you use it? That becomes of importance if you going to use it for yourself, right? So let's go into that. How do you direct energy? There's two aspects that are important. We need our intention, and we need our attention or our focus. Those are the two things you need. That's it. Intention and attention. Yeah? Where your attention goes, your energy flows. You can remember that sentence. It's really essential that you know that where your attention goes, your energy flows. So think of what you want right now. You know, you could be wanting a coffee; you could be wanting a new soulmate; you could be wanting a house. It could be small or big. Just think of something you want. Okay? Now I'm going to ask you, "Did you think of what you want? Or did you think of what you don't want?" I can tell you, you wouldn't even believe how many people I ask this question, and they tell me what they don't want. And then I tell them, "Okay, please tell me what you want, not what you don't want." And they go again into what they don't want. I have a lot of clients that actually happens right at the beginning on our first talk. And sometimes I need to remind them three times. At times, I need to actually stop them; I need to say, "Stop right here." Because while they're with me, we're already in an energy field that amplifies their experience. So I don't want the negative to get created. But here's the deal. Most people know exactly what they don't want, and they think about it the whole time. Everything that happens around them, they'll have it readily available. You know, "This, I don't want; this, I don't want; this, I don't want," you know, and they're thinking that they're actually creating what they want. That's not the case because, I'm going to say it again, where your attention goes, the energy flows. So if you're placing your attention on what you don't want, then the energy flows to what you don't want. And the energy flow always brings that very thing back to you by the law of attraction. So from now on, I want to encourage you: think of what you want and not of what you don't want. Yeah? Always remember that where your attention goes, the energy flows, and where the energy flows, it creates an energy current back to you. So we are going into a circular motion, right? If you have mastered this principle, things are going to change. So how can we make use of this energy? So now we understand attention and focus. We understand that we need to place our attention into something positive, because I can tell you right now, "Don't think of a giraffe with yellow dots." How is that working for you? I tell you, "Think of a giraffe with yellow dots." Is that working? Either way, you're going to see the giraffe with yellow dots. Because what you don't want has as much energy as what you want. Because really you're thinking of it. Whether you think of it in a positive way or in a negative way doesn't make a difference for the fact that you are placing your attention on that thing. Okay? And that's what creates that circular motion back to you. And that brings energy to you. I hope I made that clear. So now we can make use of that energy. And how do we make use of that energy? Well, I told you we're going to recharge our energy, right? We understand that our attention creates an energy flow. We understand that our focus will literally bring that energy flow back to us, right? And now we're going to add one other aspect in that where we're going to, that we're going to use in order to recharge your energy, okay? And we can make use of that by simply recharging at a place in nature that has really good energy. And as we focus on that place, our energy goes to that place. And then that place gives us energy back because we ask for it. And there's one magic key to getting something out of an energy field. I just mentioned it; I don't know if you heard it. This is where the difference lies between getting what you want or not getting what you want. Okay? And that key is you have to ask. It's exactly the same in our lives, right? So let's say, I'm going to hang up a picture here, and you know, I just want to hammer a nail in, and I find out I don't have a hammer. Yeah? So I go and find somebody that I think has a hammer, and I'll ask them, "Can I have your hammer?" He gives me the hammer. I hammer the thing in. So that's it. If I didn't ask the person, you think somebody would magically knock at my door just while I am hanging up my picture to give me a hammer? That's not happening, right? Why do I get the hammer? Because I had an intention to get the hammer. I put my focus on how to get it, and then I asked for it. Okay? Simple. Now, it's also important to know who to ask. It's the same with our energy. Yeah? So for example, you would probably not go to the neighbor's 2-year-old kid and ask him for a hammer, would you? So you think, okay, who could have a hammer? And then you go to that person. The same is with our energy. When we recharge our energy in nature, we're going to go to a place that has more than enough energy, and we will ask for the energy overflow from that energy field. And we make sure this is an energy field that's rich in energy. Yeah? And here, I'm going to give you some examples. So I'm going to lead you with your imagination to that place right now. But better yet is it to actually go physically to a place like that. Both work though. Because again, where your attention goes, the energy flows. And if you are standing at an ocean, and you place attention on the ocean, that's almost as good as if you're imagining an ocean, and you place an attention on the ocean. Okay? So we're going to go to an energy field in our imagination right now, and then hopefully you'll practice it in nature as well. And we'll make sure that this field is really rich in energy. Yeah? And it could be anything that exudes healthy, powerful energy. Could be a healthy tree, could be a lake, an ocean, a mountain, a power place. For example, Machu Picchu. Yeah? And as I'm guiding you to that place in your imagination, you are going to employ everything that I said here. Yeah? And then let's see what happens for you. You're going to employ your attention, your focus, your asking, and then that energy will flow to you and through you, and it'll actually recharge you. You'll be surprised.

====================

LESSON 1 – Recharge exercise

- So I'm going to invite you to just become quiet for a moment. Take a deep breath, and arrive at the here and now. Beautiful. Visualize yourself, or you can do this also physically, standing at a tree. This is going to be a powerful, strong, straight tree, not crooked, not curved, but actually straight and strong. And you hold your hands out on the tree, connect with the tree for a moment, and then ask the tree for its overflow on energy. We can do it together. "Dear tree, please give me from your overflow of energy," and then start receiving. Allow that energy to flow into your hands, even into your whole chakra column. You're just absorbing the energy that's streaming into you from the tree right now. Breathe it in with every breath in, and with your exhalation, breathe out used up energy. This way you make more room for more and more energy, fresh energy to flow into you. Beautiful. And when you do this more often, there may be a moment when you feel you're full. So you go until you feel you're full, or you just go for a certain amount of time, and then you thank the tree. "Thank you tree." And I like to leave a little bit of something on the tree. It could be a hair, a little bit of spit, just as something from myself. I leave that at the tree, and I go about my day. How do you feel? Do you feel a little bit more energized? If you practice this more and more, you'll get more and more energized. In fact, the question may be how often do you recharge, and when do you do the recharge? And here's where this awesome thing comes in that is called habit stacking. So what I want to recommend for you is you do it throughout your day. Because I'm going to have a practice for you at the end of this Quest that you're going to do in the morning and in the evening. So this particular practice of recharging is going to be happening throughout your day. Yes? And we're going to habit stack this. Yeah. It takes about two to five minutes as you, as you've noticed. Yeah. And these two to five minutes, I recommend plugging them into an activity that you're already doing throughout your day. So if you actually have a tree outside your house or an ocean or a mountain, then you may want to go outside and literally recharge on that actual tree, mountain, or ocean. Yeah. And if you don't have that, then you close your eyes, and you can do it anytime and anywhere. And you visualize yourself at that place. Yeah. One is easier; one is maybe a little bit more strong. So do them both if you can. And you can, for example, plug it in when you drink your morning tea or your morning coffee. So you could be sitting, drinking your tea, and then you close your eyes, and that's when you do the recharge. And then you continue your tea or coffee. You know, if you did that every morning, I can tell you it's not going to take long- it may even take only three to five times- and then that's a habit. And you'll actually not forget about it anymore. You'll do it every time. Yeah. You could also do it when you get in the car, just before you drive away. You know, you get in the car; you center really quick; you do your recharge. Now you do it every time you get in the car. Yeah. That's a powerful thing to do. Every time you sit in the car, you take two minutes, and you literally recharge. I do that. And my people that are driving with me, they're used to that. They already know she's going to go into the car; she's going to do that, which centers, and then she's going to, you know, recharge. I am driving better; I'm more focused. And you know, since I'm going into the car and out of the car relatively often, especially if I go shopping, I recharge often. You will not lose any time with that. The time you spend for this is going to be negligible, but the results you get from that are huge. Are really huge. So people ask me, "Do I also need to recharge when I have enough energy?" Well, this is actually what happens often when people start with, you know, using these tools. Yeah. We have a membership, and people in my membership, they start using the tools. And they end up feeling so recharged- they're feeling top fit-that they let go of the recharge. And they come to me, and they say, "Do I need a recharge when I feel top fit?" Well, what I say to them is, "Yes, you do need a recharge when you're top fit because you are actually creating an overflow of energy." This is like a bank account that you're adding energy to it. And when you need extra energy, you'll have stuff to draw from. Yeah. It's like brushing your teeth. You brush your teeth all the time. You don't know that you're growing cavities until the cavity's coming out and you see it. Right? So as you're brushing your teeth, that'll prevent the cavities from happening. Even though your teeth feel clean, you still brush your teeth so you don't get cavities. The same is with your energy. We get used to a certain energy level, and we think we're full. In fact, I can tell you that most of my clients, I measure their energy when they come to me. And I do this since 20 years. I have a thousand clients a year. So I've had 20,000 clients at this point. And so every time I measure their energy when they come, very often do they say they're full when they're at 30% of energy-30, 30% of energy; that's when they feel full. That means they're using 30% for their day, and they're operating most of the time on zero or below zero. I was that way. I totally remember that. You know, I used to work on very, very little energy, was always exhausted, and I would still draw energy from myself to get things done. So that can change with that. But what you're doing when you're doing the recharge tool, even when you feel fit, is you're building up an overflow. Yeah. And you can draw from that. And you are also training your brain that 30% is not a hundred. You go to 60; you go to 70; you go to a hundred; you go to 150, and that's where you establish yourself. Yeah. So we create an overflow of energy. And so when you recharge every day, you will always have more energy available than you need- my promise. And this is something I want you to get used to: going to bed at night with more than enough energy, not exhausted, waking up in the morning with more than enough energy, fresh for the day. Yeah. And whenever you need some extra energy, you have an extra energy reservoir.

====================

LESSON 2 – Activate Your Protection Shield: Summoning Sensitivity for Spiritual Strength
--------------------
<v ->Welcome back to your Quest.</v> Amazing. We're here together again. In our previous lesson, you learned how to recharge your energy at will. How easy has it been to implement the tools into your life? I'd love to know that because this is the most important part of it. This is where the rubber meets the road. You know, often we say spirituality and working with energy is not practical. Well, there's only one reason why it could not be practical, and that is if we're not seeing results in our lives, right? And so I used to call my type of teaching "Practical Spirituality." That's how I started off in Germany. "Praktische Spiritualitat," which means practical spirituality. And why? Because I'm so adamant about bringing these things into our life so our life is enhanced; our money flows better; we have more abundance, you know; our relationships work better. We're more calm; we're more at peace. All of these qualities that we want are actually at our fingertips if we use energy. If we don't use energy, it's sometimes hard to achieve them. And the little thing that needs to happen in order for that tool actually have an impact in our lives is we need to implement the tools. And when you start using these tools properly, you'll notice an immediate shift in your energy level and general well-being. For example, I have clients who use it and who don't. Yeah? And some who use it on a regular basis-not some, actually everyone, I can tell you, a hundred percent- everyone who uses them in a regular basis, they all have fabulous results. They say, "My life is better." "I have more ease." "I get things done better." "I have more time because of that. I have more fun because of that; everything flows better." And people who used it in the beginning and ended up not using it or using it sporadically, they get a little bit better. And people who don't use it at all, they don't see a difference. Now, what do you want? Do you want to see a difference? And you may already have implemented them, and I want to congratulate you for that. That's what you get to do for yourself. That's called self-love. You know, Michael Beckwith, one of my favorite teachers, calls it "Blissipline" instead of Discipline. I love that. So this is our blissipline. Yeah? And we're starting with that today. And we're going to talk about how to protect your energy today. Once you know how to protect your energy, you'll find that you're not running out of energy as quickly. It is like fixing a hole in a tire. So the tire goes out; the air goes out all the time. You have to pump up air all the time, right? You know that feeling, right? You're trying to get more energy; you're trying to get something done; you're trying to be happy or healthy, and it's just not working. You find yourself depleted all the time. That's the whole entire syndrome. Yeah? And chances are, especially if you are using the recharging techniques, that what you're missing is a protection shield. Today we're going to talk about how to protect your energy and how to create an energy protection shield around you. And the protection shield actually not only makes sure that you don't lose energy, it also helps you not to draw in energy from the world that is not useful or actually harmful for you. Yeah? So the first thing you need to know about the protection shield is, of course, the same principles apply like we had for the energy recharge. First, remember: where your attention goes, the energy flows. You got this now, right? We got this down. And your intention is important because your intention directs the energy. Yes? So your intention is to protect your energy field right now in this lesson. And your attention is on drawing the energy for the protection, and that'll create the protection shield. Yeah? We'll do a little bit of action with that as well. The second principle we mentioned in the first lesson is that you need to ask, and we'll employ that principle as well. We will ask for that protection shield to stay permanent in your field. "And who we will ask?" you may ask; "Who am I going to ask about that?" We will ask the forces around you. Okay. And I can share with you that I ask the angels because I feel very, very connected to the angels, but I have a lot of clients that I work with that don't believe in angels or that feel a little bit, you know, repelled by that thought. And I want to not have anything here that could possibly stand in the way of you getting the results from this content. So if anything comes up here in the Quest that you find doesn't work for your beliefs, just discard it, and take what you like. Yeah? But I want to be honest with you also; I'm asking the angels around me, and they help me a lot. Yeah? Now, why do you need a protection shield? People say, "I'm always protected. I don't need a protection shield." I hear that often. You know, I had a boyfriend once, and he said, "I don't need to meditate. I'm always meditating. I'm meditating when I do the dishes." And I was wondering if he's maybe right. Maybe he may be more advanced than me, and I should not meditate either. And I literally stopped meditating for a while. That did not go well. Okay? Same thing with the protection shield. In an ideal scenario, in an ideal world, we would not need a protection shield because we would actually radiate out so much love and energy that we don't need a protection. We actually have our energy go out of our system, and therefore we're not drawing energy in. And I will show you how to do that next time. Yeah? So that's coming up. But either way, whether you do the protection shield or the I radiate, both work in this world because the ideal world does not quite exist. An ideal world would actually need us to have a hundred percent focus on being protected at all times. Because again, where your attention goes, the energy flows, right? So if you have a protection shield that's actually in place no matter what you're thinking, then you're protected at all times. But if you are using your energy field just to think you're protected, then you cannot think that you're not protected because that changes the flow in the other direction. Okay? And we do that all the time throughout, throughout our day. We're like, "Oh, this person, I don't like them. I don't want them to come close." Boom, protection shield gone. Or I say, "Oh my gosh, you know, they're affecting me." Or "They're, they're mean," or, or "I don't like how they look." Anytime you place your intention on something you don't like, it totally diminishes your radiating field. And it also undermines your protection shield. And this is why I like to have an actual metaphysical tool in place that goes over your own intention and attention. So the protection shield is not affected by your intention or attention throughout the day. It's actually a tool that we employ, and that's going to stay in place and keep you protected. How do you like that? I think it's very useful because we're human. We're not perfect, right? And so think about your life, and ask yourself, do you have as much energy available in the evening as you had in the morning? Lacking energy may be a sign that you need a protection shield. Do you sometimes feel affected by other people around you? Do certain environments draw energy from you, or do you get energy from other environments that are positive? All of those are signs that you're affected by the outer world instead of the outer world being positively affected by you. Yeah? So if you are affected negatively by the world, we want to transform that today. And what we want for is to affect the world around you positively. Yeah? And it's actually easy to do that. I want to tell you a story. I had a client come to me a few years ago with her son, and her son was 18 years old at the time, and he suffered from anxiety and depression. I hear that very often nowadays, that especially teenagers have anxiety and depression together. So he was anxious at night; he couldn't sleep, and he was depressed at day, and couldn't do anything. It's very difficult situation for him. Beautiful young boy, young man. And I really wanted to help. So what we started on with him was I showed him how to do a protection shield. And he learned it very quickly, which you will learn it very quickly too. And once he started to have a protection shield, his energy started to improve because he was actually a sensitive person, and he was more sensitive to energies around him than maybe some other people are. You know, I'm very sensitive to energy around me, and you may be, yeah? This is why you had the Quest. So the more sensitive you are, the more affected you get in a way. Maybe you only know that you're more affected than other people. That's probably more the truth. But either way, you need a protection shield so you can actually use your sensitivity in your favor instead of against you. And that's what we did with Andrew. He felt better, but it wasn't enough. So then I taught him how to recharge his energy, and all of a sudden the depression went away. The depression has to do with not having enough energy. He was leaking out in any direction all the time. Anxiety has to do with not being enough protected. Yeah? So these two things helped him tremendously. We later on went on and actually taught him how to heal. And he became a healer himself, and he's now a healer. And his life completely changed. He got off medication; everything changed. But we only did these two seemingly easy things for him, and he got into his real purpose in life. So this is what can happen when you employ these tools, you know? Now you may ask, "Can I use the protection shield for other people as well? And how often do I employ their protection shield?" Well, first question, yes, you can employ the protection shield for other people. And so once I show you how to do the protection shield, you're going to do it for yourself. And then just like the recharge that we did, remember: there's a possibility to imagine it as well as do it in person. That counts for the protection shield also. It counts for everything energy. You can do it at the real place or physically, like we're going to do the protection shield physically; I'll show you. And you can also imagine it because the mind doesn't understand the difference between an imagined event and a real event. So it creates the same circuitry, the same electromagnetic field in an imagined event as it does in a real event. So yes, we can imagine it, and I'm going to show you how to do that. And if you imagine it, you can use it for other people too, for your kids and for other people who give you permission. So you need to ask for permission when it comes to protection shield. But if it's your children, you don't have to, right? So I'll show you that. If it's your car, you don't have to; you can put a protection shield around your car, around your house, around your belongings. It's totally amazing. It works like a charm. Now remember, if you're not protected, if your energy isn't protected, you're actually not only losing energy, but you're also drawing energy that is harmful to you. Yeah? So being without a protection shield is like going out into the cold without good clothes. Yeah? And from now on, once you know how to use it, use it every day. It'll be really important for you to plug it into your daily habits. Yeah? Do that habit stacking with that. Because what happens when you have it stuck, your protection shield, is that you're going to not run out of energy because you recharge from the overflow, and you're not going to get affected by the outer environment. And you're going to keep that energy that you recharge. That's going to create a really powerful energy field with which we're going to work then in our next lesson, okay? We're going to do something with that. We're going to add to it. Also, what I want to let you know is at the end of this part of the Quest, we will give you a morning practice that'll help you implement every tool that comes in here in these lessons. So I'm basically taking the guesswork out for you, and you can just listen to me right now, and I'm going to totally create the habit for you. That counts for everything except for the recharging. The recharging you do on your own. And we already talked about that. Yeah? So you'll create an energy practice that gets plugged into your daily life, that brings in all aspects of this teaching so you can apply them.

====================

LESSON 2 – Protection Shield Meditation Exercise

- Let's do the protection shield. What I want you to do right now is get up and just stand straight, visualize, or you can also imagine or allow. Either one is the same; some people have difficulty with visualizing. No problem. Then you just allow, or you can command the energy. So whatever you use right now as a tool will bring light into your crown chakra. And when I say visualize, you can employ either one of those tools. Yeah. Okay. So visualize white light coming down from the divine source in a light stream, like an energy shower, entering your crown chakra, going into your body, filling you up with light. And visualize that light coming out of your hands. Now you're filled with light. Now you're going to do a hand motion. Use your right hand; turn it into a fist, and then stretch out the first two fingers and put the thumb over the other fingers. This is a sign of protection. And you let that hand hang loosely on the side of your body. These two fingers are now lasers through which that light comes out. So visualize this white light that's coming into you, through your crown chakra, to go out of that right hand and out of those two fingers, and you're literally drawing a laser circle around you. When you now start turning clockwise, just let the hand float nicely on the side of the body, and turn your body clockwise. As you do this, you're drawing a laser beam of white light around your body. And make sure you turn all the way so this circle is actually closed and not a little bit open. And then let go of your hands, and visualize this beam of light now being around you. You're in a cone of light. Yeah. This is your protection shield. Your body immediately starts feeding off it. 'Cause it feeds you with light, and it also protects you. Mainly protects you. Good. And then the next thing we're going to do is we're going to ask the higher light forces, or the angels, to make this protection shield mobile so it moves with us. So when you do a step right now, you don't step out of it; it actually walks with you. So just go ahead and ask that. You can follow my voice if you wish. "Dear higher light beings, please make this protection shield mobile. Let it be with me wherever I go. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you." Good. If you prefer to ask on Archangel Michael to do that, you can do that with his name. Archangel Michael is the angel for protection. And now you have a protection shield. This is how easy it is. Boom. Your protection shield is in place. You got it. And now you walk around with it. I want to encourage you to enhance it, which means think about it every so often, feel that it's there. And if you're not sure, do it again. Especially in the beginning, you may want to do it a lot. When I worked in psychiatry where I needed a lot of energy, I actually ended up using it a ton. Every hour I put my clock on it, and I, every hour, I did a protection shield. So just practice it. And you can also, like I mentioned, imagine yourself doing that. You don't always need to just do it physically. In the beginning, I really encourage you to do it often physically, but later on, maybe less so. And if you're in a public place, if you don't want to look weird, you just imagine yourself getting up, doing the hand movement, holding the hand down, letting the light come through you, turning clockwise, having that protection shield drawn around you and ask for it to become mobile. Boom, you got it. That's it. That's how simple it is. And it really works. Yeah. If you put it around belongings, you imagine yourself walking around those belongings and drawing that circle there. Yeah. Amazing work today. So amazing. I'm so grateful for you, grateful for your attention. I'm grateful for you dedicating this time for your empowerment here. And don't forget to recharge as necessary and protect your energy and I'll see you in the next lesson. Aloha.

====================

LESSON 3 – Elevate Your Vibration and Harness Gratitude to Shape Positive Environments
--------------------
<v ->Welcome back.</v> This lesson's going to be extra fun because of what you've done so far. You've really learned and hopefully applied the techniques to recharge your energy and to protect it. You've mastered the amount of energy available to you. Now you get to apply this where you're going to master the quality of that energy, and then we're going to create an overflow of energy for the environment around you. Yeah. So this is where it comes full circle when it comes to energy. "Why is the environment important?" you may ask. You know, some people say, "I don't care about filling up the environment," and others do. But the reality is you are always working with your environment. We're designed to always give energy. That's how we're naturally designed. Yeah. We give energy via our looks, via our voice, via our touch, via our actions. Yeah. So we always give energy to the environment, but it's not always good quality of energy. Yeah. I can attest to that. I'm not always in my best space. Right? And so I'm not always feeding the environment with a good energy unless I have what we're going to create right now, this metaphysical energy tool employed in my energy field that will ensure that I'm giving good energy to the environment, and it'll also ensure that I get good energy into my field. So if we're, for example, upset or tired, you know, what we give is not feeding the environment; it's actually taking from the environment. Think of it this way: if you introduce a vacuum into a full space, the vacuum attracts the energy from that space. Right? So we need to be very aware of how our energy actually affects our environment. Yeah. But this is also relevant the other way around. Your surroundings either feed you or deplete you. In other words, not only can you affect your environment but the environment can affect you positively or negatively. Right. And you don't want to be at the mercy of that. You don't want to be at the mercy of your mood, one thing, and you don't want to be at the mercy of the environment-everybody else's mood. Right. That's going to be trouble. And most people actually live that way. We don't learn about energy. We grow up, you know, being literally at the mercy of our environment because environment is stronger than will. Yeah. Yogananda, one of my favorite mystics, says environment is stronger than will. And that doesn't only count for community, which he was talking about and which it definitely counts for. Put yourself into a community of people that are like-minded and that are of your vibration helps you. But it also counts for the literal environment that we're in, the energy. Yeah. The energy of the environment. If you are a highly sensitive person, and chances are that you probably are a highly sensitive person, otherwise you wouldn't be listening to this Quest. Yeah. Then you are affecting the environment strongly, and the environment affects you very strongly. Yeah. So environments can either inspire us or expire us. Yeah. Energize us or drain us is really what I'm saying. And environments exert a lot of control over our feelings and behavior. But we have the power, and you have the power, to create positive environments. What do you think about that? Yeah. Now if you had a tool that would ensure that wherever you go in the world, you will give the place a good energy, and you will draw good energy from that place, would that be beneficial for you? Can you imagine how much good you would be giving to other people just by being in a room or being in a group of people, you know, if you had that system running at all times? Yeah. This is what we're creating right now. We're going to create a system that runs subconsciously in your energy field all the time. And you don't need to have conscious attention on it. And it'll help you do both. Give good energy to the world, and draw the right energy into your system. Yeah. And this is why I love that we're at this place right now where you've learned the tool, tools that you actually need to do, right? And they're simple, but now we're going to create an energy system around you that is like a self-running system. How do we do that? Well, we're going to start with an antidote to negativity. Just like when you start a really good movie, you have an introduction; you maybe watch the trailer first, and you get into the mood of it. I want to give you something that'll be beneficial for you in terms of energy, in terms of good energy. Yeah. And that's the antidote to negativity. And then we're going to go into that tool, and I'm going to create it with you. The tool that I'm talking about that I call the antidote to negativity or the antivenom to any kind of snake bite, so to say, anything that's not good for you, anything that's going to poison your energy, is gratitude. Why gratitude and how gratitude? I know everybody speaks about gratitude, and you're like, "Oh my gosh, you know, gratitude." Well, I don't know what you're feeling right now, but come with me. Come with me for a moment. Come with into the land of gratitude, and I'm going to tell you why. All the mystics, all the masters, and everybody who has a good teaching ends up speaking about gratitude in some way or another. Yeah. Here's why. Again, remember every good tool is simple. Every good tool that really works is simple. So gratitude is one of the tools that you can employ at any time. And it always works. Always. Yeah. So if you have something going on that's not good in your life, you can always place your attention into something else, and you can be grateful for that. Can you? Yes you can. We as humans have the capacity of self-reflection and also the choice where we place our attention. Now, I don't think animals necessarily have that. Flowers, plants probably don't, but we have that. And this is why we're conscious creators. Yeah. Now gratitude is the one tool that actually brings up your vibration. I'm going to share about vibration in a minute. Brings up your vibration immediately to a higher level. So gratitude is easy. Gratitude brings up your vibration and can be done at any time. Yeah. I'm going to give you an example for those. Example for gratitude. Why is it easy? Because you always find something to be grateful for. It doesn't need to be about your own life; it can be about somebody else's life. Right? You can think of the grass growing without you telling it to grow and be grateful for that. Or you can be grateful for the sky being blue behind the clouds. You can be grateful that your heart beats without you telling it to beat. 'Cause you'd probably forget to tell it and accidentally die. Right? You can be grateful for somebody else, and you can of course be grateful about something in your life specifically as well. So gratitude can be employed at all times. That's number one. Yeah. So it works always. It's simple because all it takes is your attention to be placed on something you're grateful for, right? So think of something that's going to be like your go-to thing for gratitude. My go-to thing is "The sky is always blue behind the clouds." For some reason, I love that. But for others it's, you know, "I'm grateful for spaghetti pasta," or "I'm grateful for my grandma." You know, find something that's your go-to gratitude, and then you can build on that. Yeah. Simple. And then it's universal. That means it works to uplevel anything that you have going on. And this is what I'm going to explain to you right now. This is where we're going into vibration. Yeah. Into the actual frequency of the vibration. So vibrationally speaking, we have a certain frequency that we're vibrating on. And David Hawkins created a book, and he proved how our vibration actually affects our environment and affects our body. And he found out that we can measure the vibration of, for example, a human body. And in his teachings, lower energies, lower feelings, like sadness, shame, anger, they're on a lower vibration, somewhere around 35. Feelings of hope and starting to be positive are on a vibration of about 200, 220. And then going into gratitude; that resides in 350 and going higher. Unconditional love is around 500, 550. So he showed us how we can measure the vibration of an emotion and that that emotion that a person feels actually affects the overall vibration of the physical body. So that means if you're stuck or if I'm stuck in anger or in shame, in some kind of victim mode, yeah, that vibrationally speaking, it is actually not easy, actually really hard, to think or feel thoughts of unconditional love and feelings of unconditional love. Yeah. It's very far away. We are able to shift vibration through gratitude, but it cannot happen unless we think it's possible. So I'm assuming you already think it's possible, and I'm giving you the next step. Next step after hope is gratitude. And gratitude is fantastic because gratitude is already at 350 according to David Hawkins. And at 350, all the positive things are coming to you when you're vibrating at that. So if you bring your vibration up to 350, even if you're not seeing the evidence in your life of something to be grateful for, you just use the tool by thinking of something that you're grateful for that doesn't need to be in your life. You know, you could be saying, "I'm grateful that a meteorite is not hitting me right now." Still gratitude. Right? Then you are actually getting into that higher vibrational field where all good resides, where all good comes to you, because vibration comes together with magnetism. Remember I told you that we're going to talk about your electric field and your magnetic field. This is where this comes in. So you're bringing your electromagnetic field together in a vibration that resides in something that you want. Now, gratitude is universal because it's just something you're grateful for. So it attracts things to you that you will be grateful for. So it's something that you will be grateful for. It'll be something good, right? Therefore it's universal. You don't actually need a manifest. We're going into a manifestation next, but you don't even need a manifest in order to get the best already started to attract it into your life. Yeah. All you need is get into gratitude. So I hope I gave you a new understanding of gratitude, and it's not just something good to do or good to have. It's a life-saving antidote to negativity when you need it, and you can employ it. Yeah. There are three ways of gratitude. How do you use that? The first one is think, which is what I just explained, right? The second one is write gratitude; writing is stronger than thinking 'cause it involves an action. And later on manifestation, we'll talk a lot about how to use action. But in this case, you're going to write gratitude. For example, in the morning, you know, after your morning tea and coffee, when you're recharged, you're going to write a gratitude list. That would really help to get your vibration on 350 or higher. And it'll help you to attract good things into your life. Plenty and simple. Good. It's just good, you know, nothing specific; it's just good. The next thing that you can do is do a whole gratitude collage. And why am I bringing this up? Well, you've noticed thinking is an easy thing we can do. But when we're really negative, not so easy anymore; we stay in negativity. That's when we write, right? Because an action is stronger. So if we write gratitude, we're probably more easy in staying on that. But sometimes we're even that negative that we can't write; we're obsessing about something negative; then writing is not enough. And that's when the collage comes in. And let me remind you, we're talking about antidote right now. We're talking about an emergency kit that you need in order to stay in a high vibration. Yeah. If you are at any time not having an easy time thinking of gratitude, that means you need the emergency kit. Right now, what are you grateful for? If that came easy, you're fine. If it didn't come easy, you need the gratitude kit. Yeah. Because this is the minimum vibration we need in order to create a good life. Yeah. Again, simple tool. Now, why I am telling you about the collage is I actually had to employ this. In 2009, I had my little child I had already told you about; he was now half a year old, and I wanted to show him to my family in Germany. Now I'm a German citizen, and I was in Hawaii, and I overstayed my visa because I had my, got pregnant, and then I had my child. So I flew to Germany thinking everything would be fine and wanted to go back to Hawaii after four weeks. And I wasn't allowed in because of my visa overstay. So I found myself at the airport with a half-a-year-old child at this point. And he was, you know, with me, still patient. After two hours, he wasn't patient anymore; he was crying. I was interrogated by this person about what I did wrong and how I would be, you know, never be able to come back to the US and all of that. And after about three, four hours, I was basically a lake of tears. I was just completely devastated. My child was crying; I was crying. I wasn't going to go back. They didn't allow me back, and they couldn't tell me how long it would take. It would take minimum half a year, maximum 10 years. So I found myself completely shocked and then had to go back to my family. Now my parents don't live anymore, so I didn't really have a home I could get back to. So I went to live with a friend. And while I was figuring this out, and time went by, and I stayed with a cousin, and time went by, and I was trying to get home, that's when I got the news that my home in Hawaii-that I had magically attracted with manifestation that I'm going to share with you in the next part- I had this beautiful house in Hawaii, and somebody was literally stealing my house. I got the message that she was going to take over my house. She had told the owner of the house, you know, that I was a bad person, all kinds of rumors and stories, and stole my stuff that was in there, moved in the house; house was gone. Next week, I got the message my horse was stolen that I had brought to Hawaii. I knew who stole it, but I had no way of getting it back. So I'm finding myself, no house, no horse, no way to go, with my little child. It was just really, really hard. And while I got my horse back and while I got back to Hawaii later, one and a half years later, in that moment, I didn't know that. And I was literally obsessing about the unjustness of that, injustice of that. And I was laying in bed with my little boy next to me, and my mind was like, "Ah, ah, oh, why did that?" You know about that? Familiar? That's what I was doing. So, that, and more; it was so strong that I could tell the toxic chemicals are going through my body. Just like when you do gratitude, good chemicals are going through your body, health enhancing. I had the opposite happening. And I'm thinking this is going to affect your child. So finally got up, thinking gratitude; think gratitude, whoa, fretting; think gratitude, not working; writing gratitude, fretting, ah, writing gratitude, fret-not working; got a collage, went and printed all kinds of little pictures that reminded me of Hawaii. Drew some stuff out of a magazine. And then I sat down, and I just glued this stuff on. Everything that reminded me of being grateful. That's all I did. I just put everything out of that newspaper that looked like gratitude to me: grateful people, beautiful sunshine, all of that. And for two hours I was working on this collage. Yeah. And the more I did it, this whole grip that I had on my neck- that was like just telling me I was wrong, and the story was wrong, and I was in the wrong movie-just let go more and more and more and more. And by the time I was done with my collage, I was free. I looked at my collage, and I said, "Universe, no matter how big a miracle I need, bring it on. I'm now ready to be grateful for the fact that I'm going back to Hawaii." That's all I did. I stayed grateful for going back to Hawaii. And the miracle happened, that literally I got a 10 year bar; I got told I'm not allowed to go back for 10 years. And within one and a half years I was overcome. And I found myself back in Hawaii. I was looking at that collage every day. I was doing gratitude every day. Gratitude is a magical tool. So why is this important that we use gratitude as an antidote to negativity? Well, we can't hang out in negativity because it really brings all the negative stuff to you and enhances the negative stuff. I can't even tell you how many people actually hang out in negativity: listening to the news, you know, getting inundated in negativity. Where your attention goes, your energy flows, so it matters. So I want to encourage you right now: place your attention away from things that are not working, and make sure that in those 24 hours of your day, including your sleep, right- I'm going to share something about your sleep- you actually have more time on something you want than what you don't want. That's it. Simple equation. Just more; more time on what you want compared to what you don't want. And you can use anything positive. But the reason why I'm suggesting gratitude is because it's something you can do at any time, and it doesn't need to be related to your current situation. So now we're ready to actually do the tool that I shared with you earlier because now you understand about frequency; you understand why your frequency is important; you understand the tool to use when you find yourself in a lower frequency, and you understand why, okay? Now we're going to actually create an energy tool around you that gives you good quality of energy as well. Yeah. So the vibration goes up and stays up because on the high vibration is where everything that you want. Yeah. I want to show you this metaphysical tool that you can use subconsciously without placing attention to it, to always draw positive energy into your system and to feed the world with positivity. Amazing work. Keep working on your practice today and we'll pick up on your next module where we talk about the resources for divine manifestation. And I'll see you in the next lesson. Aloha. Bye-bye.

LESSON 3 – "I Radiate" Meditation

- Come with me. Let's take a deep breath together right here, and with your next breath, let go of everything that you've had before and that's going to happen later. Just come to this moment. Take one more breath in, arriving right here, right now, out. And then breathe normally as you start visualizing white roots coming out of your feet and the space between your legs, your perineum; send those roots down deeper and deeper into the earth. Visualizing, allowing, or intending them to go down all the way into the heart of the planet. There's a crystal there at the heart of the planet, actually not the magma. Anchor your roots into that crystal. Beautiful. You have now three light roots anchored into the crystal in the heart of the planet. And now start breathing out through the roots, all the way down to the heart of the planet. And in from there. Every time you breathe out, you're letting go of used-up energy out of your whole body and aura. And you send it down with your breath into the heart of the planet where it is immediately transformed. And then you breathe in that fresh life force energy from the planet into your body and aura, recharging yourself with every breath, and also cleansing yourself with every breath. Continue now in your own rhythm, breathing in, recharging, breathing out, letting go. Three more breaths. Beautiful. Now let go of that thought while this continues to happen. And focus on your crown chakra, the middle of your head, and visualize a light rod going up from your crown chakra through the dimensions and timelines into source of all creation, God, however you want to call it, growing that light rod all the way up through the dimensions, higher and higher and higher until you reach what could be perceived as source or God. And then start breathing in from there fresh energy into your system. That is your body and your aura, and out to God source like a whale spouts out. Beautiful. Every time you breathe in, you recharge with this beautiful energy coming from source. And every time you breathe out, you breathe out to source. Continue in your own rhythm. Your focus here is now letting go of old beliefs, anything that hinders your perfect guidance and breathing in what is perfect for you being guided, for your life purpose. Three more breaths. Beautiful. Now let go of that thought, and focus on your heart chakra in the middle of your chest. And you are using your heart chakra now to attract the energy from above and below simultaneously. So I'm going to ask you to breathe into your heart chakra, focusing on that, from both directions, from the source of all creation and the source of the planet, heart of the planet, breathing in and out in both directions. Do that a few more times in your own rhythm. Breathing in from above and below, gathering the energy into your heart and breathing out to above and below, sending the energy out of your heart. The focus here is you're breathing in unconditional love from the heart of the planet and the heart of creation into your heart. And you're breathing out what hinders unconditional love. Continue in your own rhythm. Three more breaths. Beautiful. Now your next focus will be breathing in from above and below into your heart like you just did. But instead of breathing out to above and below, you start breathing out into your physical body, pumping up your physical body like you fill up a balloon. So breathing in from above and below, that means you're gathering in the best, most powerful energies into your system. And then you distribute those energies into your physical body by breathing out into the whole physical body. Continue that in your own rhythm, breathing in from above and below, out into your body. And imagine, visualize, or intend your cells to be filled up with light. They're absorbing the light. They're starting to sparkle with that light. Every cell of your body absorbs this as you continue to breathe. And you don't need to cleanse yourself anymore because you're now clean enough. So your breathing in from above and below draws in energy, and breathing out into your body fills your body more. Just continue until you feel your body is full to overflowing. And remember, your body is made of cells. Everything is cells. Even the bones, the muscles, the tendons, the organs, the blood vessels, the blood. Everything is cells and space between the cells. So you're filling all of that up, creates a powerful vitality. Three more breaths. Wonderful. Now let it overflow with your next exhalation into your emotional body, which is about a foot outside of your physical body or 30 centimeters. Breathing in from above and below, out into your physical body. Let it overflow into the emotional body and start filling up the emotional body now with every breath, noticing that you're creating an overflow of energy; you're expanding your energy field as we do this. So keep pumping it up in your own rhythm. Three more breaths. And then let it overflow into the mental body. Another foot or 30 centimeters outside of your emotional body, another foot or 30 centimeters outside of the emotional body. Every time you breathe in, you draw in the energy from the perfect sources. You breathe out into your physical body. Keep recharging that emotional body. Keep recharging it. Now the mental body is being recharged, and you pump it up to overflowing.

- Three more breaths. Beautiful. Then let it overflow once more into your spiritual body. Again, another foot or 30 centimeters outside of the mental body. Breathing in from above and below, breathing out into your physical, emotional, mental, and spiritual body. Notice how you're expanding your aura right now with every breath, filling up that aura. Beautiful. Continue in your own rhythm. Three more breaths. Beautiful. Now lastly, let it overflow from there in all directions. You are now turning into a sunshine of energy, and you don't think of where it's going. You just create a radiating field around you. So breathing in from above and below, breathing out into your physical, emotional, mental, and spiritual body. And let it just shine outside in all directions. Now you have become an energy field that radiates out into the world and doesn't take from the world. And with every breath you're taking, it continues this way, especially if we're programming your body now. And this is what we're doing. So take another breath in. From above and below, breathe out into the physical, emotional, mental, and spiritual body. Radiate it out, and use a hand signal like this and say, "I radiate." So if you are hearing this, I basically get my arms out and around and say, "I radiate." We're going to do this three times. Breathing in from above and below, out into the body and aura; overflow. "I radiate," one more time, in from above and below, out into the body and aura; overflow. "I radiate." Good. Then wiggle your hands and feet, and open your eyes, and realize you've recharged yourself right now. You've created an overflow, but you also set up your system and programmed it so that that overflow gets activated every time you just say, "I radiate." Every time you get your arms out and say, "I radiate," the system activates itself. So throughout your day, you can just say, "I radiate." And make sure that system is in place by you thinking of it for a moment. And the more you do that, the more your system will know it. And maybe once a day do it the way we just did it, where you'll focus on the breath, and you consciously send that breath. You can also do that when you need extra energy. What it'll help you with is to never run out of energy around people. They don't suck energy from you. And also to actually give good energy into the world, into the world around you, so that you actually feed others without depleting yourself. So you're not directionally feeding people, which many people uncondition- unconsciously do. You are omnidirectional, shining it into the whole surroundings just like the sun does. Have fun with that.

LESSON 4 – Ignite Your Energy: The 4 Keys to Manifesting With Clarity and Ease
--------------------
<v ->Welcome to the second part of your Quest.</v> Right now, we're at a wonderful place because you went through a whole series of exercises and implemented tools that help you master your energy. At this point, you have more than enough energy available, I hope, at any time. And you keep practicing, right? And the cool thing is, right now, this is the moment where your freedom starts. Yeah. You're out of survival, beginning to thrive. Energy is an equal to freedom. Have you thought of that? You know, if you have enough energy, you can do anything. If you don't have enough energy, you're restricted. So really, you having enough energy is an equivalent to your freedom. It fuels your freedom. It's like money. If you have more than enough, you have more freedom. Yeah. And the important part here is "more than enough," because more than enough creates the freedom to do something with the extra money or the extra energy. Okay? So let's say you just have enough money to pay your bills. That's where your survival is taken care of. But you don't yet have that extra money to do these vacations. You know, to invite people to do extravagant, you know, parties or, or you know, to get yourself that good extra health foods. You know, get the electric car, all the things you can do when you have extra money, right? The same thing is with energy. If you have an extra amount of energy, which is what we created in the last part, then you can do something with that energy. Yeah. So now what do you want to do with that energy? Most people will say, "Now I want to manifest my dreams. Now I want to go for the dream." Yeah. "I want to first fix my survival. I want to take care of my livelihood. So my bills are paid. I have enough energy to handle my life. Yeah. And then I want to go for my dreams," right? For example, long time ago I asked my partner, "What do you want in life?" And he said, "Well, I can't think of that right now. I first need to take care of our livelihood. I need to make enough money to pay for the house, and then I need to get this business going. And once I have all of that, then I can think about that." Now, this is not my approach, but a lot of people do it that way. Now, the problem is with that is that people always wait until something is created. Something is done; something happens before they go for their dreams, right? Where he is correct though, is he has to first take care of his survival. He first has to, has to take care of day-to-day bills, day-to-day livelihood, right? Because if that's not taken care of, it's always in the back of your mind. You're always kind of worried. You're always hustling; you're always, you know, worried that it's not working. You're always, you know, pushing. Right? So you want, you don't want to do that. And therefore, right now, creating an overflow of energy will create an energy field that works on overflow. And as you'll see today, I'm going to explain to you why that also helps you attract more money. Again, money and energy are really your means to freedom, and money and energy are very equivalent. So what is manifesting? Today, we're going to dive into this. We're going to dive into you manifesting your dreams. And the word manifesting really means bringing a wish into form. Yeah. And how do you do that? Well, many people think visualizing is really what manifests things. Yeah. Well, while visualizing is an important part of manifestation, if you only visualize what you want, and that's your only tool you're using, you're probably not going to have a lot of success. Yeah. You may be wondering why things are coming slowly into your life, or maybe they're not coming at all. Yeah. Or maybe you're getting a little bit of what you want and then a lot of what you don't want. Does that sound familiar when you hear that? Think about it. And what have you been doing so far? What I want to do with you today is I want you to go from wanting something to actually having it. Yeah. So that experience of you not getting what you want or getting it delayed is no longer your experience. So let's cut through the first myth right away. Okay. It's not what you do that determines what you get; it is the energy behind it. What does that mean? Well, many people think they just need to work harder in order to get to their goals. Yeah. But if that was true, the hardest-working people would be the most successful. And that's not the case. I mean, honestly, I've seen these beautiful, amazing workers cut strawberries in California, and I was just watching them, how they're in the strawberry field, and they're cutting strawberries. They're bent down, you know, they're working really hard. And then I find out what they get per hour. And I'm like, "Hard work is definitely not getting you more success." Okay? And this fits right into our manifestation. The reason why hard work doesn't get you more success is it's not what you do that determines what you get. It is the energy behind it. Okay? The energy behind what you're trying to manifest will actually determine whether what you want lands in your lap or it doesn't. Yeah. You think that's interesting. Once I figured that out, I realized I need to have a completely different approach to manifestation. And I want to show you this approach in this session. Yeah. So here's how this all started. When I was 36 years old, I meditated in my home in Germany, and I asked, "What's my next step? What do you want me to do?" So I was working with my higher self already. And in every meditation I got to the higher self. And I asked-and which is by the way, where you are going, okay, so we'll take you to the higher self. And I got the message, "Well, you need to go to Hawaii. You need to take a long vacation in Hawaii, two months or something." I'm like, "How am I supposed to go to Hawaii without having any money, without knowing anybody in Hawaii?" I was just thinking, "How is that possible that I am supposed to go to Hawaii?" Right? Because Hawaii, to me from Germany was like in another world. It wasn't really reachable. Although I would love to go to Hawaii. I knew that I wanted to go to Hawaii since my childhood, but to actually make it happen, that seemed far away. What I was doing at the time, I was living in an apartment that-I loved the apartment, it has a lot of light, but it was a very old building, and it was very cheap. So I was paying $500 a month for my apartment, and I had a horse, and I was starting to work with clients. And so I lived in a very modest way, one could say. Yeah. So for me to think of getting a ticket to Hawaii was basically impossible. A ticket to Hawaii is $1,200. Yeah. So I said, "What if I go to the Mediterranean instead of to Hawaii? You want me to go to an ocean? I'll go to the Mediterranean." And I saw dolphins come in my meditation, and I saw myself swimming with dolphins and meeting dolphins. And I really felt called by the dolphins, and I felt called by the ocean. So I'm like negotiating with the universe, with my higher self: "Can I go to the Mediterranean?" 'Cause I could drive that with my motorbike, right? It's like, "Nope, got to be Hawaii." So here's what I did. "If you want me to go to Hawaii, I'll do what I can do. But here's what you need to do. Bring me the money to buy the ticket, to be there and to get it all done." Okay? So I ended up doing what I could do, which was packing my bag, right? So think of it, if you ever get a message from your higher self of something that's outside of your reach, think of what you can do that's within your reach that gets you closer to that goal. That's what I did. I thought "What could get me closer to the goal?" Packed my suitcase, talked to people, told them 50%, I'm going to Hawaii, 50%, I'm not. So just be prepared. Found somebody who could take care of my horse. Got an email account-at the time, I didn't have an email account yet-to work with my clients online and said, "Okay, now I'm basically ready." I even had a renter that could rent my apartment for the two months. "So bring me the money." Nothing came; nothing happened. I thought I did everything right. I did what you'll come to hear later, the three steps of manifestation, and the three steps of manifestation didn't get me nowhere. So I asked my higher self, "What's going on? Why are you not bringing the money?" You know, I even pre-booked a ticket to Hawaii at the travel agency, and it felt really amazing because the travel agent thought I'm going to be paying for the ticket, which I didn't think I would, but they gave me that confidence that I probably could. So that helped my manifestation. Well, when I talked with my higher self, I got the message, "You need to already be living in Hawaii energetically, and then all the things that you need in order to get to Hawaii will come to you." And I'm like, "Well, how does that work?" Yeah. And so this is where my higher self taught me how to manifest. I learned that there are three different keys to manifesting. Yeah. Thinking, feeling, and action. Those are the keys. I'm going to share a little bit more about it. But then I also learned that there's a missing link. And that missing link is actually what I was missing at the moment. And that's why my three keys weren't working. Okay? So in reality, you need to add something to those three keys, and that's what I call a soul magnet. Now, let me first start telling you how I work those three keys, and then we're going to go into the soul magnet. Are you with me? Yes. You're basically going to Hawaii with me right now. Okay? We're doing it together. And you can use something that you want to manifest in your own mind right now and replace it with Hawaii. So we can actually use the time that we're spending right now already starting to create what you want. Yeah. Okay. Go ahead and do that. Think of what you really want. Got you. Okay, good. So first key is thinking. Your thinking needs to be aligned with what you want. Superimportant. We learned that. I'm sure you know that; we learned that through the secret. We learned that through law of attraction; you know, many people talk about that. You need to have your thoughts in that direction of what you want. So how did I think about Hawaii? I was thinking that I would be spending time there. I thought, "I'll have a car, I'll probably going to be buying a car, and then I'm going to sell it again." So I was thinking of how I was going to do that, thinking of where I want to go. So put my thoughts into Hawaii. I also, you know, made sure that I'm looking at Hawaii, journals that speak of Hawaii. I am looking at a travel guide. Yeah. So that's getting my intellectual thinking in the direction of where I want to go. Next is feeling. So I started to feel how it feels to be in Hawaii. And I have to tell you, meditation really helped me there a lot. Because when I meditated, I actually went there in my mind. I went to this beautiful beach that I saw. I swam with the dolphins, and I, I did all of that in my meditative state, and it felt very, very good. So if you're adept at meditation, do that. And if you're not, you'll get more adept through this training here. And this is a very empowering tool, because feeling something in a meditative state where your brain is in a very receptive state is more powerful than just feeling it. But nevertheless, you can also just feel it. So I put on Hawaii music. Yeah. I put on, I got Hawaii clothes; I got myself a sarong; I put some pictures up of dolphins. So I did all of that stuff that instills the feeling, right? Number two. Number three is action. I told you already: packed my bag. I did all the action. So I was doing those three keys. Yeah. And I told you also, and you heard me already, so I'm repeating myself, but I hope it sits. I hope it really lands so that whatever I'm saying right now, you're not just hearing me; it acts actually lands with you. So it becomes second nature to you. So after this lesson, you'll literally understand how you need to manifest your next dream. Okay? So my three keys didn't work because I needed to understand how the soul magnet works. And that's when my higher self showed me the soul magnet. And I just was blown away how that worked. This is the breakthrough for me. I ended up creating a soul magnet with my higher self that night. And I'll show you how to create one later too. Now, here's the thing, what happened? You're with me? Drum roll! The next morning- the next morning: I go down to my letter box at the door, and a letter's in there from my late aunt who had died a year ago. And in that letter-I had to sit down. I'm reading, "You have inherited 13,000 euros from your aunt." I'm like, "Ah, universe! Yes, 13,000 euros!" I'm now, I'm, I went to the travel agency. I ran to the travel agency, and I booked my ticket there, acting as if I always knew that I was going to buy that ticket, right? And then I gave half to my brother, created a really beautiful vacation for them and his family. And I took half to Hawaii. Yeah. I had this amazing breakthrough in Hawaii. Actually, the fact that I got guided to Hawaii is why I'm sitting here right now with you. It started my career as a healer. It started everything that you know about me. I was an occupational therapist at the time. And while I loved my work, I really felt I needed to bring healing work more into my work. And I just started it. But when I got to Hawaii, for those two months, I completely released everything that I wasn't and received who I really was. I even received my name, Ariya, at the time. So why I'm telling you this is you are sitting here right now with me. This may be your pivotal moment. I'm calling it out to be. And if you're in agreement with that, say "Yes." There you go. This is your moment where you are manifesting your next level of soul fulfillment that is aligned with your soul purpose. A hundred percent. Once something's aligned a hundred percent with your soul purpose, all the doors open; your health gets better; your wealth gets better; your relationship gets better. You actually get the resources you need. You completely move like on a jet stream into the direction where you need to go. Why? Well, because you came here to fulfill your soul purpose, right? Everybody has a purpose to fulfill. And therefore all the energies that you need will always be given to you once you're on your soul purpose. And when you're not on your soul purpose, you'll meet struggles and hindrances and obstacles because you're supposed to not go that direction. You're supposed to go in that right direction. And this is also why all the happiness and the real fulfillment lie on your soul purpose. Because we are guided by that soul purpose; we're guided by that happiness. Everybody wants the happiness, right? So you're automatically geared to looking for more and more happiness. And the true happiness lies on your soul purpose. And when your soul purpose is found, the doors open, and then you can fulfill your life. Yeah. So why don't you come with me, and we're going to do it together. We're going to use this particular approach to manifestation that I call divine manifestation. And we're going to create the energy behind your wish. Then we create the soul magnet in order to attract what you want into your life. And then you get to repeat it and repeat it and repeat it. And every time you manifest something, you know, it's on soul purpose. It actually leads to your true soul level fulfillment is how I call that. It's a soul level fulfillment that you don't get out of anything else. Because when you are actually on soul purpose, and when you're actually living your soul purpose, there's a fulfillment that comes from that that's indescribable. And as I'm sitting here right now, I can share with you how that feels. And I can tell you it is a feeling of having all your wishes fulfilled, being loved by the whole world, and never needing anything else. It's just so fulfilling. Now, because of the law of attraction that brings to you what you're vibrating on, as soon as you're in that phase of your life where you are on that true soul level fulfillment, from that moment on, you are only going to manifest everything that you really want, more and more of it. And the things that you don't want, you know, the waves that life still has, they don't matter as much. So this is when you get to what I call to the jet stream of the higher self. Yeah. And I'll talk at the very end about that because I want you to have access to that as well. So now the good news is if you've done the work in the previous lessons, and you have already created the energy that you need to manifest, then you can go right now. You have an overflow of energy. Let's jump into it. Let's find out how embodying the energy and using the soul magnet works. Okay, let me explain this in plain physics-or quantum physics to be accurate. If you look a little bit further, what is really happening in manifestation is we're making use of a law, the law of attraction to be precise. Yeah, I just mentioned it. So the law of attraction is the most important law you need to know about when it comes to manifestation. But there are some misunderstandings about that, and I want to just bust that myth as well with you. Okay? We're going to bust the myth about the law of attraction, which the myth is that by the law of attraction, whatever you visualize comes to you; whatever you place your attention on comes to you. Now, this is correct, but it's not feasible for us as humans. And I'm going to explain to you why. Okay? So first, let's look at several other laws present here on this planet at all times. Most of them we're aware of. For example, you are aware of the law of gravity. Yeah. The law of gravity states that if you have something in your hand, like a cup, for example, and you let it go, it'll fall. Right? It'll fall. Good. We're clear on that. Now, does that happen for everybody? Or does it only happen for certain people? It happens for everybody. Right? Interesting. Let me ask you the next question. Does that happen for people who are particularly good people or particularly bad people? Or does it not matter what kind of person they are? Yes. Also here, it happens for everyone. Now, this is what the word universal law means. A universal law works for everyone at the same time. It doesn't make a difference who you are. Okay? Now, this is important that you get this because the same thing counts for the law of attraction. It works for everyone the same at all times. Yes. But many people think that to attract a lot, let's say money or fame or success, you have to be either a good person or, depending on their beliefs, it could also be the opposite, that you have to be a bad person to attract all that good stuff. But the truth is you don't. It doesn't depend on who you are. It does not depend on what your intentions are either. Yeah. It depends on whether you use the law or not. In our example, whether you let go of the cup in your hand or not- that's what it depends on. Okay? If you use the law of gravity, if you let go of the cup, it falls. If you use the law of attraction, you employ it, it works. And I'm going to show you how to employ it. But before I do, I want to tell you why we're not so familiar with the law of attraction like we are with the law of gravity and why it doesn't always work immediately. Yeah. So we're not so familiar with it because it's not as visible and as clear as the law of gravity. If you're a little child, two years old, you let go of a cup, you let go of your teddy bear, you love it. You do that all the time. The parent picks it up; you let it go. The parent picks it up; you let it go. You are learning that law, and you get instant gratification. So you let it go; instantly, it's gone, and then it comes back. Now, the law of attraction doesn't do the instant gratification. And this is why so many people don't get into their lives what they want, because they don't see the instant gratification, and therefore they don't think the law exists, or they don't believe in it, or they forget about it; all the while they're using it against themselves. Yeah. Because with the law of attraction, there's a time delay, and that time delay makes it a little harder to grasp, okay? The time delay is that when you attract something into your life, it takes time until it actually arrives with you. And I'll go into why that is in a minute. Okay? So stay tuned. So, so far we've covered that you need an overflow of energy in order to manifest, and you know how to do that. That's in part one. Okay? Then we've covered the three keys of manifestation, which are very common. It's thinking, feeling, and action. And we've covered that you need an extra piece in there in order to land it in your lap, which is the soul magnet that I'll explain more in depth as we go along. Yeah. Because it takes a little bit of time; a little bit of exercise we'll put into that. So now you know all of that, okay? You also know about the law of attraction, and that the law of attraction is your friend when it comes to manifestation. You know that it is a universal law. It works for everyone at all times. And so you can let go of the thoughts, "Oh, I'm not worth it," or "I'm not the right person," or "I'll never have money;" "I'll never have that boyfriend;" "I'll never have that wife." All of that you can let go of because it doesn't depend on who you are. Okay? It depends on how you use the law. And I'm going to show you exactly how. Yeah. Now, let me explain to you with a music instrument what the law of attraction is really like so that you have it so clear; you're just so aware of it. And from that moment on, you'll be able to use it in your favor more easily. Yeah. Just like if somebody says, "Use my car and go to Costco," right? If you don't know how to use the car, that's going to be a problem for you. You are going to try to figure out how the car works, and Costco is far, at the very end of that story, right? But if you know how to use a car, you'll be at Costco in no time. So it's really important for you to understand this law. Okay? So speaking of an instrument, let's think we have a violin here. Okay? So we have a violin. This violin is tuned to the tone A. On this hand, I have a tuning fork, and the tuning fork is tuned to the tone A as well. So now I'll place my violin down. I bang the tuning fork; it vibrates, and I put it sort of close to the violin, not even touching it. What happens to the violin's strings? They start to vibrate. They actually go in resonance with my tone A. Yeah, I've done this experiment. And it was stunning to me because the next thing was what I didn't expect. I got another tuning fork tuned to the tone D, as in David. I banged it, held it to the instrument. What do you think happened? Do you think it vibrated, or it didn't? Well, I'll tell you what I thought. I thought it would vibrate for sure. It's a vibration. Vibration. Vibration, right? It didn't. Nothing. The violin stayed just completely silent. So then I tried a few more times, and then I realized, "Wow, this is what resonance is." And when we, when we use the law of attraction, we speak of resonance. And resonance means you are vibrating on the same wavelength of something that you're going into resonance with. And the law of attraction means that whatever you want to attract into your life, you need to vibrate at the same tone, at the same frequency, than the thing you are attracting. So I was seeing the law of attraction in action right now before me. Yeah. So now let's say that the violin that's tuned to A is actually you. You are the violin. And being tuned to A means that you are using the three keys of manifestation to be tuned to your wish. A is your wish. Okay? So let's say you want a new car. Simple. Okay, I want a new car. I am now tone A, which means I'm thinking I'm going to get a new car. I'm already loving the feeling of driving it. Every time I go into my old car and I hold the steering wheel, I feel as if I'm driving my new car, right? I'm doing actions; I'm looking at ads. I'm talking to people about the car. I'm going to car places and drive, test drive the car. So that is me tuning myself to A. I'm going into resonance with the vibration of having that car. Okay? So this is how we bring our body and our aura into resonance with what we want- through these three keys of manifestation. Okay? And the tuning fork that I'm banging is actually our wish fulfilled. The tuning fork is your car. So if you're tuned to A, and you hit the tuning fork, you start to vibrate; you go in resonance with that car. The car is close. Being in resonance with something that you want will attract it to you. And that's the law of attraction. Okay? Feel it. Good. Now, as I mentioned before, why does it not work all the time compared to gravity? Well, it works all the time. It just has a time delay. That time delay has to do with the fact that there's actual distance between you and the very thing you are attracting, and it has to be drawn to you, which takes time. Yeah. Just like if your grandmother was going to visit you, she has to get into the car and drive to you. Yeah. It takes time for her to arrive. When I was saying I was using the keys for manifestation, which are thinking, feeling, and action, to attract to me being in Hawaii, this is what I was explaining. If you are using thinking and feeling and your actions towards attracting something, you're going towards it, and it's going towards you. It is working. The only thing is we have to work with a delay, and we have to mitigate the delay. And the delay gets mitigated with the soul magnet. Because some people, they have such a delay that their manifestation never gets to them. Yeah. It takes longer than their lifetime. The delay is so big. Now, how does the delay happen? The delay happens because you are not all day long tuned to A. You may be tuned to A when you're thinking about your wish, feeling about your wish, and doing action towards your wish; that's when you're tuned to A, right? But then-let's say you want that car- but then you know, somebody calls you up and says, "Hey, you know what? Do you want to come to the beach with me?" And you say, "Well, I can't because my car isn't working really well." So now you're thinking "I don't have the right car." Okay? And then you know, you get some bills, and you see the bills, and you say, "Oh my gosh, I have to pay these bills; I've had- I don't have enough money. I'm never going to get my car." Now you are manifesting against it. You're creating a delay because you're literally putting your car further away from you, and then you're thinking, "Oh, it would be wonderful to have a car. I, damn it, darn, I don't have the new car yet." Further away again. Then you're distracted, and you're just thinking you don't have enough time to get to your appointment. That's not related to the car, but it's related to "I don't have enough." So it goes away again. So the more, throughout the day, that we actually not work towards our goal, the longer the delay. Yeah. And not working towards our goal is when we think that we don't have either the particular thing or anything at all. Just the general feeling of "don't have" is a general anti- manifestation experience. Yeah. Do you remember when we talked about gratitude? Yeah. And that was the antidote to all negativity. And that gratitude can bring to you everything you want. This is where this comes in. If you, let's say, work clearly on your manifestation, you think about it, you feel it, you do actions towards it, you're tuned to A, that's the time when things come to you, right? If you do that a lot of the day, your manifestation comes quicker and quicker. If throughout the rest of your day, when you do your dishes, when you work with your kids, when you work in your work, you stay on gratitude, you're generally grateful, you're not counter-manifesting; you still keep it coming. Now, what's going to be superamazing is when you employ the soul magnet. The soul magnet is actually something that can draw this experience or thing to you during the time that you are not consciously manifesting it. Yeah. During the time that I was thinking, "I'm in Germany and I'm not in Hawaii," my soul magnet worked for me in my favor and brought to me my Hawaii experience, which is why I'm living in Hawaii now. Yeah. Now that you know this, and now that you understand more deeper how manifestation works, I want to know from you what do you want to manifest?

====================

LESSON 4 – Soul Searching Exercise

- For the sake of this exercise, I would like to ask you to think of something relatively simple. Nothing superbig. 'Cause you're trying to manifest something. And that way I'm going to show you how to bring it into your life. And it doesn't take a lot of time until it comes. Okay. So it could be, let's say, a beautiful meal invitation by a person you absolutely love. Or it could be a dance partner to dance with, or it could be a nice vacation with someone. Something simple. Yeah. Think of anything. It could also be healing part of your body that needs healing-if it's not superbig. Yeah. The reason why I don't want you to go superbig with this is later in the last part of the Quest, we're going to go for the gold. Yeah. And when we're in gold mode, we're going to contact your higher self. And your higher self will help you understand what you really need to manifest in order to fulfill your soul's purpose. Yeah. And in other words, once you're at the higher self level, every manifestation will be informed by the higher self, and it will ensure that you are putting your effort and your time into this in a way that it actually leads to your fulfillment. Right? So fulfillment is the important word, and the whole Quest is going towards your soul level fulfillment. And this is why I call this soul level fulfillment, because it's a fulfillment on a soul level. Yeah. So what I want to do now is to guide you through a soul searching meditation so you can identify with what it is that you'd like to manifest. It could be something that you just thought of, but we're going to go deeper into your soul to really find out is that really what you need right now? And then we're going to go about it. Okay. Are you ready to go? Let's start. So close your eyes if you would; take a deep breath, and then visualize you have light roots coming out of both your feet and the space between the legs, your perineum, going all the way down through the layers of the planet, into the heart of the planet. Visualize a quartz crystal there, and anchor your roots into that quartz crystal. Beautiful. Then start breathing out, and breathe out into the roots, all the way down to the crystal. Letting go of used-up energy out of your body, and breathe in the answer from the earth, fresh life force energy. Do that a few times in your own rhythm. Every inhalation brings you fresh energy. Every exhalation releases old energy. Beautiful. One more breath. Good. Then focus on your crown chakra. Visualize a light rod going up through the dimensions and timelines all the way up to source of our creation, of God, however you want to call it. Then breathe out to source like a whale spouts out, breathing out, up to source. And in from there, the answer of fresh life force energy. Again here, you're going to breathe out used-up energy to source, and you breathe in fresh energy. Do that in your own rhythm. The quality is slightly different here. You're letting go of false beliefs, anything that hinders your understanding, your guidance. One more breath. Beautiful. And then visualize or allow or intend-either one is as good as the other-to let that flow of breath come into you, from both directions all the way into your heart. So you're now breathing into your heart from above and below and out of your heart to above and below. Every inhalation recharges; every exhalation releases energy. Continue in your own rhythm. One more breath. The quality here that you just recharged with is unconditional love. And you cleared your heart from anything that hinders unconditional love. Now you're cleansed; you're energized. Now draw your breath up from the lower spine all the way up to your third eye, and keep your attention on the third eye. The eyes are closed, but it seems as if they're looking out of your forehead, so gently up. The tongue is on the roof of the mouth. Your spine is upright, and you hold your attention on your third eye, asking the question to your higher self, "What is the next best wish for me to manifest right now?" And allow the first thought to come, the first impression. Receive that. Allow that, and if it's a really big wish, ask for a smaller one for today. If you don't know what it is, ask your higher self to bring that information to you in your sleep so you'll remember it when you wake up tomorrow morning. Beautiful. Then take one more breath, wiggle your hands and feet, and open your eyes. Good. Anytime you need a deeper insight and you don't really have time to go up to the higher self or you don't know how to do that yet, you can use this short meditation and just get deeper into your soul and get an answer. Yeah. Like I mentioned, imagining, intending, or allowing are equivalent. So you don't need to be good at imagining or seeing things in your mind for this to work for any meditation I'm going to teach you. And also you can ask for the answer to come either in your dream or right when you wake up or intuitively throughout the day that it just pops in. Yeah. Good. Amazing work today. Please continue practicing how to gain, maintain, and improve your energy. And I'll see you in the next lesson. Aloha.

====================

LESSON 5 – Activate Your Soul Magnet and Manifest With Effortless Alignment and Vibration
--------------------
<v ->Welcome back.</v> Welcome back. Wonderful. Now you've done a soul searching meditation where we identified what you would like to manifest. Let's go and manifest it now. Yeah. Remember, people think that they need to visualize long enough in order to try to land things into their laps. And the missing piece is actually that you need to magnetically attract it to you. Yeah. You need to become a magnet to your manifestation. Okay. What is a magnet? Well, think of your body as an electromagnetic field. Your body is made out of electric parts and magnetic parts, and we just need to learn how to use both. Yeah. The electric part of your body is really how you wish for something. Electricity is an energy that goes out. It's a male energy that goes out and that opens doors. Yeah. So if you make a wish to the universe, which is what we did earlier in the meditation, you're literally opening doors and now the doors is open. So people make the mistake that they keep wishing and wishing and wishing over and over, and they think they need to wish more often so that it finally comes to them or that they need to push more for that to come. Nothing could be more wrong because once you've opened the door to what you want, right, instead of pushing in that direction with your solar plexus energy-so that which is an actual solar plexus energy that goes out of this area here-you need to turn and become magnetic to the very thing you ask for. So the magnetic energy will draw into your system what is in that room that you opened the door for. Okay. So right now is where you can learn exactly what to do more often and what to do only once. Yeah. And you probably have guessed it already as what I've just shared: the wish you only do once. Think of it like ordering something on Amazon. Yeah. You have a package coming from Amazon. So how do you do that? You call or you order on Amazon. Yeah. That order is making the wish. You don't continue to tell them you want it, you want it, you want it. Right? Because you would actually order more and more and more and more. And you'll probably, you know, get your bank account all overdrawn and cause some problems. Right? So you only wish once, and then you expect it to come. So that's that wish energy. Yeah. Now, what you do more often is you need to be home often so that when the package arrives, you're actually home. Yeah. And what does being home mean? Well, being home means you're magnetically attracting your thing to you. Yeah. Home in this case is your vibrational address. And so your vibrational address is you need to be home with where your wish is. What I explained earlier, in the earlier lesson, was you know, you're thinking, you're feeling, you're acting upon your wish. Then you have the soul magnet, which we're going to do today, by the way. Woo woo! Soul Magnet Day finally. Yeah. So we're going to do the soul magnet. So you have these things that help you attract the thing into your life. Now that creates your vibrational address so that your vibration, like the law of resonance states with the violin. Remember the violin example? It states that you are only attracting into your system what you're vibrating at. Okay, good. That's where your focus is. Yeah. So your attention and your energy is vibrating at that level of your wish. And that is where the soul magnet comes in handy. Because the soul magnet that we're going to do right now will help you to be also vibrating at that level when you're not doing the three keys of manifestation, when you're not thinking, feeling, and acting upon your wish, when you're doing other stuff. Yeah. So it creates a magnet that is present within your system at all times. And I'll show you how you can actually activate the soul magnet on a regular basis. That's what you need to do often. So the things you need to do often is the soul magnet, and being home is what gets created through the soul magnet. Okay. Here's where the soul magnet comes in handy. And now I'm going to explain to you how we're going to create the soul magnet. This is very exciting 'cause it is really a very powerful tool. It's going to change your life. It's going to change your whole way of how you attract things into your life. And by the way, you know, since I've been doing the soul magnet now, since I told you this story in Hawaii, I have actually come into this experience where I find myself on the jet stream of the higher self, and many of my clients are on that jet stream as well. And how manifestation starts to work, once you've done this a while, is all you need to do is think of something, even just on the side, and it already shows up in your life. It is total magic. And we start right here. Okay, good. So I'm going to guide you into a meditation. We need to do this in a meditative state. And what I mean by meditative state is I need you to be a hundred percent focused. Meditation is really another word for focus, having single-minded focus. Yeah. And there's lots of meditations out there, but I'm going to guide you into this one. And what we're doing is you are thinking of the thing you want to manifest right now, and then you can of course amp that up throughout the next weeks and months to come, and you'll make those wishes bigger and bigger. But right now, we're starting with one wish. You think of that, and then I'm going to guide you into an experience of you feeling that you already have it. Yeah. Where we're going to think that you already have it, and we feel that you already have it. So we're using those two aspects via this visualization that we're going to do. And if you're not good at visualizing, remember, you can just intend or allow that to happen. Some people, especially male, they like to just intend it. You know, "I'm intending that this is happening." Boom. It's very quick. So you don't have to visualize, but I'll use the word visualizing, and you can then replace it to what your tool is. Okay. So I'm going to guide you into this visualization where you see yourself already having that experience, or feel yourself having that experience. And then we're going to amp that up. We're going to go to 300%. Because in order for you to manifest a hundred percent of your wish, you need to create it at a 300% level because of all the counter manifestations that happen, you know, throughout your day when you say, "Oh, I didn't have that." Or other people tell you, "You'll never get it." You know? Or when you think you're lacking something. That's all counter manifesting. We're going to go to 300% so that you actually land a hundred percent of your wish in your lap. Okay. Good. And I want that 300% to be felt at such a deep level that you're like really in it. So the more, more attention you can give me right now for this soul magnet, the better. Yeah. The better for you. And then as we're in that high state of 300% of what you're wishing for, I'm going to ask you to either see a color or a symbol, and you just let that come to you just naturally. Yeah. It's just no stress. You just, "Okay, what, what would be a color that represents that?" Or "What would be a symbol that represents it?" Or picture, you know, an image I could think of. And then you let that come to you. That's going to be what we call your soul magnet because you're going to use that. You're going to use the soul magnet when you come out of meditation. It's basically your connection to that high vibrational state of resonance with your wish. Yeah. And so then you come out, and you can create your soul magnet-whatever you saw. It could be just a color, or it could be a symbol or both. You're just going to either draw it or print it out, find it online or ask AI to do it for you. Yeah. And then you're going to hang up that soul magnet, that picture of that soul magnet in your home at strategic places where your eyes naturally fall throughout the day. Why is that? What do you think? Remember, we're using the soul magnet to counterbalance our antimanifestations that we do when we're not conscious. Yeah. So that is a subconscious programming. Yeah. That's when your subconsciousness continues to create this electromagnetic field that resonates with your manifestation. Yeah. And so that resonance will draw your manifestation to you quicker and quicker and quicker. It basically cuts the time delay down. Yeah. And then you got it. So let me recap. You wish for it. So it's like ordering it, yeah, on Amazon. And with that vibrational match that you're creating through the soul magnet, you're also home to receive the package. Yeah. And you're going to accelerate the time between ordering and receiving and making that come to you quicker the more you look at the soul magnet and the more you use it. How do you use it? Either you just glance over it- it's good to just have it somewhere where your eyes naturally fall. That goes directly into the subconsciousness. Advertisements use that all the time. Have you noticed how advertisements sometimes just quickly blink into the movie, and then they're gone again? That is a subconscious programming. It's very powerful because it bypasses what's called the hypothalamus, which is the gateway to your consciousness. We have a gate in our brain that allows some things to come into our consciousness- therefore we're aware of it- and other things, everything else, by the way, a hundred percent of everything we experience, see, feel, have going on in our lives, goes into the subconsciousness. And we don't become aware of it because the hypothalamus, the gateway of the brain, doesn't let it into consciousness. Yeah. So if you are using that, that you glance over it often, you have it at several places, you're actually bypassing the hypothalamus, and you're programming your subconsciousness. Okay. You also want to use it consciously. And that's when you look at it. So let's say you have it across from your sofa where you're sitting often or your desk or on your screensaver or in your car, on your dashboard, places that you look often. When you also have a moment of time, like in the car-you're in the traffic jam; you look at it- or on the sofa, and then you actually give it energy. You look at it; you feel how you felt in this meditation that we're going to do right now, or how you"ll feel when you have it. And you just give it energy. That again amplifies the soul magnet. So your energy work for today is to listen to the soul magnet meditation and actually do it. So spend time in silence. When you do that, make sure you're undisturbed. This is superimportant, that you actually have undivided attention for that. Yeah. And that you can go into that feeling and you really go with it. So don't just listen to it. Really do it. And create your own soul magnet. Then you can hang up the soul magnet everywhere. And we're going to go into the next step in the next lesson. Yeah. Amazing work today. I'm so excited for you. This is the breakthrough moment now. We're literally thriving already. This is, you are already soaring, and I can't wait for you to bring that manifestation into your life. Good. Please continue practicing how to gain, maintain, and improve your energy. This is going to be your main practice that you're going to do, hopefully for the rest of your life. But don't tell your brain that. Tell your brain only today. Okay. And you'll see how your life improves. And I'll see you in the next lesson. I love you. Thank you for being here with me. Aloha.

====================

LESSON 5 – The Soul Magnet Meditation

- Okay, let's do the soul magnet meditation and create your soul magnet right now. Make yourself comfortable. Make sure that you're undisturbed. You can be laying down or sitting up. When you sit up, make sure your spine is upright, and just take a few breaths with me. Arriving more and more in this very moment, right here, right now, becoming very present with yourself. Watch the breath go into your nose, out your nose. Notice how when the breath comes in, it is colder than when it goes out. Notice the surface on which you are sitting or laying. And then start grounding yourself. You already know how that goes. Breathing down through your roots that are coming out of both your feet and your perineum, and they're going down into the heart of the planet. And as you send those three light roots all the way down from your feet and the space between your legs, you anchor yourself in a crystal in the heart of the planet. This is an important first step for every meditation. I recommend you do that every day and in every meditation. And now start breathing into your roots from the earth and out of your roots down to the earth. Every time you breathe out, you let go of used-up energy. Every time you breathe in, you bring in fresh life- force energy into your body and also in your aura. Just do three more breaths like that. Very good. And now think of your wish, the wish you had in mind. See yourself already being there, having it. How do you feel having that wish fulfilled? Make it real for yourself. See yourself at this space where you have that wish fulfilled. Notice your surroundings. Imagine how other people respond to you, now that you have that. Just see yourself happy with this wish fulfilled. Now we're going to amplify that wish. We're going to amplify it three times to 300%. First, we're going to double it. Take a deep breath, and as you breathe out, double it, double as happy, double as fulfilled, double as fun. Whatever it is, double that emotion. How do you feel now? Now we're going to triple it. I'm going to count till three. We'll triple it. 1, 2, 3. Breathe in. Out. Triple. Very good. You have more than enough. You have enough to give from an overflow. Just let it. How does that feel? Good. Now, feeling yourself in that different level of your wish fulfilled. Allow a color to come. What color does that look like? Or it could also be a symbol to appear that symbolizes you're at that level. Allow the first one to come to your mind or heart. Remember that. And now we're going to say, "I am willing." You can follow my voice. "I'm willing to have all obstacles removed that are hindering me from being there. Please remove them with ease and grace." See yourself letting go of any restrictions you may have of this wish being fulfilled. Whether you know them or not, they're just leaving you right now. "I now ask for support. I'm asking for the best support I could possibly get for this wish to come into my life as fast as possible, accompanied with ease and grace. And so it is. And so it is. And so it is." Wiggle your hands and feet, and open your eyes. Now you have your soul magnet; you have a symbol, whatever it is, and you just place that symbol in strategic places and let it work for you. And anytime you look at it, consciously use the feeling that you just had. If you had a hard time creating a real elated feeling, just repeat this meditation until you get to it. Yeah. And you can use this little meditation for every wish coming up into your future. Good job.

====================

LESSON 6 – Amplify Your Attraction by Using the Soul Magnet to Accelerate Manifestation
--------------------
<v ->Congratulations.</v> Woo-hoo. We have reached midpoint of your Quest, and you have done so much. You've mastered your energy; you understand how to manifest things in your life. You have even created a soul magnet for yourself. I'm very proud of you. Okay, now what are we going to do? Now we're going to find out how you can practically use these tools so they actually work in your, like, daily life. You know, I love to call this practical spirituality because really, only when it hits the ground, when you're actually literally using these tools so everything in your life is enhanced, that's when you know it's working. 'Cause you are a busy person with a busy life, right? We're not just theoretically talking about this. We want you to be able to use these tools in your daily life in order to enhance everything you do. In order to do that, I'm going to show you how to exactly use the soul magnet in your life. And I'm going to show you some tricks and tips of what you can do in order to enhance your manifestation if you want to call something really big into your life, yeah. This is the differentiating factor between other people who are trying to manifest and you who are actually landing the manifestation in your lap. Yeah. Okay, let's go. The first thing that I want you to remember is that when you created the soul magnet, that is an energy tool. Yeah. This is especially true if you went deep in that meditation. Your soul magnet could be considered a magical tool because it literally accelerates time for you, the time between your wishing and your receiving. Make sure you have several copies of your soul magnet available, and go ahead and hang them up in your home, like I shared in the earlier lesson. Yeah, hang them up at strategic points where you see them, and anytime you see them, just give it a moment of energy. Just feel that feeling again that we had when we did the meditation. And you know, instill those thoughts within you. And just, just give a moment as if you are remembering a vacation you had. You know, do you sometimes close your eyes and you see yourself at that beach or on that boat or on that mountain on your vacation, right? And you just bring those energies back into your day in that moment. That's what you do with the soul magnet. You literally bring these energies back from our meditation when we did it into the moment. And the more you do that, the more you'll become the vibrational match for your wish. Vibrational match for your wish makes instant manifestation. And like I said before, and I just want to bring this up one more time, you are literally going, if you continue on this path, into the direction where you have instant manifestation. Yeah. This is when people think of something, and it shows up. This is when you don't even need to go through the process of literally manifesting again- unless it's something big outside of your paradigm- and it just comes to you. Yeah. And why is that? Why is it possible that you get onto that jet stream of the higher self, as I call this, where you know, in a jet stream you just have extra speed, and you need less energy, and you get to your goals quicker. Why is that? I want to go into that a little bit here with you so you understand it because understanding is actually power, and I want to empower you. And then I want to help you go into the really high manifestations, into things that are outside of your paradigm, and show you how to do that before we'll go on into the third part where we're going to work with your higher self, and we're literally helping you to exactly determine what you need to wish for. And that's when you're going to employ what we're learning here on a high level. You're ready? Yeah. I can't wait for you to do this. 'Cause I've seen so many people who've had unbelievable results. I see miracles every day. I work with clients since 20 years, and when people come to me and they actually do the course and they literally have experiences that they could never dream of, they go outside of the best thing they could possibly imagine. It's better than that. And I see it every day. So you're going to be one of those, right? And then if you want to work more with me, then you can come; we can do personal work. But right now you're at the perfect level where your quality of your vibration will determine your experience and your results. Now what does that really mean? A vibration can be measured, and the quality of the vibration gets determined by how you feel about something. That's why your feelings are so important. That's why I say you need to look at the soul magnet at times and really instill that feeling because that brings you up to that vibration. Yeah. We can also call it a heart and mind coherence because you are thinking about the soul magnet, and then you're feeling how you feel when it is fulfilled. And that creates a heart and mind coherence. Heart and mind coherence creates your vibration, and your vibration can be measured. And I mentioned in the first part about the frequency levels, and that's the same, like vibration and frequency is interchangeable here right now for me. And so when your frequency is high, then your vibration is high. And when your vibration is high, you are attracting more good into your life. So right now you have a high vibration, and that high vibration was created by you feeling positive about what you're manifesting, I hope. Yeah. And this creates an energy vortex around you. Feed that energy vortex. You need to use the soul magnet a lot. The more you use it, the faster your manifestation comes. And that's what feeds this energy vortex. Yeah, your energy vortex is basically the resonance that the violin had when it was playing on A. You're going to be playing on A now, okay? And when you're playing on A, you are vibrating at the level of your wish fulfilled. The universe goes in resonance with you. That's the tuning fork, goes in resonance with you, the world around you, and brings everything to you magnetically that matches that vibration. And so now you are attracting the people you need in order for that wish to be fulfilled, the information you need. You all of a sudden get a phone call, and somebody says do this; do that. You know, for example, I was looking for a blueprint and my husband said, "I need a blueprint. I need you to create a blueprint." And I needed a blueprint. What is it called? A blueprint template. Yeah. So all I did is, on the side- it wasn't even a conscious thought-on the side, I'm thinking, "I wish I had a blueprint." And I go on about my day. The next thing you know I open my computer. I kid you not. And there comes this ad: "Free blueprints." I clicked on it, had my blueprint. This is what happens. You know, I, I made this wish, "Oh, I wish somebody would bring me a Earl Gray tea right now," just a few minutes before; we were in the break. And I'm sitting there, and I'm feeling a little bit tired, and I'm like, "I wish somebody would bring me an Earl Gray tea right now." I can't move. I'm working with somebody right now. The door opens; the Earl Grey tea shows up. So this is the level that you're going to right now. You're coming with me? We're going together? Awesome. From now on, everything you want is at your fingertips. Nothing is impossible. It really isn't because you have that missing link that a lot of people don't have. Other than that, you know, I've worked with a lot of people who say, "I manifest. I'm manifesting. I'm working with this law of abundance, and I want to track more abundance. And it's not coming." It will come now. I do want to remind you about the delay, and that there can be a delay. And depending on how much resistance you have, you may need some energy work to have that resistance removed because it can add to the delay, but it nevertheless will come. That is guaranteed. Just remember, manifestation works in four easy steps. Let me recap for you. First- we've been through this. You got this?-Yes. You make the wish. Two, yes; think, feel, and take actions toward your wish. Those are the three keys. Yeah, it's basically you embodying the wish. Then three, you create the soul magnet that helps you become a vibrational match with your wish and attract it into your life. And that's it. And then you continue that soul magnet often throughout the day by just looking at it or having your subconsciousness see it. And you continue to take actions towards your wish, feeling, thinking, and doing it. And it lands in your lap quickly. You want to have some examples? How does that look practically? My son, Naiya De, wanted a little Chihuahua. And he's been talking about a Chihuahua for maybe a few weeks. And it's like, "I want a Chihuahua! I want a Chihuahua!" And you know these little Chihuahuas, right? They're tiny. And he was just in love with them. Now the problem was when he tells me he wants a Chihuahua, what I see is we have a big Airedale; an Airedale Terrier is like a huge dog. And they're very rambunctious; they're very fit; they're very energetic. They're loving and friendly, but they're not unscary. They're a little, they can be scary because they're so big and so alive, right? They're definitely going to be scary for that little Chihuahua 'cause Chihuahuas are known to be scared easily, and they bark a lot, and all of that. So I'm thinking that does not work. So I go to my higher self, "What can we do?" And got the message. Simple. I could have come up with it myself. Just get a Chihuahua Terrier mix. Because if the Chihuahua has a little bit of Terrier in it, it'll be more resilient, and it'll want to play. Those tiny little Terriers? They're also just as the big terrier; they're the same. They're like, you know, rocking the world. So here, in my mind, I'm realizing the best solution would be a Chihuahua Terrier mix. I'm not even making a wish. I'm not even going into a meditation, but I sort of had that idea. So next thing you know, I was sitting on the sofa with my dear friend Patricia. And this dog jumps on Naiya De's lap, lays down, closes his eyes, lays down, acts as if he's completely sound asleep, never to be disturbed again. And Naiya De is just petting the dog, like, what kind of dog is this? And the kids come running in and say, "Oh my God, he's laying on his lap like he did with his owner. Look at that!" And turns out it's a Chihuahua Terrier mix. And you guessed it, the owner had to leave; they left for Mexico, and they left a little dog with Patricia, and she needed to find a home. So within two weeks, we had our Chihuahua Terrier mix. Same thing happened for our horse. He wanted a Icelandic. And within two weeks we had an Icelandic- I'm going to make this short; I'm not going to make a big story about it because we don't have a lot of time, but the same situation. He's on such a high vibration. I'm on that high vibration through practice. And so whenever something comes up as a wish, the universe just conspires to bring it to us. So he wanted an Icelandic, and I looked in the newspaper, and I saw it's $10,000 to buy an Icelandic on Hawaii. So I'm like, "Okay, universe, bring it to us in a different form." Just a short amount of time later, somebody drives my horse from one place to the other and says, "Hey, I'm bringing another horse that goes to the sanctuary." Like, "What is it?" "It's an Icelandic." Like "What? Can you bring it to us? What's wrong with it?" "Well, it can't be ridden anymore because it has a back problem. And it's also not very good with people because it's very sensitive. It needs somebody who's telepathic." Guess what happened, right? The horse came to us. Naiya De, my son, is supertelepathic. He did this conversation with the horse. He became supercomfortable with it. I did healing work; within three weeks, the horse was healed, could be ridden, and we have a free Icelandic. So what could you do if you did not have any limits? And if you would just, whenever something comes up that you would like, go higher; go to the next level. Say, "Okay, wait a minute; let me manifest higher than what I can think right now." If I want a Chihuahua, and I realize it doesn't work, well, what's the next high thing that still works with my wish? If you want, you know, something into your life, let's say you, you have an arm missing, and you need a really good prothesis. You know, I'm just making a little bit more stronger example. And people are, doctors are telling you "There's no such prothesis out there; you can't afford it. It isn't, it doesn't exist." Whatever it is, you're just going to go, "Yeah, but, ah, but yes it is. And better than that, I'm going to do the next level. I'm going to get a an AI thing, you know, that does everything for me, just with my mind," right? And then you attract the money for that, and you're like, "Okay, if I want that, if I want this prothesis, and it costs like a hundred thousand dollars, and I have maybe five, I'm supposed to have it, because I need it, because it makes me give more work to, more good service to the world, right? It makes me a better person." Then you call it in. And you call in that money; you call in whatever it is. And for that, yes, for big stuff, you'll do the real manifestation. For little stuff, you don't need to, if you've done enough manifestation that got you onto the jet stream, and especially if you're working with your higher self, which we're going to go into next. I hope I made this clear, and this is how it works. The important part you have noticed here, other than the steps, is that you want to avoid energy distractions. Because if you think, "Oh, it's going to be hard; we're never going to get it," your energy is focusing on what you don't want instead of what you do want. And that creates a time delay. Yeah. If your car breaks down, we might be tempted to tell ourselves, "Now we have to get a cheaper car because we don't have the money to repair it or to buy a new one." Do not do that. Just say, "Okay, my car broke down; I'm going to manifest a better one." Always go to the next better step. Yeah, never settle. You can manifest anything and everything you would ever want with these steps. Yeah. It doesn't depend on you having the means, money, resources, nothing. It only depends whether you can keep the focus long enough and use the tools. The tools are wishing, becoming it. Those are the three manifestation keys. Creating a soul magnet and then using the soul magnet as often as you can. If you can do that, and these steps are supersimple, then you'll get it no matter what your circumstances are. Okay, I want to leave you with one quick example. One of my clients came to me, and he was working for an airline for a long time. He's working for 19 years. He came to me with a foot problem, and he thought that's all he really needed, but his soul was calling him to do much more. He had actually come to Hawaii for a sabbatical to really change something in his life. And as we started working on his foot, I introduced him to these principles of manifestation and literally working with energy. And he was so disciplined, even though he had not believed in that before, he now decided he's just going to try it and see if he gets the results. So he ended up manifesting a complete career that is completely soul aligned. What he had done before was a lucrative career, but all other aspects of his life, social life, personal life, everything was just neglected. But instead he created a 12-category smart life, you would say in Lifebook. And what he did is he found the perfect profession, the perfect company to fulfill his soul mission. And he is now creating millions of dollars and creating a company that's going to have billions. So all of that is possible. Do you think he thought it was possible when he came with his foot problem? Not at all. But he wasn't closed to the possibility of more good than he could imagine. So just open yourself up to more good than you could ever imagine. And I'm going to end with my favorite affirmation from one of my favorite teachers, Michael Beckwith. And if you want to do it with me, we can do it together. "I'm open and receptive to more good than I've ever experienced, manifested, or wished for in my life." Bring it on. Hoo. Woohoo. You can do it. So for your energy work today, I want you to simply practice creating an energy vortex by using your soul magnet. Yeah. Remember, the more you use your soul magnet, the faster you'll be able to see the results. Amazing work today. Good luck, and I'll see you in the next lesson. Aloha.

LESSON 7 – Empower Your Life by Reprogramming Your Subconscious Mind
--------------------
<v ->Welcome back to our Quest.</v> I'm just so happy we're here together, and if you've been following the exercises from the beginning of the Quest and building the habits that keep you energetically aligned with your soul's desire, you are now ready to absolutely have your desires land in your lap. Yeah. Sometimes though, there may be things that you're attracting that are either too far out of your reach, and you have not been able to manifest that yet. For some people, it's their first love of their lives or an actual functioning relationship. For others, it may be a real overflow in wealth, where they've always more than enough money, or it could be a complete career shift. Whatever it is for you, things that are outside of your current paradigm, they may need a little bit of extra attention and extra energy. Yeah. Why is that? Well, I asked you to start with something simple, right? And as you are working with something simple, you're basically getting your muscles trained to actually doing manifestation the right way. And the more you do that, the more good stuff will come to you, the more confidence you get and the higher you can go with your goals. Yeah. Now, when it comes to something that's totally outside of our paradigm, though, there is an extra inhibitor, and that's our ceiling. All of us have a ceiling, and when we reach that ceiling, then we sort of stop and we're like, "Okay, I'm at a good place now. I don't know where to go next." And that's usually when you need extra help. You can come for extra help, but you can also try this first. I'm going to give you some tips and tricks of how you can amplify your manifestation in order to get them anyway. Okay? We are going to focus on the soul magnet and how to use the soul magnet in an amplified way, where you want to create more input to your subconscious mind. Your subconscious mind is actually active about 80% of the time whereas your conscious mind is only active about 20% of the time. So you have 80% here and 20% here. Conscious activities are things where you're consciously thinking about what you're doing. So for example, if you're listening to something or somebody consciously, that's conscious activity, but if I'm working with my hands right now, that's subconscious; I'm not thinking, "Oh, move the hand up; move the hand down." No, it's subconscious. If you're walking, subconscious; your feet are doing whatever they need to be doing because consciously you are just thinking of where you want to go, right? Subconsciously, you're getting there. A lot of activities are subconscious. It's unbelievable really, when you think about it. You drive subconsciously, often; you know, the shifting, whatever you do is all subconscious, and therefore, if you think about it, your subconsciousness really controls your life. Those 80%, they control your life. The 20% is focused attention. So it has a little bit more weight than subconscious nonattention. But the overall quantity trumps everything here. So if you can actually have access to your subconscious mind and program your subconscious mind onto what you want, you'll have a big advantage. And for most people, the subconsciousness will be vibrating at a low level where we've experienced difficulties in the past, and especially, it'll be vibrating on what you've already experienced. That's a given because the subconsciousness is like a computer that takes in everything unfiltered and just stores it. It doesn't create new content. So what's in the subconscious mind is literally what you've experienced in the past. If you want to move beyond your current paradigm, you have to overcome your subconsciousness because consciously you can allow that or attract a new paradigm, but your subconscious will pull you back like a rubber band. Okay? There's another factor, and that comes in here, and that is your consciousness can sometimes not perceive what you will go into in the future because you haven't experienced it yet. It's just like the chicken in the egg. You know, the egg gets too small for the chicken, and the chicken grows and grows and grows, and what can it wish for? It wishes for a bigger egg, right? "Please bring me a bigger egg." Little does it know that there's a whole world out there, and that instinct that makes it peck through the egg shell and actually make it born, be born into this world, that's what takes it to a next paradigm. So your next paradigm is outside of your egg. Yeah. And in order to be born into that next paradigm, you need to destroy your current world to a degree, right? That's why one of my favorite quotes from Herman Hesse, he says, in order to be born into your next reality, you need to destroy your current reality. So what does that mean? It means you need to be able to perceive and conceive of things that are outside of your conscious perception and your conscious possibilities. This we're going to do in part three with your higher self. What we're going to do right now is this. We're going to work with your subconsciousness, and we're going to help your subconsciousness- that's 80% of power in your life- to bring it up to this level of your consciousness. So if your subconsciousness is at the same level, working towards the same goals, you have it; you have a hundred percent of attraction factors, okay? Now, how do you do that? It's actually not that difficult. You need to create more input to your subconscious mind, because remember, the subconscious mind works with input. Yeah. So you want to create things that go into your subconsciousness while you're doing your normal life, things that are training and programming your subconsciousness to actually attract what you want. The advertisements make use of that, and they're really, really good at that because subconsciousness is trained the best when we are not conscious. Huh? Who would've thought that? Right? So when we are actually focusing on something right now- let's say I'm tying my shoes, you know, or I'm doing something you know, with my dress, or I'm making food, or I'm eating dinner with someone, and I'm talking with them; that's when my subconscious mind is completely open and absorbing everything like a sponge. So you can make use of that, and I want to warn you to not use it in the wrong way. If you have the TV going during that time, the news, anything that's negative, it's going to train your brain that way, and it's going to train your subconsciousness. So, especially when it comes to things that are actually happening on the side, make sure you turn them off, and you have only things happening that are positive, which is what we're going to do right now. I'm going to help you to train your subconsciousness in a positive way. Let's start with the easiest one. The easiest way to train your subconsciousness is when you're asleep at night. It doesn't take time; it doesn't take energy. It's a really cool tool. It also works when you are doing something else, and you are listening to something subliminally, or you see something on the side. That's also training for your subconsciousness. Two other places where subconscious is trained really well is the first moment that you wake up in the morning and the first moment when you're just about to fall asleep. So, if you make use of these times in a strategic way to fill your subconsciousness with the thoughts you want to instill, which are thoughts about your manifestation, what you want in life instead of what you don't want, then you use those times. I'm going to give you an example. So what could you do at night? Well, when you go to bed, you have a last thought, right? Would you agree? Everybody has a last thought before they go to bed. Everybody does. That last thought actually determines where you spend the whole night. Can you imagine? Once I figured that out, I thought, "Wow, that is powerful. If I just make sure I'm going to have one last thought that is aligned with what I'm manifesting, then I'm manifesting for eight hours." Time-wise, that's a huge chunk. You're filling your subconscious with what you want for eight hours. Subconsciousness works with repetition, so this is a huge plus. Yeah. If I were to ask you to focus on something for eight hours during the day, you wouldn't be able to do it, right? So think about your last thought, and make sure your last thought is about you having what you're envisioning. That simple, that gives you eight hours. Then you can take it higher. Again, if it's something you want to really manifest that's outside of your league, create an audio or use an audio from the internet, an audio that tells you that you can have what you think; it tells you positive affirmations. It says, you know, "I am rich; I'm wealthy;" "I'm healthy; I'm well;" "I'm loved;" whatever it is. I love Louise Hay's work. You can use Louise Hay on the internet. You can make your own audio, and that's actually very powerful. You can just record your voice on your iPhone, and you tell yourself all the good stuff that you're experiencing. Make sure, very important, make sure to speak in the present tense. You say, "I am wealthy; I am healthy. I am feeling so aligned with my soul purpose. I love what I have right now in my life." For example, you want to envision a beautiful house on the ocean with the perfect relationship and with your career being at its peak, your health being vital. You know that's a big wish, right? So here's how this could sound. "I love my life. I'm so happy when I touch the furniture in my beautiful ocean house. This mansion, if I look at it, I just think it's a dream, and I get to live in it. I love the audio system. I love the music that it plays throughout the house. I love the plants everywhere. When I touch the water in the pool, it is fresh, clean, and clear. When I sit in the jacuzzi in the evening for sunset, I just am so filled with joy and gratitude. I hold my husband by the hand, and we look into each other's eyes, and we're like, 'Oh my God, how could we be in this amazing place?' We love each other. We appreciate each other. My son is running around; my daughter is playing with her cats. We have beautiful dogs. We're just in heaven, and really, heaven and earth come together in our lives. My career is at its peak. I love my clients. I love making beautiful experiences for clients and helping them get to their next level. I love the money that comes in from that and the wealth that we have that helps us to give more. I'm just in awe about my body. My body's well; my body's healthy; my body feels good. I'm vital, healthy and strong." You get the gist. Yeah. This is how you go. And so you can create this kind of audio for yourself and then play it at night, especially when you just fall asleep, and then play it again in the morning when you are about to wake up. Yeah, because those are very powerful times that your subconsciousness is programmed. You can also create a collage, and I highly recommend that. Anything, anything, anything, anything I've ever put on a collage has come true, believe it or not. I mean, one time I put a Tesla on a collage while I was already driving an electric vehicle, and I thought, "Ah, Tesla would be kind of fun." Put the Tesla on there. Within three months, I had a Tesla for free. You know, I mean, how is that possible? You know? So all of that happens. Totally amazing, you know? So you can just create a collage. You know how to create a collage. You just rip out stuff from your journals or print it or let AI create it. Put it on the collage, like I explained in our first part here with gratitude. Create the collage, and place it where your eyes first fall when you wake up and last when you go to bed. It'll program you. And if you want an even amplified version that invokes all aspects of you, your feelings, your thoughts, your subliminal consciousness, then create or have a video be created for you. It's called a mind movie. That's a collage sort of, that flowing like a video, where you see yourself in the current state that you're going to right now. Either one will work, from simple to more complicated, from easy to more complex, and you can choose which one. But remember, the secret to this is you're going to get your subconsciousness on board with your consciousness, and you do that while you are focusing consciously on something else or while you're sleeping, and you do it for a lot of time without it taking time away from your day. Okay? I hope that helped. I love you and thank you for being here with me for this manifestation piece. I can't wait to dive into the gold level with you. We're going to go to your higher self next, and it's going to be absolutely rocking your world. Now. We're taking the roof off. We're getting you out of your ceiling, and we're getting you into the next level that you can't even see yet. I'm so happy about that, looking very forward to that. I love you. Blessings. Aloha.

Part 3: The Higher Self Pathway: Elevate, Align, and Fulfill Your True Purpose

====================

LESSON 8 – Connect to Your Higher Self and Cultivate Intuitive Awareness Part #1
--------------------
<v ->Aloha and welcome back, beautiful soul.</v> Wow, you've made it so far. You've learned how to master your energy. You've learned the art of truly manifesting what your soul desires. You got that in your tool belt right now. Now I want you to get in touch with your higher self. This is the time. We upleveled you. Now we're going to take you all the way up. You with me? What is your higher self? That's a question that comes up first. The higher self is also another word for the soul, for example. And your higher self is that part of you that resides in the unseen world. In the invisible realm. It has access to the all-knowing field, which is the field that we're all connected with. This field is connecting everyone and everything in this universe, really. And it is also accessing everybody's information and connecting that information with everybody, which means if you have access to this universal field, you have access to all knowledge. You have access to an understanding of what's going to happen now, what's going to happen in the future, and what happened in the past. And this field is where your higher self resides. Yeah. And your higher self is the part of you that is everything that you are. It's your whole individualized expression. And a part of that individualized expression is here in a physical body, but not all of you. So when this physical body dies, you don't die. Right? Your true self continues. And if you believe in reincarnation, it can continue in another lifetime even. Yeah. And you don't need to believe in that in order for you to access your higher self. What you do need to believe in is that you have a higher self. Now, I like to explain the higher self from a different aspect as well. And that is a metaphysical aspect where we're going to talk about frequency. Okay? And I'm going to share with you the hierarchy from your higher self going up all the way to source that I call God. And if you don't like the word God, please replace it. Whenever I say God, you'll replace it with love, source, higher power, you know, whatever works for you. Because it's just a word that expresses that unifying omnipresence that is everywhere at all times. And it is a beneficial presence. Okay, good. And as I explained earlier when we were in the energy part of this Quest, your body is of course made of energy, right? And it's made of particles and space between the particles, but the fact that those particles are actually held together so they create a physical matter means that your body is vibrating in a sort of low vibration. Yeah. Good. Now let's go higher. Next higher step is your higher self. It's your consciousness and your consciousness that is watching the body, that is watching you having feelings. It's watching you having thoughts; it's watching you having experiences in the body. That's not the body, right? It is that higher experience of yourself that is already at the higher self level. So you experiencing your life, experiencing all the feelings, thoughts, and you know everything you have in life. That is the higher self level. On that higher self level, where we can also say, like I said earlier, the soul resides. You not only watch the body and experience the body; you also have access to everybody else's body and everybody else's experience and how they're related to each other. And therefore you have higher knowledge. And I'm going to share a little bit more about that higher knowledge later. Okay? But now I'm going up higher again. Vibrationally speaking, you are now coming to a level where a physical body cannot reside anymore, cannot connect anymore directly. That is the level of the angels and the ascended masters. Then you go up to the next level where it's actually the monodic level, it's called, where your whole soul cluster resides, your whole soul family. And then you go up to the higher realm where you have now higher light beings that are called the Seraphim. And then you get to God level. Yeah. That's the apnic level. Now, vibrationally speaking, your body vibrates around 25 to 500. And that is according to the work of David Hawkins. He measured the vibration. And if you remember, and this is kind of fun because now we're taking what we said in the earlier part of this Quest to the next level. So we're, we're really working on amping up on that. Yeah. So it's coming full circle. I love that. So David Hawkins shared with us that we have-25 is shame. Then we go 35 is anger. So those lower vibrations are negative emotions. If we go into the 200s, we're going into more positive changes, you know, positive direction. And that is, for example, hope. Yeah. Or it's also longing. It is a little bit higher. It's in the 200s. If we get all the way to the 300s, 350s, that's where gratitude resides, and that's where it becomes really positive, a hundred percent positive. From that level on, you are actually attracting all the positive experiences. And then you go to 500; that's unconditional love, 550, unconditional love level. Everything is just in real flow mode and for you and works in your favor. This is how far the body can go in vibration. And you'll have control over that. And I shared with you in the energy model how you control that. Yeah. In order to access your higher self, you need to be minimum at 350. So right now you're vibrating minimum at 350 all the way up to 550. Yeah. And this is what we wanted you to get at. So you can access your higher self. Now, the higher self, vibrationally speaking, comes all the way down to 500. So when you're at that 500 level, that's where you can meet your higher self. That is when your brain goes from survival mode, ego active, to higher consciousness, higher level of awareness. Okay? Hopefully you're following me. I'm bringing it in from different angles so it can land with you from different angles. And wherever you are at with your understanding of metaphysics or energy, you can get me. Yeah. Good. So now, vibrationally speaking again, our higher self can come down all the way to 500 and meet us. It can also go all the way up to the ascended master level and connect in that level. So God-or however you want to call this entity-vibration is so high that we cannot directly be in contact with it in a physical body. We can be in contact with it via our consciousness, via our thoughts. So don't get me wrong with that. You know, when Neale Donald Walsh says, "Communicate with God," yes, you can absolutely do that. But how you're doing it is you're letting it come in unconsciously or subconsciously, and then your intuition just, you know, makes sense of it. And that's how you communicate. What we're doing here is something different. We're communicating directly with the lowest institution that actually can access these higher realms. And that's your higher self. Yeah. And so when we're coming to God, if we were to directly experience God, we would completely dissolve. Our body could not be held together. The particles that are held together, vibrationally speaking, with love, that vibration is love that holds everything together is dissolving as soon as a really high vibration gets introduced. That's why we can't handle these high vibrations such as nuclear energies, because everything that's radioactive is so high in vibration that it dissolves matter. And that's why we get cancer from that. Or if we're really in an experience with that high vibration, we dissolve. Yeah, we die. Okay? This is where the higher self is so handy and so amazing. Vibrationally speaking, it's a bridge to God. So God is really high up, superhigh vibration, not physical; then come the Seraphim; then come, you know, the ascended masters, and then comes our higher self. And then come we. And when we connect with our higher self, we can access that whole realm because the higher self can go up really, really far, all the way to God. So it's your direct line to what I call God or higher consciousness. Okay? And the cool thing is, if we access our higher self consciously compared to accessing our higher self via our intuition, which is an unconscious way of accessing higher self, we get more accuracy. The accuracy is about 90% compared to about 60% with your intuition. Why is that? Well, if we're accessing our intuition, we basically allow that channel to work through us. And it comes in as a hunch, as sort of a sense of "This is right; this is wrong." Or it comes in via signs. Now there are a lot of other voices in that channel as well. It's like a radio signal that's not very clear. And sometimes you get it right, and sometimes you get a different radio signal that tells you something else. Yeah. And so in that channel, the information that's in there could also be from your ego, could be informed by what you want, what's important to you. And it could lead you astray, at least a 40%. So it's still better to access your intuition compared to having no intuition. Most of humanity actually doesn't live on intuition at all. And they are living only on their wisdom that comes through their mind. And that's only 10% accurate. Can you imagine? Most of humanity, it's actually 10% of wisdom. And that's how they live. The people that are accessing intuition- which you a hundred percent are; otherwise you wouldn't be on this Quest- are getting 60% of accuracy. Now you, from now on with having access to your higher self, you get 90% accuracy. Now, you may ask yourself that question, "Why 90, not a hundred?" I may hear you correctly here right now. Well, nothing in this world is a hundred percent. Nobody and nothing. So I don't want to claim that, right? Even the doctor, if they give you a diagnosis, that's not a hundred percent accurate either. Nothing is a hundred percent because everything is moving, and everything is changing all the time. Okay? But 90% accuracy is huge, and it leads you in the right direction, the fastest way, and the most effective way. And this is why I want you to access your higher self consciously. Okay, good. Now, why is it so important to access that higher self consciously? Well, number one, the higher self knows everything. It has access to that all-knowing field that I just explained. All beings on this planet, including the plants and the animals, are connected via this field and are affected by that field. And they're also affecting the field. Yeah. But there's another part to that. Not only do we have an effect on that field, we also can use the field in our favor. And that's why it's important. Yeah. So if the all-knowing field can inform you of the best steps to take in order to reach a certain goal, would you want to use it? You answer that question. Do you think you would have better results if you knew the outcome before you made a decision or took a certain step in your life? I'm assuming, of course you would, right? So for example, if you want to make a decision about where to move next, yeah, your brain can only make that decision according to what you've already experienced in your life. Because the brain is part of a computer that your system runs on. But that computer can only give you information about what has been put into the computer. It cannot give you information about your future, and, which I think is very important part, it cannot give you information about other people. Now, do you ever make a decision that only involves you and nobody else? It doesn't happen, right? So having information about the other people and how your move right now, if you're thinking of moving, affects your friends, your family, you know, your, your work crew is superimportant. And if you knew before you made that move, which place to go to would affect everything in a positive way, would affect your work, your family relationship, your health, your wealth, your happiness, your love, in a positive way, would you be able to make a better decision? Yes, you would. And would it save you time? Yes, it would. Would it save you troubles? It would. It saves you everything, right? So compared to you moving one place and finding out, "Oh, this was the perfect spot that I really envisioned, but really my child is not happy; he's not finding the friends," or "I'm not being fulfilled in my work. Now I'm moving somewhere else, I'm trying that out. Oh, I'm finding out this is not ideal because of this and that." So instead of doing trial and error, you can know the right course of action ahead of time. Now, that's why people get onto the jet stream of the higher self where everything works in their favor. They're faster; they're more effective, and they have less resources lost and get more resources in. It's like having a crystal ball that you can literally ask anything, and you can make the best decisions. You can make the best choices, which is something that's really important for us in this day and age, right? You can save, like I said, a lot of time and struggle. I compare this route to a highway. So you can take the highway from A to B, which will get you there really quickly and very smoothly compared to a gravel road with obstacles, which is a little bit harder to take. It'll be harder on the car or on your bicycle, on your horse or your shoes, whatever vehicle you take. And it'll take you longer. Does that sound familiar in your life? Have you noticed that in certain areas, it seems like you are on that gravel road, and you're literally hitting one obstacle after the next. You have to take time to remove the obstacle. You have to deviate in order to get to your place. And it's just not that easy. And in other areas it's like, "Oh my gosh, I'm flowing." It's like I think myself, then I'm already there. Sound familiar? So from now on, we're going to create these highways for you everywhere, and we're going to remove the obstacles along the way also. And not only that, the higher self can also give you that extra boost. It's as if you have a Tesla where you can just press the gas pedal in the moment when you need it, and you're like, boom. You know, quickly move it forward. So with the higher self, you get more ease, more effectiveness, and you get the extra boost that you need. So let's take the highway to your best life. You want to do this? Let's go.

====================

LESSON 9 – Connect to Your Higher Self and Cultivate Intuitive Awareness Part #2
--------------------
<v ->Before we literally hit the road,</v> there are a few things I want you to know about the higher self, and that is the higher self is also a faculty that can help you with steps. Not only can it give you information; it can literally help you to bring the resources and the people in your life that you need in order to advance, in order to uplevel. It's that boost that I just talked about. Yeah. I really want you to know that because when you know that, you gear yourself for that. You know, it can help you to open up your heart to have a better understanding of circumstances so you can actually see things from a higher perspective. I like to use that a lot when I have a difficulty with friends or with loved ones. I go up to the higher self, and I see their perspective from a higher perspective. And I can tell you, it is so eye-opening. It is unbelievable how when you have a different perspective, your information is more complete about the situation. You can actually feel such a heart opening, and you realize where you may have been wrong and what you need to do in order to set this situation right. And you realize where the other person's coming from, and there's compassion streaming in and understanding and solutions. It's a very powerful thing. A good example is, for you to understand this, think of yourself as trying to solve a puzzle without looking at the bigger picture. So you don't know exactly what you're doing; you just see all the puzzle pieces. Yeah. You can get confused, would you say? It can get overwhelming and especially because you may not know exactly what results you're aiming for, right? I've tried this many times. Raise your hand if you tried something like that. You know, you don't really know what you're doing; you're just going. A lot of people live their whole life like that, and they never get to that sense of fulfillment. Now, if you're trying to fit the puzzle pieces in and you don't see the bigger picture, you get frustrated. You don't know the goal you're going for, and it feels overwhelming. Yeah. But when you actually take a higher perspective and you see the whole pattern, then you can make a choice on which area of the puzzle you want to work on right now, which areas need to wait, and which puzzle pieces go into which area. That's very fulfilling. So you're basically in the power seat from that perspective. Yeah. Now, some people ask me, "Do I use my higher self already when I'm tuning into the right solutions?" And I'm going to tell them, "Absolutely you do. Your intuition is your higher self speaking to you." But as I mentioned earlier, it's speaking to you subconsciously. And I'm going to take you to that level where you are talking to your higher self consciously, and where you're getting that higher accuracy. And the important thing about accessing your higher self consciously, and in order to enable you to do that, is the frequency of your body. We need to get you to a 500. And here's why. Because down here, when you're in typical, let's say, beta mode of the brain, you are in stress mode and active mode. Then you're mostly locked in the lower part of the brain. And that lower part of the brain works from instincts, and it works from your ego a lot. And it's very, very active, but it's very, you know, self-centered to a large degree. Yeah. And when you go higher into the higher parts of the brain and you're working more from the frontal lobe, then you're already looking more at circumstances at other people. You have compassion; you're more in flow mode. Yeah. Now, that is still a place where your higher self cannot fully access you. You need to activate the pituitary gland and the pineal gland in your brain, which are the receivers and the senders of information to the higher rounds. So we want to get you from that part of the brain to that part of the brain, activating that fully. And then we want to activate the pineal gland and the pituitary gland so that you can receive and give information freely. Yeah. And also consciously, not just in your dream or via your intuition. That needs the body to be on minimum of 500 frequency. Now people will say, "Am I not always connected to source or God?" Yes you are. You're always connected to that source. But that frequency, when you are up on 500, that gives you an ability to be consciously in touch with that energy. Okay. And so we need to heighten your vibration in order to meet that. And frequency and vibration I'm using interchangeably here, even though it's not physically absolutely accurate. But if you can run with me with that, that would be great. Okay. So the higher self, you know, has to lower its vibration in order to meet your physical self that has to heighten its vibration. And this is what we're doing in this module. I'm going to really give you the tools that get you up on that high vibration. And these tools will be mainly coming in via meditation. So I'm guiding you a lot in meditations in this part of the Quest because those meditations bring that brain frequency up into the theta state from beta, which is stress mode to alpha, which is a relaxed and creative mode, can be also a meditative mode, to a theta mode, which is a deep meditation. So I want you to be able to stay awake with theta mode, which is a deep meditation, and eventually you'll actually live your life mostly on theta, believe it or not. Right? Now, your body may think "Oh, this is sleep mode. I'm going to sleep as soon as I guide you." But I'm going to tell you, the more you do this, the more your brain will get used to be staying awake on theta and sleeping on delta, which will give you better sleep. And you will then be able to receive information and give information on a regular basis. And eventually it even takes over into your daily life, which is what's happening for me and for my master students, for example, where you are ending up on what I call, and you've heard it many times, the jet stream of the higher self. That's when you're hitting that speed level where things come to you without you asking for them, where things work out. Solutions already get produced when the problem shows up before you even notice the problem. Right? And in order to get there, your brain needs to understand how to stay awake on theta, number one, which you're going to practice right now. And then it'll learn how to actually have a conscious awareness while on theta. So it starts to receive information from the higher self and communicate with the higher self. And that's not difficult. It's actually very fun to do. And you just need to know that this has to happen in a meditative state. Yeah. It cannot happen by you sitting around and just listening to me. Because as soon as you are aware of the body, and you're literally in body consciousness, you are actually going lower in vibration because the body, you know, has only certain vibrational abilities, yeah, that are lower 'cause of the physical matter. So what I want you to do is as we're heightening your frequency, you want to really get into that meditative state and get out of body consciousness, not think about your body, not feel your hands, your feet. So you want to be sitting in a place where you can comfortably sit upright or lay down and not fall asleep. I recommend sitting upright with your spine erect for at least half an hour. Yeah. And every part here, every lesson of this third part of this Quest will be sort of meditation heavy. I hope heavy doesn't sound bad to you right now. It'll be meditation informed. Yeah. The meditation will be the most important part. And that's training, training, training, training for your brain. And it's also very enjoyable. If you get into that, you'll end up getting into even bliss states. I've had a lot of people that have started these meditations, and they did 'em for the first time; they said, "This is the best experience of my life." In fact, Vishen did this meditation I'm going to do with you the first time. And he said this is one of the best meditations he's ever done. He loves it. So you're going to get to love this meditation also, I hope. I want to tell you a story. Just last week ago, I got a message from my master student, who's gone through one of my master one-on-one trainings, and he shared that his frequency is so high that he's now experiencing these blissful moments all the time. Jet stream, right? He can go through his life, and he can feel difficulties for other people or even go through difficulties himself, and he'll still be in a mode of gratitude, happiness, even joy. Okay? I loved it. I loved that message. Superawesome. You know, I know what he's talking about. But then about two to three days later, he texted me, and he shared that he got Covid. Now, Covid takes the frequency all the way down, boom. And you obviously feel miserable. And he called upon all the other tribe members of my membership, and we all send him energy. What we did is we helped him to raise his frequency in the midst of having Covid. That not only healed his body-in two days, by the way- yeah, but also got him on a high state of well-being again. Now why is that possible? You get it now. I know you do. It's about frequency; it's physics, quantum physics. So he was already living on that high frequency. So his body was used to going high. That's why it was really quick for him. And this will happen to your body too. You will establish yourself on such a high vibration that that'll become the norm. How cool is that? So it's easy for you to travel up and reach higher rms quickly, and you learn how to send high vibrations to others like we did for our tribe member. Once he told us that he healed this quickly, it created a ripple wave in the whole tribe where people were realizing, "Wow, we have a power as a group, and if we employ higher frequencies as a group, we can actually heal." Now, you can imagine what could get done if more and more people access their higher selves. Right? We could heal the whole planet with that. And you are right now embarking on this journey. You can heal yourself; you can heal people around you, and you can definitely uplift people around you. And you will notice that you have better results; you get quicker through difficulties and into solutions, and you will sail through those challenges seemingly effortlessly. And you'll reach your goals faster than anybody else. I want that for you. I'm really excited that we're doing this right now. Okay. Before we go up to the higher self, I want to explain a tiny little bit more about the higher self so you really can get the best experience up there. There are no questions for you up there. You're totally clear on what you're looking for and where I'm guiding you. And then we're going to dive into that experience together. Okay? So what you want to know about your higher self is that your higher self can appear to you in many ways. You may be able to see it visually; some see it as a ball of light, or some see it as a person, or some see the higher self as looking like themselves or an angel or a person they know or, you know, themselves in a older stage. So it can look many different ways. For some, it looks just like a ball of color or form of energy. It can also appear not visually but as a feeling, a sense where you're feeling calm or loved or nurtured. Or it can come as a physical feeling, like a shiver or a warmth or coolness, which I mentioned earlier. You don't really want to go for physical feelings too much. So that's the only thing that you may be feeling right there, but then also look for that more higher sense that's outside of the physical experience. Yeah. And for some people it does not come via a sense at all. That's harder to work with, but it is still coming to them. Yeah. How you work with that, if it doesn't come as a visual or as a feeling? You work with that with your intent. You intend to be with your higher self, and as soon as you intend it, your higher self will be with you because your intention directs your attention, and where your attention goes, the energy flows. Yeah. So you can trust that. And this is why we don't want to set our mind on how our higher self has to appear to us. We want to be open on how it actually shows up for us. What's interesting is that the majority of people actually don't see their higher self. They feel it. And trust that if that's your main sense is feeling, then you're clairsentient. If your main sense is seeing, you're clairvoyant. And some people even have audio where they're getting the messages via words; that is clairaudient. So there's a sense of connection always that comes with that. Yeah. No matter how the higher self shows up, a sense of warmth, a sense of love. But no matter how you feel it and how you perceive it, I will give you time for that, and you'll take that in. Yeah. And the one thing you don't want to do when you're up there is think about it. Don't think and assess. For example, if you're listening to somebody, and they're telling you a story, and you think about it and assess what that means and what you're going to say next, you're not listening very well. Right. That's a small percentage of problematic compared to when you're doing that at the higher self. Because as soon as you think about the message you're getting and you're wondering, "Is it right or not?" And "Does that match," or "Oh yeah, I remember." Or you interpret it. You are activating another part of your brain, which is actually in the left side of the brain, which that side should be asleep when you're at the higher self. So do not do that because you're waking that up, and then the lower part of the brain gets active; your ego gets active, and it completely messes with your messages. Yeah. So just like when you meet your love that you're absolutely in love with and they come and they smile at you, you don't question it. You don't think, "Are they really meaning that?" you know, "Do they really smile at me? Maybe they're just trying to get something from me." If you did that, your whole love experience would just pop like a bubble, and you would like think, "Oh my gosh, maybe this person is a fraud." And then you have all these doubts, and you're never going to get it right because from that moment on that you, you know, question them, they'll have to prove themselves, and you'll never be able to believe it because that part of you that questions it will always question everything. Everything in life. So for the good things in life, things that feel good, things that are meaningful to you, shut that off. Don't question it. Yeah. You can save that for when you're back down later. If you absolutely have to assess things, if you have to interpret things, you can do it later. But best is to write your experience down, and you can think about it then in a loving way. Not in a doubtful way. Yeah. But when you're up there, don't do it. Because it's really inhibiting your higher self connection if you think about anything while you're up with your higher self. Yeah. I want to give you an example. Remember when you were a child, or think of a child that you know; look how the children go into experiences. They, they look at the flowers and like, "Oh my God, that flower is amazing." "Oh, look at that little, little, you know, worm. I love this worm." I remember when I was two years old, I was singing a goodnight song to the worm, and I thought "That worm is exactly like me. He wants a good night song." And I felt very connected to it. So we just take everything in, and we're present with everything. We don't question anything. That gives us this beautiful experience of awe, but it also creates an openness where things can actually have an effect on us. And children are very imprintable, wouldn't you say? Now you want to be imprintable with your higher self. You want to be like that with your higher self. Why? Because if you're questioning things, you're taking yourself out of the experience and into a brain assessment that's basically the same as if you're reading about a sunset on your computer and assessing it compared to watching a sunset and enjoying it in the moment. Yeah. You don't want to take yourself into a computer mode where you're listening to your brain. Yeah. You want to stay in the experience. So don't ask yourself, "Is this real? Am I making this up?" Just accept it for what it appears to be. Why? Well, it took me a while to figure this out, and this is the last thing I want to leave you with. I asked my higher self, "You know, anytime I try to think about whether this is real, the whole experience is gone. Why is that?" And I specifically asked that because I actually saw a light being show up for me in my meditation. And as soon as I thought "This is real," the light being was gone, and later I, I understood it was my guardian angel who showed herself. And the higher self said to me that any time you assess something, you ask if it is real, you are actually thinking it's not real. And because you're thinking it's not real, your reality bends to what you believe, and everything disappears. The other aspect about that is when you feel that there's something there, you sense as if there's something, that has to do with an actual energy field being present there. Otherwise your brain could not pick it up and think maybe there's something there, or it feels as if there's something there. It couldn't pick that up because nothing would be there. So whenever your brain feels, senses, something as if it's there, it feels as if somebody's standing behind me, trust that it is actually true because otherwise your brain would not pick up that energy. And so for your energy work today, we will go into this deep meditation while I'll guide you up to your higher self. And I just can't wait for you to have that experience. And what's important is that as I'm leading you into this meditation, I want you to prepare. I want you to understand and know that this is actually a longer practice and know you can do this. Yeah. Most of the work that we'll do in this part will actually be done via meditation, as I mentioned, and we will be working in consciousness mode, not in intellectual mode, so that we affect the vibration. Now you're at a place where we have leveled up our time in meditation since the first lesson when you started with the very small meditations. And then we got into longer meditation with the manifestation. Now it's the time where you're at the higher self level, and you are ready to have longer focused meditations. And it's still not really a meditation because I'm guiding you, so you're literally doing something. So it's not like, oh, you're sitting in silence for half an hour, even though I encourage you later to do more and more silent parts. But as you prepare for this half-hour energy session, just make sure you're undisturbed and you're completely ready to dive in. Yeah. So uninterrupted time of about 30 minutes that you can dedicate yourself with accessing your higher self and meeting the most important part of your life. I'm so excited for you. I'll see you soon in the meditation, and then I'll see you in the next lesson. Aloha. I love you. A Hui Hou, which means, until I see you again.

====================

LESSON 9 – Meeting Your Higher Self Meditation

- It is time to meet your higher self- the most important being you'll ever meet. Come with me. Let's close our eyes. Visualize, intend, or allow white roots coming out of both your feet and your perineum between your legs, going down into the heart of the planet, deeper and deeper through all the layers. Let them anchor in the crystal that's in the heart of the planet. Then start breathing out into those roots. Breathing all the way down, letting used-up energy go into the crystal to be transformed. And then breathing in fresh life-force energy from there. And continue to do that in your own rhythm. Breathing out, letting go of used-up energy, then breathing in, refreshing yourself with fresh life-force energy from the planet. Continue in your own rhythm. This will refresh your physical energy. Every breath cleanses you more and recharges you more. Three more breaths. Beautiful. And then let go of that thought, and connect up through the crown chakra, visualizing that light rod going up from your crown chakra all the way through the dimensions and timelines to source or God, however you want to call it. And then breathe in from God/source fresh energy into your system, which means your body and your aura. And out to God/source. Letting go of used-up energy. Focus here is you're breathing in inspiration, guidance, clarity, anything that's necessary for you to fulfill your mission in life. And you're breathing out what hinders it. Any confusion, doubts, whatever it may be. Continue in your own rhythm. Three more breaths. Amazing. Now breathe into your heart chakra from both directions. You're collecting the breath from source of our creation and the heart of the planet into your own heart. Breathing in and breathing out in both directions. You're now cleansing your heart, making room for more and more unconditional love that's coming in from the heart of the planet and the heart of creation into your heart. Just continue in your own rhythm now. Three more breaths. Wonderful. Then let go of that thought. We're now calling on Archangel Michael. "Archangel Michael. Archangel Michael. Please create a protection shield of light around the person listening to my voice." And you can visualize or allow that light shield around you. You can also see yourself drawing that shield in your mind's eye. And we're calling on Archangel Sachiel. "Archangel Sachiel. Archangel Sachiel. Please let divided flame burn on the person listening to my voice, transforming every negativity into the next more positive vibration." Uplifting the frequency, you allow that violet fire that is a fire in the invisible realm that has a very powerful, potent energy and capacity to transform everything in your system, to allow it to actually transform it. And as this is happening, your frequency is rising. And I'm now calling on a light shower. You can visualize, allow, or intend a light shower to come down from the divine source, powering from the divine source, showering over you and into you. It's like beautiful golden white light, as bright as sunlight on water. It's entering your crown chakra, filling up your whole body as it flows down. It's also going around your body into your aura. And it cleanses your whole system. Activates it; strengthens it. Allow that light shower to come through you and around you. Every cell of your body is drinking in that light; it's being activated, strengthens your immunity, rises. Your vitality rises more, and your frequency rises. You're being cleansed of lower vibrations as this is happening. You're being prepared to go to your higher self. Just a few more moments sitting in that light shower, keeping your attention on that, if you don't mind. Your attention magnifies everything that's happening. Beautiful. Now your vibration is up. Now, visualize, intend, or allow an elevator to show up in front of you. A golden elevator. You walk towards the elevator; the door magically opens. You walk in, and you see the buttons. And the highest button says "Higher Self." You press that, and on the count of three, the elevator will take off and take you to your higher self: 1, 2, 3, taking off, going through the dimensions and timelines, higher and higher and higher. Raising up your higher self is magnetically drawing that elevator in as well. Then you travel higher and higher and higher until you reach the highest level. The door opens. You exit the elevator, and you see beautiful light beings, two, one to the right and one to the left, awaiting you. They're holding their hands out. And whether you see them or feel them or you just intend them, they are there, and they're taking you by the hand and guiding you to your higher self. There's a certain sense of familiarity from these beings that's coming into you, as if you know them; they're family, somehow. Just feel that comfort from being guided like that. And as you approach your higher self, you start noticing your higher self from far away. And it comes closer and closer. Whichever sense you're noticing it with is fine. Or you can even just intend it or allow it. Make contact with your higher self. You can hug it; you can touch it. You can have foreheads connect. However you want to do this energy exchange. Just allow yourself to be guided. Feel how it feels to be welcomed with such open arms. To be recognized. To be cherished. Allow yourself to open up further and further to this encounter. Every part of you is opening up to being seen from the part of you that knows you the best, that knows all that you are, and appreciates all about you. Knows that there is nothing but good intentions in there. Everything that you are and have ever been is steeped in good intentions. And it's being seen right now, so strongly, so clearly. Feel seen. Feel loved. Feel received with such open-hearted love. And then the higher self takes you to a beautiful healing room, takes you by the hand. And you walk on this beautiful platform, and you enter a room full of emeralds and green light. There are emeralds on the wall. There's an emerald fountain in the middle. And right next to the fountain is a beautiful bed that's made with tiny, tiny emerald sand. The mattress is filled with emerald crystals. It's very soft. And you go into that room, feel the energy, and you lay on that bed. As soon as you lay on the green bed, you notice the energy streaming through you; an energy current starts to work with you and actually rejuvenates and heals you. There are many light beings in that room. All of the Green Ray healing angels of the regal Archangel Raphael. And you just relax, and you let go of anything and everything that could possibly need healing or rejuvenation. Give that up, and allow that healing and rejuvenation to come to you. Your higher self is standing right behind you, holding its hands- if you can imagine that it has hands-onto your head, streaming powerful energies through your body and aura, activating your remembering of how loved you actually are. Nothing you've ever done is judged here. There's no distinguishing between good and bad. There's just a recognition of who you really are. And you're starting to feel more and more connected to who you really are as you higher self is streaming this energy through you. And you're being healed by the light beings in this green room, supported and restored. Let's just be in silence here for a few moments. As you're experiencing that. The energy fountain is now placed under your bed, and the energy starts to stream through the bed and through you, going up high above you, coming back down on the outside and back in in the middle, creating a torus energy field where the middle of the torus is right around your heart and solar plexus area. And the rest of that torus energy field, which is a donut shaped energy, is streaming around you, activating and healing you even more deeply. Inwardly, you say the question without answering it. Just opening that question into the universe. "Who am I really?" Beautiful. Just a few more moments here as you prepare to get back up out of the bed; just enjoy those last moments, feeling this sense of belonging. I'm loved. I'm seen. I belong. And even repeat that for yourself. "I am loved. I am seen. I belong." And know that this is true: when it comes to your higher self, how it feels and experiences you, whether you feel those feelings or not, this is a true statement. And you just allow that in, deeper and deeper in those last moments. And then you gently get up from the bed, and with your higher self, you walk out of the room; you turn around one more time, looking into the room, feeling it, sensing it, imagining it, allowing it. Whatever is active for you right now, you just use that. And then you walk out of the room and say goodbye to your higher self in the way it feels good to you. Feel the strength and the empowerment from this encounter, and tell your higher self you'll be back. And the light beings guide you back to the elevator. The elevator door opens; you enter, and you press the lowest button where it says "Body." And on the count of three, the elevator takes off, taking you directly back to where your body is sitting in meditation; 1, 2, 3, going down through the dimensions and timelines, deeper and deeper until you reach the lowest level where the elevator comes to a halt; the door opens; you walk out and back into your body. And now send those roots back down into the earth, those two light roots that are coming out of your feet and the one light route that comes out of your perineum between your legs. And visualize those roots literally grounding again back into the heart of the planet, and then breathe down into those roots anchoring this experience so that it becomes actually available energetically for you in physical reality. This is why we need to anchor this. And then breathe in from the earth back into your system. Do that two more times. Breathing out, anchoring in from the earth. And one more time. Wiggle your hands and feet; massage your ears, and gently open your eyes. Welcome back. How was this? Take a few moments, and you may want to write things down, your experience, or just dwell in it for a little bit. Drink some water. Don't rush into the world right now. Give it a little bit of time so you can actually have this experience linger on a little bit-just like you sit after a beautiful piece of music that you listen to. And I'll see you in the next lesson. Aloha.

LESSON 10 – Path to Purpose: Discover the Fulfillment of Your Soul's Essence
--------------------
<v ->Welcome back.</v> Wow. Now you've met your higher self. How was that? How are you feeling? I want to tell you, some people at this level feel totally ecstatic because they've had this amazing encounter, and others are a little bit doubtful or maybe don't know how to categorize this experience. And others, again, they haven't had a real encounter with the higher self, and they're wondering if they're doing it right. All of that is normal. This will take practice, and you'll get better and better at this. Just keep going. Okay. In this lesson, we're going to find out what your soul purpose is. And once you know your soul purpose, you can basically put everything that you do towards your soul purpose. You can literally streamline everything you do, the resources you take, the time you take, into the direction of your soul purpose, and therefore you're going to not lose time. You're actually going to make time, and you're going to be more successful at things that you do. And it feels-that's the important part for me and for you-more fulfilling. For example, let's think of an athlete. Yeah. Let's say we're thinking of a basketball player, and a basketball player that's, who's a professional basketball player. They target their life towards their body being in perfect shape for their game, right? Their mind, their heart, their soul, their body, everything is for the game. So that's how a targeted life looks like. They can also decide to do something else instead. They can say, "I'm going to do parties." "I'm going to eat wrong." "I'm going to hang out with the wrong people." But they know what they're doing there is not feeding their purpose, and they're free to choose that, right? We're not tied to anything. But the interesting thing about that, which is what I want to get to, is that they consciously deviate. They know what their purpose is, and they know when they're feeding their purpose, and they know when they're not feeding their purpose, and they make a conscious decision about that. So they're basically in charge at all times. Now, most people, they drift through life. They go to the right for a moment because that feels right, and then they go to the left for a moment because that feels inspiring, and then they get distracted, or they get disappointed, and then they move on and on and do those same moves all the time. Then they find out, "Oh my gosh, this is taking so long. This is hard. I am struggling. I need to do something else." And they shift again, and they're lost again. Does that sound familiar? Do you know some people who have that going on? Maybe some parts of your life are like that right now. Some parts may be streamlined, and others may be a little bit like what I just explained. Yeah. Now, in my practice for 20 years as a healer, I have found out that the most prevalent problem that people come with is actually not their health. It's also not their emotional well-being or their mental well-being. It is literally their lack of purpose. When you are at the deathbed- and they actually have done research with that; they have interviewed people who are laying on their deathbed- the most important question will be, "Did I fulfill my mission? Did I do what I came here to do, and did I love well?" So those are the two things that people will literally want to know that happened in their lives. "I loved well, and I fulfilled my mission." And if they didn't, then they're having a hard time leaving the planet because something's really missing. We all have a purpose. We all come here with a purpose. We all know that if we're doing something that we're meant to do, it feels right. There's a sense of fulfillment that comes from that that we can't get any other way. We try to get it another way. We try to get it through exercise; we try to get it through entertainment, and it's short-lived, and all of a sudden you feel empty. Have you been at that place when you're doing all the right things, but it feels empty, and you're getting disappointed, maybe disheartened. And as we continue on that path, when we're sort of drifting through life, we feel that there's something missing. Now, on the other hand, when we're actually on target with our purpose, and when we're living a purposeful life, then we're good at what we do and we have fun with doing it, and we have generally more success with that. So there's a true fulfillment that lies in actually living your purpose compared to not living it. So what I found by working on this with people is that if we get them on their purpose, a seemingly miraculous thing happens for them. All the doors open up. You're basically hitting the jet stream of your higher self. The resources come that they need. They meet the people that they need to meet in order to fulfill that purpose. They heal; their problems dissolve. It's not that they'll never have problems. Life goes in waves. Yeah, we always end up with challenges, and then we solve them again. We have good points and not so good points, but when the wave is down here, this is struggle. This is hard. When the wave goes up there, it's easier. It's more fulfilling. You're already living at a level of fulfillment where that jet stream is, and you can have sometimes better days and sometimes not so good days, but it doesn't feel like agony, struggle, and disheartening or overwhelming as it does down here. There's a huge, huge difference. And I know you've experienced this in some levels and at some times here and there, and you've experienced this as well, but we're going to establish ourselves here, and I love helping people to get to that jet stream. When you are riding that jet stream, not only is it effortless and fun; you are also riding in the right direction where you need to go at all times, and you don't waste time. I want that for you. And just like the athlete I shared earlier about that can make a choice whether they're going to do something that's directly aligned with their purpose or not so much, you're going to get exactly to that place where you can, of course, make all the choices that are feeding your life purpose. And that's really fulfilling. But you also don't have to. You can also deviate, but you're in charge; you know what you're doing. And that's a very empowering place to be at, and it's very fulfilling. I want to share with you a story about a client. I had a client named Amanda, and she came to me, and she had a problem with her hips, and she wanted me to help her heal her hips. So we did healing sessions for her hips, and of course they got better very quickly. But when I was doing these sessions for her hips, I realized that the reason why she has hip problems is she doesn't trust in life, and there's a bigger reason behind those hip problems, and that they actually are leading her into a greater fulfillment of her life if she fixes that underlying problem. So I brought it up with her and said, would she be interested in working more deeply towards her life purpose and finding her life purpose? And luckily, she was. And what we found out is that she was stuck in her job. She was working in a corporate office making good money where she had been for 10 years but was never happy, and she really didn't feel joyful with her work. You know how it feels when you're like, ah, grinding, don't want to go. That's kind of how it was for her. So she actually signed up for a 12-week master training with me, and we went up to her higher self together every week. And through that training, she ended up understanding what her purpose was, and her purpose was to work with children and help their development. Now, she didn't have any education in that regard, but she felt very passionate about children and she didn't have children herself, so she really wanted to help other kids. And she had a lot of background information of courses she had taken just because of her interest. Now, for example, Mindvalley has a lot of amazing courses, amazing content. Yeah. But it's sometimes hard to tell which course should I take that leads me personally actually further on the path towards my fulfillment and which courses should I not take and leave out because they're distractions, right? So it's really so helpful when you know what your purpose is, and you can align all that good content with your purpose. Yeah. And that's what we did with her. She ended up doing a few classes where she was qualified for opening a nursery for children with disability, and she rented a house to do that. She printed flyers and the exact steps for doing all of that, we downloaded from her higher self. We literally downloaded her purpose but also the exact steps to take in order to fulfill it, such as you know, which house to rent, what flyers to print, what's the design, who to hire, right? All those details that are actually practical details in the world. We can download that from the higher self as well. And she asked for the resources to come to her that she needed in order to go to that next step in her life purpose. And those came as well. And within three months, she had her practice, and she had a beautiful clientele of people who brought their children. And she had hired a professional therapist to work with the children. And within about a year she could franchise that office. And she became very well known, and she made a lot of money with that. She could absolutely quit her job that she didn't like, and she ended up making more money than she had made with that day job, with her day job. But she got to be together with the children, which she was missing because she didn't have her own. And her physical problems were completely gone because she had entered that jet stream of the higher self. Yeah, that energy field where you just move forward at ease and grace, you get propelled into the right direction because you are on purpose. This is what happens with people when they're living their purpose. And once you know your life purpose, you go without these deviations. And I want that for you. You want that? You want to get into that next level? I'm sure you're feeling me, right? We're feeling this together. This is why we're here together, right now, in this moment. This is your moment when you're listening to my voice. It's your now. So I'm entering your now, right now, and I hope you're hearing me, that we're going together to help you get to your next level. Yeah, I'm very excited about that. Now, all of this I'm telling you because it's literally what happened every time when I had a client that came with a physical problem. When we went to the higher self, we saw what the problem really was pointing towards. And that that problem was only created, only created in order for them to find their true purpose. And I think most of the accidents, most of the physical problems that we have, are actually pointing in that direction as well. This could be arthritis; this could be depression; it could be an accident with a car; it could be an accident with, you know, another person, or something just falls down, and you hurt your hand because the glass breaks, you know. Whatever it is, it's always helping to point you towards your purpose. So we are geared to find our purpose. And what's actually happening when we're not on our purpose is we get troubles; we get shaken; we get pushed; we get nudged to come back on purpose. Yeah. And when we're on purpose, things go smoothly; there's more happiness. We're designed that way. We're designed to go for happiness and for ease because ease and happiness are on our purpose, and everything else is away from our purpose. But sometimes it's hard to find the exact, the exact route to get to that, right, or the route to get to that. And everybody wants it. And we're like, "Okay, please point in the direction where I need to go, and I'll do it." This is what your higher self will do for you. The other thing is, when we're on our purpose, we're always feeling happy. Purposeful actions feel fulfilling. Whereas actions that don't lead to fulfillment of our purpose lead to more or less unhappiness. They're not fulfilling. Yeah. So if you go towards your purpose right now, and I'll guide you up to your higher self, and we'll ask about that, you can already know that you are going towards more and more happiness in your life. I can guarantee you that. And that happiness comes also with more health, more wealth, more well-being in all areas of your life. I see you thrive. I see you bring that thing forth in you that's wanting to come forth. You know that part of you that says, "You know, there's more to it. I want this more." That's where we're leading you. We're leading you into the more that you can't see yet. You know, when I was meditating in Germany, and I was 36 years old, I was just meditating in order to do my work well and ask my higher self, you know, "How could I do my work well as an occupational therapist working in a practice with children living in Germany?" sort of like a normal life. Yeah, I didn't have much money, but I came by, by really well. So it was all okay. People loved my work I did. I didn't like it so much because I was so exhausted, but I still did good work. So it was meaningful. So it was sort of like a mediocre experience. Yeah. And when I went to the higher self, I just asked, "How can I be better at what I'm doing?" I didn't think of where I could go. And in fact, I could not have thought of where I could go because it was inconceivable for my brain. It's inconceivable for your brain where you can go. I guarantee you that it's inconceivable. Your brain has no idea what's in store for you, but your gut feeling says "There's more to me, and I want to explode that. I want to bring it out like a flower field that starts to bloom." That's what we're doing with you right now. And I got told I need to move to Hawaii. Can you imagine living in Germany and moving to Hawaii? How big that a step that is? And that was made smooth, not only smooth; I would never go back. I am having the most amazing experience ever since. And that's how it's going to be for you. It doesn't need to be a huge step that takes you out of your current state. So don't be afraid of that. But it's something that is so much more fun than what you're having right now. We will ask about your purpose when we're up at the higher self, but I want to prime you about your purpose right now. When we're up at the higher self in that meditation that I'm going to lead you into where we're going to get clearer on your purpose, I want you to understand the difference between soul essence and mission and how that leads to your soul purpose. Because when you have an understanding before you go up there, everything you're feeling and experiencing from the higher self lands on fertile ground, and you don't have to kind of question it. That's why I'm doing this long explanation about your purpose. And there's a part to it that I'd love for you to understand, and that is soul essence and mission and how it leads to soul purpose. So your soul purpose is that fulfillment of this lifetime. Okay? We're clear on that now. You have a soul essence. Everybody has a soul essence. That soul essence is really a quality that you embody the most, and that's most important for you in life. So some people have as that quality, for example, peace. If I ask my husband, he'll say peace is the most important thing in his life. If you'll ask me, connection is the most important thing in my life. If you ask one of my clients, joy is the most important thing in their life. So ask yourself, what is the most important quality for you? If you would have to choose one quality over all the qualities that are available to you here on this planet, what's the most important quality for you? That is your soul essence. You've seen yourself as a child go towards that. Try to create that. You fantasize about jobs that create that. You try to get that in groups all the time, at your work. When you have it, you feel more fulfilled, more happy. That's your soul essence. And you can take some time to think about that. Your mission is how you live that soul essence. The soul essence doesn't change; it's what you come with. The mission can change. It doesn't have to. You can have a whole mission for your whole life, the same mission, but it can change. Your mission is how you live that soul essence. So my soul essence is connection. Yeah. And how I lived it earlier in my life was, you know, through play and as a child and to connecting with everybody. When I was at school, I tried to, you know, mitigate between people and mediate. 'Cause connection was the most important thing for me. In my work, I try to connect with people. Occupational therapy is all about connecting, and now I'm connecting people to their higher self. So connection has always been part of my life, but my mission has changed over time. Yeah, occupational therapy, different mission; healer, different mission; life coach, different mission. Yeah. So your mission can change, and that gives you a lot of freedom. It's very fun. You can literally choose a mission that sounds very fun to you. Yeah. And then just do it, and then try that out, and change it. As long as you're clear about your soul essence, and you know that that doesn't change, that leads to a purposeful life, and that creates a lot of fun. How do you like that? How's that landing with you? Are you hearing me? Do you feel me? Okay, now let's talk about how you get answers from your higher self about your mission. So your soul essence, you probably can find by just checking in with yourself, but your mission, how you live your soul essence, that's something your higher self can tell you. Because that can sometimes be outside of your current paradigm, outside of what you can see, and it involves other people. Earlier we spoke about the importance of asking what you want, right? So now I want to share with you how you can ask your higher self questions and how you can get better answers. We're going to do a system, we're going to create a system for you. So there's two ways of how you can get answers from your higher self. Number one is simple yes and no answers. Is that black and white, yes or no? Yeah. For that, you need to ask yes or no questions. Okay? A yes or no question is, "Does this work for me better, or does this work for me better?" You can't ask that. But you can say, "Does this work for me better?" Then you can get yes or no. And if you getting a no, you say, "Does this work for me better?" You can get a no. Remember that game when we played as children, where you know, you think of a person, and the other person has to ask, and you can only say yes or no questions. It's like that; you need to come up with a way to ask that allows your higher self to give you a yes or no question. So I'll give you a better example of that. So for example, I want to find out if this job that I'm taking is the right job for me. So what I would ask first is, "Is the job that I'm going to take the perfect job for me?" Yes or no question. Let's say I'm getting a no. Now I want to find out which job is the right job for me. If I ask that, "Which job is the right job for me," that doesn't work. So I need to guess. I need to say, "Okay, does the job involve people?" Yes. "Do I already know about that job?" Yes. "Have I already been offered that job?" No. "Okay. Okay. Does a friend know about that job?" Yes. "Is it this or this friend?" Yes. Okay. Is it this or this job?" Yes. "Okay." You get the gist. Yeah. So that's how you're going to do it. Number two, how we can ask our higher self questions is with open-ended questions that give you more open-ended answers. Yeah, the latter, of course is more advanced, and the first one is easier. So let's start with the easier one. So right now we're going to go into what happens when we go up to the higher self. Okay, I'll guide you up. You already know how that goes. We did that. And then what's going to happen up there, when you are up there, I'm going to ask you to ask questions to your higher self that can be answered with yes or no. In order to do that, we need to establish a baseline to understand the answers that we will receive. Yeah. So you can start with a question that's obvious. So for example, "Am I a woman?" "Do I have black hair?" "Do I have children?" And you'll hear the answer from the higher self. So just ask something that you know the answer to, and see what your higher self gives you. This is where you want to get a feel for how your higher self gives you a yes and how your higher self gives you a no. Yeah. When it gives you a yes, you'll feel a certain sense, or you'll sense a certain feeling. And when you get a no, it feels differently. And that you're going to remember. Yeah. So understand what is a yes and what's a know from your higher self. And I can give you some examples here. So for some people, the yes will feel like a forward movement. It's as if their body is moving forward, even though you're not checking in with your body. But it's sort of like the energy is, you know, moving you forward. It's positive; it's affirmative. Yeah. That could be a yes. And a no could be nothing. That happens often for people. There's just nothing; that's actually a no. Yeah. For others, a yes can feel like excitement, woo, good feeling. Right? And a no can feel like, hmm, no, that doesn't feel good. Yeah. That's how it can come through as well. And it can also be a shiver, or a sense of energy is there, or there's no energy. So those are examples of how a yes and a no can feel. Now, if you are visual, you can literally see your higher self nodding or shaking your head, shaking its head. Yeah. So we're going to establish a yes versus a no feeling. Once you have that, you can ask any question because you know how your higher self answers it. What's important is I want you to get out of your physical sensation. This is not a physical sensation usually that you're looking for. Sometimes people get shivers in their physical body, but it's not the ideal thing to look for because you really want to be out of your physical body, and you want to be in consciousness mode. So what you're looking for is do you feel more full and energetic? Do you feel more affirmative, more moving forward, more excited? Then that's a yes. And do you feel nothing or more negative moving backward energy? Then that's a no. It's comparative to when you have a person come behind you. There's all of a sudden a sense there. You don't see them. Your brain theoretically doesn't know they're there, but you can sense them. How do you sense that they're there compared to that they're not there. That's how your higher self often says yes or no. It's sort of full and empty. Yeah, but you'll get it. I'm so excited to be taking you by the hand again today. And we are going up to you higher self together. We'll be doing another energy session that is designed to help you identify your life's mission and learn how to align with it. I mentioned before, this is a longer meditation session. So please set aside about 30 minutes of uninterrupted time. And when you are done, I just want you to reflect on the answers you received. Write about it in your journal, and if you feel moved to do so, share with the community. Treat this as a very special encounter with your higher self. Just like spending quality time with a billion-dollar mentor. Even if you don't get all the answers right away or don't understand the answers, just being in the presence of this mentor will activate you. It will eventually change your life. And please make sure that you are not interrupted. This is very important. This phase where I'm taking you into theta mode to your higher self actually trains your brain to stay awake in theta mode. If you get interrupted, or if you say, "Oh, I'm quickly going to go down check my phone or internet; then I go back up." And if you take that lightly, what happens is you're going to actually short circuit some of your, your electrical lines in your brain, and you will become impervious and immune to that frequency raise. And you don't want that. This is going to create more stress in your life, and you're actually going to be waiting for an interruption subconsciously when you go to a theta level. And that would be the worst that can happen to you because then that part of the brain that we want to be asleep, will be awake at all times. And if you cannot get that to sleep anymore, then you have real trouble with accessing the higher realms. So not being interrupted is absolutely vital. Another thing that's absolutely vital is traveling down consciously and slowly for the same reason. You'll be inclined possibly that you're just, okay, you're done with a higher self, you open your eyes and you go about your life. Don't do that because you're actually energetically not yet in your body. And you can create accidents that way, and you also will do that with the brain that I just explained. It's important to travel slowly back down. And the last thing that I want to warn you about is not to ground. So make sure you are grounding. Yeah, I want to tell you to ground because when you are grounding, which means sending consciously your roots back down into the earth and then breathing in and out of the roots between three and five times minimum, what you're doing there is you are bringing these energies that are in the higher realms and in the invisible realms, untouchable and not tangible, you're bringing them through your body, which is touchable and tangible into physical reality. And all the things that your higher self wants to give you, also the ideas, the resources, they will become physically "experienceable." You can experience them physically in your physical reality when you ground. And a lot of people don't know that. They forget to do that, and they wonder, "Why am I having all these great ideas, and nothing actually comes of it?" Part of it may be that they're not grounding. So ground down, and you got this. As I said, this encounter with your higher self will eventually change your life. And I'm superexcited for you to be at this level right now where we're already asking questions. I love you and thank you for being here with me. Aloha.

LESSON 10 – Meditation: Identifying Soul Purpose Meditation

Take a deep breath with me and start focusing on your roots that are coming out of both your feet and your perineum, and send them all the way down into the heart of the planet with your intention. Intent them to completely anchor themselves in the heart of the planet where there is a beautiful crystal receiving your roots. And then start breathing out of your roots. Sending down used up energy with your breath, allowing it to be immediately transformed in the heart of the planet and breathing fresh energy back up into your body and aura. Do this for a few moments in your own rhythm. Breathing out, releasing your step energy and breathing in recharging. Three more breaths And then focus on your crown chakra. Visualizing or intending a light rod going all the way up from your crown chakra up to source. So God, choose whichever word works for you there, sending this all the way up through the dimensions and timelines, higher and higher until it reaches the source of all creation. And then breathe out to source just like a whale would. Breathe out all the way up to source. Let releasing used up energy and breathe in fresh energy into your system. Now, continue in your own rhythm, releasing used up energy, false beliefs, anything that can hinder your perfect guidance up to sorts where it is immediately transformed. And then breathing in that perfect guidance, the beliefs that are beneficial, anything you need to fulfill your life mission. Three more breaths. Beautiful. Then focus on your heart chakra in the middle of your chest and breathe in from both directions simultaneously, from the heart of the planet and the heart of creation into your own heart. Filling up your heart with beautiful energy. And then breathe out in both directions. Releasing that energy again, focusing on recharging with fresh energy as you breathe in and releasing new step energy as you breathe out. The focus here is you're breathing in unconditional love from above and below, and you're breathing out what hinders love. Three more breaths. Beautiful. Then let go of the thought about the breath, knowing that this will continue without you thinking about it. Who calling on Archangel Z keel? Archangel Z Keel. Archangel z. Keel. Please let the divided flame burn on the person listening to my voice and also the space that I'm gonna be traveling in. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. We'll call in on Argenal, Michael Argenal, Michael Argenal. Michael, please create a protection shield of light around the person listening to my voice right now and protect them with your energy. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Now we're calling on a light shower. That light shower is coming down from the source of all creation in a golden white stream of light, like sunlight on water. Visualize our intent, this waterfall of light coming down onto you like a spotlight, showering over you, showering your whole aura and into you showering your whole body, freshing, clean and activating every molecule. Every atom is your whole being. Allow your cells to absorb. That light gets strengthened and filled. Your vibration rises. You're becoming stronger, your immunity goes up, your aura gets filled to overflowing. As this is happening, just continue sitting in this light shower right now or laying in it and enjoy that Beautiful and then visualize or intend and elevator showing up right in front of you as you're getting ready to visit your higher self. See the golden elevator? You walk towards the elevator, the door opens, you enter and you press the highest button that says higher self. And on the count of three, this elevator will take off and take you directly to your higher self. 1, 2, 3, lifting off through the dimensions and timelines. You're going higher and higher and higher, automatically being pulled in by your higher self as well. And once you reach the highest level, the elevator stops, the door opens and you see two beautiful light beings awaiting you. They hold their hands out, they receive you. You walk with them. You feel the love and the appreciation coming from them. They feel so familiar, so good. As you're walking closer and closer to your higher self, see or intend your higher self coming closer to you as you approach it until you reach your higher self. Do an energy exchange right here. Give it a hug or hands or however it feels right to you. Mm. Feel the appreciation. You know your higher self cherishing you, how special they feel about you. Notice some of that and let in more and more of that. As this encounter continues, Feel how it feels to be loved. So divinely Beautiful. Let it in. Open your heart. Open your whole being to this encounter. And then you higher self guides you into a teaching room. This room has furniture that we don't know on planet earth. Beautiful, amazing furniture. And you come into this room, you see adorned, look around you feel it, sense it. Whichever sense is active for you. Allow yourself to perceive this room and you sit down on a chair at a table with your higher self in front of you. There's a big screen on which your higher self can project things to you, show you movies and pictures. There's a book on the table that you could see. There are pieces that you can touch that could be cues to what you higher self is sharing with you. And you look at your higher self and you ask your first question to establish the baseline. Ask a question that you know the answer of and that you know the answer is a yes, such as your gender or your name. And once you ask the question, notice a sensation that you're getting. Are you seeing your higher self nod? Are you feeling a certain sense that is your yes. You may be hearing it as well. Just take that in and remember that. And then ask you higher yourself a question that you know the answer is no too. And check what no feels like for you. You could see shaking his head. You could feel a more repulsing energy or you could feel nothing, an emptiness. Whatever it is, remember it. This is your no good. And then think of a question that's important to you that you would like to know. Answer of and ask that question your higher self. It needs to be a question that can only be answered with yes or no. Receive the answer. And you can do up to two more questions. Or you can also pause the recording and ask more Since the answers. If you want to go deeper into a question, ask more about that subject. Just keep asking more questions that can be answered in yes or no. Don't question the answer, just remember it
Beautiful. Then give thanks to your higher self and tell it you'll be back. You can use this recording anytime and pause it in the middle if you need longer. And you now being guided back to the elevator I filled with information and clarity. The door opens, you enter, you press the lowest button, it says body. And on the count of three, the elevator takes off and goes down, taking directly to your body. 1, 2, 3, going down through the dimensions and timelines further and further, all the way down until it reaches the level of where your body is in meditation. Good. Once you reach the lowest level, the elevator door opens. You walk out back into your body and you breathe down into your roads, breathing down all the way into the heart of the planet through the three light roots and in from the planet. Two more times. Anchoring the experience, making the answers livable in physical reality and anchoring yourself back in the body. Then wiggle your hands and feet. Massage your ears. Tell your body you love it. Thank you body for being here with me and open your eyes. Now. This is a time where you can write down the answers you've gotten. Think about them, assess them, work with them, live them, and then come back to this anytime you have more questions. Thank you. Aloha.

LESSON 11 – Navigate Life's Challenges and Overcome Obstacles
--------------------
<v ->Okay, now we're at a very good point.</v> You've already met your higher self; you have found your purpose, or you started on the path of becoming clearer and clearer about your life purpose. And you can repeat that session as much as you want, as often as you want, until you're really clear "What is my life purpose?" Yeah. And if you need help, you can always come to me. You can book a private session, and we can do it together. So don't worry about it. It will come to you. What we're going to do right now is we're going to eliminate obstacles. This is actually one of my favorite sessions because it moves mountains. It's really powerful, and this is superimportant if you want to create a lifestyle out of this. Your higher self can give you the information you need and help you with the resources, nevertheless, and it can also help you eliminate the obstacles that are standing in the way of you reaching your goal. Today's session is like taking off the brakes on a car. Yeah, let's imagine you have a Ferrari, okay? And you want to drive that Ferrari somewhere, and you're like, you can't wait to drive that Ferrari. The first thing you need is you need a Ferrari, right? That's your higher self. You got that. Then you need a driver. That's you. You got that. You get into the Ferrari, and now you need to let go of the brake and push the gas pedal, and that's removing the obstacles. In this lesson, we will ask you higher self to help you clear your path into your future so that you can work with ease and grace and more success every day. You can also help with this process in your daily life. How can you help? This is really beautiful, and it's an important part of this Quest. You can help by eliminating certain things that lower your vibration. Because remember, as you understand now, the contact with your higher self and you understanding the messages from your higher self has a lot to do with your vibration being high, higher than 350, where gratitude is, and ideally as high as 500, 550, where unconditional love is found. So in order to get there and stay there on a regular basis, you want to find out what is draining and lowering your frequency, and you want to eliminate that. Yeah? The first thing that I want to share to eliminate is alcoholic beverages. So anytime you drink alcohol, it'll lower your frequency. That doesn't mean you can't drink alcohol, I'm telling you to absolutely abstain. But I want to encourage you to abstain from alcohol for at least throughout these weeks here, where we're working with the higher self, and we're getting your frequency up. And then you can see what results you can actually get, what you're capable of. Yeah. And then when you introduce alcohol, again, start with a very low amount. I can tell you I've had quite a few times this incident that people, you know, they didn't drink throughout the time that we either had a master training or they did a course or a Quest like you're doing right now. And then they just ended up going with their one or two glasses of wine that they were used to, and they got really sick. They got a big headache. They felt the next day as if they had like drunk two bottles of wine because it'll have a stronger effect on you. So when you start again, if you absolutely have to, then lower the amount of alcohol, and it's actually ideal to have very little. What I do is sometimes I want to, you know, toast with champagne. I'll put apple juice cider in there, the sparkling apple juice. Everybody thinks I'm drinking champagne. Nobody knows I'm drinking apple juice. No problem. You know, we're toasting. And if I will drink a little bit, then I'll drink like a sip or two just so I can toast with my friends. Yeah, but it happens rarely, and you'll find out you actually don't need it. But as I said, it's up to you. Just notice what happens, because alcohol is one of the substances that lowers your frequency abruptly. For example, when you are on 500, and you drink an alcoholic beverage, you're going to drop quickly. It's like going down a water slide. And it also is really hard on your system. So mind, your system will become more and more fine tuned for what we're doing. You can compare this with a typewriter. You can only write with a typewriter, just letters, right? But if instead you had a computer, you could do much more. Now the problem is the typewriter you can accidentally throw down, and it doesn't break. You can just pick it back up, and you can type your letters, right? But if the computer falls down, that's a bigger problem. And your system is becoming more and more sophisticated and sensitive like a computer. So you want to be more careful with shocking experiences. A computer also can't stand the heat or water or anything that's basically extreme; same for you. So for example, whatever you take into your system has an effect on you, right? Has an effect on your frequency. And because you have all the tools from the first module, you also become immune to a lot of things in the outer world. So you're not getting bogged down by energies around you. What still has an effect on you is what I call mind food. Mind food is something you let in through your eyes and through your attention. Remember where your attention goes, the energy flows. So the protection shell doesn't really help you there. And mind food are things that you take in intellectually. And this could be movies; it could be books; it could be conversations. And so you want to be mindful of what you're taking in. For example, if you are watching movies where people are getting killed, you're actually literally programming your mind that way. If you're watching the news a lot, same thing; especially, don't listen to it subliminally while you're doing something else. But instead, you could choose a beautiful movie. You could choose an encouraging movie, maybe even a movie that talks about energy work and what you can do and how this energy work and world can actually inform our reality. You know, just choose something that you actually want to experience in your future. So don't watch, talk about, read, dwell in, things that you don't want to see in your future because your mind creates your future. Remember manifestation? Thoughts and feelings and actions will create. So therefore you want to be mindful about that. Lastly, and this is a big one, and this is an important one to eliminate, and it actually helps your life big time. You want to-hopefully, I'm encouraging you to-eliminate gossip. Gossip is something that actually lowers our frequency tremendously, and it impacts other people negatively also. Why? Well, where our attention goes, the energy flows, and when we're placing our attention on negative traits of another person, the energy flows to them in a negative way. So not only are we lowering our own frequency, you know, to probably a level of 50; we're also hurting the other people by sending them negative energy and enhancing the aspects in that person that are not good. So if you want somebody to change, don't gossip about them. Talk good about them; bring out their best. Now, how do you determine whether you are gossiping about somebody or whether you're just sharing your feelings of an experience with somebody? What do you think? Well, gossip is anything you say that you would not say in the person's face. Think whether what you're going to say right now is going to be fine if the person will be sitting with you; then it's not gossip. If you'd rather have them not be present and not hear that, it's gossip. Eliminate it. Cut it out. Yeah. Oh, it's going to be so wonderful. Imagine a world without gossip. Imagine you would come into a room with people where you know, they would think only positive thoughts about you. They would embrace you unconditionally. How would you feel? And I actually am set out to create more and more experiences like that. That's part of what my membership is about. That's part of what this Quest is about, and that's part of what my life mission is. So I hope you can hear me there, and you're actually feeling the same way. And if you don't, try it out. Now, there is another form of gossip, other than talking about others, that's also harmful and that we need to eliminate, and that's the gossip about ourselves. Whatever we think about ourselves has to be a good thought. And if we don't have a good thought, then we're gossiping about ourselves, and we're harming ourselves. So it's good to train to get out of that self-judgment. Yeah. Now, where is that self-judgment coming from? It's an interesting experiment that we made when we found out with people, why are they actually gossiping? And we interviewed some people and asked them, you know, "What is your intention in this conversation?" after- or "What was your intention," after they gossip? And we found out two reasons why people gossip. Number one is they want connection. They actually are trying to connect with the other people, but they don't want to expose themselves. They won't want to share anything about themselves. So they talk about somebody else. And if they talk about somebody else with uplifting them, that they're better than the other person, then they're automatically putting themselves in a good light. So it's a very safe way of trying to connect. Obviously, it doesn't work because it creates negativity all around you, but the underlying reason is connection. When you know that, you can help people rather connect and get them out of gossip. And I'll share with you how to do that and how I suggest you do that in a minute. So the other reason why people gossip is they actually think they become a better person if they gossip. Here's the thought behind that. It's "If I am hard on myself, I will want to be better. So instead of being good to myself and encouraging myself, I'm going to be hard on myself, tell myself what I'm doing wrong, and then I get this pressure and anxiety of not being good enough, and that'll pressure me into being better. And I'll do the same with the other people, and I'm basically judging them and putting them in drawers because I want to be morally correct. I want to be morally, you know, a good person, and therefore I'm judging and putting in drawers." Yeah. Now, this is a very misconceived way of being a better person, but it comes also from a good place. It comes from a place of wanting to be righteous and right and good. Yeah. So always remember that, even yourself, when you're gossiping about yourself, you're really coming from a good place. Now, how do you eliminate gossip in yourself and with others? In yourself, it's relatively easy: when you notice you do it, you just put a gratitude thought on top of that, ideally three. So one negative thought gets three positive gratitude thoughts about yourself. Do that often enough, and you'll notice you'll actually stop. Number one, you get used to gratitude. It's, it's a new thing that your brain will learn, and the hypothalamus understands this is important, puts it into your consciousness more, and you'll create a habit. Pretty simple. Yeah. The other thing that happens is you get bored of saying three things all the time, and you make a better effort in being positive. I tried that on myself; worked superwonders, worked really great. Yeah, hopefully it works for you that way too. The other way of what you can do with others is a little bit more complex. So when somebody comes to you and they start gossiping, I generally suggest three approaches. The first one is the easiest. Second one, "Okay, they're not listening. I'm going to go a little bit harder." And third one is, "They're really not stopping. I'm going to put the emergency brake on." Yeah. So the first one is, when somebody starts to gossip, you'll just bring up something positive about that person or situation that they're gossiping about or something positive about the person who's talking, and just make them, give them a compliment. "Oh, you look good today," and "Oh my gosh, I love the flowers that you have in your garden," or "Hey, I really loved that yesterday you cleaned up before I even could do it." Whatever it is. And you get them on a positive vibe and then change the subject and start talking about something you want to talk about. That's number one. If they go with that, great. If they don't go with that, go to number two, and you can say, "Well, maybe you want to talk with the person about that," or "This is probably something you need to bring up with them." So you're literally pointing out to their conscious brain that number one, you are recognizing that they're talking about another person. So they are caught. Number two, morally correct would be to bring that person in and to actually talk it through with them. So now you have their observer going, you know. When we're gossiping, we're coming straight from the ego. There's no observer there, but you bring their observer on by saying, "Hey, you should probably talk with that other person directly about that." If they get that, great; you talk about what you want to talk about. If they don't get it, then this is where you need to eliminate yourself out of that situation because you cannot allow gossip in your field. You don't want to. Nobody wants to, really, because life is so much better without it; there's joy; there's happiness; there's relaxation; there's rewards; there's being acknowledged. All the good stuff is outside of gossiping. There's nothing good in gossiping. So you want to be ready to actually leave the situation. How I did it with my uncle Ludwig: I have a really judgmental uncle, which I absolutely love, and he's now not with us anymore in the body, but he used to be superjudgmental. So as children, we didn't know how to deal with it. We just had to be in a certain way with Uncle Ludwig. When I got older, and I was living on my own, I would call up Uncle Ludwig and his, my aunt, and he would pick up, and here's what he would say, "Oh, it's about time you called. Gosh, you know, you never call. This has been ages that you called," right? Every time. So I said to him, "Well, I'm hearing you're really glad that I'm calling. That's awesome. Hey, and if you want to talk to me earlier, just call me. You know, you got my number too, don't you?" Silence. Okay. He's thinking about the next judgment. Okay? Then he goes on, and he says, "Well, you know, your brother; your brother is really, I mean, impossible. He did this and that and this and that." And this would go on every time I call him, and I endure this, and I try to tell him how good my brother is, and I'm sorry about that, blah, blah, blah. You probably know what I'm talking about. Yeah. So one day I decided I'm going to say my typical spiel about you can call me, you know, but I'm also going to say something about my brother. And I did number one and did number two, and he did not listen. He kept going on about my brother, and then I said to him, "Uncle Ludwig, I'm going to tell you I'm actually going to hang up the phone right now. I don't want you to talk about my brother. I don't want you to talk bad about my brother with me. If you have anything to say to my brother, say it to him personally. But from now on, I will not talk bad about my brother whatsoever. And if this is okay with you, we can continue the conversation. Otherwise, I'm going to have to go." And I thought our relationship is gone. I thought, this is now the end, but I was willing to jeopardize it or to sacrifice it. You know what he said? He's like, "Huh, huh, huh! Huh. Okay, well, well, how are you doing?" And I'm telling you, for seven years after that, until he died, not one time did he bring up my brother. It was so direct for him. It was so clear. I'm going to hang up the phone. He knew it; he got it. You know? So sometimes you need to do that with people. You may not need to be as direct as I just shared, but you may be able to just say, "Okay, hey, I'm going; I'm going to see you later." You know, "Let's talk about it some other time. I'm going to see you later." Or "I got to go." Yeah, you can make it more soft than I did it. The reason why I gave you this example is that you see something good can actually come out of a real boundary. Either way, get yourself out of gossip. Yeah. Now, what we need to do in order to get out of gossip is we need to create a faculty in our mind that actually changes the judge that's in our mind. Yeah. Because we obviously have a judge in our mind that has been created from childhood on. Because from little children on, we were told we're good if we're doing something good and we're bad if we're doing something bad, right? It's like you are either good or bad, and that depends on your behavior, which is not a correct reality. We're always good. Our behavior may not be appropriate, or it may lead to certain results that we may like or not like. But the parenting is not always that aware of that. So every challenge of creating a judge in their minds, that's actually the judge of their parent, and that's judging them for doing something either good or bad. That judge gets internalized, and at the age of five, you start judging yourself harshly already. You really don't need a parent anymore to judge you. So this is a tough one to unlearn, but it's an important one to unlearn. And here is how I suggest you start. Start pointing out the things that are positive and good about you from today on; start writing a gratitude list about your life and about yourself and the people around you. I want to encourage you to do that gratitude list every morning when you drink your tea or your coffee. Remember how we talked about gratitude being that antidote to negativity? It comes really handy here in this phase where you're literally marinating in this high frequency, and judgment will be coming out, and you'll bump against judgment quite a bit as your frequency raises, and you'll literally need an antidote for that. Okay? This will then also help you eliminate negative thinking and judgment in the long run because your hypothalamus, the gateway to your consciousness, will become used to you thinking that gratitude is a very important feeling and thought, and it'll let everything in that has to do with gratitude because it's considered relevant, And therefore it'll become easier and easier for you to do things that you're grateful for and to live in gratitude. Yeah, it's very rewarding, and it's sort of compound interest. Yeah. The more you do it, the more, more, more, more it gets, and the better your results are. And another beautiful exercise is to think of things that are good about other people. When you're driving past people, you're in the train or you are, you know, in a taxi, train your brain to look for the good. You can make it a habit to choose a quality each day that you're actually looking for. So for example, in the morning programming, I'll ask, I ask you to think of a quality that you want to embody that day. Yeah. It's really fun to actually look at the world from that quality, of quality filter, and you're looking for that in each person. So let's say your quality that you chose is love. Then you look for love. You look at the people that are standing somewhere on the street and your first thought is, "Oh my gosh, look how fat they are. They're unhealthy." You know, I'm going to be really blunt here. And then the next thought you're going to put on top of that is, "Look how much they love each other. They probably love food a lot. They probably love life a lot. They probably would love to have better bodies. You know, their love is probably very big and strong." Ooh, all of a sudden you think really positive about these people. And then you go to the next one. You see the parent with the child, you know, and the dog on the leash and, and earlier you may have thought, "Oh my gosh, you know, I'm so glad I don't have a dog that I need to walk right now." Or you may think, "Oh, you know, this, this mom looks old," or whatever the brain can come up with; it always can comes up with negative stuff. You just tell it, "Oh my gosh, look at that love. Look at the love for the child, the love for the dog. Look at that family love, the love for their future." Imagine them aspiring into a beautiful future. Right? When you do that, it actually raises your joy throughout the day. I noticed that in myself, that when I was driving to work in Germany with the train, I would look at all the people, and what I would look for naturally was what healing they needed. I always saw, "Oh, they need that heal," or "They need that heal," emotional, physical, whatever it is. So I was working the whole time. Those two hours that I'm on the train, I'm working and thinking about what people need and sort of giving them that energy, but I also gave them negative energy because I was thinking there was something wrong with them, and I got that negative energy back. Remember, the energy you give comes back to you. So then I changed it, and I said, "I'm looking for the love" or the joy or the gratitude, the peace, whatever I chose that morning, and then I'm looking for the love, and I'm having such a better time. I can see love, even in an angry person. It's possible: they have love for being right. They have love for changing this situation right now. They're really passionate about that. That's why they're so angry. Easy, and you actually feel better. So your frequency rises from that to 200, which is positive, and maximum 500, 550, which is where we want it. Yeah. If you're having a really hard time with that, if you are having a really hard time with getting out of any kind of judgment, remember, go back to my story where I talked about the third level of gratitude. You're going to do a full-on collage. So that means you never, never, never want to stay in anything that's lower than gratitude. So just whatever you have to do to get to that gratitude level, to that higher level, do it because that's where all the rewards lie. Okay, I hope I explained that well, good. I want to encourage you to practice this, and I'm cheering you on. You got this. You can live a gossip-free life, and you can live a high vibrational life where you're in a jet stream of your higher self, getting more and more fulfillment every day, and use tools such as music, movies, books, time you spend, wherever you spend it, the people you spend it with, and choose those things wisely so they actually feed your high vibration. Simple. Yeah. Now, as you know how to remove the conscious obstacles from your day, you can also now go to the higher self, and we can let the higher self remove your unconscious obstacles. Your energy work for today is we're going to have a healing session with the higher self, and we're going to remove the unconscious obstacles that you're not aware of that are in your energy field, that could be hindering you from your success, from reaching your purpose or from even hearing your higher self talking to you. Whatever it is, I'm going to ask you to be really open for that healing. Say "Whatever I need to heal and have let go of in order for me to reach my next level, I'm willing to," and then allow it. I'm going to see you in the energy session, and then I'm going to see you in the next lesson. Thank so much. You're doing amazing. You're really doing amazing, and I honor you for being here. Aloha.

====================

LESSON 11 – Meditation: Healing Session With Your Higher Self

Make yourself comfortable. Sit in a position where your spine can be upright. Your chin is slightly tucked the tongue on the roof of the mouth, and your gaze goes gently up towards the third eye as if you're looking out of your forehead. And take three deep breaths as you're taking deep breaths. Send your light roots out of your feet and your perineum down into the heart of the planet, and breathe all the way down into those roots and into the heart of the planet. And when you breathe in, recharge from the planet with fresh life force energy. And when you breathe out, release your step energy. Notice how your energy gets clearer and clearer as you do this. Breathing in recharging, breathing out, letting go. And then send the light rod up from your crown chakra all the way up to source. Oh God, breathe out through that rod releasing you, step energy that way, and breathing in fresh energy from God's source. The focus here is on inspiration. Letting go of whatever hinders your inspiration, your guidance, anything that you need to be on purpose and recharging with what you need to be on purpose, on your inhalation. And then breathe into your heart chakra from both directions. Focusing now on unconditional love, that you're breathing in from the heart of the planet and the heart of creation into your own beautiful heart. Filling it up with love, energy on the inhale and exhaling anything that could hinder this unconditional love. Your perfect loving. Continue to do this in your own rhythm. And now we're calling on the violet flame, calling Archangel Z, Archangel Z, Archangel Z. Please let the violet flame burn on the person listening to my voice, transforming everything into the next high vibration. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you for calling on Archangel Michael. Archangel Michael. Archangel Michael. Please create a protection shield and strengthen the protection shield around the person listening to my voice and also create a protection shield around that space that we're going to be traveling in. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Now we're calling on a light shower to uplevel your frequency. The light shower is coming down from the divine source, showering over you and into you rinsing, clearing your energy furthermore and activating your energy as well. With this light. Visualize beautiful light as bright as sunlight on water coming through you and around you, washing your aura clean as well. Every cell is absorbing this light. Every molecule is every atom. Your energy body is being fed in this moment from this beautiful light shower as well as it is washed off. Any remnants of you stop energy. And now that you're clear and your vibration is raised up, that elevator shows up in front of you, a beautiful golden elevator that takes you to your higher self. You approach the elevator and the door opens for you. You enter, you see the buttons, and you press the highest button that says higher self. And on the count of three, the elevator takes off and takes you straight to your higher self. 1, 2, 3, taking off through the dimensions and timelines going higher and higher and higher, being magnetically pulled in by your higher self as well. Until you reach the highest level, the door opens and the light beings are welcoming you, taking you by the hand and leading you to your higher self that is happily awaiting. You already go see your higher self, feel your higher self, immerse yourself with your higher self. Whatever comes to you will be perfect. Just allow an energy exchange the way it feels right for you in this moment. And then you're being guided by your higher self into the healing room, the emerald room you enter. And allow the room to be perceived by your senses the way it is appropriate for you right now. Feel it, see it. Imagine it intended. There are emeralds all around beautiful emerald vortex in the middle of the room, and an emerald bed that's soft and comfortable also in the middle of that room. And you lay on that bed, green angels of Archangel Raphael's leak surrounding you. And you just ask for all the obstacles to be removed that are possibly hindering your next level. And you can ask this in your own words, obstacles that hinder your mission. Your next steps, or any aspect in your life can be removed here. So go ahead and use your own words and just ask for any obstacle to be removed that you need out of your way, And then allow that to happen. The angels are working in your aura. Ganesha is showing up the removal of obstacles and is helping you remove obstacles in your daily life and in your future. The obstacles are actually removing other obstacles with themselves. So it creates an aval of clearing right now in your system. Obstacles with other people and in situations are being removed. And all of this is happening in a way that is accompanied with ease and grace. This is a command we're giving ease and grace only. And therefore, in divine timing, just to clear your willingness to let it all go. Whatever is hindering you, give permission and all the obstacles are being dissolved into pure energy from where they came from. So you will also have more energy available. A few more moments as the angels are finishing up, Kenisha is finishing up, and you can ask for obstacles to be removed for other people as well in these last moments. And that will continue after you are already back in your body. I, And then give thanks to the angels, Ganesha, and your higher self. You get up from the bed refreshed, renewed, full of positive energy, conviction, and you're gonna succeed more easily. And things work out sly effortlessly. Tell your brain that inform your brain, command it to creating more and more ease. And you're being guided back out of this room by your higher self. Say goodbye to all the healers and your higher self. And the light beings are taking you back to the elevator. The door opens, you enter and you press the lowest button to your body. And on the count of three, the elevator goes down and takes you back to your body. 1, 2, 3, going down through the dimensions and timelines going down further and further into more and more density to where your body is sitting in meditation. Until, until you reach the lowest level, the door opens and you walk back into your body and anchor this experience. Anchor yourself back into your body by breathing down into your roots all the way down to the earth, heart of the planet, three to five times in your own rhythm. This is an important part. So stay focused here. And then wiggle your hands and feet. Massage your body a little bit. Massage your knees, your rests your ears. Wake up your body with positive energy. Tell it something good. Tell it you love it. Override some of the negative thoughts you may have had about it. Realizing this is your servant that's doing the best it can to help you be a beneficial presence here on the planet. And I'm welcoming you back into the body and into this experience of your life. Breed of obstacles, clear and ready to go. Blessings, aloha.

LESSON 12 – Apply Practical Tools for Clear Guidance from Your Higher Self
--------------------
<v ->Congratulations; you've made it so far already.</v> This is amazing. I'm so proud of you. You have now access to your higher self. You have gotten in touch with your soul purpose, and you have the tools to actually eliminate anything that keeps your vibration low. That's a very powerful place to be in. Now, from here, we can only go up. You are already at a high level. I'm assuming your frequency is above 350 right now, and we can now create a lifestyle out of that. Have you noticed any difference since you're at that high level? Have you noticed people responding to you differently? Have you noticed that things work out better for you? Ask yourself, you know, are you noticing even subtle changes? Right now, we're going to go up to the absolute high level, and if you would like to go deeper later, at some point, I'll share at the end of how you can dive deeper with this also. There are a few options, but right now what we're doing is we're creating that lifestyle that lives on that jet stream of the higher self. And as you know, in a hot air balloon, when you hit the jet stream, that's when you take off. You basically start rolling in one direction with way less power, with much more speed and ease. Yeah, and it probably feels very fun. I haven't been in a hot air balloon yet, but I'd love to. So now that you've learned how to eliminate obstacles, let's talk about how you can enhance your vibration. There are some tools that can enhance your vibration and therefore keep your higher self close to you and keep you close to your higher self. One of the easiest tools is what I mentioned in our first module. We're bringing it basically full circle right now in this module. The tool I mentioned is raising your vibration through mastering your energy. So if you use the tools from the first module every morning and every evening-in other words, if you are doing your morning programming and your evening programming, you are always raising your vibration. But now you're going to have momentum, more and more momentum, and that momentum builds upon itself. And it's really like an avalanche, that it starts with a little snowball, and the bigger the snowball becomes, the more results you see. So keep going. Yeah, keep going with your morning programming, your evening programming, and your recharging throughout the day. Now that you're at the higher self level, you can also use your nighttime in an even better way to accelerate your vibration. Remember, the last thought you go to bed with is where you dwell all night, and you've been using this till now. You can actually travel up to the higher self and spend all night at the higher self. This is a very high level of nighttime programming, and you can use the first session where we met the higher self for that. Yeah, you just go up there. You spend time with your higher self; you spend time in the emerald room, and it actually totally enhances your night. You just need to remember to come back down in the morning, and you can't forget about that. I actually did forget it once, and I went onto the tram, and I left everything in the tram. I left my jacket in the tram. It was winter. I took my jacket off. I don't know why. I left it in the tram. I was freezing cold. I left my my keys there, and thankfully one of my clients saw me, talked with me there, and saw me leaving it and brought it later to me to the practice where I was working, but I was just out of my mind, which is what happens when you're not really fully in the body. So you want to remember to come back to the body in the morning, travel down. You probably know the steps by now. If not, you'll practice them a little more. And what I do is I literally take a pillow and put it on the ground next to my bed so that when I get up in the morning, I would stumble over the pillow. That's my reminder. If I'm stumbling over the pillow, I can remember, did I go down or not? If I didn't, I'll go down then. Okay, so go back down. But you can use your higher self for the whole night recharge. And today we're going up to the higher self, and we will ask questions there about your manifestation. So this will enhance your whole experience, your whole vibration, because we will get information from the higher self as of what you are actually meant to manifest. And then you can use the manifestation module, the part where we learned about manifestation, informed by the higher self, and manifest your next higher thing, your next best thing, and continue to do that. Yeah. So therefore, your higher self will tell you what you need in order to fulfill your life purpose. Yeah. Is that exciting? Here's how you can integrate all of the tools you learned so far. I'm going to give you an example. In August, I had a whole group of higher self masters visit me at my house in Hawaii, and we did a mastermind for the masters. And what was so interesting to me was that they shared that even though they were using the tools since about a year, and they had really great results, they all had that jet stream of higher self experience, and they did a whole master training with me. So they had already broken through their own ceiling and literally accomplished things that they never thought were possible. They nevertheless were surprised when they saw how I'm using the tool in my daily life. And so that led me to think to actually share it. So I'm sharing with you how a day can look like, for example, if you're using the tools every day. So I get up in the morning, and before I get up, I'm laying in my bed, and I'm looking at my collage. That's where my eyes fall. I see my collage, and I let the feelings of that collage come to me. I feel as if this feelings and the experience and the imagination about it washes over me. So I already feel bathed in that energy. And then I get up, and I go straight to my kitchen. I make my tea, and when I make my tea, I do gratitude. So I'm thinking of what I'm grateful for. This, I'm grateful for. This, I'm grateful for. This, I'm grateful for. Sometimes my husband's up at the same time; we do gratitude together while we sip the tea, or, if we have guests, we do the same. Yeah, gratitude comes first. It's a very beautiful vibration in the house, as you can imagine. And then we go into the meditation room, and we meditate, starting with the morning programming; we'll do the whole morning programming. We have a little bit of music also before that; my husband plays the harmonium and music. After that, I'll do a prayer, and then we sit silent in meditation for about an hour. So I have one and a half hours of meditation in the morning. You don't have to have that, but I just love it so much, and you will also love it afterwards. And it's my time. It's a time where I tell myself I don't have to do; I get to be. And so then I'm sitting in meditation. And in meditation, after the morning program when I already have removed all the obstacles, connected with the people on the high level, brought everybody up to speed, when I grounded myself, got myself plugged into the right energy so it draws into me every day, created a protection and a radiance tool. So I'm energizing the world, and I'm not getting bogged down by the world. Then I'm sitting in silent meditation, and I'm opening myself up to my higher self. Sometimes I travel up to the higher self, actually spend time there, ask my higher self about the day, what I need to know or about the week, or I ask for help. And sometimes I'm just sitting in silence being with my higher self or the angels or other higher beings that want to connect with me. Then I come out of meditation. My son gets up, and we make breakfast. When we make breakfast, we put the violet flame on everything. In the morning programming, everybody has the violet flame on, but I'm putting the violet flame on the food as well. And then we bless the food. So we make sure the food is actually energized before we eat it. And then I'm taking my son to school. On the way to school, he does the morning programming, and he does a short version because he's a teenager. Even as a child, he did a very short version. So he gets to school energized, connected, obstacles removed, connection made with other people. Same thing that we do. Only he does it like in three minutes. Yeah. And then I drop him off. On the way back to school, I'm listening to a talk. So I'm feeding my mind. I'm feeding my mind with positive energy, with good input. Yeah. So when I arrive at home, I'm fed on an emotional level, on a mental level, and on a physical level, and I'm protected. I have all the tools going. This-I'm up for the best day of my life. Yeah. And then I work with clients. And then in between I energize. I go out to the ocean; I go to a tree. I quickly recharge with energy. Right now I went to the tree as well, in between sessions here, and recharged, and that way I don't run out of energy. So all these tools work all day for us. Yeah, and you can plug them in wherever you want. Then in the evening, my son comes home from school; we play, and in the evening before I go to bed, I sit down, and I do the evening programming, where I clear myself of the day, recharge again because if I have a recharge energy, I can actually use the nighttime to restore even better. And then I go to my higher self and spend all night at the higher self before I wake up in the morning, go down from the higher self, and look at my collage. Simple. Simple, but it's strategic. And as these tools start working, they actually flow so powerfully that everybody who's been with me in the higher self mastery, they saw that this life is a life of synchronicities. Everything seemingly aligns as if you have a personal assistant that does everything for you nonstop and has everything cleared already before you get there. Now the higher self: when do I connect with the higher self and ask these questions? I can not-I don't have to do it every morning. I can sometimes just do it every other morning or minimum once a week. So I recommend go once a week minimum to your higher self. Yeah. Now, manifestation, that's another story. Manifestation is not necessarily something you do every day or every week. What you do every day or every week is you look at your soul magnet or your collage. You give that energy. Yeah. I also have my soul magnet on my phone. I have it in my bathroom; I have it on my dashboard. So I'm giving energy to my manifestation all day long. But to actually do a manifestation, you only do that when you're literally changing what you're manifesting. When you have achieved one thing, then you do a new manifestation with the session that I gave you in order to achieve the next thing, and then you employ the soul magnet on a daily level. Now, have you noticed that most of what I shared with you doesn't take much time. It happens during the time we're doing something anyway, except for my meditation in the morning and in the evening, and that's how it should be. That's how these things actually work for a busy person. Yeah. Now, the morning and the evening, I will tell you, saves you time. So the half hour you take in the morning and the 15 minutes you take in the evening save you at least three hours of time, of obstacles and deviations that you otherwise would have. And I have hundreds of testimonials that attest that. So I encourage you to try it out. Most importantly, keep raising your vibration to stay on that jet stream. Yeah. And since your vibration is high, you will get into a mode where your manifestation comes instantly. For example, you want to manifest that chai latte? Boom. Somebody calls and says, "Hey, I brought you chai latte," or you want to manifest a parking spot? It's there. You might want to manifest that new friend. They come and they show up. You just sent that wish out, consciously or unconsciously, and it shows up. You want to manifest a beautiful surprise. Somebody surprises you. Instant manifestation happens when you're at that high level. We call them synchronicities, but they're really instant manifestations. Yeah, it's that jet stream of the higher self. This is where it becomes really practical. This is where the rubber meets the road, and you can use the higher self for anything else as well, for solving problems with somebody. You have a problem with someone, you go up, and you see their reality, like I shared earlier; solves the problem instantly. You know what to do. So once the higher self lifestyle becomes your lifestyle, you will also want to attract friends into your life who are living on that level. You may be feeling a little bit isolated. You may be feeling different than other people. Do you? I hear that a lot. Actually, the number two thing that people want when they come to me is, other than, you know, finding their purpose, is literally connection. Because when you work on such a high level, not a lot of people actually can relate to you there. You want somebody who you can talk to about angels, about your higher self, about energy, and who can help you when you have a bad day, right? Instead of having negative communications where you're gossiping, you are going to be a person that says, calls a friend up, or says to somebody, "Hey, you know, I'm having difficulties with this and this. Can you help me remember who I really am? Can you help me remember that I have millions of possibilities and I'll get through this? Can you help me remember what the positive news is about that?" That's how you're going to share about negativity. You don't need to eliminate it and not share about it, but you share about it solution oriented. So it doesn't start a whole downward spiral of conversation. It actually gets an upward spiral. But you need a person that can relate to you on that level. So I recommend just making a wish into the universe and say, "Dear universe, bring me the friends that are aligned to my frequency or higher so that I can literally share this with them." If you want, you can make that wish right now. Say it in your own words and they can come to you. Yeah. This is important, that you don't do this alone. It's important that you have a community, and you have a community here in Mindvalley, already a community of awake people. Come to the events, you know; do that because it really helps you. It is said that the new awakening is not through an individual, not through an avatar that comes. It is through communities. It's through people coming together, and you can see why. Yeah. Earlier in the Quest we talked about your soul purpose, and you learned about asking your higher self yes and no questions. Now, in this lesson, I want to teach you about open-ended questions. You are more advanced now. You hopefully have been practicing all your tools, which will have heightened your frequency, and as your frequency is higher, your pineal gland and your pituitary gland in your brain will be more active. Those are the glands that transmit energy into the higher realms and receive energy from the higher realms. With that, your clair senses are activated. That is your clairvoyance, your clairaudience, your clairsentience. Yeah. By the way, those senses will come more and more on board the longer you actually practice this. If you end up practicing in a group with your friends, or if you come on board with our tribe membership, then you'll get that even more activated. So it's very rewarding, and it gets better and better. What I want to share with you about the open-ended question is it takes a little bit more skill to perceive these answers. Your higher self can give you pictures if you're a visual person, and you can literally see images and movies in front of your mind's eye. They will not be as clear as a movie that you can see with your physical eyes. You'll perceive those movies similar to what you see in a dream. If you're an auditory person, you'll hear the messages. You may get a sensory information, which the majority of people do. About 75% of the people that go to their higher self will actually sense the information rather than see it or hear it. Yeah. If you sense it, it comes as a hunch, an intuitive sense. It does not come as a feeling in your physical body. It's more like if you have a hunch that somebody's coming to visit you or somebody's going to call you and the phone rings, you sort of know who it is. That's how that sense comes to you, yeah, no matter which way you are receiving the answers from your higher self. You need to make sure that you're not invested in that question, that you're really neutral to the answer. If you're very invested in that question, you really have to have a certain answer, then it's harder to hear it correctly because your brain will fiddle in there and will try to control the outcome. So try to be neutral to the answer. If you're really invested, ask a friend to go up to their higher self for you. Remember the example where we talked about the child? When you are a child, and you go open through the world, you don't judge things, and you don't think about whether they're real or not real. I want to remind you to go up to your higher self without attitude. I found a good comparison for this. I want to give you an example for that because I actually have that happen often. My clients come to me- just, I think, a few weeks ago, one of my favorite clients came- actually all my clients are my favorites. She came and she said, "You know, I'm just not sure that I'm getting the right messages." Now with her, I can tell you, she's so clairvoyant. She's so totally on target with her messages. I totally know she's completely tuned in, but yet she's not believing the messages. You know what I told her, I said-it came to me. I was really grateful for that download- "So if I were to ask you if you're really sure if you love your child, what would you tell me?" She said, "I'm sure." "Well then, I'm going to ask you, how are you sure? Are you just thinking you love your child?" She's like, "No, not really." "Are you feeling it?" "Yeah." So she started questioning her love for her child. You know, how does that show up? How can she be sure? And she realized the longer she questioned whether she loves her child or not, whether she's just making it up, she had to admit that she could as well make it up. She can't guarantee that she loves her child or she's making it up because it feels the same. If you're making up something and you believe it-feels the same. So I told her, "You're also not questioning that love, are you? You just know you love it." There are a lot of things in life that we don't question. We don't question that we are actually drawing in oxygen, even though we don't know if it's oxygen or whatever we're drawing in. Yeah. So the same thing comes here. Don't question the answers from your higher self all the time, because-I want you to hear this- anything you question will become questionable. Anything you question will become questionable. If you question somebody bringing you flowers- and whether they mean it, they actually love you; that's why they bring flowers, or they just feel obligated- you lost it already. Don't question it. Take it. Go with an open mind, and you'll have so much fun. So for your energy work today, I'll guide you up to your higher self, and we'll be manifesting from your higher self; we'll actually ask your higher self what you need to manifest in order to reach that true soul level fulfillment. And this could be finding out your purpose if you don't know it yet and then manifesting that. Or it could be manifesting something that is on your life's purpose, that's on target with your life's purpose. Either way, it's going to lead to true soul level fulfillment. Are you excited about this? Gosh, I'm so grateful I get to do this with you. This is so powerful. Thank you for being here. Again, set time aside. This will take about 30 minutes. I'm sending you so much love, and aloha. Blessings, and I'll see you in the next lesson. I'm so proud of you.

====================

LESSON 12 – Meditation: Communicating With Your Higher Self Meditation

This is the meditation where we're asking open-ended questions. Take a few deep breaths. Center yourself in this now moment with every inhalation you take. Come more into this moment with every exhalation you take. Let go of what was before and what will be later. And then start sending your white light roots down into the heart of the planet, out of both of your feet and your perineum between your legs and curling these roots inside the heart of the planet in that crystal. And once they're deeply anchored there, you start breathing out into the roots, letting go of any used of energies that you have in your system right now. And breathing in fresh life. Force energy from the planet with every breath, you recharge more and you let go of more you up. Energy. One more breath. And then you focus on your crown chakra and send that light rod up through the dimensions all the way to source, anchor, anchoring yourself deeply and source God, however you wanna call it. And then breathe out to source like a whale. Spout out all the way up and in from. Source the answer. Do this in your own rhythm. Breathing out, letting go. Breathing in, recharging. Beautiful. One more breath, And then let go of that thought and focus on your heart chakra. Breathing into your heart chakra from both directions. As you breathe in, you recharge your heart chakra with unconditional love. And as you breathe out, you'll release what hinders unconditional love in both directions. One more breath. Wonderful. Now you recharge. You're connected. Now we're calling on a protection shield. Archangel Michael. Archangel Michael. Archangel Michael, please create a protection shield of light around the person listening to my voice and around this space that we're gonna be traveling in. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. We calling on the divided flame. Please let the viol flame burn on the person listening to my voice. Please set it burned for as long as it's perfect for everyone involved. And men were calling on the light shower, visualize or allow or intend a light shower to come down over you from the divine showering over you and into you, clearing and cleaning you, recharging you. Your body all functions, all cells, all atoms are being recharged and filled. Your aura, the emotional body, the mental body, the spiritual body are being cleaned, cleared, and recharged from this beautiful light shower, your frequency is being raised up higher and higher by the second. Beautiful. Wonderful. Now your frequency is raised high and you allow that elevator to appear in front of you. See the golden door opening. Walk into the elevator, press the highest button to your higher self, and on the count of three, the elevator takes off to your higher self. 1, 2, 3, going up through the dimensions in timelines, higher and higher and higher. You're being pulled up and at some point you'll reach the highest level. The door opens, you exit out of the elevator, and you're being received from these beautiful light beings that you already know, that feel so familiar, warm, and welcoming. They take you by the hand and guide you over to your higher self in such grace, such appreciation. And you see or feel your higher self, you perceive it in any way. How does your higher self feel today? Do an energy exchange. Allow the higher self to fill you with its appreciation, with its love for you. That's unconditional. It's not dependent on what you ever did or didn't do. It's completely free of any judgment. Just allow that in. How does it feel to be fully accepted and appreciated? I, and then your higher self guides you over into the teaching room. Become aware of this room, the way it shows up for you. And take a seat at the table with your higher self. And now you're ready to ask an open-ended question. What question do you have today? You can ask questions such as, what is my life purpose? What is my mission in life that I need to fulfill right now? Or what is my first step? Fulfill my mission? Or any other question, just ask away. Perceive the answer from your higher self. Let it in through all your channels. You may see some pictures, some movies portrayed on the screen. You may hear some messages. You may feel a sense of understanding and you may get a certain feeling. And try to remember when you felt that way, what that feeling could possibly mean. What could your higher self be telling you right now? If you knew it, you can ask for clarification or for more specifics and just always let the answer come in, even if it only comes osm automatically just by osmosis. You absorb the answer A few more minutes. Good. Beautiful. Then give thanks to your higher self And know that you'll be back many more times and you'll be getting clearer and clearer answers. You can also ask you higher self to bring you an answer via your dream or the next morning when you're waking up and ask it for support. Whichever support you need right now, and give thanks again. As you prepare to go back, you walk towards the elevator with the light beings that are guiding you. You see or feel a sense or allow the door to open for you. Whichever way of perception that's working for you right now, use that. Enter the elevator, press the lowest button and travel down on the count of three. 1, 2, 3. Traveling down through the dimensions and timelines all the way to where your body is sitting in meditation. And once you've reached the bottom level, the door opens, you exit and you walk back into your body. Anchor yourself by grounding down minimum three times into your roots, sending your breath through your roots, down into the heart of the planet and up from there two more times. Beautiful. Then wiggle your hands and feet like yourself, back up in the body. Say something positive about your body. It's doing such a good job, working so hard for you. We sometimes judge our bodies. You say something beautiful, unjudgmental and loving. Wiggle your hands and feet and open your eyes. Welcome back. Now, write down the answers you have gotten. Sit a little bit longer just to marinate in that energy and then repeat this session. Anytime you need more input, Aloha.

====================

LESSON 13 – Continue to Elevate: Build Momentum for Overflowing Energy and Purpose
--------------------
<v ->Woohoo.</v> Congratulations. You've done it. You have all the tools. I'm celebrating you. This is amazing. You are now part of the small percentage of the people on the planet that have access to their higher self, that know how to master their energy and that know how to manifest. I'm telling you, you can do anything, anything with that. You can use any course you've ever taken, any course you will take, in a strategic way so it propels you in the right direction. You'll have all the information you need. I love that, and it's my goal to see more and more people have that. I'm envisioning-I'm sharing this with you right now-that how we have yoga in every town nowadays, and yoga just started small. I'm envisioning everyone having access to their higher selves. So each town having a higher self group available soon in the future, where people go to their higher selves, and they ask the questions, and they live their life informed by the higher self. Can you imagine what kind of planet we'd have when we do that? You're part of that right now. I am welcoming you into this group of high-minded higher self masters. You're now a higher self master. What did we do? We started you with mastering your energy. That means you have the metaphysical tools and the knowledge and hopefully also the habits that create an overflow of energy at all times. So you have the freedom to live your life the way you want it. That overflow of energy helps your vibration, so you can attract anything you need in form of money, health, love, success, whatever it is. Because remember, a higher vibration attracts higher vibrational experiences to you. Then you have the tools of manifestation to literally and deliberately create what you want to create with that extra energy, and you know how to create it, and you know what not to do: not to think about what you don't want. And you know about the soul magnet, which is that missing piece that many people don't know about. That helps you to actually bring the manifestation into your lap. So you can be successful. Anytime you need something, you manifest it. In fact, my husband said to me, "You know what? Next month I'm going to be in California, and I need you to take care of our house payments." Now remember, my house payments were $500 a month when I started in Germany. My house payments right now are $14,000 a month. So I manifested $14,000 right then, and I've been manifesting $20,000 the next month and another $14,000 the next month because we needed it. Just extra, you know, I just manifest it. He asked me, "Hey, can you count on it?" And I'm like, "I can't count on it." Depending on my frequency, if I have a high frequency, I can count on it. So I can't count on the money. By thinking about whether I have it or looking at my bank account, I'm drawing it in. And that's how I'm drawing in my friends, the most amazing experiences. And you know, also an overflow of money, with extra money in the bank account, whatever you want, you know, health, all of that. This is at your fingertips right now. Yeah, so then we got you onto the higher self, which means you have a high vibration where happiness lies, so I already know that your life is more happy, more fulfilling, and more filled with ease than it was before. I also know that you're more guided, and you are more directional with using your resources, your energy, and everything that you have in the direction to fulfill your life purpose. And therefore, I know that you have more fulfillment. You're now a higher self master. You have the tools to access your higher self. You can communicate with your higher self, and you can stay on that high level by continuing the habit stacking. And this is where I'm like superexcited about what I'm going to share with you right now, because not only did we deliver the tools to you in this Quest, where you learned you know how to do what, but we're also delivering the routine for you. We're making it easy. The routine for you that you need to use in order to have a daily habit that supports this lifestyle, and this routine is what I shared in the earlier lesson with you in my daily routine, is the morning programming and the evening programming. Those two tools basically have all the aspects within them that are in all the modules. They bring them together, and they bring them together in a very structured way so that when you do the morning programming and the evening programming, you actually are constantly doing the tools that I asked you to do. It only excludes the recharge; the recharge you do throughout your day. But how do you like that? This is like delivering it on a silver plate for you. And the reason why I do this is I know it's actually hard to create a routine out of something and to implement something in your life. It's actually not easy, and therefore we created that habit stacking for you, and hopefully you're still doing that. And I'm delivering you the morning and the evening routine. When you do that, what happens is you are amplifying your manifestations; you're cleaning your energy body; you are recharging your energy body. You are evening out obstacles with other people, so you actually go smoothly into your day. You eliminate deviations or interruptions because you're already having an effect on the energy of the day from that perspective, and you are creating an overflow of energy for yourself so that you don't run out of energy, and you feed the world, and you feed your manifestation. All of that in the morning programming. As I mentioned, this morning programming will save you at least three hours of time. Over the years, you know, I've looked at what happens when people do it and when they don't do it, also in my own life or in our friends' lives, and we kind of came up with that equation, and it seems to be pretty accurate because you're saving that in distractions because you already created this streamlined timeline. You're saving it in misinterpretations or misunderstandings because you align with the other people better, on a higher level. You're saving it in deviations or problems because you're eliminating obstacles. You're saving it from being in a form of energy loss where you're slow or you're not responding right or you need extra nap time- because you have extra energy. So this is very exciting, and if you want more, come meet me. Work with my membership. I wanted to share with you that I do have a membership where you can come into and actually work with other higher self masters. So if you're interested in that, come find me. But by all means, use this community that you're already in. Right now, you can share about your experience in this Quest in the Mindvalley Community and share with your Tribe in the Mindvalley Community, with the like-minded people that are there, that are interested in things that you are interested in and share with them. I would love to see you sometime live in one of the sessions or in my membership or here in Mindvalley, in any of the events. And I just want you to succeed. Go on and multiply the good. I love you. Blessings. I honor you, and I see you. Aloha.
