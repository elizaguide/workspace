Preparation 1: Getting Ready for Unlimited Abundance
--------------------
<v ->Hi everyone and welcome to Unlimited Abundance.</v> My name is Vishen Lakhiani. I'm the founder of Mindvalley and I created this program with Christie Marie Sheldon, because of the sheer impact Christie's work has had on my life and the lives of thousands upon thousands of other students here on the Mindvalley platform. Before we get into unlimited abundance, I want to share with you how to look at the field of training for abundance or building wealth. We can look at that field from three different levels. The first level and what is most commonly thought is the Physical level. The physical level of what stocks do you invest in? Where do you place your money? How much of your salary do you keep and save? How do you do financial planning? All of these are physical level aspects of managing your wealth and many people are great at that and there are many different courses you can take on that. The next level is the Wealth mindset. The wealth mindset would be programs on say how millionaires think, programs on how to think about money in a healthy way. This is another level of training popularized by teachers like Ken Honda and T. Harv Eker. Now the third level is the Spiritual aspects of wealth. And this has to do with looking at money as energy, as an energy that flows through you and understanding that what you experience in life as a soul has to do with the energy which you bring into this life. This is what we're playing with today. So, you definitely want to pay attention to number one, ensure that you're reading books that you're aware of basic financial planning. You definitely want to pay attention to number two, reading books or autobiographies of great entrepreneurs or reading books on the mindset of money are wonderful. This third level though, is what many say is the most important. It's your energy body around wealth and this is Christie's gift. She is by far the number one teacher I found that is able to work in this field. Christie started out as a psychic and a healer, and she had done close to 10,000 different sessions with people and as she started doing these sessions, using her gift to observe people's energy, she noticed that one of the biggest blocks and frustrations that people were having in life were related to money, and with 10,000 sessions, and now it's close to 30,000, but that then, she started noticing this pattern, the 24 Abundance Blocks. And so, she began working directly with each block and working to heal people. What you're going to experience in this program is that healing. Now, this program was recorded several years ago. It was a thousand dollar program where 400 students signed up online to go through a live session with Christie, twice a week for 12 weeks. Christie worked with live training to heal their abundance blocks. She used a specific method called the Mold method, where she would get a sense of the 400 people who had called in and she would create sort of in her mind, a human mold that fits all of these 400 people. She would then apply the healing to the mold and when you are on the call, people would report feeling interesting sensations, interesting things. Following that 12 week experiment, what we found was astonishing. Christie sent an email survey to these 400 individuals to ask them how much extra income that you generate and not everyone replied, obviously, not everyone checked their email, not everyone completed the survey, but based on the replies for money that suddenly came to them through an inheritance, or through a promotion, or truer rates, or through a business that they were working on that suddenly became successful, we saw close to $4 million. Now, if you do the math, that's almost $10,000 per person. And that was based on the idea that not everyone replied. So this was a huge success, this course, this online course for these 400 people was so successful that we decided to sell the recordings and to lower the price. Not everyone could afford a thousand dollars, but what you're getting here are the recordings. Now the obvious question is, are the recordings as effective as the live session? What we have found working with countless healers across the world is that in many cases, yes, a healer, a good energy worker can infuse a recording with a power, with an energy where when you listen to this recording, you gain similar results. Is it as powerful as the live session? Obviously not, there is something magical of course about being live with Christie. But what you're about to listen to is more than just a recording. This recording is infused with an energy and when you go through this recording, you will see shifts happen in your life. I know because I'm extremely sensitive to energy. And when I listened to Christie's recordings, I feel energy flowing through my body. I go through this program myself, whenever I feel stuck on a particular abundance block. So, know that what you're about to experience is mystical, is powerful, but thousands of people, at this point, 50,000 students swear by this program. Now notice program is huge. It's 24 hours plus of content. and we want to make sure that it's you go through this, will you get the best results in a shorter time as possible. Not all of you are going to invest 24 hours and go through every audio. So, what we created is a simple diagnostic quiz to help you understand what are the audios that you need to focus on. Here's how the program works. The first block is extremely important. It's on clearing resistance. I want you, as soon as you've finished this video to go straight to that first block, block number one and listen to it. Now, as you listen to recording again, keep in mind that you're hearing the recording of Christie working with the initial batch of 400 people, but you are still going to experience a powerful shift. Now, after you remove Clearing Resistance, now, you do not have to listen to the other 23 audios in order, unless you want to, but if you are short of time, do the diagnostic quiz, answer the questions, it will take close to five minutes. That's all and the quiz will tell you what audios to focus on. After you've done the quiz, you now go to the specific audios relevant to you. The PDF workbook directly below this video will help you understand how the 24 audios are laid out and what is most relevant to you. But immediately when you are done with the first block clearing resistance, take the diagnostic quiz. Don't go to block number two, take the quiz to identify what is the next set of blocks for you to work on and then I recommend listen to one audio a day. So if you've been recommended five audios for your abundance block, listening to one a week means in five weeks, you will work to dramatically heal all five blocks. So there you have it. Let me recap how this program works. Number one, listen to the first session, Clearing Resistance. Number two, take the diagnostic quiz. The self-assessment that will help you figure out what set of audios are most relevant to you. And then number three, go and set a plan on your calendar to listen to those audios once a week or once a day, whatever works for you. You choose, don't feel a pressure or rush that you need to go through all five in one day or every other day. But what I recommend you do is mark on your calendar, hour long blocks to listen to the audios that you need to listen to, after you take the diagnostic quiz, and then you're done. You will experience a huge shift in how you approach money. Thank you for signing up for this program. One more thing, as part of this program, we also included a set of bonuses. Let me tell you what these bonuses do. The first bonus is a set of two additional audios Clearing Past Beliefs and the second one is Clearing Fundamental Blocks. So, after you've taken the self-assessment and you perceive the four to five to six audios necessary for your specific abundance block type, what I recommend you do is you listen to this bonus audio Clearing Past Beliefs and the second bonus audio, Clearing Fundamental Blocks, okay? So that's an additional two hours. It's optional, but doing this will help magnify and lock in the results. Now, the next bonus we have is for those of you who want a short daily meditation, and it's called 24 Hours of Love or Above, and this is to get you to buy break at the frequency of love. There is a morning meditation and an evening meditation. So, if you really enjoy meditating to Christie after you've done the one hour abundance session and you're waiting seven days to get to the next hour long abundance clearing session, you can use these morning and evening meditations to reconnect with Christie's voice and to help increase your vibration to the level of love or above. So thank you for being part of this program and I can't wait to hear your stories.

The 24 Abundance Blocks

====================

LESSON 1: Clearing Resistance

- Hey, this is Christie Marie and you're listening to a recording I did of a series of 24 live group sessions on clearing abundance blocks. And here's what we're going to cover in this session. First, I'm going to introduce you to energy. It's the good stuff that we're going to be working with. We'll talk a little bit about what it is, how you may or may not feel it, and give you some solid energy foundation to launch you into a successful Unlimited Abundance Journey program. Second, we're going to challenge many of the lies that people learn in life. Lies about change, lies about money and abundance. And we're going to break down many of these lies and the patterns that they create that often run us on autopilot without even being aware of it. And finally, we're going to start clearing out some of the old gunk. I'll introduce you to connecting to the light and some clearing statements that you can use to clear your energy and get things flowing. And we will begin clearing out the energy of the autopilot lies and patterns about change, money, and abundance. So let's begin. Hello. Welcome to Unlimited Abundance Journey. This is Christie Marie. Thank you so much for joining this program. I am so thrilled that you're here. I want to thank you for showing up, not for me necessarily, but I want to thank you for showing up for you. You know, often we don't acknowledge ourselves, and I want you to really get the download that you deserve it. I would love it right now if you grab a journal, a piece of paper, take some notes while we're doing this, be open to new awareness. And let's set our intent and what we hope to accomplish in this program. I know people don't normally say this kind of thing, but I want you to bring all your junk to the front. Yeah, bring all your baggage up so we can clear it tonight. And let's all begin a happy new abundant journey of, you know, a lot of gorgeous clearings. Now, when a group of people gather together for one big experience, there's this cool group energy structure that gets created, kind of like a family for a while. But I also made sure that I added into the energy structures that any future time you listen to this or any other future person is listening to this, you will receive whatever energy you need and have that come through as well. You know, time is something you can travel forward and backward in, and we can bring our energy past, present, or future. If you think about something from the past, you're connected to it. The same as imagining something in the future, you're connected to it. So people listening in the future is going to get some help too. And you're all here at the right place at the exact right time for you. What you attract to this energy field depends upon you. And it's all about you in this webinar. I can offer the energy. I can bring it forth. I can open the door. I can show you the way. But you must be the vessel that receives the energy. You're all aware beings. And even though we're working with this energy, and I get it, for some of you, this energy thing can feel like nothing. And for other people this energy thing can feel like a lot of intensity, but it doesn't matter if you feel or don't feel because even if you don't feel and you've shut off some of your feelings, you're going to start getting over it in this energy field. I've worked with over 10,000 people one-on-one, thousands more through my telecourses and courses, and you'll be able to feel and know that it's working for you at some point in the course, okay? So it might be a little whisper at first, it might be louder later on, or it might be a super duper loud in two seconds, okay? Everybody's different. And if you shut off your feelings, you're really not going to feel a lot, okay? But you'll see that there are signs that you might start feeling more relaxed, more peaceful, really cool things show up. You'll see signs, don't worry, that something new is happening. And this energetic level that we're going to be working with is who you are as a soul, as a conscious being. And eventually, hopefully within this 12 weeks, and I've seen it happen really fast in people when they're willing to tune in to the energy level that I'm talking about, you'll be able to really perceive the energy just like I do. And you'll know for sure that it's working for you. So trust me, as long as you're open, it's going to show up. We're bringing profound energy and enlightenment through this teleseminar. And if you have blocks on feeling, it means that you probably checked out at some time or felt that it wasn't safe to be here or be in your body, and all sorts of other things. So even though we're working on abundance, you're going to end up clearing those things too. Because the real thing with manifesting is you have to be willing to be present and ask for things to show up. And part of your being present is really connecting to your body and being in it, all right? So we're going to work on that. Now, have you ever noticed that sometimes you just look at things and it changes? I mean, you read something, you create a new awareness in that moment. You overhear somebody talking, it creates a new awareness. And by looking at things, just being aware of something new, things change. And even in science, they've proved that. If you look at a molecule, the molecule will move according to the energy and the perception of the person viewing it. So if the person looking at it thought it would bounce across the room, that's what it would do. If the other person looked at it and they thought it would move in circles, that's what the molecule of light would do. So just by you showing up and listening with intent is going to change you, just that. So just by being you changes a lot of things. So thank you for being here. All right, so your energy and light. And in this course, I'm going to tune in to the energetic vibration that is truly you. For some of you, this is a little kind of off the charts, not normal to talk about. But as we know, everything is energy, and this energy and this light is basically the prima materia, the pure consciousness that runs through every object that's on this planet, a rock, a tree, every energy that runs through the atoms that holds everything together is consciousness. And when we tune in to this level, this is the level where a reality is started to form. And we're going to play with this kind of energy. And this is the place that we have to change your life from. I'm really practical though. So even though I'm a bit esoteric in this moment, what you're going to see with me is that I'm a really practical girl, and we're going to walk you through what that would look like in your life. So don't worry, we're going to teach you. And at the end of this you'll pretty much be able to do a lot of the things that I do. And I actually hope you can do more. Wouldn't that be fun, right? Okay. So are you guys ready to change? This webinar today is all about busting open some of the lies that we believe in. The interesting thing with a lie is a lie can stick you to the wall, basically. It's like sticky glue. A lie can stop you from creating change. And one of the first lies that I want to cover is the lie that we often think, which is I can't change. A lot of us are doing the same habits day in and day out. And we think, "Well, nothing is changing in my life." Well, there's actually a lie here. And here's the lie. If you're a vibrating, oscillating energy field of molecules that dance and change in every second, you're always changing. So the lie right there is that you're not changing, but you're always changing. And so you don't have to look at your life the same once you get this whole concept. Because instead of fighting and resisting and trying to stay stuck in the same daily routines, think about how much force and energy and infinite being, which is you, has to put against itself to stay the same day in and day out. I mean, that's quite a trick. That's quite a talent. You're taking the same kind of energy and the same experience and locking it into your body and into your being and into your habits, the same thing over and over and over again. And what if this infinite being called you decided to actually allow and quit resisting and reacting to change? What if you actually just went with change? Moved through change? You know, just really went for it? So what's going to happen is we're going to start clearing so many patterns in these 12 weeks that we're basically going to go layer upon layer, walls are going to fall down, and all sorts of interesting things are going to happen. And all of your raw power, this prima materia, is basically going to show up for you in the way that you want it. And so what I'm going to urge you to do during this is pay attention to the same kinds of daily routines and the things that you're doing, even if they're on autopilot. Have you ever noticed that you don't have to tell your body to breathe? You don't have to explain to your heart it has a beat. It's on autopilot. Well, some of these exact energies that you've got going on that create these habits are also on autopilot. Now, breathing and having your heartbeat are really good things. It allows you to be here. But for some of the other things that you have on autopilot, they might not actually be working for you. And they might actually be the things that are creating your life to not change when you say, "Things never change for me." These could be your walls. So we're going to go through some of these autopilot programs, and we're going to clear these so that you can be free, free up some of your raw talent, your ability and your energy, and let life express through you. Abundance is really just a consciousness. You have this whole thing that abundance is somehow separate from you. But if you really look at raw consciousness, prima materia, raw power, the kind of energy that your soul let's run through every part of its being, it's completely abundant because it runs and runs and runs and it never really stops, right? So it is all possible from this level. Everything is changing and morphing and forming from this level. It moves through your heart, basically. It moves into your world, kind of like a vortex, actually. The molecules get denser and denser and denser forming your body and your life. And you're really though, you always are the light that you've always been looking for and your pretty much the gift of the energy exchange of abundance that you've always been looking for. You are the synergy. And we're going to start clearing energy all along the call. So today is going to be a little different. We're going to do the energy clearing at the end, because I have to set a little bit of a foundation. But from now on, on every single call, I'm going to talk about a concept, we're going to stir up the muck, and then we're going to clear it. And I'm going to purposely push your buttons. I love you enough to basically push your buttons. And again, some of you will feel it and some of you won't, but the thing is what drew you to this class is your soul saying to you, "Hey, it's time to clear up these same old, same old stories. "It's time to get rid of some of the buttons that you have "that are reacting or stopping you." And the thing is change can happen. You know how sometimes a musician can become an overnight success? The thing is all the musicians I know say they were never an overnight success. What happened is they'd been practicing. They'd been showing up in their life and they've laid the foundation and the groundwork. So in this program, we're going to be laying the foundation and the groundwork. And any time in this program, it could be after a day or after a month, but if you fully participate, you will find yourself to be different. Whatever you need to show up for you could just pop, like literally pop right into your reality. And that's how funny it is with energy. At the moment you keep thinking it doesn't work, you're throwing a huge ass counter-intention into what you're trying to manifest. So we're trying to work on clearing all the reasons why you think things don't work in your life because that's always going to be a block. Some of you might believe in past lives. I do. When we're clearing some of these things, we actually do go into other lifetimes where you've been blocked in things. You don't always show up here with a clean slate. It'd be nice if we could. But sometimes we have some other things that are locked in our bodies and you might not be aware of it. So I'm going to teach you about all these things, and we're going to clear them. I'm going to talk to you about another lie that happens in this world. And the other lie that we believe in is that we are right and we are wrong. Because in truth, everything is just a perception, a worldview that we've taken on. If you say abundance is bad, money is bad, that is just the way you look at it. To other people, money is great. Okay, so that's not really truth with a capital T. You're an infinite being in a body, that's truth with a capital T, but, and that's not a judgment, that's actually just what is. So when you make yourself wrong, you create another block, and another wrongness gets vibrated into your world and you lock more energy in. When you make yourself wrong, you also feel guilt and shame, which are lower vibrations. This consciousness and this energy that we're working on can sneak in and just go kaboom, just like blow out all the crap out of the water. We're going to show you how to literally unlimit yourself and allow more and more of the flow to show up in your life. When you're in the flow, you're being loving, kind to yourself, you're letting the goodness in that's truly you from the infinite, energetic world literally come, is going to come through your life. And here's a little lie that we all believe. We all believe the lie, or I shouldn't say all, but most of us, that somehow choosing from the wrongness of us somehow makes us smart or aware. So I'm going to show you something. Let's just say I'm going to do something stupid in my life. And I'm just going to make fun of myself. And, yes, I still do stupid things. But when I do something silly, I laugh at myself, and laughter literally opens the flow for more and more change. So I don't sit around focusing on my mistakes or my wrongness. If you were to ask me, for instance, what is the last silly slash stupid thing I ever did? I probably can't tell you because I blew it up and blew up the energy that created it. I did not let that be in my reality anymore just sitting around. I don't go around thinking, "How did I get so wrong? "How could I make that mistake?" What you guys may have noticed, as a lot of people do is they go around thinking a hundred times a day, "What did I do that was so wrong? "How did I create that mistake? "I can't believe I was so wrong. "How could I mess up so much? "How come this thing in my life won't change? "What and why does this keep happening to me?" And if we think these things a hundred times a day as a little thought that kind of happens behind the scenes, you know, like what's wrong with me, all these things you're showing the universe what it is that you actually want because you're seeking to understand why does this keep happening? And you're only seeking to understand it, therefore you're standing under it. And if you're standing under it, you can never get over it. Now, what does laughter do? And what does non-judgment do? It actually helps you get over it because you are no longer stuck in the understanding of it. Now, some people would say, "Oh, well, you're just denying things." No, you're not really denying things if you're choosing to look at what you did and make a new choice and decide not to do it again, right? What I am suggesting is let's quit beating ourselves up, move to the higher vibration. You know, this kind of flow, this kind of energy that I'm trying to model for a minute is actually the real energy that will create the most amount of change. I want to talk to you a little bit about where do you wish to be at the end of this program? Well, what's really cool about what we're doing is that you can type answers in the comment section because I want this to be, you know, like, imagine I'm standing in front of you and I have a big whiteboard and you're all in this big classroom with me and we're all sharing and helping each other, okay? It's going to be that kind of experience. And you're going to do it by typing through to me on the webinar. So what do you want to have happen for you? Where do you wish to be at the end of this program? Okay, so here are some of the responses that are coming in. Mary Kay wants to be fully confident in her finances and money to flow abundantly. All right. I always get one of these. I love this. So thank you, Buddy. Buddy wants to be the winner of multi-millions. Now, you see some spiritual people, teachers would say, "Oh, that's crazy." You know what? I actually don't think it's crazy. I've actually won five numbers in the lottery twice. So you know what? I think it can happen. I don't think that there's any, you know, it's just a interesting perspective. And if you're aware enough to grab the numbers, then good for you. All right. So this is Lex. "I plan to feel less stuck "and burst forward with clearly defined goals "and move on some projects that I've been holding back. "Awareness and release of these blocks." I love this, awareness. There are only two things an infinite being can be and that's be aware and make choices. Let's see what else we've got. Career change. Thanks, Roman. Sheila, she's very specific. She wants to make 15 grand a month and create family time. That's a whole thing about money. It should be pleasurable, right? Abundance, it should be pleasurable. It should get us what we actually want. Sarah wants an abundance of love. Nicholas wants to use his connection to source. You know what? It's the most powerful thing you could ever do. Let's see, there's a few others, full of fun, joy, lots of money, winning at being myself. I want to have a huge income after expenses. Hey, Jack, you know what? I love how you phrase that. That's actually how I phrase my manifestations. "I will focus on the profit "because that means I am profitable." I love that. Good job, Sandra. Sue wants to be completely and passionately in love with her husband. What about completely and totally in love with yourself? That's really lovely. That's my favorite word, by the way. Lovely. I love it. All right. Learning through loveliness. That's who I am. Okay. So this kind of view is basically being in love with yourself and being lovely. So thank you, Gabriel. Cindy has got a good one, make a difference in people's lives. And you know what? That's a really admirable thing. One of the first things that people do is they say they want to have money or win money or whatever so that they can help people, make a difference in people's lives. And you know what? That's so cool. A few other people want to work on the fear of success and be able to not worry. We're going to talk a little bit about that today, Christie. Another Christie. Hello. Nancy wants to use her gift of music to heal things. Okay. You know, what this is really all about is us all using our gifts. Really? That's just what it is. Okay. Whatever your gifts are, you're infinitely talented in something. Thank you, Nancy. Thank you, guys. Hey, so this is a really cool wishlist, right? Be fully confident in your finances, money to flow abundantly, feel like it's heaven on earth, winning the lottery, ending procrastination, career change, remove blocks, 15,000 a month and creating some family time, abundance of love, using your connection to source, loads of profit, being in the flow, being in love with your hubby, in love with yourself, making a difference in people's lives, no worries, overcoming fear of success, and using our gifts. All right, thank you. Thank you so much for this. That's why you guys showed up here. So whether or not you know it, consciously or not, this is what your soul wants for you. This is what you want for you. And that's what we're going to do. A lot of cool things to make it happen. I want to talk about change and being the change you wish to see in the world. The most important thing on this call is actually you. You guys actually made a choice. You made a choice for change, and that's what showed you up here. Choice in the energy behind every choice is really the thing that creates the reverberation out into your world. If you can breathe into life with yourself wide open in the flow, that's really the expression of yourself manifesting through you. Okay, so let's talk about one more lie. And the other lie that I want to talk about, that was actually brought up in the wishlist thing, but basically the lie is that you are not enough. Now, how happy does that make you feel when you think about that? I am not enough. It feels crunchy, right? Like, ugh. Because the real truth is an infinite being is actually quite much more than enough. So you use all this force, you put it against yourself, and we're going to knock all these things down, okay? Now where do all these lies come from that you're not enough? They come from a lot of places. It becomes kind of embedded in the consciousness of the planet. It comes from our parents, society, or religion. You know, nobody wants us to get too happy, too out of control, you know, or too happy. Fun people are out of control, right, a little bit, in a good way. I don't mean out of control crazy. I mean like out of control, like they have boundless energy to make anything in their life happen. That's really what I mean by out of control. But it's boundless. There is no boundaries. And if we're too happy, it creates a lot of change. And if it creates a lot of change, then people have to go along with it. And there's, you know, these embedded beliefs and fears in society that we should all just kind of contain ourselves. So what if I invite you to be so much change that you drive everybody around you a little nuts? You'd basically be so potent that you kind of like stir the energies of those around you by having so much fun and showing them that you're completely and totally enough just as you are. And basically this means that you've opened up to the flow. That's really what this means. And when you're opened up to the flow, you're aligned with that consciousness, basically infinite potential, infinite love, infinite strength. So you basically get to love your life, which is the whole point of being here. I mean, love everything into existence. Let's talk about opening the door to unlimited possibilities. One of the other lies that happens on the planet, and this is kind of an insidious lie. We actually don't get that it's a lie because we think that our only options are those options that we've seen from all the people around us. So your ideas, how you go and create the world are all made of energy, right? So these ideas you probably bought and sold from somebody around you and how they created their world. So you come into your body, you mimic Mom and Dad because you want to make them happy so they love you, so they feed you and clothe you. And if they're happy, then you get happy, right? So then you choose options from this limited box called Mom and Dad. And you only make these options because you want to make them happy. Unless you're a rebellious person or a spirited person, which a lot of lightworkers really are because they don't really like to do rules. They don't really like to lock themselves in boxes. But then you get in trouble, you get squashed because you actually made a new choice different than that was being made from anybody else around you. And that's where we get all these patterns from, by the way. Now who else makes us, squashes us a little bit? Lots of things, teachers, authority figures, TV, like if you only have the best designer or the right pair of jeans, can you be included? You have to have the right bag in order to be rich. All those things limit your ability to choose whatever you truly want for yourself. So obviously your dream is going to be a little different than everybody on this phone call tonight and all the six billion or seven billion people on the planet now. So your dream is obviously your dream. So create and attract things into real life from either one of two ways. You either attract things to your life from the old evidence appearing real, and that's the evidence that we see around us, or two, you make some new choices and you make these with lovingkindness and total awareness. And you know, why am I choosing this old reality when I can actually choose something new for me? You ask questions, you decide something different. You know, you wouldn't really need this seminar if you only made choices for the next 12 weeks that were loving and kind to you, and were truly pointed in the direction that you really wanted to go to, without hesitation. And some of you are going, "Well, I can't do that because I have to work at a job "and I have to do this and I have to do this." So we're going to work through these blocks. And we're going to talk about these because these are all your have tos, your would have, could have, shouldas. And these have tos are basically putting you in jail, and we're going to help you get out of jail with the free card, right? The freedom card. These choices to be lovingly kind to yourself will completely align you with your life purpose. The reason you're here and the reason you breathe and the reason your life or whatever it is drives you and makes you happy is the ability to make this thing called free choice, okay? We're going to dispel any lie that you are not enough and you can't truly live like this. Every choice that you make in the future has a frequency to it. And the frequency can either be a high vibration or a low vibration. All of it though is just really energy at the end of the day. And you make a choice to just vibe with this energy. So I always say, if you're going to make a low vibration choice, you know, some people would say, oh, eating a sugar cookie is horrible, right? It's got sugar, it's got carbs, it's got butter. But I always say, if you're going to make the choice to eat the sugar cookie, you know, you shouldn't, but you make that choice, you either eat the sugar cookie and feel guilt, or you eat the sugar cookie, you make a choice, and you totally love it and feel joy in it. And there's a totally different frequency to that. And that frequency, kind of in a weird way, actually transmutes a lot of the negative. So what I've noticed is that when we do life and we live the energy of joy and pleasure, fun and joy, all of that, you're actually being who you are from the highest consciousness. Infinite beings feel light, happy, aware, free from guilt, shame, fear, solidness, seriousness, and all those kinds of things that basically lock you back in these boxes where you don't actually get any real choice. So we're going to have you focus this week on choices that you're making. And that's going to be your play work a little bit later. If you have to make a choice and you feel good about that choice, you get more life in you. Not everybody knows what a good choice is until you've made it long enough. Have you ever noticed that sometimes you're not sure if this choice adds life to you or it doesn't add life to you until maybe somewhere in the future? So we're going to be working on creating enough truth in the you that you can be actually aware of if I make this choice, where does it take me in five years, 20 years, two days, all right? Because that would be loving and kind to you. I'm going to talk to you about playfulness for a minute. I love to play. I love to play because play is an expression of who you are. You take every ounce of your energy and you move it through your body doing the highest vibration of joy and loving life. And if you act like you're having fun for long enough, and you let that energy run through your body, you're basically keeping the doors open. And that creates a lot of new options. And these options come from this playfulness, this feeling, which is really kind of an inspiration, an inspirational energy. You know, you get inspired, you know? It's the energy inside and just kind of spirals out in a weird way. And just, boom, goes into your world, goes into your world, opens the door, and lets you be however you want to be in the future. Have you ever noticed that the actors and actresses who get to play new characters in their lives, they get to try on new thoughts and new ideas? They get to see the world through another character's eyes. And that's actually really, really, really, really good because they get used to the fact that they get to bop into other worlds and other realities, try it on, and then they get to keep what works for them. What if you just looked at your life that way and you didn't get so attached to all these stories, you said, "Wow, this thing that I've been being "for the last 20 years, I could just drop it and change it "and be something different," okay? So I'm going to ask you to invite that kind of playful spirit inside of you while we're going through this journey so that you don't get all serious and crunchy and hard work and no play and all that kind of stuff. It's going to make it harder for you to shift, I promise you. Playfulness even makes you feel confident. We're always going to be nudging you towards play. And have you ever noticed that you sometimes think, "Oh, I can't play. "I feel guilty"? Well, what if your soul is always expressing to you these little permission slips, these kind of kind and gentle nudges that say, "Hey, why don't we try something different?" But we shut it down because we're so used to the other way. So we're going to work on clearing this whole expression of you, this whole playful expression. Your soul doesn't want you to shrink or shirk your responsibility. I'm not saying that. But it does want you to play and become more in the flow. Think about the flow. You connect as a source, flowing that kind of light and love out into your world, into the future. Expressing source energy, no judgment, playing basically who you really want to be in the future, but doing it now. And that's going to be an amazing, amazing life for you if you can create from that place. All right, so let's talk for a minute about what happens when you start working on this energy plane, this higher consciousness. At the end of the day, you're going to have to embrace something different, okay? And this something different might not be what you ever expected, because it's probably going to be something, who knows? I mean, all I know with manifesting is the more I get into the spirit of play, open-heartedness, and just push myself to be more of me, whatever that looks like, the universe will just keep bringing and bringing and bringing, and all your walls fall down. You know, it's really interesting. How many of you have ever noticed that you go to manifest something really, really big, and I've heard this story, by the way, so many times I wish I had a dollar for every time I heard it. But you say, "Manifesting doesn't work for me. "I went and did it. "The exact opposite thing happened to me." And some of you are going, "Yeah, that's right. "The universe is cruel and punishing and torturous. "And it wants to torture you into submission "so you don't ever actually ask for anything." I mean, I've heard lots of stories from people saying, "The universe brings me nothing. "I'm not doing this manifesting thing. "It brings me the opposite." But here's what's really going on. I want you to really, really get this concept. You're saying, "I want something different in my life finally." And your soul is saying, "Wow, really? "Awesome. "I'm going to totally help you do that." And then your soul is saying, "But I love you so much, "I'm going to actually show you all your stuff "that's in the way, because you asked for it, "so I'm going to show it to you, "and then you can let go of it, "and then we'll be done with it. "And then you can get what you really, really want." Because your soul is now happy because it's like, "Wow, you haven't been listening before. "So, honey, I'm going to show you what's in the way." Now, does your soul do that so it can punish you and torture you into submission so you don't ask anymore? No. If you are willing to be totally in tune and listen to your intuition, your soul would just say, "Hey, you have this belief." I mean, this is what happens in my own head, by the way. "Hey, Christie, it seems like you have this belief "called you have to work hard." And so then what happens is I go, "Really? "I have that belief still?" You know, talking to myself basically. And then, "Yeah, you still have that belief." And then, kaboom, and I just blow it up. And then I no longer have that belief. Okay, that's how it really should work, okay? But we've never been taught that, that you can actually just check inside, you can get an answer. And once you have the answer, you clear it. And when the universe shows something to me, when my soul shows something to me, I just laugh about it. I go, "Really? "I still believe that silly thing? "Oh my god, that's so funny." I just blow it up, laugh about it, and just get on with it. I don't go into the drama of, oh my god, blah, blah, blah just happened, I can't believe it, you know? I just blow it up and go, "Wow, that's so cool. "Thank you for showing that to me," myself, I'm talking to myself, of course. Talking to myself in my own universe going, "That is so cool that you're showing that to me. "Thank you so much. "Now I can get rid of it." Okay, so it's a different perspective. One's a totally empowered response. And one is a response where you felt disempowered. And you probably felt disempowered 'cause you didn't have any tools. And that's totally okay. So we're going to give you some techniques so that you can blow everything up that's not what you want and invest in yourself and bring more of the good stuff in. Whew, all right, so all the ways that you look at the world will probably be shown to you on this journey. And then you're going to have to start asking them questions and say, "Wow." So if I had that belief that I just used as an example, I have to work hard, and I say to myself, "Is this true? "Do I want this to be true for me?" And if the answer is no, that this doesn't work for me, then I'll clear it, okay? So you're going to be shown things. And then you really, really honestly have to choose. Do you want to keep it or do you want to let it go? All right, so here are some of the rules that you're going to play with in the next 12 weeks. And I hesitate to say rules. I will say guidance, how about that? For those of you who don't really know me very well, I don't do rules. I just do awareness. I really don't do rules. I was a funny little teenager who would, you know, say screw that to all the rules. I really was. You have to be willing to see if you really want a certain reality. You know, oftentimes people are just afraid to actually look at what they're doing. I mean, it's kind of like this. If you say you want to be organized, but every part of your house is full of junk, there's pretty much a counter intuitive something going on, right? Okay, so you're going to have to really, really start looking at some of the things that you've been avoiding that may be blocking you. You know, if you don't pay your credit cards off every month, you might have to actually look at that, right? That's not a bad thing because, remember, you look at something, you change it, okay? So it's going to be really, really fun. But I have seen people afraid to just really look at what's going on. But again, do it with non-judgment, love it, that it came up. Who cares that it's there. Let it go. All right, here's another cool trick that we're going to do during this journey. You're going to try things on. Yeah, you're going to try things on. So let's just say you have a job. You're going to try it on and say, "Wow, does this really fit for me right now?" And you might come to the conclusion, I deserve to be happy more than I deserve to be doing this job. A lot of people on this journey, they try to please everybody around them, including their family. And then they don't change. You know, it's like really this power struggle about being happy or not happy. I always have this funny, cool thing. If you've ever looked up the definition of weird, you actually find that the definition means supernatural. And so I actually think we're all pretty weird. I really do. I think we're all pretty weird. So what if everybody down here is trying to be normal and you're really weird, and you're trying to do all the silly things that all the normal folks are doing around here, but they actually are pretty much insane, totally abnormal? You know, if you look at a lot of people, they actually, you know, there's a lot of sane people on this call who actually really get it. But what if you've been doing the world where you actually look at everybody else, so you go, "Wow, they're really normal. "I guess I'll be like them." But what if you were really gifted and you just turned down all your gifts? I mean, that's kind of what happens really, really. So we're going to get you more happy where you're actually just being yourself and not shrinking to everybody else's reality. And in that way you grow your confidence, you grow your power, you become the amazing gift that you are to yourself, you step into yourself, you step up to the plate, you love yourself to be brave enough to kind of stand out there and be fully, fully you, you don't bend to anybody else's reality. And you're going to embrace this new kind of way that you are. It's going to be fun. And in a way, this is also choosing for the love of you, choosing so you can receive more love. You have to be willing to live in truth. And part of that means being willing to see your own stuff and willing to see other people's stuff that might not be there normally. And it's not there normally because now you're actually finally looking at it. And when you're really looking at it, it's not about blaming or fighting them. It's just about, I don't really choose what they're choosing to put on me. That's not who I am. The other thing for living a conscious, aware life is you're going to have to clear the density and the old stuff. And I'm going to show you how to do it. And clearing the density and the old stuff in the moment that comes up is really what's required. I don't really live with my stuff anymore. You know, if something comes up in my life that I don't prefer, I just clear whatever energy created that showing up in my world. And I pretty much, you know, I can't remember the last time I was annoyed or bothered, but you know, I never take any of that stuff personally, okay? I just look at it and go, huh, that's kind of interesting. And then I let it go. Yeah, so that's how you live life. You don't make it personal. Somebody's stuff is their stuff and your stuff is your stuff. And just move on. You don't have to bend to their world. So we're going to sort out some things and find out what's true for you. And we're going to give you all sorts of definitions because I think a lot of lies that we have attached to abundance and money are, you know, just that, lies. And you can't really, you know, lies are going to stick you, and lies are not going to let you move forward. Have you ever noticed that we never talk about money in this reality? Money is like this secret, you know? You don't teach people how to make it, how to keep it, how to grow it, how to nurture it, how to tend to it. But we can watch TV and we can learn how to kill people. But we can't talk about it. We can learn on TV how to cover up our crimes. We can learn how to solve all the crimes. You learn all these other dastardly things. And we keep a secret the thing that would actually help all of us. I mean, the more you have of abundance, the more abundance in any form, it could be love or money or anything, the more you get to help people on the planet and the more fun and joy in life that you get to bring to the table. Here's one of the questions. What's your definition of money and abundance? All right, so somebody typed, "Abundance means I get to stop beating myself up." Yeah. How many of you guys beat yourself up every day? Another person says, "Abundance means having a money intuition." "Choice," is what somebody else typed. Mike said, "It's energy, freedom, dream lives." Yeah, your dream life. Abundance and money is your dream life. Okay, "Abundance means never having to worry about anything, "just knowing it will be there when I need it." Another person said, "The freedom of no worry "and having everything I need." All right, what else do we have going on here? Let's see, a few other people are saying, "Abundance is never enough." Okay, so a few people have some negative definitions. That's good. William is saying, "Unconsciously competent." So that means that you're so much in the flow that it just shows up and you don't even have to think about it, kind of like breathing. Competent. Roman says, "To do what my soul wants." So for some people it's heavy. For some people they put hard work. For another, never enough. That's Dylan. He says, "I have a dual definition of abundance, "both a negative and a positive one." So the negative ones are just what they are. And we're going to clear those. And that's totally true, Mariel, struggle. Yeah, some people think it's struggle. I got another good one here. Marie says, "I'm on the way to experiencing it." Love it. Mary Kay says, "It's for other people." Money equals power. Yeah, for some people, money is power and control. Some people will say money always runs out, or greed. Somebody said, "I'm an idiot with it." Okay, what about this one? What about being broke? Takes a lot of money to make money. Saving and hoarding. Money used to be a chain of other people's intentions more powerful than my intention to manifest it for myself. So it's about being controlled by other people, right? Another person typed, "Money is used for manipulation." Yes. Another person put, "It's not safe to ask for what I want." I like that one, Mary. I feel that's really, really good. Somebody else is saying that they have to be desperate before money shows up. Wow. That's got to suck. Seriously. You have to go through heartache before it'll show up. Yeah, and what about it doesn't grow on trees, or that abusive worry and fear thing. Okay, so I want to teach you guys a little bit about truth and what truth feels like. So I want you to just say this inside yourself. And I want you to tell me where you feel this energy in your body. Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes. All right, maybe you have to say it out loud yourself for you to feel it. So say out loud, yes, yes, yes. And feel where you feel that. All right. Now I want you to think, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. Okay, where do you feel that? And you might have to say it out loud yourself. So for me in my body, I feel yes in my chest, and I feel no in my stomach. All right, now everybody's going to be a little different. Just 'cause that's my vocabulary doesn't mean it's true. If you can get really good at that, and for some of you this might be a new experience and you might not think, "Oh, I can't do it." And I'm just going to ask you to practice a little bit. You can, you can do it in your daily life. You can say, "Wow, if I take this route home, "will it be faster than taking this other route home?" Yes or no, right? So try on yes or no. And we're going to try on some of these statements, and you tell me if they feel true, okay? Because at the end of the day, we're going to have to get to a lot of truth here. Does it feel true that money equals cash? Money equals cash. Yeah, it feels light. It feels like a part of that's true. Or most of it's true. You know, money could be in some other form besides cash. So how about abundance is a constant flow? Does that feel like a yes or a no? Think of that. Abundance is a constant flow. Where do you feel that in your body? I feel it in my heart. Yeah, it's a constant flow. That feels true. All right, there might be a better way to phrase that. I mean, there feels like in some languages, there might be a little lie, but it feels pretty light. Okay, abundance and money are freedom. Okay. Now what's interesting is freedom is freedom and money is money. If you ask for money to become your freedom, it won't bring you freedom. The energy of freedom will bring you freedom, and that energy can or cannot be money. So it depends where you're vibing at with that. Basically freedom is freedom, money is money. They're not the same money. Money can't buy you freedom, only freedom can give you freedom. All right. That's a long-winded explanation, but just try it on. Okay, money equals freedom. Kind of a little bit heavier there. All right, so let's just try this one on. Is money and abundance just a choice? Money and abundance is just a choice. Does that feel light? Yeah. That one actually feels really, really light. So at the end of the day it's just a choice. Just for you, is love a part of your abundance and money? Just feels like this crunk, like this heavy, old ancient door just closed on it, on a lot of people, not everybody. Yeah, but love could be a part of abundance and money. But for some of you, you don't really love it. Okay, try this one on. Having money is hard work. How does that feel? For me it makes my stomach feel a little funny. Yeah, because it doesn't have to be part of hard work. Hard work is like creation, destruction, form, you make yourself solid, you work, work, work, all your molecules like crunch together. And the other way is that money is fun. Money is easy. Can you see how that's like, that's lighter, expansive, creation, happy. You know, there's really no joy in this hard work thing. What if you could actually just get paid being you and have it be really easy? That would be fun, huh? Okay. I love it, love it. What about money equals power and control? That was somebody's definition. Well, I actually think that money is just a tool that can be used through our ability to have control over things and have power over things. But true power is really our ability to be loving, kind, and use higher vibrations. So you can have power over things using lower frequencies. And then there's the ability to use raw power and create something good in your world. So it just depends on what you're intention is, honestly, behind that one. How about this belief? Money always runs out. Wow. That feels like ugh. It's like a big faucet just got shut off, all right? So that's not true. Greed. Somebody said money is greed based on their definition. So obviously that's not true. It's really the person's intent behind it. Greed is somebody's intent. That's not what money is. Money is actually just neutral. And greed is really funny because it says, "There's only so much, I've got to grab it all." So there's a lot of fear-based agendas attached to that one, for sure. Being an idiot with it is what somebody said. Okay, how light does that feel? Not very much, right? How about not worthy? Somebody wrote, oh, I think money is not, their definition of money was being not worthy. But I want you to try this on for a minute. Could an infinite being really be not worthy? 'Cause that's really just an opinion. That's just like this whole judgment system. It's just your opinion. Okay, somebody's definition of money was broke. That's obviously not true. The person holding it might be broke. That's their deal. But money itself is not broke. How about this one? It takes a lot of money to make money. You know, it's really funny because I've hung out with tons of rich people, and rich people, the ones that I know, let me see, wow, that's very fascinating. I was just kind of thinking, most of them made money, the ones that I know made money from nothing. They just decided they were going to make a choice, made a powerful choice, decided they were going to be profitable from the beginning. And they built these crazy multi, multi, multi-million dollar businesses. I was just kind of Rolodexing through some of my friends. Wow. I know one guy who started with $5,000, gosh. Another one, $10,000. Another one, no money. So I even know this lady, she made $750,000 on a real estate thing in two months because literally her angels told her to go buy this property and flip it. So she figured out how to do it, had never done it before, and made $750,000. I know another person who started a business with no money. And now it's like making a hundred million dollars marketing things. Started with no money. He brought in a business partner. The business partner put money in the company about 20 years ago. And now it's a really, really, really big company, but he didn't put any money in it. Wow. Okay, what about this whole thing about money is saving and hoarding? Again, this saving and hoarding. Hoarding is really I am not enough. It's kind of a weird energy. Money and control, yes. It's a funny thing. You know what happens in a lot of wealthy families, the kids come to me, and they've had wealthy parents, and they felt so controlled they didn't feel like they had their own lives. So I've had to clear those beliefs on people who had money. And the reason I'm bringing it up is 'cause people think that, "Oh, if I was rich, I'd be so different." Well sometimes when you grow up rich, you have your own other set of problems. So it doesn't matter if you're rich or poor, it's just different problems. So I agree. It's more fun to have rich problems than poor problems. But at the end of the day, there's still things that you're going to have to, they don't have to be problems. But what I'm saying is there is going to be new distractions that you might have to deal with, that you might have to blow up the lies that are attached to it, and you might have to make it different. Is it really true that money and abundance feel like lack? No, that's just an interesting perspective. What about manipulation? You know, manipulation is an interesting energy because if you really think about it, we're really manipulating everybody all the time. I'm manipulating you guys to make a choice to be conscious, right? Hopefully, hopefully I'm using my energy in a way that would enhance your life. I'm not using it to control you in a way that would be negative. I think that how we manipulate people is really what our intent is underneath. And that's the part that can be from a higher or lower energy. So it's really just a choice, but we are always manipulating our world into form and creating our reality, right? Money can be used as a form of manipulation for sure. Money, I see money, really, as a tool. Manipulation is really, really, really not attached to what money and abundance, from the highest definition, is all about. So what if one of your greatest gifts and talents is that you are an amazing manipulator? And you're manipulating your energy and your world into place? At the end of the day, in order to change what you don't like, you have to manipulate it a different way. So basically, if you notice, I'm trying to take the wrongness out of manipulation because at the end of the day, we're forming our world. If we get that it's not okay to manipulate, in a way that belief could make it it's not safe to ask for what you truly want, you know, or something like that. So what about asking? Do you guys feel good about asking for what you truly want? Or do you not ask because you don't think you're going to get it, so you go, why bother? Or you think you're going to get in trouble if you ask if that's what happened when you were a kid. So we're going to clear all these kind of lies and misinformation about asking. And then, you know, you'll start asking the universe to be manipulated in your favor, bring you the unlimited abundance and money that you really love. All right, so somebody else had said, "You have to be desperate before it shows up, "or you have to lose it all in order to create it all." So if you have to lose it all, now, that obviously doesn't feel true, but if you have to lose it all in order to create it all, that's this whole kind of polarity thing where you have to create things and destroy things. And creation destruction, hopefully I'm going to get you guys above that kind of energy where you're not doing polarity where you have to create things and then you have to accidentally blow it up so that you can create something new. 'Cause what it, what the highest evolution of you would do is you just keep creating what you want and creating what you want and creating what you want and so on and so on, and then gently letting things fall away that don't want to be here. I mean, how many of you have ever seen people create their life perfect and then just do some sort of secret sabotage thing and like blow it all up? It's kind of fun. It's full of lots of drama. But it's probably not what you want to do in the highest evolution of you. All right, what about this one? Money doesn't grow on trees. Well, obviously we know that's a lie, and then there's other things that we've talked about which is that money could be abusive or worry or you have fear that it's taken away. And those are obviously all lies too. So there's a truth here about abundance being a constant flow. You know, that felt light. So in the real truth of it, it should be if you're really living who you are, it's a constant flow. All right, so thanks for sending these in. All right, so now we're going to work on some energy clearing statements to clear up all the cool things that you talked about. My clearing statements are kind of interesting. I've programmed into the energy field that you guys are going to download when you say yes to it, I'm going to say the word delete. But sometimes I use short speak and delete really means across all time, dimension, space, and realities, okay? So we're going to delete it across every field of energy that you could possibly imagine that you are plugged into at some level. And then we're going to uncreate it, which means we're going to unplug the energy from the first moment you created it. And you're going to go back in time and pull it out like a big weed, even if it was millions of lifetimes ago. And the other clearing part of that, I say the word destory. So you're taking out the story in your field of energy and the story has all these lies and untruths plugged into it, right? Sometimes I change the word destory for destroy. The reason that I do that, energy can't be blown up at the real truth of it, but the story around it can be blown up. So we're basically just taking all the lies out of the story. So it'll be kind of fun. So sometimes I interchange destory or destroy, but it's clearing pretty much the same angle of energy. So let's talk to you about what kind of stories you might have. If you have the story money is hard to get, then somewhere you have probably a thousand gazillion, or a hundred or so, other energies programmed into that one story. Basically what you're saying is, "I believe money is hard to have "and you have to work really hard "because I watched my dad do it, "because I watched my mom do it, "because that's my experience, that's what I had to go do." And therefore you believe that story. And once you've bought and sold that story to yourself, then there's no other reality that can truly be created because now you're basically banging against all these other hundreds or thousands literally of times you believed the opposite where it's hard. Okay, so that's why we have to blow up all those densities. So we're using energy tools, energy intensity, energy statements that are basically powerful intentions that are going to literally rock your world. So it's going to be kind of fun. I also have programmed other energies into these statements, including that we're clearing any matrix energy that we kind of live in, that we are going to clear all the judgments that you have in everything. We're going to clear all the push and pulls and resistance and reaction and fear and anger and shame and guilt and obligation and all sorts of other things are programmed into those words. I'm just giving you the shortened version of it. And it's basically where we're clearing the lies, the falsehoods. And you know what's kind of cool? Some people will ask me while we're blowing all the stories up, so does that mean I'm blowing up the good stories? Well, here's actually the truth. The truth is you can't blow up something that is true. So if I said to you, try to take the energy and blow up the phrase the universe is always expanding. Can you feel how in your body that energy feels pretty clear? The universe is always expanding. So that feels truth. But you could say I'm going to uncreate it and delete that story that the universe is always expanding. And at the end of the day, you can't really get rid of it because it's just true. Okay? So do you kind of get the whole deal that we're blowing up the lies. We're not blowing up what's actually truth with a capital T. Another funny thing is if I say to you, you are an infinite being, which means you can take your energy, you can go connect to the sun. So I want you to take your energy and perceive the sun. Okay, so you all thought of the sun. I want to take your energy, perceive a tree. Okay, so you just perceived a tree. I wanted to ask you to take your energy and go back to when you're the happiest memory in your whole life, whatever that is. Okay, so now you guys all went back in time. So you can kind of see that your energy is infinite. You can play around with it and go backwards and forwards and change things. So you can't really take the story out of who you are at the core of you, because it's who you are, it's you. And in a funny way, try this. This is a cool experiment. If you say I uncreate and delete everything that is me, I uncreate everything that is me, I uncreate and delete everything that is me. I uncreate and delete everything that is me across all time, dimension, space, and reality, you know what will happen? You'll actually get more powerful. Because what you're doing is you're uncreating and taking out the story of all the lies of who you are. And in a funny way, you're filling back in with pure consciousness itself, okay? So I know this is kind of a little bit new to some of you guys listening, but I'm trying to inspire you to check out what is true or false, okay? And clear everything that's false and know for certain that you can't really clear something that's true. It's just who you are. Okay, I've done that, by the way, for a couple of weeks. It's very fun. Everything that Christie is, I uncreate and delete it all. Everything Christie is, I uncreate and delete it all. Everything that Christie is, I uncreate and delete it all. And you want to know what it does? It clears like a whole cool pathway for something new to show up. Because if I'm not any more of my old stories, then I've just created a clean slate for million gazillion new things to show up. It's really fun. Earlier, you know, we went through those slides and we were talking about making choices and are things lies or truth. And so now we're going to connect to the light and start clearing some of these things that we talked about. In the next sessions we're going to do it throughout, but I wanted to lay a little bit of a groundwork. Okay, so for a moment, just close your eyes. And if you're driving, obviously you can't close your eyes. I would actually pause it and then just do this part a little later. Later on, once you get used to connecting, you don't have to close your eyes. I never close my eyes hardly anymore when I connect, I'm just always connected. I call it ABC, always be connected. Okay, so take your energy, close your eyes. Kind of roll your eyes up a little bit. And I want you to see, sense, or feel the light. Okay. Now take your energy up about 300 feet above your head. There's the dimension there that just kind of opens and you can see, sense, or feel source energy. All right, now I'm tuned into the group so I can feel that some of you guys are a little too low, take your energy higher and just kind of think, "I'm going to connect to the source energy "that opens the door to all my really cool downloads." Yeah. Okay. Now let this light come into your crown. Yeah. Let this light open up all awareness of who you truly are. Ask this light to come into your third eye and scrubby bubble some of those energies that are blocking you from seeing where your abundance is. Ask this light to come into your ears and open up your spiritual hearing. Ask this light to come into your throat and open up your spiritual communication. Knowing that you're totally safe, connected to the light, ask this light to come into your heart, opening up the part of you that loves you so much that you just want to have unlimited abundance. You want to live it, embody it, be it, and have it be easy. Ask this light to come into your solar plexus, opening up any place that you felt a little sucker punched about money, like you didn't get enough. And we're going to ask that to just kind of delete. Allow the light to come into your stomach area anywhere you have power control issues with money. You don't feel powerful over it. We're going to ask that to delete. Okay, we're going to allow the light to come into your root. Yes, allow the light to come into your root, opening up any place you feel rooted in old energy that isn't going to let you move. And we're going to ask that to just sort of delete. And we're going to ask this light to come down your legs into your knees, into your feet. And we're going to ask this light to be like a beam of light and come into the center of the planet. And I want you to just kind of feel around in the center of the planet. There's a cool dimension where it feels really, really, really blissful, kind of just like mama love, the kind of mama love that we should've gotten all day long. All right, and ask this light, imagine there's a little trampoline and it can bounce right back up to us. Okay, and ask this mama love kind of energy to come right back up our feet, our knees, our thighs, our hips, our hearts. And I want you to just imagine that there's this energy that's now met your heart. So you're now connected from above and below, right in the center of your heart. And now form an energy that looks like a big energy ball in your heart, like a big sunshine. And expand it out around your whole body, about 12 to 15 feet all the way around you. So now you're connected to the more infinite part of you. And now I want you to take this energy and expand it past the home you're in or the building you're in, wherever that is, and send it love and blessings. Thank you for supporting me. And expand this ball of light out past the city you're in sending lots of love and light to everybody in that city. And take your energy and expand it out past the state you're in sending lots of love and light to everybody in the state, knowing all is well. And ask this light to expand past the country you're in, sending lots of love and light to everybody in the country so that everybody gets a little new awareness, a little consciousness, a little happy, little abundance, a lot of abundance. Okay, and ask this light to expand past the planet, knowing that you're connected to everybody and everything and it's safe, right, and good for you to be here right now doing that. Now, if you notice, we can just take your energy and keep going and going and going past Pluto, past Mars, past the sun. And you'll see that there really is no edge to you. If you finally asked to notice where the edge of you is, you'll notice that you can't. So now we're going to start clearing the energy of the lie that you says you can't change. So anywhere you guys bought the idea that you can't change and everywhere you bought the idea that change was slow, will you please delete it, destory it, uncreate it across all time, dimension, space, and reality. Okay, one more time. All the places where change is slow and you can't make it happen or nothing in your life has ever changed before so why change it now? And all kinds of things that make you say, why bother? Why bother? Why bother? All that stuff, will you uncreate it, destory it, and delete all of it now. Everything in your life about money and abundance that won't change ever, will you please delete it, uncreate it, destory it across all time, dimension, space, and reality. All right, so you guys are really good. Things blow up a little bit more if you stay pretty expanded, okay? So just stay expanded. You're not your stuff. So maybe this is new and your stuff is going, "Yeah, but this is my stuff, you know? "I worked really hard to get this stuff." So everything creating you worked really hard to get all this stuff that you have that now wants to go, uncreate it, delete it, and destory it across all time, dimension, space, and reality. Anywhere you don't want to be a magnet for abundance, will you uncreate it, delete it, destory it across all time, dimension, space, and reality. Anywhere you guys are in a state of stuckness, uncreate, delete, and destory it across all time, dimension, space, and reality. Okay, everywhere you don't like being in your body and you don't want to change for sure, will you delete all that? All right, how many of you don't want to make a new choice because new choices are scary or new choices mean you're going to have to leave something behind and you don't want to do it, will you uncreate it, delete it, destory it across all time, dimension, space, and reality. Anything else that you guys have that says I can't make a new choice or choice was taken away from me and I really don't ever want to do it again, I don't want to choose, why would I even do that because I don't know what I want to choose. Any of that confusion and any of the lies and destruction that you bought with any of that, will you uncreate it, delete it, destory it across all time, dimension, space, and reality. And so anywhere else that you don't feel like you get to love money or love yourself enough to get it or love yourself to have enough abundance to keep you safe and have a lot of fun. Everything that is, will you, uncreate it, delete it, and destory it across all time, dimension, space, and reality. All the lies that you guys bought that I'm never enough, I can't be enough, I shouldn't be enough, will you delete all that? All the places that you guys are hiding from yourself, so all the walls and barriers and pretend energies that you're hiding from yourself that you don't want to let go of, uncreate, delete, destory across all time, dimension, space, and reality. Wow. You guys like to hide a lot of stuff. That's a lot of stuff going on. Okay, everything that is, will you uncreate it, delete it, destory it across all time, dimension, space, and reality. All right, I'm going to do that one a few more times, okay? So everywhere else you guys are hiding your infinite self from yourself, that's a really cool trick by the way, because you can't really do it. Uncreate it, delete it, destory it across all time, dimension, space, and reality. So anywhere you guys are hiding yourself from yourself, uncreate it, delete it, destory it across all time, dimension, space, and reality. I'm hearing everywhere you guys are hiding yourself from yourself, like who you really are as a soul in a body from yourself. And anywhere else you're carrying the weight of anybody else on your shoulders, we're going to delete that too, uncreate it, delete it, destory it across all time, dimension, space, and reality. All right, stay expanded. Some of you guys are thinking too much. So thinking, thinking, thinking, thinking, like, if you're thinking, is this working, this is really weird, what's up? Any of you guys doing that instead of just kind of going for it and saying yes to every energy I offer you, will you uncreate it, delete it, destory it across all time, dimension, space, and reality. All right, how many of you guys are bleeding hearts and want to just, you know, keep doing and doing and doing the same thing over and over and over again so that you can get respect from other people, even if they don't want you to be abundant? Okay, will you, uncreate it, delete it, destory it across all time, dimension, space, and reality. Yeah, who are you guys being poor for? All right, any of that stuff uncreate it, delete it, destory it across all time, dimension, space, and reality. Is there anything else that you bought about this reality that really isn't even true, that you bought from society and your parents and all that stuff, and it just bogs you down, makes you heavy, delete it all, uncreate it all, destory it all across all time, dimension, space, reality. Anywhere you still feel like you're kind of a victim in the past, present, or future, will you uncreate it, delete it across all time, dimension, space, and reality. All right, so one of your energies is energetically telling me to clear something. Yeah, so I'm talking to all of your souls, by the way, and kind of just reading the energy of the group and clearing what's most beneficial for everybody. So some of you guys have the belief that I don't like being here in a body. Now, it doesn't mean that you're suicidal. It just means like that you're, you know, you feel like you were dropped off from the spaceship and they, and your real friends left you here on this crappy island called Earth, right? Okay, so anybody who feels any remorse for being in a body, will you uncreate it, delete it, destory it across all time, dimension, space, and reality. Okay, anywhere else you guys are like, oh, beam me up, get me out of here, uncreate it, delete it, destory it across all time, dimension, space, and reality, because that's going to block you from truly living down here because you're all, there's always one foot in the door and one foot out of the door thinking I don't really want to be here. Okay, so everything that is that shuts off your power because you don't really want to be here, so every time you take two steps forward you got to take two steps back just to prove that you don't want to be here, you know, kind of that rebellious spunkiness, uncreate it, delete it, destory it across all time, dimension, space, and reality. Woo. All right, so thank you, whoever's soul just kind of tapped me on the shoulder and pointed that out. So thank you. All right, so now we're going to go into some of the money ones. So everywhere you're not allowed to be free, have abundance, be in constant flow, everything that is, will you delete it all, uncreate it all, destory it all. Everywhere you guys are not allowed to have cash money prizes or any of these cool things, anything that is, will you delete it all, uncreate it all, destory at all. Anywhere you guys are not allowed to have anything that showed up on your wishlist, will you delete all that? All right, so all the secrets that you guys feel about money, delete all those, uncreate all those across all time, dimension, space, and reality. Okay, anywhere you guys are beating yourself up, not loving yourself, paralyzing yourself, procrastinating, will you destroy, delete, uncreate, all that across all time, dimension, space, and reality. Anywhere you're suffocating yourself with money and the obligation to debt, will you uncreate and delete all that. Anywhere that you don't feel you have the ability to know about the truth of what it is you need to do in the future to guide yourself and make a lot of money, have a lot of money, will you uncreate it and destory all that. Anywhere you guys feel like you have no choice, will you delete all that across all time, dimension, space, and reality. Everywhere you feel like you can't have love, wow, you guys have a lot of energy about love, uncreate and delete all that. Now, some of you guys are wondering, like, I'm talking like I can see everything. I have you guys kind of like in an energy bubble and I can check you all out and see what percentage of you is releasing things and what percentage of you are, is thinking, oh, I can't, which is kind of weird, yes. You guys can do this too. I'm not doing anything unique that you guys don't have the talent and ability to do 'cause you're sizing up your energy and your future all the time, whether you know it or not. So we just got to open the door so that you're more aware of it. So everywhere you can't have a lot of choice, a lot of love, will you destory and delete all that. All the energy that you're using against yourself so you can't have your dream life, uncreate it and delete all that. Some of you guys are tuning out. I can tell you that you think the energy thing sometimes isn't working. So a few of you are going, "God, this is weird." You're right. 'Cause you're thinking, "I've kept all this for like so long. "And now all of a sudden it's going. "It could be that easy?" Well, kind of. You have to understand, I programmed so much consciousness into the energy I'm using. So just really, really take that. Take all the pure consciousness, which is truly you, okay, which is truth. You know, truth does heal. But I would expand that in saying the energy of truth, the energy of pure consciousness is what's healing everything. So everywhere you guys are tuning out, uncreate it, destory it. Everywhere your mind wants to grab all the stuff that we're clearing back, uncreate it and delete it. Everywhere you guys are worrying about your future or think that you're incompetent in any level on anything, all right, uncreate it, delete it, destory it across all time, dimension, space, and reality. Everywhere you guys aren't doing what your soul actually wants from you, which is basically to be abundant, be happy, be loved, and have a really good trip down here, make a lot of friends, make a lot of fun, make a lot of love, make a lot of money, okay, and everything in the way of that, will you uncreate and delete it and destory it across all time, dimension, space, and reality. All right, so now we're going to go into struggle and not having enough. Okay, so everywhere you guys can't have enough and you struggle, uncreate it, delete it, destory it across all time, dimension, space, and reality. Everywhere you guys are making it hard one more time, uncreate it, delete it, destory it across all time, dimension, space, reality. Everywhere you think money is for other people and not you, wow, you guys think money is for everybody else. Crazy. Okay, everything that is, will you uncreate it, delete it, destory it across all time, dimension, space, and reality. Isn't that kind of funny that you guys think that everyone else gets money, but I don't. Okay, whatever that is, uncreate it. About 60% of you believe that. Uncreate it, delete it, destory it across all time, dimension, space, and reality. Everywhere you guys think that everybody else gets the good life and you don't, and that the rich get richer and the poor get poorer and you're, you've been cheated out of your life's destiny 'cause you have no money or not enough money, will you uncreate it, delete it, destory it across all time, dimension, space, and reality. Everywhere you're not allowed to have all the power, all the money, all the control in your own life, will you delete it, destory and uncreate it. Everywhere you're not allowed to have power, control to change your destiny, delete all that too. Everywhere your money always runs out before you have enough to fill it up. Everywhere you don't have enough, so therefore it always runs dry, will you uncreate it and delete all that too. Having too much money would be greedy. And what is too much, by the way, like, what is your limit? Okay, everything that is, will you uncreate it, delete it, destory it across all time, dimension, space, and reality. Everywhere you're being silly with it, an idiot with it, stupid with it, all that, will you uncreate it, delete it, destory it across all time, dimension, space, and reality. Now I don't think you guys are stupid idiots, but sometimes I have to call up what you guys think about yourself. Okay, so a few of you guys, a lot more than you would think, by the way, about 55% of you, think at some level that you've been stupid and an idiot with money. All right, so everything that is, uncreate it, delete it, destory it across all time, dimension, space, reality. Everywhere you guys feel broken, broken about it, uncreate it and delete all that across all time, dimension, space, and reality. You know, at the end of the day, it just takes a powerful intention, a powerful choice to make your life go in a different way. So wherever it takes a lot of money to make money, will you delete it, uncreate all that. Everywhere you don't save it, don't allow yourself to save it, don't allow yourself to keep it, delete all that. Everywhere you have fear-based agendas, so you have to hoard it because you'll never ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever have enough again, uncreate it and delete all that. Okay, how many of you guys are hoarders because you don't think you'll ever, ever get it again? Delete it, uncreate it, destory it across all time, dimension, space, and reality. Everywhere you're basically controlled and not controlled by money. It's kind of all of this 'cause it's creating this resistance, reaction, and chaos, because part of you wants to be controlled by money and have it. And part of you wants to control money. And there's parts of you that don't want to have money 'cause then you have to control it, or you're maybe not willing to control others with it, 'cause, you know, if you have a lot of money, then people are going to come to you and then you would have to tell them no, or yes, or maybe, and it creates all this other weird stuff. So everything that is, will you uncreate it and delete it? What if you guys were willing to be the person in the neighborhood that creates the most amount of change in the neighborhood by being totally wealthy, totally conscious, and then inspire everybody around you? Everywhere you're not willing to be the inspiration that your community and your family needs, will you uncreate it, delete it, destory it across all time, dimension, space, reality. Everywhere it's not safe to control others or have enough money to control things in your world, will you uncreate it, delete it, destory it across all time, dimension, space, and reality. Everywhere money is lack or poverty, delete all that too. Everywhere it's a tool for manipulation, delete all that. Everywhere it's not safe to manipulate your world, uncreate and delete all that. Wow, you guys do not like being manipulated, even if it's good. Okay, 'cause you can have good manipulation, right? You're about to jump off a bridge and it's not your highest, happily talk to you and convince you that maybe there was another choice, that would be good manipulation, right? I know, I'm pushing this button on manipulation 'cause people have such a reaction on it, you know? Like, ooh, manipulation's bad. Everything that is, will you uncreate it, delete it, destory it across all time, dimension, space, and reality. Everywhere it's not safe to ask for what you want, delete all that. Everywhere you have to be desperate before it shows up, delete all that. Everywhere it doesn't grow on trees, delete all that. Everywhere it's abusive, worry, and can be taken away, delete all that. Okay, so uncreate and delete any other leftover anything that's just kind of hanging out in your energy field that really wants to go right now. Okay, expand out 300 feet all the way around you and just think, whoo, no matter what it takes right now, I'm going to uncreate it, delete it, destory all these lies, misinformation. Parts of me that wants to gamble and pretend that I don't control my money, will you uncreate it, delete it, destory it across all time, dimension, space, and reality. You guys did a really, really good job. Okay, so here's what you guys are going to do at home. You're going to do the energy statements whenever you feel density or vibrations, you know, that are kind of heavy. And you're going to ask everything in your world, "Does it feel light and good and true? "Or does it feel like a lie?" And you're going to start sorting out your lies and your misinformation. And then I want you guys to start thinking about what kind of changes would you really have if you lived truly, truly in an unlimited possibility field? What are you willing to change? So be in truth, clear up everything that's not true, just delete it and uncreate it. All right, so I would just love to thank you guys for showing up here, being here, being the best that you can be. Thank you so much. All right, and if you get stuck, get confused, get anything, just uncreate it and delete it all and just see what happens, okay? All right, so I will see you at the next session. I cannot wait. Your journey has just begun. And believe me, it's going to get better and better and better and better. Please continue to the next Unlimited Abundance Journey session.

====================

LESSON 1: Clearing Resistance (Clearing Session Only)

Okay, so for a moment, just close your eyes. And if you're driving, obviously you can't close your eyes. I would actually pause it and then just do this part a little later. Later on, once you get used to connecting, you don't have to close your eyes. I never close my eyes hardly anymore when I connect. I'm just always connected. I call it ABC, always be connected. Okay, so take your energy, close your eyes, kind of roll your eyes up a little bit. And I want you to see, sense, or feel the light. Okay, now take your energy up about 300 feet above your head. There's a dimension there that just kind of opens and you can see, sense, or feel source energy. All right, now I'm tuned into the group so I can feel that some of you guys are a little too low. Take your energy higher and just kind of think I'm going to connect to the source energy that opens the door to all my really cool downloads. Yeah. Okay, now let this light come into your crown. Yeah, let this light open up all awareness of who you truly are. Ask this light to come into your third eye. Scrubby bubble, some of those energies that are blocking you from seeing where your abundance is. Ask this light to come into your ears and open up your spiritual hearing. Ask this light to come into your throat. And open up your spiritual communication, knowing that you're totally safe, connected to the light. Ask this light to come into your heart, opening up the part of you that loves you so much that you just want to have unlimited abundance. You want to live it, embody it, be it, and have it be easy. Ask this light to come into your solar plexus, opening up any place that you felt a little sucker punched about money, like you didn't get enough. And we're going to ask that to just kind of delete. Allow the light to come into your stomach area. Anywhere you have power control issues with money. You don't feel powerful over it. We're going to ask that to delete. Okay, we're going to allow the light to come into your root. Yes. Allow the light to come into your root. Opening up any place you feel rooted in old energy that isn't going to let you move. And we're going to ask that to just sort of delete. And we're going to ask this light to come down your legs. into your knees, into your feet. And we're going to ask this light to be like a beam of light and come into the center of the planet. And I want you to just kind of feel around in the center of the planet. There's a cool dimension where it feels really, really, really blissful. Kind of just like mama love. The kind of mama love that we should have gotten all day long. All right. And ask this light, imagine there's a little trampoline, it can bounce right back up to us. Okay, and ask this mama love kind of energy to come right back up our feet, our knees, our thighs, our hips, our heart. And I want you to just imagine that there's this energy that's now met your heart. So you're now connected from above and below, right in the center of your heart. And now form an energy that looks like a big energy ball in your heart, like a big sunshine. And expand it out around your whole body about 12 to 15 feet all the way around you. So now you're connected to the more infinite part of you. And now I want you to take this energy and expand it past the home you're in. Or the building you're in, wherever that is. And send it love and blessings. Thank you for supporting me. And expand this ball of light out past the city you're in. Sending lots of love and light to everybody in that city. And take your energy and expand it out past the state you're in. Sending lots of love and light to everybody in the state. Knowing all is well. And ask this light to expand. past the country you're in sending lots of love and light to everybody in the country so that everybody gets a little new awareness a little consciousness a little happy a little abundance a lot of abundance okay and ask this light to expand past the planet knowing that you're connected to everybody and everything and it's safe right and good for you to be here right now doing that now if you notice we could just take your energy and keep going and going and going past Pluto, past Mars, past the sun. And you'll see that there really is no edge to you. If you find the astus, notice where the edge of you is, you'll notice that you can't. So now we're going to start clearing the energy of the lie that says you can't change. So anywhere you guys bought the idea that you can't change, and everywhere you bought the idea that change was slow, Will you please delete it, destroy it, uncreate it across all time, dimensions, space, and reality? Okay, one more time. All the places where change is slow and you can't make it happen or nothing in your life has ever changed before. So why change it now? And all kinds of things that make you say, why bother? Why bother? Why bother? All that stuff. Will you uncreate it, destroy it, and delete all of it now? Everything in your life about money and abundance that won't change ever. Will you please delete it, uncreate it, de -story it across all time dimensions, space, and reality? All right, so you guys are really good. Things blow up a little bit. more if you stay pretty expanded okay so just stay expanded you're not your stuff some of you this is new and your stuff is going yeah but this is my stuff you know I worked really hard to get this stuff so everything creating you worked really hard to get all this stuff that you have that now wants to go uncreate it delete it and destroy it Across all time, dimensions, space, and reality. Anywhere you don't want to be a magnet for abundance. Will you uncreate it, delete it, destroy it? Across all time, dimensions, space, and reality. Anywhere you guys are in a state of stuckness. Uncreate, delete, and destroy it. Across all time, dimensions, space, and reality. Okay, everywhere you don't like being in your body and you don't want to change for sure. Will you delete all that? All right, how many of you don't want to make a new choice because new choices are scary or new choices mean you're going to have to leave something behind and you don't want to do it? Will you uncreate it, delete it, destroy it across all time, dimensions, space, and reality? Anything else that you guys have that says I can't make a new choice or a choice was taken away from me and I really don't ever want to do it again? I don't want to choose why would I even do that because I don't know what I want to choose any of that confusion and any of the lies and destruction that you bought with any of that will you uncreate it delete it destroy it across all time dimension space and reality And so anywhere else that you don't feel like you get to love money or love yourself enough to get it or love yourself to have enough abundance to keep you safe and have a lot of fun. Everything that is will you uncreate it, delete it and destroy it across all time, dimensions, space and reality. All the lies that you guys bought that I'm never announced. can't be enough. I shouldn't be enough. Will you delete all that? All the places that you guys are hiding from yourself. So all the walls and barriers and pretend energies that you're hiding from yourself that you don't want to let go of. Uncreate, delete, destory across all time, dimensions, space, and reality. Wow. You guys like to hide a lot of stuff. There's a lot of stuff going on. Okay, everything that is. Will you uncreate it, delete it, destory it across all time, dimensions, space, and reality? All right, I'm going to do that one a few more times, okay? So everywhere else you guys are hiding your infinite self from yourself. That's a really cool trick, by the way, because you can't really do it. Uncreate it, delete it, destroy it across all time, dimension, space, and reality. So anywhere you guys are hiding yourself from yourself, uncreate it, delete it, destroy it across all time, dimension, space, and reality. I'm hearing everywhere you guys are hiding yourself from yourself. Like who you really are as a soul in a body from yourself. And anywhere else you're carrying the weight of anybody else on your shoulders, we're going to delete that too. Uncreate it, delete it, destroy it across all time, dimension, space, and reality. All right, stay expanded. Some of you guys are thinking too much. So thinking, thinking, thinking, thinking. Like if you're thinking, is this working? This is really weird. What's up? Any of you guys doing that? And so just kind of going for it and saying yes to every energy I offer you. Will you uncreate it, delete it, destroy it across all time, dimension, space, and reality? All right. How many of you guys are bleeding hearts and want to just, you know. Keep doing and doing and doing the same thing over and over and over again so that you can get respect from other people even if they don't want you to be abundant. Okay, will you uncreate it, delete it, destroy it? Across all time, dimensions, space, and reality. Yeah, who are you guys being poor for? All right, any of that stuff? Uncreate it, delete it, destroy it? Across all time, dimensions, space, and reality. Is there anything else that you bought about this reality that really isn't even true, that you bought from society and your parents and all that stuff, and it just bogs you down, makes you heavy, delete it all, uncreate it all, destroy it all, across all time dimensions, space, reality? Anywhere you still feel like you're kind of a victim in the past, present, or future, will you uncreate it, delete it, across all time dimensions, space, and reality? All right, so one of your energies is energetically telling me to clear something. Yeah, so I'm talking to all of your souls, by the way, and kind of just reading the energy of the group and clearing what's most beneficial for everybody. So some of you guys have the belief that I don't like being here in a body. Now, it doesn't mean that you're suicidal. It just means like that you're, you know, you feel like you're dropped off on the spaceship. And your real friends left you here on this crappy island called Earth, right? Okay, so anybody who feels any remorse for being in a body, will you uncreate it, delete it, destroy it across all time, dimension, space, and reality? Okay, anywhere else you guys are like, oh, beam me up, get me out of here. Uncreate it, delete it, destroy it across all time, dimension, space, and reality. Because that's going to block you from truly living down here because there's always one foot in the door and one foot out of the door thinking I don't really want to be here. Okay, so everything that is, that shuts off your power because you don't really want to be here. So every time you take two steps forward, you got to take two steps back just to prove that you don't want to be here. You know, kind of that rebellious spunkiness. uncreate it delete it destroy it across all time dimensions space and reality all right so thank you whoever's soul just kind of tapped me on the shoulder and pointed that out so thank you All right, so now we're going to go into some of the money ones. So everywhere you're not allowed to be free, have abundance, be in constant flow, everything that is, will you delete it all, uncreate it all, destroy it all? Everywhere you guys are not allowed to have cash money prizes or any of these cool things, anything that is, will you delete it all, uncreate it all, destroy it all? Anywhere you guys are not allowed to have anything that showed up on your wish list, will you delete all that? All right, so all the secrets that you guys feel about money, delete all those, uncreate all those across all time dimensions, space, and reality. Okay, anywhere you guys are beating yourself up, not loving yourself, paralyzing yourself, procrastinating, will you destroy, delete, uncreate, all that across all time dimensions, space, and reality. Anywhere you're suffocating yourself with money and the obligation to debt. Will you uncreate and delete all that? Anywhere that you don't feel you have the ability to know about the truth of what it is you need to do in the future to guide yourself and make a lot of money, have a lot of money, will you uncreate it and destroy all that? Anywhere you guys feel like you have no choice, will you delete all that? Across all time dimensions, space, and reality. Everywhere you feel like you can't have love. Wow, you guys have a lot of energy about love. Uncreate and delete all that. So everywhere you can have a lot of choice, a lot of love. Will you de -story and delete all that? All the energy that you're using against yourself so you can't have your dream life, uncreate it and delete all that. Some of you guys are tuning out. I can tell you that you think the energy thing sometimes isn't working. So everywhere you guys are tuning out, uncreate it, de -story it. Everywhere your mind wants to grab all the stuff that we're clearing back. Uncreate it and delete it. Everywhere you guys are worrying about your future or think that you're incompetent in any level on anything. All right. Uncreate it, delete it. Deastory it across all time, dimensions, space, and reality. Everywhere you guys aren't doing what your soul actually wants from you, which is basically to be abundant, be happy, be loved, and have a really good trip down here. Make a lot of friends. Make a lot of fun. Make a lot of love. Make a lot of money. Okay, and everything in the way of that, we uncreate and delete it and destroy it across all time, dimension, space, and reality. All right, so now we're going to go into struggle and not having enough. Okay, so everywhere you guys can't have enough and you struggle, uncreate it, delete it, destroy it across all time, dimension, space, and reality. Everywhere you guys are making it hard one more time, uncreate it, delete it, destroy it across all time, dimension, space, reality. Everywhere you think money is for other people and not you. Wow. You guys think money is for everybody else. Crazy. Okay, everything that is. Uncreate it, delete it, destroy it across all time, dimensions, space, and reality. Isn't that kind of funny? That you guys think that everybody else gets money, but I don't. Okay, whatever that is. Uncreate it. About 60 % of you believe that. Uncreate it, delete it, destroy it across all time, dimensions, space, and reality. Everywhere you guys think that everybody else gets the good life and you don't. and that the rich get richer and the poor get poorer and you've been cheated out of your life's destiny because you have no money or not enough money, will you uncreate it, delete it, destroy it across all time, dimensions, space, and reality? Everywhere you're not allowed to have all the power, all the money, all the control in your own life, will you delete it, destroy, and uncreate it? Everywhere you're not allowed to have power control to change your destiny, delete all that too. Everywhere your money always runs out before you have enough to fill it up. Everywhere you don't have enough, so therefore it always runs dry, will you uncreate it and delete all that too? Having too much money would be greedy. And what is too much, by the way? Like, what is your limit? Okay, everything that is, will you uncreate it, delete it, destroy it across all time, dimensions, space, and reality? Everywhere you're being silly with it, an idiot with it, stupid with it, all that, will you uncreate it, delete it, destroy it across all time, dimensions, space, and reality? Now, I don't think you guys are stupid idiots, but sometimes I have to call up what you guys think about yourself. Okay, so a few of you guys, a lot more than you would think, by the way, about 55 % of you think at some level that you've been stupid and an idiot with money. All right, so everything that is, uncreate it, delete it, destroy it across all time, dimension, space, reality. Everywhere you guys feel broke and broken about it, uncreate it and delete all that across all time, dimension, space, and reality. You know, at the end of the day, it just takes a powerful intention, a powerful choice to make your life go in a different way. So wherever it takes a lot of money to make money, will you delete it, uncreate all that? Everywhere you don't save it, don't allow yourself to save it, don't allow yourself to keep it, delete all that. Everywhere you have fear -based agendas so that you have to hoard it because you'll never, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever have enough again. Uncreate it and delete all that. Okay, how many of you guys are hoarders because you don't think you'll ever, ever get it again? Delete it, uncreate it, de -story it, cross all time, dimension, space, and reality. Everywhere you're basically controlled and not controlled by money. It's kind of all this because it's creating this resistance reaction and chaos because part of you wants to be controlled by money and have it. And part of you wants to control money. And there's parts of you that don't want to have money because then you have to control it or you're maybe not willing to control others with it. Because, you know, if you have a lot of money, then people are going to come to you and then you have to tell them no or yes or maybe. And it creates all this other weird stuff. So everything that is, will you uncreate it and delete it? What if you guys were willing to be the person in the neighborhood that creates the most amount of change in the neighborhood by being totally wealthy, totally conscious, and then inspire everybody around you? Everywhere you're not willing to be the inspiration that your community and your family needs, will you uncreate it, delete it, de -story it across all time, dimension, space, reality? Everywhere it's not safe to control others or have enough money to control things in your world, will you uncreate it, delete it, destroy it across all time, dimension, space, and reality? Everywhere money is lack or poverty, delete all that too. Everywhere it's a tool for manipulation, delete all that. Everywhere it's not safe to manipulate your world, uncreate and delete all that. Wow, you guys do not like being manipulated. Everything that is, will you uncreate it, delete it, destroy it across all time, dimension, space, and reality? Everywhere it's not safe to ask for what you want, delete all that. Everywhere you have to be desperate before it shows up, delete all that. Everywhere it doesn't grow in trees, delete all that. Everywhere it's abusive, worry, and can be taken away, delete all that. Okay, so uncreate and delete any other leftover, anything that's just kind of hanging out in your energy field that really wants to go right now. Okay, expand out 300 feet all the way around you and just think, woo, no matter what it takes right now, I'm going to uncreate it, delete it, destroy all these lies, misinformation. Parts of me that wants to gamble and pretend that I don't control my money, will you uncreate it, delete it, destroy it across all time, dimension, space, and reality? You guys did a really, really good job. Okay, so here's what you guys are going to do at home. You're going to do the energy statements whenever you feel density or vibrations, you know, that are kind of heavy. And you're going to ask everything in your world, does it feel light and good and true? Or does it feel like a lie? And you're going to start sorting out. Your lies and your misinformation. And then I want you guys to start thinking about what kind of changes would you really have if you lived truly, truly in an unlimited possibility field? What are you willing to change? Please continue to the next Unlimited Abundance Journey session. 

====================

LESSON 2: Clearing Doubt And Fear

- Hey, this is Christie Marie Sheldon, and you're listening to a recording I did of a series of 24 live group sessions on clearing abundance blocks. And here's what we're going to cover today in session two. Your realities are created with four things in mind, what you hold dear, you energize, how you live and what shows up for you in the outside world is always a reflection of your interior world. Third is significant energy. Anything you seem to deem important will have a lot of force with it. And four source energy moves through you and that powerful energy will follow the direction or command that you give it. And what does all this mean? That you should only live the energies you wish to have in your life, in the future. And second, I'm going to introduce you to the idea of cross purposes, because he's a little mixed up messages are sending inaccurate signals to the universe. How will the universe know what you actually really want to create? So join us and let's begin. Hi! Welcome! This is Christie. How are you? I'm so grateful that you guys are here. And I know some of you might be first-time people that you haven't been in the last webinar. So thank you, thank you, thank you for being here. If you have a moment, make sure you grab a piece of paper or a journal so that you can take some notes. And I'm going to ask you to open up, so be open to new awareness of what it is that you want to have happen in this session. So set your intentions. And this is probably the only webinar I'm going to tell you to bring your baggage. So bring all your junk because we're going to help you clear it. All right, let's get started for today. So for today, we're going to do massive clearing. We're going to talk right now about how your realities are created with four things in mind, what you hold dear to you, you reenergize. Basically what you hold dear to you re-energize. There's an interesting energy that's associated with that, which we really like. Now sometimes we even like the things that we think we hate, because for some reason they actually give us energy or they, we think that they give us power. We can get power from the negative vibration and that's why sometimes your stuff won't leave. But what you hold dear to you, you re-energize. So whatever you hold in your field, make that be that which you want to have in the future. How you live in what shows up for you is a reference of your thoughts, ideas, vibrations, and significant energy. So here's what this means. Whatever your world looks like right now, it's like a total reference to what's going on for you internally. It's a reference point to what you're thinking or have thought even in the past two years old, okay, one years old and you were thinking something and you bought and sold it to yourself, it could still be in your energy. You could be watching your mom and dad fighting about money and going, wow, people fight about money and that thought could be stuck in your vibration and maybe you're fighting yourself about money. Maybe that's how it picture shows up later in life. The other thing is your ideas, right? So it's the same concept. Any ideas that you bought from the people around you, your parents, society, you know, authority figures, whatever that is, that can impinge in your reality and creates the formation through which you live through. So if you think only actors and actresses get paid a lot of money, that, that idea what, however you imprinted it could make you think that you can't make any money and you might not even be consciously aware that that idea is vibrating in your field. Vibrations. A lot of the things that we pick up when we're kids, especially before the age of seven were basically just downloading the world and downloading the reality so that we can learn how to be human. But those vibrations basically create these fields of energy where we'll have a certain feeling where we might feel yucky and we don't know why. See not everything's a direct belief. Like, not everything's like, I believe X, Y, Z. Sometimes it's just a feeling that feels like crap for whatever reason. Okay so those feelings can be completely in our field for whatever reason and again, if you're with your mom and dad and they were fighting, you could pick up that vibration and say, "Wow, I don't want my mom and dad fighting. So I'm going to take all of their negative energy into me." And then oftentimes kids will get sick, but it's really because they're picking up their mom and dad's and negative energy. You might get sick, or are you just create these patterns that you later on are manifesting and the reason kids do this is 'cause they love their parents and they want them to get along and they think they're powerful, still, you know, infinite beings, right? And they want to heal that. So those vibrations could be sticking you and you have no clue what they are, but all the uncreate deleting and destorying that we're doing will take away all that stuff. So you don't have to live with it. Significant energy, anything that you deem is important, will have a lot of force with it. So if it's important to you, that you're always right then your whole life you'll put tons and tons of force about always being right. And then you might not even be able to see that you're wrong or that there's a better way. So significant energy. If you hold your family significant, if you hold money significant, if you hold lack of money significant, if you hold whatever, whatever it is, those things will have a lot of power energy behind them. And that's how you generate a lie. So make sure that the things that you consider important, again, are that which you want. Okay, source energy lives through your vessel making it possible to be here and creative energy is the source energy, all right? Basically, source energy, imagine for a minute, you have this bubble of reality called around you called the reality bubble and you radiate out about 10 feet all the way around you. Now you're an infinite being, so you can radiate out more than that, but let's just for illustration sake so imagine this. All of your thoughts, ideas, vibrations, and significant energy are imprinted in this reality field. Source energy moves through it from a completely neutral place, and then out pictures of your life. So the energy moves through you, and then it follows whatever command that you're giving it through the imprint in your field and then it does that. You can change your reality if you focus on listening to yourself and observing what you're doing and being, and seeing if it matches what you truly want. Like, how often do you say I really want to save money, but then you go blow it. You know, I really want to get another job, but then you won't go get another job. So all of these things, you're going to have to pay attention to a little bit and focus on what you're actually doing and being, and then say, "Well, why am I doing and being this when my real intent is XYZ," okay and that'll start shifting your world a little bit. So the action step to take from this is only live the energies that you wish to have in your life in the future. If you have to now, watch this. A lot of people will say, I want to try to blah, blah, blah. Okay, the universe doesn't understand try. It'll just see that you're always trying, but then you'll never have it. Kind of like if you say, I want to have blah, blah, blah in my life. It would be better to say that more money is coming to me, instead of I want more money. More money is coming to me every day. Even if at first you think that's a lie. If you start imprinting that, then eventually the truth will catch up, right? 'Cause you'll have demolished all the other things in the way of it. Act as if is really what that's saying. So only live, only live the energies you wish in the future. Okay. Today, we're going to show you how to unmixed your mixed up messages. And there's a thing called cross purposes that create mixed up messages and my definition of a cross purpose is more than one purpose influencing your life. Therefore, you get mixed results. This is why your manifestations don't happen 'cause you say I'm going to generate, you know, a million dollars this year. And then you have 40 other influencing things saying, "Are you crazy? That's not going to happen. The rich get richer. The poor get poorer. Money is bad. You can't make more money than your mom and dad," and on and on and on. Okay, these things are the cross-purposes in your life that are basically blocking you from having your life. And today, this is so exciting today what we're going to do. We're going to actually go through six of the places and reasons why you have these cross purposes and we're going to clear all the reasons. So it's completely interactive. You're going to have to help me out. And we're going to clear everything that shows up. Okay so the first reason you have cross-purposes is doubt. Doubt gets created by mixed messages and you don't trust yourself or feel confident in your choices. It can also, doubt can also be created from a lack of awareness. Like, maybe you just don't know what to do. So therefore you doubt you're doing the right thing. Okay so, that's talking about inner guidance as well, but doubt could be like, oh, I want to move forward. And then you have this other energy inside you that says, "No, you can't do that." That's a cross purpose. And we're going to uncover all the, "No, you can't do those" today. So we're going to go, I'm going to type things in and I want you guys to interact with me and type me your responses. And here's what we're going to do. We're going to ask this question and I want you to just show up inside yourself, all the stuff, even if it makes total nonsense. So when you ask this question to yourself, what do I doubt or not trust in manifesting my abundance? What do I doubt or not trust that I can do to manifest abundance? Even if it's whatever silly thing you're thinking, just show it up right now. I won't be able to handle it. She doesn't think she'll be able to handle abundance. Oh yeah. What do you doubt or trust that you're, age-related too old, you know, too old, young, whatever. That abundance is not really for me. Which means it's kind of then for everyone else, right? It's like you're out of luck. Oh, the invisible map. Yeah, it's like the invisible direction book that everybody else has, but you don't have. Invisible directions everyone else has. I'm not clever enough. Don't really believe I can. Okay so Drego said, "Don't really believe I can." Ooh yeah. She doubts somebody else. Amber doubts her abilities. Her ability is not enough. Okay, it'll never happen from Paula. It'll never happen for me. I am not good enough from Annette. Always self-sabotage. Oh, interesting. So Roman has identities attached to money problems. So somehow it's like, he thinks it's part of him. I doubt receiving. So she doesn't think she can receive, Shareen. Afraid I will fail. Yeah, so why kind of, why bother? Afraid you'll fail. Okay so Veronique. I can see everybody's. I just get so many at one time. She's saying, "I can't see you." I do see what you're writing. I just can't write everybody's. Okay, I never got it before, why bother? There's a lot of energies that end with why bother? I never, blah, blah, blah, why bother? I can't why bother, right? It's never going to happen. Why bother? Oh, if I get it all blow it. If I get it, whatever the it is, I'll blow it, right? It doesn't matter what it is, opportunity. Other doubts and trust that, yeah. That you were no teaching on abundance. So how would I know? Okay these are all really good. Another one it's difficult. Hard, struggle, not to easy, all these. So now what we're going to do is we're going to clear these. Here's what we're going to clear, and we're going to go connect to the light. So everybody close your eyes for a minute and then roll your eyes up. Okay, see sense or feel the light and take your energy about 300 feet up. So see sense or feel the light and ask this light to come like a stream, just like a rain shower. You don't have to do anything. You just have to open and it'll come into your head, it'll come into your face. It'll come into your neck. It'll come into your chest. It'll go down your arms. And it's like liquid light and it just fills you. It goes into your chest and your torso and your stomach, down your hips, thighs, knees, calves, feet, just like open and let it in just like a, just like a shower. Take this beam of light. Let it go to the center of the planet. And there you will connect to this happy place right in the middle. All right, there's a happy place right in the middle. And like a trampoline, it just kind of bounces right back up through your feet and into your chest and into your heart and it radiates out 360 all the way around you. All right. Now, take your energy and get bigger than your house. Bigger than your city, bigger than your country, bigger than the world. Just kind of expand out and allow the light to show up. 'Cause now you're connected in all directions, you're being unlimited. So everywhere you don't trust yourself and doubt yourself in manifesting your abundance and wealth, will you please, please, please uncreate all of it, delete all of it and de-story and destroy all of it, across all time, dimension, space and reality. And for those of you listening for the first time, I'm going to give you what delete means, deleted across all time, dimension, space and reality. Uncreate means we pulling out the weeds from the very first time you created it and pulling it out from way back when and destroy, you can really destroy energy. You can only take the story out of it, right? So we're just clearing the dense matter and taking the story out of it. So this is a lot of heavy energy on this one today. So whatever you doubt don't trust in manifesting your abundance and wealth, will you please, please, please uncreate, delete and destroy all of it times a gazillion. Okay, one more time. All the places where you doubt that you can have it, don't trust that you can have it, think you can't ever, you know, make it happen and all the reasons why you have these doubts, delete, destroy, and uncreate all of them. Okay, now we're going to go to the next one. Everywhere you don't think you can go forward and trust that you're making a good decision, will you please delete, destroy and uncreate all that. Everywhere you think that you can't do it, delete, destroy, and uncreate all that. Everywhere you think that I won't be able to handle it, delete, destroy, and uncreate all that times a gazillion. Everywhere you think you're too old, too young, too important, not important enough, too stable, not stable enough, all your excuses, delete, destroy and uncreate all those. Okay any other too olds, too youngs, too important, too drama-filled, too much of a problem, whatever your toos are, delete, destroy and uncreate all those times a gazillion. Anywhere that you doubt or trust that this could be for you, it's not for you, it's for everyone else. Delete, destroy, and uncreate, uncreate everything about that times a gazillion. All right, everywhere else, you think that you don't have like the secret sauce, you know, the invisible map or directions that everybody else has. Okay, everything that is, will you please, please, please delete, destroy and uncreate all of them. Okay, everywhere you're not clever or smart enough, delete, destroy, and uncreate it all. Everywhere you're not a know it all and you can't know it all, right? Delete, destroy, and uncreate all that. Everywhere you don't really believe you can, delete, destroy and uncreate all that. Everywhere your abilities are not enough, will you please, please, please delete, destroy and uncreate all that times a gazillion. Everywhere you think it'll never happen for you, will you please delete, destroy and uncreate all that. Everywhere you think I am not good enough, will you please delete, destroy and uncreate all of that. Everywhere you self sabotage and all the reasons why, will you delete, destroy and uncreate all that. Everywhere your identities are attached to money problems, that's who you are, you think, delete, destroy, and uncreate all that. Everywhere you doubt receiving, will you please delete, destroy and uncreate all that. Everywhere you're afraid you'll fail, why bother and all your other why bothers, delete, destroy and uncreate all that. All your maybe is like, maybe I'll try, maybe I won't try. Maybe I'll try, maybe I won't try it. Ooh you guys got a lot of maybes. Delete, destroy, and uncreate all of those. Everywhere I never got it before, so why bother again, never happened before, why bother? Delete, destroy, and uncreate all that. If I get it, I'll blow it. You know, I'll ruin my only chance or I'll blow my money or I'll blow the deal, delete, destroy, and uncreate all that. And everywhere you have no teaching on abundance, so you can never, ever, ever have it in the future, delete, destroy, and uncreate all that. And everywhere it's hard to struggle and not easy, delete, destroy, and uncreate, all that. All right, you guys, good job. All right, we're going to clear some more. Are you ready? Okay. So let's see what we're going to do next. We're going to go here. I'm going to ask you this question. And once again, just think of all the non sensible things, you know, it doesn't have to make sense. It's like the crazy mind stuff we're thinking about. Okay, like all the places where we think are stupid and pathetic and whatever we think. So what am I avoiding being aware of that would help my abundance and wealth generation. So what are you avoiding, being aware of that would help your wealth and abundance generation? What am I avoiding being aware of that would help my abundance and wealth generation. Okay so what am I avoiding being aware of that would help my abundance and wealth generation. So a couple things you could be avoid being aware of your future goals and desires. Another thing is you could not want to be aware of what your family maybe needs for you. You're avoiding being too big. What are you avoiding being aware of that you could be that you could be all that, right? What else are you avoiding being aware of? Not aware of the actions you need to take. Yeah, that's a perfect example. That I am an unlimited being. Oh, interesting. I love this Roman, thank you. You know, this, this is a good one 'cause a lot of people has it. The fundamental belief, he actually said the fundamental dislike that money has to be earned. You know what, when I decided to change my belief that I get paid for being me, it didn't seem like such a drudgery. Ooh, okay. So, Hey Bonnie, how are you? I know Bonnie. She's avoiding responsibility that I think would come from being big in the world. Like, basically avoiding being so big her light shines and everyone sees her. How many agree, how many have that one? Amber, she's avoiding being aware of her bank accounts. So that's actually a good one 'cause you know, we oftentimes do that, right? We won't look at our bank accounts. You know, it's better to put our head in the sand. Okay, this one being a student, which is probably be about learning something new. Showing up in the world. Somebody says being famous, avoiding mastery. Ooh, I like this, avoiding paperwork. How many of you do you avoid paperwork? How many do that? So vulnerable. When we're vulnerable, we basically don't have any walls around us and if we don't have any walls around us, then we can manifest things. So being vulnerable is really being authentic. Fear of success. Being scared to try. What else do we got? Avoiding pain. Yeah so maybe you think that something new will cause pain so you avoid it. And avoiding change. All right, these are good. So connect to the light again and again, you guys will get really fast with this. So look up, hook up, let the light in. Let it go all the way through you to the center of the earth. And then let that bounce back up inside you into your heart and radiate out. Now, what am I avoiding being aware of that would help my abundance and wealth generation and everything that you guys are being unaware and avoiding, will you please, please, please uncreate, delete and destroy all of it. All the places where you're being unaware and avoiding who you are and what you could be in the future, delete, destroy, and uncreate all of it. Everything else you guys are avoiding or being unaware, all your cans, shouldn'ts, wouldn'ts, couldn'ts could nevers, delete, destroy, and uncreate all those. Okay and all your sick and tireds, all that stuff. I can kind of feel a little sick and tired going on. Okay, everything that is, delete, destroy and uncreate all those. All your weariness and fear of being seen, delete all those. All the future goals and desires unmet, delete, destroy, and uncreate all those. All the things you think your family wants from you that you can't do, delete, destroy, and uncreate all those. all the things that you could be that you're not, delete, destroy, and uncreate all of those. All of the things that you're not aware, you're not aware of the actions you need to take when you're blocking out what actions you need to take. All those things, delete, destroy, and uncreate all that. And all the reasons why you do that, delete, destroy, and uncreate all of that. Everywhere that you feel your unlimited or not unlimited, delete all that. Everywhere you have a fundamental dislike for money at any level, earn to not earn, saving, keeping, fundamental dislike about money, delete, destroy, and uncreate all of that. Everywhere you're avoiding being so big, your light shines and everyone sees you, delete all that. Everywhere you're avoiding being in your power, delete all that. Everywhere you're avoiding looking at your bank accounts, delete all that. Everywhere you're voiding being a new student, learning new things, showing up in the world, delete all that. Everywhere you're avoiding being famous, delete all that or well known or well known in your circle or well-known in society, or well-known in your corner, or well known in your neighborhood or well-known in your family, any of that, delete all that. Anywhere you're avoiding mastery, anywhere you're avoiding the, you know, all your talents and ability showing up in your world okay, delete all that, destroy all that, uncreate all that. Everywhere you're avoiding paperwork and getting things done, everywhere you're avoiding being vulnerable, delete all that. Anywhere your avoiding your fear of success, delete all that. Anywhere you're avoiding being scared to try, delete all that. Anywhere you're avoiding pain, delete all that. Anywhere you avoiding change, delete, destroy, and uncreate all of that. Anywhere you're avoiding being not sure of yourself, delete, destroy, and uncreate all that. And once again, all the other things that came up for you today, when you asked this question, delete, destroy, and uncreate everything in the way of that. Okay now what I'm going to encourage you guys to do is go back to these in the PDF and you can either listen again or just do them on your own, but clear them all a couple more times, for sure. You're an infinite being, who's probably had a million thoughts in your life and if you believe in past lives and all that, you might've had other lifetimes where you were doing the same kind of thing. So I would probably try to clear them every day and at least a couple of times before the next session. All right? You guys are good. You guys are ready to move energy and be done with all this stuff. So now we are going to go to the next cross purpose. Here it is. Neglecting yourself. This point that where you don't want to look at what you're actually spending your time and efforts doing in your life. We all have denial systems where we don't want to look at what we are actually creating. Like, trying to say money that you never do or go to work, but hate it every day. But you won't send out a resume, ask for a new position or do anything different. So that's like neglecting yourself because you're not really choosing for you, right? It's about choosing against you. So how many of you guys are like basically the worst enemy in your own life? Let's clear that energy, it just came up. All of the places you guys are the worst enemy in your own life, delete, destroy, and uncreate all that times a gazillion. Okay, one more time. All of the places you guys are the worst enemy in your own life, delete, destroy, and uncreate it all. What are you guys fighting? Yourself. Okay, delete, destroy and uncreate all that. All right. Let's look at all the places in your life that you neglect or don't change and then this is where you're going to have to focus on, ask why you let this happen and then just whatever pops up in your head, you're going to have to clear it. All right? So now let's go to, how do I neglect myself in manifesting abundance and wealth? How do I neglect myself in manifesting abundance and wealth? I like this response 'cause how many has just plain lazy? You know what that that's, that's a weariness. That's actually a heavy energy in your heart, usually that can be cleared. I've seen it before. You can change that. So worst enemy in my life and that was Carrie. Thank you, Carrie. Veronique said her motivation drops. Afraid of greatness. I procrastinate. Yep, procrastinating. Look at that word. It's like, basically cutting off your future, Cutting off parts of yourself, you know? That's pretty much what that is. Irregular energy being inert. Won't move. Can't move. All right, what about this one? Oh, I love this one. Distract yourself because you know what, here's what we can do. We can distract ourself, she said with minutia. Thank you, Annette. But you know what? It's all about this. It's like TV. It's the web. It's gossip, you know, gossip. It's like sugar, alcohol, all the places where we check out. How else do you neglect yourself? Oh, unfinished projects. Yeah. How many unfinished projects do you guys have? Neglecting completing things. Don't respect self. That's what you guys are neglecting. Thank you, Ivan. Sleep. Though all those things are a way that we neglect ourselves. Keep yourself a little foggy. Ooh, this is a good one. Not paying bills on time. You know, but this could also be like not taking the time to look through and figure out the best deal you could get or paying attention to those kinds of things, all of that. Talking self out of good ideas. That's how you neglect, that's a good one. How many of you talk yourself out of good ideas or where you don't even know if they're good ideas 'cause you won't even try. Not wanting to take charge, overdoing, caring for others first. All right, these are good ones. Criticizing, self criticizing. All right, we're going to clear these. So let's connect to the light again. Close your eyes. Connect to the light. Let the light come through all the way through your body, into the center of the planet. Connect from the center of the planet backup to you. Now again, you guys are kind of used to this. So even if you think you can't connect that much, that quickly, you totally can. All right so just pretend you can. So you're radiating out from your heart 360 degrees all the way around you like a big sunshine and here's, what's going to happen. Be bigger than your house, bigger than your town, bigger than your state, bigger than your country. I wonder if you guys can feel all that, but you guys got really big right there. That's lovely. You can clear more when you get a little bigger, how do you neglect yourself in manifesting wealth and abundance? All the places you neglect yourself, delete, destroy, and uncreate all those. All the places you neglect yourself, either known to you or unknown to you, delete, destroy, and uncreate all those things. How many other ways or places do you neglect yourself in manifesting your true abundance, your true wealth, delete, destroy and uncreate all that. All the other places you disconnect from being totally abundant, totally happy, delete, destroy, and uncreate all that. All the other places where you check out, delete all those. Everywhere you neglect yourself by not doing what you need, want and desire for your life, delete, destroy, and uncreate all that. Everywhere your self talk is about hating yourself, delete, destroy, and uncreate all that. Okay you guys, everywhere you guys self-talk in the lower dimensions, delete all that. Every other place you guys neglect yourself, by just being lazy, delete destroy and uncreate all that. All the other places you guys are the worst enemy in your own life, delete, destroy, and uncreate all that. Everywhere you guys are afraid of your greatness, delete, destroy, and uncreate all that. Everywhere you guys procrastinate, delete, destroy, and uncreate all that. Everywhere you guys have a regular energy, you won't keep yourself up, delete, destroy, and uncreate all that. All the places where you guys can't move, can't change. inert, can't budge, delete, destroy, and uncreate all that. Everywhere you guys are distracted by TV, web, gossips, sugar, and alcohol, delete, destroy, and uncreate all that. Everywhere you have unfinished projects, things that you don't want to get done, delete, destroy, and uncreate all those. Everywhere you're neglecting completing things, delete, destroy, and uncreate all that. Everywhere you don't respect yourself, don't love yourself, don't choose for yourself, don't gift to yourself, don't celebrate yourself, delete, destroy, and uncreate all that. Everywhere you can't sleep, take care of your body, whatever that means to you so that you can be abundant, healthy, wealthy, and wise, delete, destroy, and uncreate all that. Everywhere you guys won't play the bills on time or find the best deal or, you know, do whatever would be good for you in the, you know, reformation of your money, delete, destroy, and uncreate all that. Everywhere you guys want to take care or talk yourself out of good ideas or any ideas, delete, destroy, and uncreate all that. Everywhere you guys are not wanting to take charge and make a choice, delete, destroy, and uncreate all that. Everywhere you guys are overdoing it, caring for others before yourself and you know, it's kind of like the whole thing with the plane and the oxygen, put the oxygen mask on yourself first and then help everybody else. So you had to be filled with light first and then you'll feel happy, therefore you'll do it from a different place. You'll do it from a kind, caring, compassionate place versus feeling totally distracted and not liking yourself and doing it from a place where it annoys you, okay. So fill your self up first 'cause it'll help you and everybody else around you. Okay, delete, destroy, and uncreate all that. Everywhere you criticize yourself or do self-loathing in any form delete, destroy, and uncreate all that. And one more biggie, all the places that came up for you, where you guys neglect yourself in any way, delete, destroy, and uncreate all that. And we're going to fill you back in with the vibration. So we're going to say this. So we feel you back in what vibrational energy can you be and become, and have to love yourself more and more every day. What would it take for you to be the vibrational energy of more and more love for yourself every day? What would it take for you guys to be and invite in and become the vibrational energy of loving more, having more, having it your way, loving yourself enough to let, let it be the highest and best possible way and all those things. We're going to talk more about filling in, but it's always good to fill in after everything. So you can fill in with whatever vibrational energy that you want to become more of. Okay because everything operates kind of at the energetic level. So you can delete those things and you can fill in. Now what you don't know, and maybe don't know is when you delete these things, you naturally, because you're filling it with light, you're automatically kind of filling in, but it's always nice to add a little bit more. So you're automatically filling in with your stuff once you delete all these other things. Okay 'cause you can't really destroy yourself. You can only destroy the lies and the negative energy. So here's where we're going to go. We're going to go to the slide show. Okay and we are going to go to the energy statements down here. Now, next time we're going to finish everything. All those other things that we were talking about, we're going to finish those. So here's the, remember the clearing statement. Deleted across all time, dimension, space reality, uncreated all by unplugging from the first moment you created it, destroy it all, de-story it all and leading all falsehoods and untruth. You can go through the journal right now, all the things that we can just cleared, any aha moments that you had that are really cool and inspiring. You just write what abundance bok you're clearing and how did it, how did it manifest in your life and, you know, go through some of the tools and how they helped you with this block and any other additional things that came up for you that you know you need to clear, okay? Here's like a bigger picture of it. And you can type it in and you can save it. And then you'll always have it for yourself. Do the energy statements on everything that comes up for you, any fear, hate, worry, anger, frustration, you know, anybody pushes your buttons, you're going to have to do the energy statement and just say everything that's creating all this, I delete it, uncreate it, and de-story it all. Ask when you're saying something out loud, is this true? Do you want it to be true for you in the future? If it's light it's truth, if it's heavy, it's false and probably has a lie attached to it. If it makes you feel bad about something, there's usually a lie there. And everything we cleared, I would love it if you could do it a few more times, at least two more times, preferably every day. Okay and it'll clear a lot of your buttons. All right, I love you all. I will see you for session three. We are going to clear more of the cross purposes.

LESSON 2: Clearing Doubt And Fear (Clearing Session Only)

Your realities are created with four things in mind. What you hold dear, you energize. How you live and what shows up for you in the outside world is always a reflection of your interior world. Third is significant energy. Anything you seem to deem important will have a lot of force with it. And four, source energy moves through you and that powerful energy will follow the direction or command that you give it. And what does all this mean? that you should only live the energies you wish to have in your life in the future. And second, I'm going to introduce you to the idea of cross purposes because these little mixed up messages are sending inaccurate signals to the universe. How will the universe know what you actually really want to create? So join us and let's begin. Hi, welcome. This is Christy. How are you? I'm so grateful that you guys are here. And I know some of you might be first -time people that you haven't been in the last webinar. So thank you, thank you, thank you for being here. If you have a moment, make sure you grab a piece of paper or a journal so that you can take some notes. And I'm going to ask you to open up, be open to new awareness of what it is that you want to have happen in this session. So set your intentions. going to tell you to bring your baggage. So bring all your junk because we're going to help you clear it. Alright, let's get started for today. So for today, we're going to do massive clearing. We're going to talk right now about how your realities are created with four things in mind. What you hold dear to you, you re -energize. Basically, what you hold dear to you, you re -energize. There's an interesting energy that's associated with that which we really like. Now sometimes we even like the things that we think we hate because for some reason they actually give us energy or we think that they give us power. We can get power from the negative vibration and that's why sometimes your stuff won't leave. But what you hold dear to you, you re -energize. So whatever you hold in your field, make that be that which you want to have in the future. How you live and what shows up for you is a reference of your thoughts, ideas, vibrations, and significant energy. So here's what this means. Whatever your world looks like right now, it's like a total reference to what's going on for you internally. It's a reference point to what you're thinking or have thought even in the past two years old, okay, one years old, and you were thinking something and you bought and sold it to yourself. It could still be in your energy. You could be watching your mom and dad fighting about money and going, wow, people fight about money. And that thought could be stuck in your vibration. And maybe you're fighting yourself about money. Maybe that's how it shows up later in life. The other thing is your ideas, right? So it's the same concept. Any ideas that you bought from the people around you, your parents, society, you know, authority figures, whatever that is, that can impinge in your reality and creates the formation through which you live through. So if you think only actors and actresses get paid a lot of money, that idea, however you imprinted it, could make you think that you can't make any money and you might not even be consciously aware that that idea is vibrating in your field. vibrations. A lot of the things that we pick up when we're kids, especially before the age of seven, we're basically just downloading the world and downloading the reality so that we can learn how to be human. But those vibrations basically create these fields of energy where we'll have a certain feeling where we might feel yucky and we don't know why. See, not everything's a direct belief, like not everything's like a I believe XYZ. Sometimes it's just a feeling that feels like crap for whatever reason. Okay, so those feelings can be completely in our field for whatever reason. And again, if you're with your mom and dad and they're fighting, you could pick up that vibration and say, wow, I don't want my mom and dad fighting. So I'm going to take all of their negative energy into me. And then oftentimes kids will get sick, but it's really because they're picking up their mom and dad's negative energy. You might get sick or you just create these patterns that you later on are manifesting. And the reason kids do this is because they love their parents and they want them to get along and they think they're powerful still, you know, infinite beings, right? And they want to heal them. So those vibrations could be sticking you and you have no clue what they are. But all the uncreate, deleting, and de -storying that we're doing will take away all that stuff. So you don't have to live with it. Significant energy. Anything that you deem as important will have a lot of force with it. If it's important to you that you're always right, then your whole life you'll put tons and tons of force about always being right. And then you might not even be able to see that you're wrong or that there's a better way. So significant energy. If you hold your family significant, if you hold money significant, if you hold lack of money significant, if you hold whatever it is, those things will have a lot of power or energy behind them. And that's how you generate a life. So make sure that the things that you consider important. Again, are that what you want. Okay, source energy lives through your vessel making it possible to be here and creative energy is the source energy, all right? Basically, source energy, imagine for a minute you have this bubble of reality around you called the reality bubble and you radiate out about 10 feet all the way around you. Now you're an infinite being so you can radiate out more than that but let's just for illustration sakes imagine this. All of your thoughts, ideas, vibrations, and significant energy are imprinted in this reality field. Source energy moves through it from a completely neutral place and then out pictures your life. So the energy moves through you and then it follows whatever command that you're giving it through the imprint in your field and then it does that. You can change your reality if you focus on listening to yourself and observing what you're doing in being and seeing if it matches up what you truly want. Like how often do you say, I really want to save money, but then you go blow it. You know, I really want to get another job, but then you won't go get another job. So all of these things you're going to have to pay attention to a little bit and focus on what you're actually doing in being and then say, well, why am I doing in being this when my real intent is XYZ? Okay, and that'll start shifting your world a little bit. So the action step to take from this is only live the energies that you wish to have in your life in the future. If you have to, now watch this, a lot of people will say, I want to try to blah, blah, blah. Okay, the universe doesn't understand try. It'll just see that you're always trying, but then you'll never have it. Kind of like if you say, I want to have blah, blah, blah in my life. It would be better to say that more money is coming to me instead of I want more money. More money is coming to me every day. Even if at first you think that's a lie, if you start imprinting that, then eventually the truth will catch up, right? Because you'll have demolished all the other things in the way of it. Act as if is really what that's saying. So only live, only live the energies you wish in the future. Okay, today we're going to show you how to unmix your mixed up messages. And there's a thing called cross purposes that create mixed up messages. And my definition of a cross purpose is more than one purpose influencing your life. Therefore, you get mixed results. This is why your manifestations don't happen. Because you say, I'm going to generate, you know, a million dollars this year. And then you have 40 other... influencing things saying are you crazy that's not gonna happen the rich get richer the poor get poorer money is bad um you can't make more money than your mom and dad and on and on and on okay these things are the cross purposes in your life that are basically blocking you from having your life and today this is so exciting today what we're gonna do we're gonna actually go through six of the places and reasons why you have these cross purposes and we're gonna clear all the reasons so it's completely interactive you're gonna have to help me out and We're going to clear everything that shows up. Okay, so the first reason you have cross purposes is doubt. Doubt gets created by mixed messages and you don't trust yourself or feel confident in new choices. It can also, doubt can also be created from a lack of awareness. Like maybe you just don't know what to do so therefore you doubt you're doing. the right thing okay so that's talking about inner guidance as well but doubt could be like oh i want to move forward and then you have this other energy inside you that says no you can't do that That's a cross purpose. And we're going to uncover all the, no, you can't do those today. So we're going to go, I'm going to type things in and I want you guys to interact with me and type me your responses. And here's what we're going to do. We're going to ask this question and I want you to just show up inside yourself all the stuff, even if it makes total nonsense. So when you ask this question to yourself, what do I doubt or not trust in manifesting my abundance? What do I doubt or not trust that I can do? to manifest abundance. Even if it's whatever silly thing you're thinking, just show it up right now. I won't be able to handle it. She doesn't think she'll be able to handle abundance. Oh yeah, what do you doubt or trust? That you're age -related, too old, you know, too old, young, whatever. That abundance is not really for me, which means it's kind of then for everyone else, right? It's like you're out of luck. Oh, the invisible map. Yeah, it's like the invisible direction book that everybody else has, but you don't have. Invisible directions, everyone else has. I'm not clever enough. Don't really believe I can. Okay, so Drago said, don't really believe I can. Oh, yeah, she doubts somebody else. Amber doubts her abilities. Her ability is not enough. Okay, it'll never happen. From Paula, it'll never happen for me. I am not good enough. From Annette, always self -sabotage. Oh, interesting. So Roman has identities attached to money problems. So somehow it's like he thinks it's part of him. I doubt receiving. So she doesn't think she can receive. Shireen, afraid I will fail. Yeah, so what kind of why bother? Afraid you'll fail. Okay, so Vronique, I can see everybody's. I just get so many at one time. She's saying I can't see you. I do see what you're writing. I just can't write everybody's. Okay, I never got it before. Why bother? There's a lot of energies that end with why bother. I never blah, blah, blah. Why bother? I can't. Why bother, right? It's never going to happen. Why bother? Oh, if I get it, I'll blow it. If I get it, whatever the it is, I'll blow it, right? it doesn't matter what it is opportunity other doubts and trust that yeah that you were no teaching on abundance so how would i know okay these are all really good another one it's difficult hard struggle not easy all these so now what we're going to do is we're going to clear these here's what we're going to clear and we're going to go connect to the light so everybody close your eyes for a minute and then roll your eyes up okay see sense or feel the light and take your energy about 300 feet up So see, sense, or feel the light. And ask this light to come like a stream, just like a rain shower. You don't have to do anything. You just have to open. It'll come into your head. It'll come into your face. It'll come into your neck. It'll come into your chest. It'll go down your arms. It's like liquid light, and it just fills you. It goes into your chest and your torso and your stomach, down your hips. thighs, knees, calves, feet, just like open and let it in, just like a shower. Take this beam of light, let it go to the center of the planet, and there you will connect to this happy place right in the middle. All right, there's a happy place right in the middle, and like a trampoline, it just kind of bounces right back up through your feet and into your chest and into your heart, and it radiates out 360 degrees all the way around you. All right. Now take your energy and get bigger than your house, bigger than your city, bigger than your country, bigger than the world. Just kind of expand out and allow the light to show up. Okay, so now you're connected in all directions. You're being unlimited. So everywhere you don't trust yourself and doubt yourself in manifesting your abundance and wealth, will you please, please, please uncreate all of it, delete all of it, and destroy and destroy all of it across all time, dimensions, space, and reality. And for those of you listening for the first time, I'm going to give you what delete means, deleted across all time, dimensions, space, and reality. Uncreate means we're pulling out the weeds from the very first time you created it and pulling it out from way back when and destroy. You can't really destroy energy. You can only take the story out of it, right? So we're just clearing the dense matter and taking the story out of it. So this is a lot of heavy energy on this one today. So whatever you doubt, don't trust in manifesting your abundance and wealth, will you please, please, please uncreate, delete, and destroy all of it times a gazillion? okay one more time all the places where you doubt that you can have it don't trust that you can have it think you can't ever you know make it happen and all the reasons why you have these doubts delete destroy and uncreate all of them okay now we're going to go to the next one everywhere you don't think you can go forward and trust that you're making a good decision will you please delete destroy and uncreate all that everywhere you think that you can't do it delete destroy and uncreate all that everywhere you think that i won't be able to handle it Delete, destroy, and uncreate all that times a gazillion. Everywhere you think you're too old, too young, too important, not important enough, too stable, not stable enough, all your excuses, delete, destroy, and uncreate all those. Okay, any other too olds, too youngs, too important, too drama filled, too much of a problem, whatever your twos are, delete, destroy, and uncreate all those times a gazillion. anywhere that you doubt or trust that this could be for you. It's not for you, it's for everyone else. Delete, destroy, and uncreate everything about that times a gazillion. All right, everywhere else you think that you don't have like the secret sauce, you know, the invisible map or directions that everybody else has. Okay, everything that is, will you please, please, please delete, destroy, and uncreate all of them. Okay, everywhere you're not clever or smart enough, delete, destroy, and uncreate it all. Everywhere you're not a know -it -all and you can't know it all, right? Delete, destroy, and uncreate all that. Everywhere you don't really believe you can, delete, destroy, and uncreate all that. Everywhere your abilities are not enough, will you please, please, please delete, destroy, and uncreate all that times a gazillion. Everywhere you think it'll never happen for you, will you please delete, destroy, and uncreate all that? Everywhere you think I am not good enough, will you please delete, destroy, and uncreate all of that? Everywhere you self -sabotage and all the reasons why, will you delete, destroy, and uncreate all that? Everywhere your identities are attached to money problems, that's who you are, you think? Delete, destroy, and uncreate all that. Everywhere you doubt receiving, will you please delete, destroy, and uncreate all that? Everywhere you're afraid you'll fail, why bother? And all your other why bothers? Delete, destroy, and uncreate all that. All your maybes, like maybe I'll try, maybe I won't try. Maybe I'll try, maybe I won't try. Ooh, you guys got a lot of maybes. Delete, destroy, and uncreate all of those. Everywhere I never got it before, so why bother again? Never happened before? Why bother? Delete, destroy, and uncreate all that. If I get it, I'll blow it. You know, I'll ruin my only chance, or I'll blow my money, or I'll blow the deal. Delete, destroy, and uncreate all that. And everywhere you have no teaching on abundance, so you can never, ever, ever have it in the future. Delete, destroy, and uncreate all that. And everywhere is hard to struggle and not easy. Delete, destroy, and uncreate all that. All right, you guys. Good job. All right. We're going to clear some more. Are you ready? Okay. So let's see what we're going to do next. We're going to go here. We're going to ask you this question. And once again, just think of all the non -sensible things. You know, it doesn't have to make sense. It's like the crazy. mind stuff we're thinking about okay like all the places where we think are stupid and pathetic and whatever we think so what am i avoiding being aware of that would help my abundance and wealth generation so what are you avoiding being aware of that would help your wealth and abundance generation. What am I avoiding being aware of that would help my abundance and wealth generation? Okay, so what am I avoiding being aware of that would help my abundance and wealth generation? So a couple things, you could be avoid being aware of your future goals and desires. Another thing is you could not want to be aware of what your family maybe needs for you. You're avoiding being too big. What are you avoiding being aware of that you could be all that, right? What else are you avoiding being aware of? Not aware of the actions you need to take. Yeah, that's a perfect example. That I am an unlimited being. Oh, interesting. I love this, Roman. Thank you. You know, this is a good one because a lot of people have it. 

====================

LESSON 3: Overcoming the Fear of Change

- Hey, this is Christie Marie Sheldon, and you're listening to a recording I did of a series of 24 live group sessions on clearing your abundance blocks. And here's what we're going to cover in this session Number three. So in the last session, I introduced you guys to the idea of cross-purposes. And I mentioned that there were six major ones that people get hung up on. And the first two, we clear doubt and self neglect. Today, we're going to tackle number three, change, and this is a doozy. This is the cross purpose where you think you might want to change, you actually proclaim. You want to change, but then you energetically fight the steps it takes to create it. You won't believe how many people I've worked on, who when I asked them to let go of a certain reality field or change, literally over 10,000 people has shown me this. They don't want to let go of that because some part of them really loves it and believes they need it to be safe and survive. And then we're going to take a look at three big stumbling blocks to change. Number one, what change in your abundance or wealth situation, are you avoiding? Two what's keeping you disconnected from source and therefore not allowing change. And three, what abundance and wealth generating ideas are you not acting upon because you don't think you know what to do? So all of these will be covered today. So let's begin.

- Hey there. Welcome, welcome. This is Christie, how are you? Today is day three of unlimited abundance. And I am thrilled, thrilled, thrilled that you guys are here. And just so you know, we're going to do a whole big setting intention thing and basically your vision, how you want your future. But I was guided that we need to clear basically the baggage that you have underneath that because sometimes, and oftentimes you don't set the highest intentions for yourself because you're actually basically subjecting yourself to the old patterns and programs. And you're not really living what you truthfully want. You might be settling. So we're clearing some things first and don't worry. We're going to work on getting you your abundance. And you're going to actually, during this course, you're going to take some action, okay? So I'm all about action. So we're going to get you into the new part of your life, whatever that may be for you. And I want you to bring your baggage, like whatever that is. And again, I always giggle in this section because how many people would tell you to bring all your baggage out, right? So bring all your baggage. We're going to clear it tonight. So let's begin. This is my favorite favorite part of the day. We are going to talk about inspiring stories. And the reason I have this section is because we want to celebrate you. So first off, I want to celebrate everything that you guys have been going through. I'm going to go through a couple of them that I have this one's cool. Alison had some issues with her body and she manifested a free seminar. And it was with one of the gurus and like BodyMind science. And she got in for free. She could ask her question and she got him to answer very specifically what it was that he could do, what she could do to help fix her body. So she got an answer, right? And she got it for free. This is another really good one. I love this. It's really cool if you guys set some kind of strange intentions just to see what comes up and what I mean by strange, as who listen to the story. Elizabeth set an intention to start getting a hundred dollar bills given to her, which is a really good intention, right? And so here's what happened. First off, a friend who owed her some money, paid her with two, $100 bills that was on Saturday. Then on Sunday, she was invited to come over and play in paint in a studio. And she'd been meaning to do that. Her friend was going to give her $25 for the materials, but she insisted on giving her $100. So she manifests with another a hundred dollars bill. Then she went to the bank and the cashier was giving her some change and he looked up and said, do you want hundreds? Then she manifested a trip, a free trip to San Diego at a specific hotel. She said she got gifts and books given to her, some extra money, a free trip, a hotel, some hundred dollar bills. So that's been a good week. I would call that a really great week. She also does, like one of my favorite things is I just bless everybody and love them, send them good energy down the street in the office anywhere, right? So she was doing this and she started feeling love and compassion for people. So that's the blessing in it. The blessing in it, when you send love and blessings to everybody else, you are changed, okay? So it's kind of a selfish thing, but in a good way, thank you, Elizabeth. I want you guys to just think for a moment of all the really cool things that happened for you in the last couple of weeks. Even if it's just a little thing, like maybe somebody was nice to you on the street or your husband was a little nice or your coworker was a little nicer to you. All those things are just part of manifesting, true abundance in your life. So we're going to go through, and we're going to clear some more things. If you remember we were working on the reality and how it's created. So if we can get to the root of how realities are created, when we go to basically download or import or put out into the universe, what your next steps are, we kind of need a clean slate. So remember what you hold dear to you, you re-energize, what you love even if it's that you love that you hate that's reenergizing it, yes. How you live in what shows up for you as a reference to your thoughts, by ideas, vibrations, and significant energy. So look at your life and you'll see what it is that you really need to shift. Source energy is the energy that moves through you making all the creative energy and all the things in your life that are creative and can show up possible. And you can change your reality by listening to yourself, observing what you're doing and being, and really seeing if that's what you're choosing in the future. Because what you're being in the moment is what you are choosing in the future. Unmixed, you're mixed up messages. So if you guys remember, we were talking about cross purposes and cross purposes are more than one purpose, influencing your life, giving you your mixed results. And we went over the first few and we're going to go over the next two today. Doubt. So doubt gives you mixed messages and lack of awareness. And we cleared a lot of things on this. Then we went over and cleared, neglecting yourself. Basically that's denial where we are actually in denial of what we're creating. And we don't really want to look at it all the way and that can be neglecting yourself. So today's number three. This is the cross purpose where you might want change. But the other part of you says, no, I don't want change. And I'm going to call this one out as it is, which is people who don't like change can often be control freaks about change. All right, you wouldn't believe how many people I've worked on, where I asked them to let go of a certain reality field. And they don't want to let that go because some part of them loves it and, or believes it will keep them safe. Also, your fears about change can be brought about by you not necessarily liking what you perceive your future to be. So if you think that if I let go of this, something bad will happen to me, right? You won't like your perceived future. The stuck behavior is really, really an act of love. Cause you love it for some reason because you either love it because it makes you feel safe or it keeps your life good. There's always a reason why you love it for some reason. And some people don't really want to change. And I'm just going to call that out. If it kind of triggers any buttons in some of you that are listening, that's okay. But usually you don't want to change because somehow you're afraid of either source energy moving through you, or again, you're afraid of what the perceived future might be. We're going to get to the next, basically to the main clearing section, which is this. I'm going to ask you this question and then again, you're going to give me lots and lots of feedback, and then we're going to clear it. So what change in your abundance or wealth situation are you avoiding? So what change in your abundance or wealth are you avoiding? And you could be avoiding it now or in the future. Somebody was asking me a question. Can we do clearing for others during this session? Yes you can. Just imagine them in little bubbles of energy off to your right and just kind of like put them off to the side to the right and just ask source to clear them. You don't have to clear them. Basically envision a tunnel of light coming down and putting the energy right through. So here's some things that you don't want to change dealing with debt needing to take the responsibility of your investment. Irene doesn't want to finish her dissertation so she can start her business that he doesn't want to change asking for what she's worth. Louise doesn't want to change getting her tax information together. Margaret doing things differently. Sabrina, she doesn't want to change knowing what to do. Fear of not knowing how to handle the responsibility, yeah. Well, responsibility. If you make your energy a little bit bigger, which is going to kind of seem a little strange, but if you make your energy a little bigger, you'll actually feel more able to handle what's happening around you. Christine, she's avoiding taking action on possible revenue streams. She stops herself before the money is coming in. Some people, Eduardo avoids asking for money. Some people don't want to ask for help. I love it and that she just calls it out. She says, I'm a control freak. And I'm afraid to let go of what I know at the present time. And she's afraid of the future. That's kind of normal fear of what others would think. They're jealousy. I fear getting clear on what expenses are going out monthly. Thank you Louise For being honest, a lot of people don't really know what their bottom line profit loss is every day. Looking for fulfilling job, paying off debt, starting a business, refinishing separating taxes, procrastinating, and getting organized. So I'm seeing a couple of the same repeats. So we're going to clear what's coming up, right? So here's what we're going to do. Remember we connect to the light. And so for all of you just close your eyes for a minute and then roll your eyes up a little bit, look up a little, take your energy up about 300 feet around there you'll see sense or feel what feels like light and just kind of let that light come through you and what that means as you imagine, and or feel. Some people are good imaginers some people are better feelers. So imagine and or feel it comes into your head and into the center of your head where the pineal gland is into your ears, into your eyes. Yeah. Just kind of clean all that out into your throat. And for some of you it'll feel very light and for others, it'll feel like a liquid light. It's perfect however it's coming in. So just imagine that it's connected into your head, into your throat. For some of you just say to yourself, I love myself enough to let myself receive this light. I love myself enough to let myself receive this light. Some people see it as white and some people see it a little golden. I actually see it kind of right in between golden and white. Let it come into your chest and down your arms, like a liquid light flowing out your hands and into your heart center, yep. Into your Tufts cavity, into your torso, stomach, hips. Okay. And let it just kind of like really rest in your hips a minute and fill those up. This is where we hold a lot of fear or insecurity about moving forward. So just let it fill in right there for a minute. Okay, and into your thighs, into your knees and intro your calves, into your feet. Okay, and then imagine that it can just go straight down right into the center of earth. So it's liquid light and it can basically go through anything. And it goes through right into the center of the planet. And there's a place in the center of the planet that feels really, really happy. So as above, so below, there's just as much love above as a result below, right? So in the center of the planet, there's a place where it feels really happy and kind of like a trampoline. Just imagine that the light that you send down there just kind of meets you and sends it straight back up into your feet, your calves, your knees, your thighs, your hips, and straight up in your heart. So now you have two energies, one from above one from below connecting into your heart. And just ask it to radiate out 360 degrees, like a really big sunshine. All right, You guys just changed energy. Okay, And imagine it getting three feet around you, 10 feet around you, a hundred feet around you, bigger than your house, bigger than your city, bigger than your state, bigger than your country. And then a little bit bigger than earth, Okay? So that's where we're going to be today. A little bit bigger than earth. And remember when you expand your energy out, the you that is really you truth with a capital T becomes more truthful and anything that is false or unaligned or not true, kind of like a net, it'll just be a little smaller. So it's easier for us to clear things when your energy is expanded. All these changes that you guys mentioned, and that we mentioned that are kind of hanging out in the energy field, will you please, please, please uncreate them all, delete them all and destroy them all. So you're going to take the story out of the whole thing. So all the thoughts, beliefs, and feelings that have led to this place where you were avoiding change, will you please, please, please uncreate delete. And destroy all of it. Just let the light go in and fill up all parts of you. And even if you think you're imagining it, just this light is doing a lot more work than you might be wholly conscious of just let it go to work, Okay. So now one more time, think of all the things that you are avoiding changing now and in your future about abundance and wealth, everything that is one more time, delete uncreate and take the story out of all of it, Okay. A couple of you guys are not letting go of it all away. So we're just going to do one more time. Think of all the things that you're avoiding changing and all the things that you love about not changing, because truthfully you probably love a lot of things about not changing. Like if I get to keep this, then it means that I'm XYZ, whatever those things are. Yeah, everything that is, will you delete it and create it and take the story right out of it. Some of you are avoiding looking at your future for other reasons and all those other reasons delete uncreate and destroy all of them now. So now we're going to go to the next one. Here's the next question. What reasons keep you unaligned from allowing source energy? So whatever you want to call it, source, God, loving light, whatever your word is, okay. What reason keeps you basically disconnected from it so that you do not have to manifest your abundance? So what are your reasons why you don't want to let source in? And even if it's nonsensical, like it doesn't make rational sense. That's probably your stuff. So send it in so we can see it. So some other reasons that you guys are unaligned from source, I don't trust myself. So I can't trust source. I want to, but I cannot hear source. I'm scared of success. It's all with someone else. It's safer to be small, in a conflict and resistance. I don't always trust, I'm invisible. I feel guilty about past actions and in truth light doesn't judge us only humans judged us, right? That's the human thing, it's not what light does. Light actually wants us to open to it so that everything in the way of us feeling love is gone. Distracted by excess pain, I can't handle that much source. Mom said I can't connect like that. That's a really good one Joan, how many of your parents told you guys you can't really connect to source or be all that? Fear of the unknown? Patricia is used to her negative problems. So that's why she's unaligned with source or love and light. I'm not good enough. I don't believe in myself. This is also a good one in her mind, I can imagine source would be bothered with me because the real truth is source would help you with anything because you are source energy personified, right? So why would source not help itself? It'd be like, why would rain not become rain? It's still rain. So source of source, even if it's in you. Margaret says she's holding on to old hurt and rejection. So we're going to clear these. I can't hear my guides, source is unknown. If I feel good and others don't, I will be punished. I don't feel like I can communicate. I can't believe sources really been there for me. And when another one it's used only to receive or only to give, not receive, ah, well, if you're not filled up, how can you get, right? That's like a depleted person, put your oxygen mask on first, fill yourself up first and then help everybody else. Trauma keeps me from source. Sandra's saying it judges her or Sandra was saying, I keep telling myself that a lot of negative energy around me, so I can't have positive energy, like too hard, too disappointing, I'm not real. That's a good one. You don't feel real or visible. I'm afraid to face myself. Self-loathing I don't think I have the blueprint for mass abundance, which actually, the good old story of the Harry Potter author, right? Welfare mom, like is now a billionaire. Same as Oprah. You know what I mean? She didn't really have all the advantages that normal people would in look where she goes. So all of these things, will you please, please, please uncreate delete. And destroy all of them, all of these things, will you please, please, please uncreate delete and destroy all the reasons why you do not think you can be connected to source. Now some of you may have noticed the energy is kind of a little heavy with this one, okay? Cause this is one of the core wounds that we might feel where source won't take care of us, which is basically the complete lie. So expand your energy a little bit more. Remember, just expand past your house, past your state, past your country, past the earth, and just think of all the stories you have of why source won't help you delete, delete, delete uncreate and destroy all of it, time's a gazillion. Okay. And all the places inside you that feel a little dense or heavy does take a little extra light and send it there and just say whatever this is, whatever this pattern is. Even if you don't know the exact words that go with it, just send some light right down there. And imagine like a sparkler it just kind of blows up like a little bomb, a little light bulb, okay? So everything that is delete, uncreate and do you story all of it, okay. So about 70% of everybody is like go of a lot of it. So let's do it a couple more times, okay? All the places where you think that source won't bend over backwards, like completely help you completely support you, fill you with love, open up for you. Great advantages for you. Give you what you need. Everything that is, will you please, please, please uncreate delete and destroy all of it at time's a gazillion, okay? A couple of you guys have mom and dad issues, okay. So all the mom and dad issues that are keeping you from aligning with source and pure 11 light energy, will you please, please, please delete uncreate and destroy all of them, take the whole thoughts, ideas, feelings, so everywhere your body has a memory of like not feeling cared for. Will you also take that out of your body? So everywhere you feel this from a body level, please, please, please delete uncreate and destroy all of it. Now let's just imagine that source was going to come into you and just fill you with much light and love, the deepest form of light and love that you've ever felt in your whole life and ask the vibration of pure light, pure joy, pure abundance, pure source, pure energize energy, lots of energy, energized energy. We're going to ask that all of that go in now. So one more time to sass that all the light from above and below, all the light from above and below be connected in. So everybody listening does connect to the light, let it in, fill it with pure love, light and joy right now. We're going to fill in all the empty spaces that we just deleted. All right. I just want to clap for you guys. It's like, woo. All right, so tell me how you guys are feeling right now. I want to see how everybody's feeling a little bit. This is the one. This is the good one, okay. Like grateful but this one is the one that will bring a lot of tears because we're connecting you to the deepest part of yourself. Some people feel a little sad. I'm just going to say to you that it's just a little bit of energy, a little kind of energy healing. That's kind of happening. And by the end of the session, that should be better. So anybody feeling a little sad or emotional it's really okay. You're releasing a lot of stuff that was in your tissues that made you feel disconnected from source. So this is like a really big day that we're clearing today. Few people feel light and high and great and filled with energy, lightheaded. Some people are clapping with me, joyous, stress-free, vibrations going through my legs. Sparkly, lots of tears connected with everyone filled with golden pink, love, smile, perky, like a weight's been lifted off of me. Some people are reliving some emotional abandonment issues. So Jennifer and anybody else, who's still feeling a little heavy, we'll clear it through the rest of the session, but sometimes things can't leave in two seconds. But if you just expand your energy out and just keep soaking in lots of love right now, tired, tired is okay. Tired is just the rebooting that's happening. Some people are saying a little sick in your stomach. So Gail, that's just a little bit of an energy that wants to release. So send a beam of light right into your stomach there and just kind of blow it up. And Nicholas Is being really grateful. And he's so glad that all of you guys are in the journey with him, so he doesn't have to do it all or get it right or do it all alone. So thank you Nicholas for being grateful for all of us being here. So we're going to go to the next one and just keep stay connected to the light and you'll receive all the healing you need. So another cross purpose growth unrealized. So people in this category often feel stuck and don't know what to do. They stop bringing about the new idea thought or life change because they are lacking either information, a skillset or the know-how. So we're going to clear all this stuff today. So you guys ready? So what abundance and wealth generating ideas are you not acting on because don't think you know how to do it, all right. So let's see what you guys got going on. Manifesting the lotto, setting up blogs, WordPress and other internet stuff. Opening my holistic center, trading with real money, starting a business, start my website, doing sessions with people, investing in the stock market, becoming a millionaire, real estate investing with grants for nonprofits, expanding a business, using the law of attraction, manifesting lots of clients, doing my classes and helping my team, helping my family, changing career to a freelance photographer. I don't know how to make money from teaching others how to meditate. Well, Tara, you know what? You can help people do that. There's a lot of people that need a stress free life. So we'll help you with that a little bit, generate some ideas of how that's possible, selling your home for the highest price possible. Winning the mega millions, setting up classes with students, speed coaching, opening up my holistic high school and middle school, that's cool. Making money online, putting my services out there, manifesting contacts to speak places. Coaching business, healing others, life coach, finishing a dissertation, doing acting, MLM, fear of being sued, I liked that. I mean, sometimes we have these funny little fears, a little pop up, somebody that wants to manifest fixing her car for free. All those ideas that you guys just sent in here. So just imagine again, that you have a magnet in your heart. You're connected from above and below into the center of your being, okay? From the center of your being. You're connected to the light. Okay. So all these things, which are really cool reasons why, right? All the reasons why you are not acting on these amazing wealth and abundance generating ideas, will you please, please, please uncreate delete. And destroy all of them time's gazillion. All the places where you have no idea how it is that you're going to market yourself or create your life or trade or start your business or get your website up or find clients, all of those things, will you please uncreate, delete and take the story out of all of them. All the reasons why you don't think it's fair that other people have it so easy and you don't, whatever that's about delete, uncreate and destroy all of it. Please take back your power now and say everything that's been in my way that I don't know what to do. I asked the universe to please line it up so that some way, somehow through someone or some form of media, bring me the exact, know how of how to do it, that I can happily and easily manifest whatever it is. Maybe either for free or maybe it's for cash that you have the cash, whatever it is, asset to show up now. Okay, awesome. Thank you. You guys just let a bunch of stuff go right there. Okay. One more time. All the abundance and wealth generating ideas you're not acting on cause you don't think you know how to do it. And all the reasons why you're not acting on them, basically delete all that. Time's a gazillion uncreate at all time's a gazillion. Okay one more time. Does I ask all the power that you need from the universe to put into your future, to know that you can happily easily manifest whatever is you truly need. Please pull that to you now. We're going to go to the next section. What are you not doing? Because you don't know how. What are you not doing? Because you don't know how I love it. Louise says she's going to close... So after her clearing, she's going to go close some unused bank accounts. So what are you not doing? Because you don't know how writing a book, trusting yourself, getting a dream job of helping people, investing in stocks, bookkeeping for your business, making money online, approaching investors, generating consistent sales, talking to people, helping your team be successful. Trusting yourself, developing real estate, writing codes, not wanting to charge people for my work. I'm not sure what that means, So you don't want, I am not what I am not doing because I don't know how not wanting to charge people from my work. I think that's a belief. she's talking about making new friends, connecting to guides and source, marketing yourself as a healer, a business plan, buyer's club, working with energy and helping people change their lives. Speaking up in public, picking profitable trays, loving relationships, letting go of my stuff now become the most successful online jeweler, generating clients, finding clients, being a Lightworker, getting out of debt, finding sources for renewable energy, balance relationship, marketing, all right? So all these things that you guys are not doing because you don't know how we're going to release all the reasons, all the thoughts, all the justifications, all the behind the scenes, things that are happening, that are creating you, not knowing how okay. Delete all that because what's really true is you can connect a source, get the download and then know what to do. Some of the information might have to come through people in books, but source can all as arrange it so that you line up the right person who will tell you what it is you need to know. And the cool thing about source is you never have to worry about messing up. This is what's really so cool. You don't have to worry about messing up because even if you don't get it the first time, it'll keep bringing it to you until you get your answer, okay? So all the places that you guys are stopping yourself, because you don't know how, and don't think you can manifest the how, the what, the when the why and all that, everything that is delete, uncreate and destroy all of it. Please, please, please take the story out of everything, including all the places where you still feel like you're on the rat race and you can't get out, delete uncreate and destroy all of it. Now, all the thoughts, ideas, and feelings like create the story inside all of us, deleted all now. Awesome. Anywhere this energy is stuck in your body. Yeah. All of the places, this energy is shoved in your body, but I don't know how, I don't know what, I can't. And all the stops that you got in your body delete all those now. Now I went to the like pull source in, imagine your heart's like a magnet and pull source into your hearts from above and below asking one more time to fill up with all the know-how, all the who, what, where, when and why that's going to connect you to the know-how and everything that needs to be easy, breezy, everything you need for it to be easy and breezy in your life, please pull that to you now, and like a magnet. You're going to attract that to you now. So think of something that you want to know how everything that you were thinking, I want to know what to do and how to do it. I think as somebody coming into your life right now, or a magazine article, or a website or something that just shows you how to do it, and any other new ideas or thoughts that can help you generate the most amount of abundance and wealth for yourself, ask those to show up now. Now when we're asking them to show up now, that means that there'll be in on or around you. And they can come in the form of a dream, an inspiration a thought, a journaling, cool tip as you can keep asking, what's my new idea that will generate me X amount of dollars, whatever that is. Universe, please show me how. Okay. So tell me a little bit about how you guys are feeling. I'm going to clap for you again. Awesome. I feel excited. So happy to be here, grateful. A bit more serene, confident. Some people are a little tired and lightheaded. That's okay. It's just a lot of stuff processing out of you really quickly. David's a little heavy, heaviness you might need to clear a couple more times. So to stay connected to light as much as you can. And just ask that everything the way of you being abundant, healthy, wealthy wise, be deleted. Yawning. Yawning is good. Yawning is like a rebooting filled with a hot buzzing. Realizing the creator will work through me, tingly all over, feeling good. Now this is kind of interesting. They said she's feeling confused. Confused is actually okay because what's happening is a lot of your old thoughts are leaving. That don't really fit you anymore. So you'll feel a little confused while they're leaving, but by the morning, you should feel a little better. We're within like, I don't know, it could be an hour. It could be two hours. I don't know how fast you process. It's nighttime where I am. That's why I said after I sleep. Okay, lighter, relaxed, calm, trusting. Somebody has a cord attached to their neck. So just imagine that you can take an energy and just kind of blow it up and send it back out your back. So you take a little sparkler there. It just kind of boom, sends the ends of it and send it all back, good vibrations. I feel like there's a way out, intoxicated. Will clearance stuff stay out? Yes. Once that layer is cleared, it's gone. You might have some more layers and those will become apparent. But truthfully, once it's gone, it's gone. Heaviness in your throat. Send a little energy there Draco. I have a great direction now. So Margaret had an idea kind of pop in her head blurry, Maureen that's okay. Cause a lot of energies are just sort of really leaving really quick. And so it's kind of like, imagine your filters are getting reshuffled. The next one. So remember today at home, what are you going to do? You going to delete it across all time dimension space reality. You're going to uncreate it by unplugging from the first moment you created it, you're going to destroy it. By taking all the energy impulses out of the stories, holding it in place. And you're also clearing it from all the polarities, all the push and pull, all the lower frequencies. You're deleting all the false hoods, untruth, all right. Those are the things that we're clearing. And we're going to get a little bit more into that later. What that means to you after today or today, like right after this seminar, you can go back in, journal, whatever it is that you would like to talk about, what you released for yourself. And then you can remember all the steps that you've taken. So here's what you can play with. Do the energy statements on everything that comes up for you. That's lower or dense. Basically, if something comes into your world that you don't like, what you would say is everything creating this in my world I delete it, uncreate it. And do you destory all of it, then you ask, is this true for anything that you're not sure if it's really true? Like it might not be true. You might be thinking I'm bad. Is that true? No, that is just the point of view and everything that we cleared tonight. Do a few more times if you can, listen if you can, and then you can do some more clearing, all right. So I want to fill you guys up to the brim with a lot more love right now. So everybody just kind of connect to the light, for again, for a minute. So connect to the light, let some more light in, okay. So let's fill you with so much source love and light, okay. So just ask that pure lobe and light come through you. Pure love and light becomes you. Pure love and light is you pure love and light sources your life, pure love and light sources your future, pure love and light goes forward into the future of manifesting the true abundance that you really deserve and desire. Think of something that you guys really, really love, like anything that you really love, that you want to send some energy to. All right. Let's put into the energy how you want your day to be tomorrow. So think of how you want your day to be tomorrow, okay. So I'm going to open it up for a couple of questions. So if you guys have a couple of questions, I want to make sure I just answer them pretty quickly. So there's a couple of questions I got already. If I fall asleep or if I do the replay, do I clear more over and over and over again? Yes you do. You clear, deeper and deeper levels. The more you do it, Sabrina is going to France and can't participate. But thank you for being here tonight. Forgive me how I say your name but I think it's Moobah here said that had some negative feelings come to the surface the last two days that will usually happen, like right before a session. Like sometimes you'll notice negative feelings just asset any, and they don't have particular thoughts. So you just say everything, creating this, feeling, everything, creating this feeling. I un-create, it delete it and destroy it. So it's the same thing. If it's a thought or a feeling genuine to know, did I really clear everything? You cleared a lot of things, Jenny. I mean everything no, but you just started kind of clearing, but you cleared everything that you could on this day for yourself. Yes. Did you take a hundred percent of the clearing that was available for yourself today? I heard, yes. Basically the clearing working even if you're not sure you're doing it right, it really is Maria. As long as you set an intention. If I feel stuck, what do I do? You actually let in more light, kind of expand your energy out, connect to the light and let more in, okay. Once we connect a source of energy, when we finished, do we disconnect or just reconnect any time? Yes. Well, after the session, I'm going to leave you guys just kind of connected however you want to be connected. I would just say connected to source for a little while, and just make sure you let it flow through you. Basically, I'm always connected to source. I just walk around pretty much always connected to source. That would be the ideal because then you can always kind of create and manifest your future. We'll believe to be clear that I am not aware of. Yes. Because a lot of the stuff that we're clearing happened before you were seven years old and you might have no recollection of it. Cause it might be just an energy you picked up from your parents. So even energy is that have no exact belief you will clear say why don't things happen when I ask, well, Margaret, it just means that there's still some sort of as hard as it might seem, or we don't want to hear those. Sometimes it seems there still must be some pattern in your frequency, that's blocking it. Give yourself a little nudge in the right direction and think, okay, whatever this thing is, that's blocking me. Just ask for it to be uncreated, deleted and destroy. Okay. So you just say everything that's that's blocking me from not getting what I want, delete, uncreate and destroy okay. So Margaret, that's your homework about 30 times a day. If we miss a live session, is the replay as effective. Actually it is. If you connect back to the time when we did the replay and just really let all the energy in, it's really up to you. If you let all the energy in you'll get all the energy. You always access to the replays in the future. This is a great question. What if two people are working with opposite intentions, one wants to fix a relationship and the other one wants out, well, it's kind of a freewill game down here, okay? Mostly you have to just choose for you. What makes you happy? You can't really make somebody do something. I mean like if we all just think about it, how many of you could I really make you go do something? If you don't really want to do it, you can give them positive energy and maybe the positive energy will shift them. But if you give them positive energy, you shouldn't really have too much of an intent. You shouldn't take your freewill and use it upon another. You should just be love. Be a lot of good energy and send a lot of love and good energy their way, and then let them choose for themselves. Paul, this is a really great question. He's saying that we've done a lot of deleting. Are we going to install new beliefs, attitudes, intentions. Yes. It's kind of funny. I work a little bit opposite than some healers because I found that if we leave you a little bit more empty, what will happen is your natural soul will come in, your higher self, your divine guidance. We're creating a space for real, the real you to show up. Even if you don't know what it looks like yet, okay. So we're creating basically a space first and within the next a week and a half, we're going to get into the, how do you want your life to look? Barsha saying she feels the pain in her left calf. Every time she releases energy. That's because you have an energy attached to your mom and a boy. So just send some light down there and just ask to disconnect from mom and a male figure in your life, dark hair. Do you set an intention that your work with us keeps flowing throughout the week? Yes. You guys are like in my prayers and my thoughts pretty much all the time nonstop generating all the time. If I go back to the previous sessions, can I clear more? Yes. Oh, thank you. Somebody sent me love, thank you, Jose. If the block began on an ancestral level will a block be cleared for others in my family. Yeah. So some of these things that we're clearing, I haven't gone all the way into it yet. Cause I just need to like clear a bunch of stuff out really quickly so that we can get to the next level. Yes. If you're clearing things that came from the family DNA or the subconscious and you know or don't know of them, will they clear for anybody else connected to it? Yes. How can I be vulnerable without being naive? You said that last week being vulnerable helps us manifest vulnerable is just being truthfully you, which you would always be aware and infinite being is always aware. Here's my suggestion. If some of you still feel a little bit of things like sometimes people have like little interesting symptomology, like when things are clearing really fast, like a little headache or a little flu, or like any of those kinds of energies. If you there's two things you can do. Number one, you can send a lot of light to it. Number two, expand your energy. Just like literally expand your energy more than you've ever expanded it. And remember truth is who you are. So you expanding creates more space for the energy to flow through your body. Sometimes bodies need a little attention while we're cleaning these things to make sure you guys eat good food, good food means veggies, fruit, whole foods, right? Not a lot of cooked things are heavy things, drinking water, all those kinds of good things, taking nutrition that's supportive. All those things would help your body. Sometimes I have known people that take Bach herbal remedies, and these Bach herbal remedies will help some of the processing. Okay. But if you have a lot of minerals in your body and a lot of water, the energy will flow through more quickly. Okay. I love you all chat for now. Thank you.

LESSON 3: Clearing the Fear of Change (Clearing Session Only)

A couple of the same repeats, so we're going to clear what's coming up. All right, so here's what we're going to do. Remember, we connect to the light. And so for all of you, just close your eyes for a minute and then roll your eyes up a little bit. Look up a little. Take your energy up about 300 feet. Around there, you'll see, sense, or feel what feels like light. And just kind of let that light come through you. And what that means is you imagine and or feel. Some people are good imaginers. Some people are better feelers. So imagine and or feel. It comes into your head and into the center of your head where the pineal gland is, into your ears, into your eyes. Yeah, just kind of clean all that out into your throat. And for some of you, it'll feel very light. And for others, it'll feel like a liquid light. It's perfect however it's coming in. So just imagine that it's connected into your head. into your throat. And for some of you, just say to yourself, I love myself enough to let myself receive this light. I love myself enough to let myself receive this light. Some people see it as white and some people see it a little golden. I actually see it kind of right in between, golden and white. Let it come into your chest and down your arms like a liquid light, flowing out your hands and into your heart center. Yeah, into your chest cavity, into your torso, stomach, hips. Okay, and let it just kind of like really rest in your hips a minute and fill those up. This is where we hold a lot of fear or insecurity about moving forward. So just let it fill in right there for a minute. Okay, and into your thighs, into your knees, into your calves, into your feet. Okay, and then imagine it. that it can just go straight down right into the center of Earth. So it's liquid light and it can basically go through anything. And it goes through right into the center of the planet. And there's a place in the center of the planet. that feels really, really happy. So as above, so below. There's just as much love above as there is below, right? So in the center of the planet, there's a place where it feels really happy and kind of like a trampoline. Just imagine that the light that you send down there just kind of meets you and sends it straight back up into your feet, your calves, your knees, your thighs, your hips, and straight up into your heart. So now you have two energies, one from above, one from below, connecting into your heart. And just ask it to radiate out 360 degrees like a really big sunshine. All right, you guys just changed energy. Okay, and imagine it getting three feet around you, 10 feet around you, 100 feet around you, bigger than your house, bigger than your city, bigger than your state. bigger than your country, and then a little bit bigger than Earth. Okay, so that's where we're going to be today, a little bit bigger than Earth. And remember, when you expand your energy out, the you that is really you, truth with a capital T, becomes more truthful, and anything that is false or unaligned or not true, kind of like a gnat, it'll just be a little smaller. So it's easier for us to clear things when your energy is expanded. All these changes that you guys mentioned and that we mentioned that are kind of hanging out in the energy field, will you please, please, please uncreate them all, delete them all, and de -story them all. So you're going to take the story out of the whole thing. So all the thoughts, beliefs, and feelings that have led to this place where you are avoiding change, will you please, please, please uncreate, delete, and de -story all of it. Just let the light... Go in and fill up all parts of you. And even if you think you're imagining it, just this light is doing a lot more work that you might be wholly conscious of. Just let it go to work. Okay, so now, one more time, think of all the things that you are avoiding changing now and in your future about abundance and wealth. Everything that is, one more time, delete, uncreate, and take the story out of all of it. Okay, a couple of you guys are not letting go of it all the way, so we're just going to do one more time. Think of all the things that you're avoiding changing, and all the things that you love about not changing, because truthfully, you probably love a lot of things about not changing. Like, if I get to keep this, then it means that I'm XYZ, whatever those things are. Yeah, everything that is, will you delete it, uncreate it, and take this story right out of it? Some of you are avoiding looking at your future for other reasons and all those other reasons. Delete, uncreate, and de -story all of them now. All of these things, will you please, please, please uncreate, delete, and de -story all the reasons why you do not think you can be connected to Source. Now, some of you may have noticed the energy is kind of a little heavy with this one, okay? Because this is one of the core wounds that we might feel where Source won't take care of us. which is basically the complete lie. So expand your energy a little bit more. Remember, just expand past your house, past your state, past your country, past the earth, and just think of all the stories you have of why Source won't help you. Delete, delete, delete. Uncreate and de -story all of it times a gazillion. okay and all the places inside you that feel a little dense or heavy just take a little extra light and send it there and just say whatever this is whatever this pattern is even if you don't know the exact words that go with it just send some light right down there and imagine like a sparkler it just kind of blows up like a little bomb a little light bomb okay so everything that is delete uncreate and destroy all of it okay so about 70 percent of everybody is like go of a lot of it so let's do it a couple more times okay all the places where you think that source won't bend over backwards like completely help you completely support you fill you with love open up for you create advantages for you give you what you need everything that is will you please please please uncreate delete and destroy all of it times a gazillion okay a couple you guys guys have mom and dad issues okay so all the mom and dad issues that are keeping you from aligning with source and pure love and light energy will you please, please, please delete, uncreate, and de -story all of them. Take the whole thoughts, ideas, feelings. So everywhere your body has a memory of like not feeling cared for, will you also take that out of your body? So everywhere you feel this from a body level, please, please, please delete, uncreate, and de -story all of it. Now let's just imagine that source is going to come into you and just fill you with so much light and love. The deepest form of light and love that you've ever felt in your whole life. And ask the vibration of pure light, pure joy, pure abundance, pure source, pure energized energy, lots of energy, energized energy. We're going to ask that all of that go in now. So one more time to ask that all the light from above and below. all the light from above and below be connected in so everybody listening just connect to the light let it in fill up with pure love light and joy right now we're going to fill in all the empty spaces that we just deleted so just imagine again that you have a magnet in your heart you're connected from above and below into the center of your being okay from the center of you your being. You're connected to the light. Okay, so all these things, which are really cool reasons why, right? All the reasons why you are not acting on these amazing wealth and abundance generating ideas. Will you please, please, please uncreate, delete, and de -story all of them times a gazillion. All the places where you have no idea how it is that you're going to market yourself or create your life or trade or start your business or get your website up or find clients. All of those things. Will you please uncreate, delete, and take the story out of all of them? All the reasons why you don't think it's fair that other people have it so easy and you don't. Whatever that's about. Delete, uncreate, and de -story all of it. Please take back your power now and say everything that's been in my way, that I don't know what to do, I ask the universe to please line it up so that some way, somehow, through someone or some form of media bring me the exact know -how of how to do it that I can happily and easily manifest whatever it is, maybe either for free. or maybe it's for cash, that you have the cash, whatever it is. Ask that to show up now. Okay, awesome. Thank you. You guys just let a bunch of stuff go right there. Okay, one more time. All the abundance and wealth -generating ideas you're not acting on because you don't think you know how to do it, and all the reasons why you're not acting on them, basically, delete all that, times a gazillion. Uncreated all times a gazillion. Okay, one more time. Just ask all the power that you need from the universe to put into your future to know that you can happily and easily manifest whatever it is you truly need. Please pull that to you now. Speaking up in public, picking profitable trades, loving relationships, letting go of my stuff now. Become the most successful online jeweler. Generating clients, finding clients, being a light worker, getting out of debt. finding sources for renewable energy, balanced relationship, marketing. All right, so all these things that you guys are not doing because you don't know how, we're going to release all the reasons, all the thoughts, all the justifications, all the behind -the -scenes things that are happening that are creating you not knowing how. Okay, delete all that. Because what's really true is you can connect to source, get the download, and then know what to do. Some of the information might have to come through people and books, but source can always arrange it so that you line up the right person who will tell you what it is you need to know. And the cool thing about source is you never have to worry about messing up. This is what's really so cool. You don't have to worry about messing up because even if you don't get it the first time, it'll keep bringing it to you until you get your answer. Okay? So all the places that you guys are stopping yourself because you don't know how and don't think you can manifest the how, the what, the when, the why, and all that, everything that is, delete, uncreate, and de -story all of it. Please, please, please take the story out of everything. including all the places where you still feel like you're on the rat race and you can't get out. Delete, uncreate, and de -story all of it now. All the thoughts, ideas, and feelings that create the story inside all of us. Delete it all now. Awesome. Anywhere this energy is stuck in your body? Yeah, all the places this energy is shoved in your body of I don't know how, I don't know what, I can't, and all the stops that you got in your body. Delete all those now. Now I want you to like pull source in. Imagine your heart's like a magnet and pull source into your heart from above and below. Asking one more time to fill up with all the know -how, all the who, what, where, when, and why that's going to connect you to the know -how and everything that needs to be easy breezy. Everything you need for it to be easy and breezy in your life, please pull that to you now. And like a magnet, you're going to attract that to you now. So think of something that you want to know how, everything that you're thinking, I want to know what to do and how to do it. Think of somebody coming into your life right now or a magazine article or a website or something that just shows you how to do it. And any other new ideas or thoughts that can help you generate the most amount of abundance and wealth for yourself, ask those to show up now. Now when we're asking them to show up now, that means that they'll be in honor around you and they can come in the form of a dream, an inspiration, a thought, a journaling. A cool tip is you can keep asking what's my new idea that will generate me X amount of dollars, whatever that is. Universe, please show me how. David's a little heavy. Heaviness, you might need to clear a couple more times. So just stay connected to light as much as you can and just ask that everything in the way of you being abundant, healthy, wealthy, wise be deleted. Okay, lighter, relaxed, calm, trusting. Somebody has a cord attached to their neck. So just imagine that you can take an energy and just kind of blow it up and send it back out your back. So you take a little sparkler there, just kind of, boom, singe the ends of it and send it all back. The next one. So remember, today at home, what are you going to do? You're going to delete it across all time, dimension, space, reality. You're going to uncreate it by unplugging from the first moment you created it. You're going to de -story it by taking all the energy impulses out of the stories holding it in place. And you're also clearing it from all the polarities, all the push and pull, all the lower frequencies. You're deleting all the falsehoods, untruth. All right. Those are the things that we're clearing. And we're going to get a little bit more into that later. What that means to you. After today, or today, like right after the seminar, you can go back in, journal, whatever it is that you would like to talk about what you released for yourself, and then you can remember all the steps that you've taken. So here's what you can play with. Do the energy statements on everything that comes up for you that's lower or dense. Basically, if something comes in your world that you don't like, what you would say is, everything creating this in my world, I delete it, uncreate it, and de -story all of it. Then you ask, is this true for anything that you're not sure if it's really true? Like it might not be true. You might be thinking, I'm bad. Is that true? No, bad is just the point of view. And everything that we cleared tonight, do a few more times if you can. Listen if you can. And then you can do some more clearing. All right. So I want to fill you guys up to the brim with a lot more love right now. So everybody just kind of connect to the light again for a minute. So connect to the light. Let some more light in. Okay, so let's fill you with so much source love and light. Okay, so just ask that pure love and light come through you. Pure love and light becomes you. Pure love and light is you. Pure love and light sources your life. Pure love and light sources your future. Pure love and light goes forward into the future manifesting the true abundance that you really deserve and desire. Think of something that you guys really, really love, like anything that you really love that you want to send some energy to. All right. Let's put into the energy how you want your day to be tomorrow. So think of how you want your day to be tomorrow. Say, why don't things happen when I ask? Well, Margaret, it just means that there's still some sort of, as hard as it might seem, or we don't want to hear this sometimes, it seems there still must be some pattern in your frequency that's blocking it. Give yourself a little nudge in the right direction and think, okay, whatever this thing is. that's blocking me, just ask for it to be uncreated, deleted, and de -storied, okay? So you just say everything that's blocking me from not getting what I want, delete, uncreate, and de -story. Okay, so Margaret, that's your homework. About 30 times a day. Drinking water, all those kind of good things, taking nutrition that's supportive, all those things would help your body. Sometimes I've known people that take Bach herbal remedies and these Bach herbal remedies will help some of the processing, okay? But if you have a lot of minerals in your body and a lot of water, the energy will flow through more quickly. Okay, I love you all. Ciao for now. Thank you. Please continue to the next Unlimited Abundance Journey session.

LESSON 4: Clearing Money Zapping Decisions

- Hey, this is Christie Marie Sheldon, and you're listening to a recording I did of a series of 24 live group sessions, on clearing your abundance blocks. And, today, in session number four, here's what we're covering. We're going to keep you focused on what actually creates your reality. Remember, if you only live the energy and vibrations that you wish to be in the future, you get a really great positive outcome kind of life. And, we're going to clear up some of the crossed purposes and mixed up messages that block you. Cross-purpose number four, growth unrealized. And, this is when people's energy is stuck and they can't bring about new ideas, thoughts, or life changes, because they lack information. They lack the skill set. They lack the know-how to make stuff happen. So, we're going to clear that cross-purpose. And, the other one that we're going to clear is when people have no love for yourself, and that's when you don't have the hard wiring built in to make you want to do things. And, I'm going to introduce you to a technique I call the secret formula. So, let's begin. Hey, this is Christie. How are you guys? Today is an awesome day. It is our fourth day of the unlimited abundance journey. I'm so happy that you guys are here. So, in case there's a few people who don't know the... What's up, grab a piece of paper or a journal, because you're going to be journaling a lot of things that kind of come up for you, that you're going to want to clear during the week as well, be open to new awareness. So, if you know everything, then you can't learn anything new. Set your intents on what you hope to achieve like if you could have some cool breakthrough, let us know, just set that intent right now, out into the universe and we'll all help you. Bring your baggage that you bought and sold to yourself to the forefront, because we're going to help you get rid of all the stuff in the way, and let's journey together, and generate unlimited abundance. How awesome is that? We are going to talk for a minute on the inspiring stories section. I wish I could share all of them with you, but I'm going to share a few. Christina Kabbalah, miracles really do start to happen when you're around. Oh, okay. She's meaning me and I'm assuming all of you guys, I live in Australia and here's what happened to me, right after the first unlimited abundance session. Four hours after the seminar finished, she received a phone call from her accountant who told her that her tax return refund was going to be 50% more, five-zero percent more than she originally thought, an extra $4,000 in her pocket book. Then, she got a call from her son's school. He's autistic and goes to a special expensive school. And, for those of you who know, sometimes the special education costs a lot more. And, basically, they were calling her, and said that they had received some special funding, and they were going to give her $3,500 reduction in fees. So, basically, that's $7,500 that came from nowhere, pretty much, just within a few days after doing the unlimited abundance journey. And, then, another thing happened. She said I had to confess, I started to cry, because it was really completely unexpected, and so helpful right now. Thank you, Christie. And, thank you everybody else. I'm fully expecting more miracles. Alright, we have Irene, was thinking about signing up for unlimited abundance was short of funds, I asked the universe to give her a sign, if she should sign up or not. Here's what happened. She went to an appointment in an area she doesn't go frequently, got on the subway, noticed a lottery ticket sign. The idea occurred for her to go in. Some reason she didn't, a few hours later on the way back, she decided to follow the initial impulse, went in, bought the lottery ticket, and wallah, $1. Basically, she only had a buck on her, made her $350. And, that was the sign that she was waiting for. It really stunned her, she said, and filled her with gratitude. But, what we can all gather from this experience is notice what she said. She followed her initial impulse. Isn't it cool that some people think, oh, well, I messed up 'cause I didn't go. But, she didn't think, oh, I messed up. You know what I'm saying? Like, why would she think that. She's just said, oh, I'm going to just follow my original impulse. And, she won the $350. So, awesome. Yun said after the first session started seeing some results, feeling more energetic, and then needed some more money to pay some bills, got an unexpected check, $400 from relatives. Says, I think that things happen for a reason, I am no longer postponing my wishes. I think unlimited abundance came to my life for a reason. Yeah. So, it's kind of positive to have all those things that stop us all the time to be gone, right? It's about releasing blocks. And, basically, what are we... Been working on is releasing cross-purposes. So, all these cross-purposes that have been stopping you are energetically, just getting out of the way, whether you know, specifically, what the problem was or not, but we're clearing them, at a very deep level. We are going to just go over this really quick, again, just a little refresher. Realities are created with four things in mind, what you hold dear to you, you re-energize. How you live and what shows up is a reference of your thoughts, ideas, vibrations, and the things you hold significant. Source energy lives through your vessel, making it possible to be here. So, the creative energy is source energy, and you have an aura, that creative energy. You can change a reality by listening to what you're saying, just as Lucy did, listening to yourself, and then observing what you were being and doing, and then rearrange it to fit what you really want. So, if you don't like what you're saying, uncreate, delete, and de-story all of it. 'Kay, so the action step is only live the energies and vibrations that you wish to be in the future. We're clearing cross-purposes or the mixed up messages, more than one purpose influencing your life, giving you mixed results. So, we're going to go through some of the reasons you have cross-purposes. Doubt, you don't trust yourself or feel confident in your new choices. Lack of awareness is one of those doubts too. Neglect of self, points out where you don't want to look at what you're actually spending your time and efforts doing, otherwise called what, denial, right? Number four, growth unrealized, people's energy in this category often feel stuck and don't know what to do. They stop bringing about the new idea, thought, or life change, 'cause they are lacking information, a skillset, or the know-how. No love for self, so this is when you don't have the higher, hard wiring in you to really care. Now, sometimes, what happens, because remember I've worked on well, well, well over 10,000 people. And, one of the first things I often have to do is I have to help people get that energy or that imprint in them where they can feel loved and cared for, because, sometimes, and oftentimes, parents don't love us the way we actually need. They love us the way they needed to love you. And, oftentimes, they're not filled up with love. So, they're doing their best, right? With the tools that they have. And, sometimes, their best might not fill you to the brim with what you need. So, this is what we're going to work on today. We're going to start, what kind of abundance and wealth are you not allowing in your life, because you can't care or love yourself enough to really go for it? So, type back to me, what comes up for you, even if it's completely non-sensible, because it probably will be. So, what kind of abundance and wealth are you not allowing into your life, because you can't care or love yourself enough to go for it? Okay, what kind of money? Money is, basically, money is one of them. I've never allowed myself to own a home. Thank you, Carrie. Full of total abundance, no holding back. Thank you, Mark. My dream home, Patricia. A Swiss bank account. Alright, Ashley. Hopefully full of money, right? Not just the bank account? True love. A team of great people to assist me to achieve my desired outcome. That's a great one, Rosietta, that's about asking for help, right? From the universe. Not good enough. Everyone is better. I feel so grateful to you. Let's see, over 100,000 salary, as I can't seem to get over this level. Alright. So, we're going to help work on that today. Getting help from other people, not committed enough to make money. Carrie never allowed herself to have wealth. Roman wants a stable job. Yeah. A stable job that you actually love, right, Roman? The real value of your service, healthy relationships, loving relationship with self, financial freedom. My belief is that I have to work hard for the money, a new car, a mate that pleases you. Sahide never allowed himself to think more than a certain amount. Right diet, exercise, enough money to pay off debts. Having a business that actually makes money, investing in profitable trades. I like that. Meeting a soulmate, this innate belief that money, love, health, is hard, as struggle as hard work, and hard work. She's not qualified if it's easy. When I have money, I can't keep it. I don't allow myself to have luxury, payment for services rendered, spending time with people to help me grow and blossom, take one year of travel around the world. Oh, hi, JC. Dream home. That international distribution of my inventions, taking the next step, millions of dollars so I can spend my time helping other people, taking action, providing rich experiences for my kids, allowing myself to feel free, and light-hearted, cheerful, and that I can handle it, whatever comes my way. Alright. Thanks, Bunny. How are you? So, all of these things, and all of these things that keep coming up, okay? Will you now, please, all the energies that are behind this, that don't allow you to have this in your life, everything this is, will you now, please, please, please delete, uncreate, and de-story it all. So, we're going to start with connecting us to the light. I don't know if you guys know this, but you're actually way more connected to the light than you normally have been. So, just as good measure and good cheer for everybody, close your eyes for a minute. Connect up to the light, go about 300 feet up into the air. See your sense or feel the light. Let the light come in and let that come into your bodies, into your head, your throat, your heart, your stomach, your legs, down your arms, into the ground, into the center of the planet. Find that really cool, happy place in the center of the planet. Let that energy come back up, and nourish, and fill your body, so that source energy can work through the material world called earth, and help support you, and ask energy to bounce up your legs, into your torso, into your heart, and radiate 360 degrees all the way around, like a great big central sunshine. See this light getting bigger than the building that you're in. Bigger than the town that you're in. Bigger than the state that you're in. Bigger than the country you're in. And, bigger than the planet. Alright, you guys are awesome. You guys are doing this so well, I can completely tell this is why I forgot, 'cause you guys are actually more connected, so everything, everything, everything that is defined in your life that you don't care or love yourself enough, like that's the energy behind it all, that you won't go for it, that energy where you don't care or love yourself, will you please uncreate, delete it, and de-story it. 'Kay, this one's heavy for some of you. So, just stay pretty expanded. We're going to do this a few more times, all the energies, where you don't care or love yourself, for whatever reason, will you please, please, please delete, uncreate, and de-story all of it. Wow, there's a lot of energy here. Okay, so all the other places that... All these beautiful things that you guys really want to have happen in your life, and every story, and every place behind that, that doesn't let you have that, will you please, please, please uncreate, delete, and de-story the whole thing. So, a couple more times, we're going to do this again, 'cause you guys still have some energy going on. So, everybody listening just kind of expand your energy out and decide, alright, so all this no love stuff, can't care about myself. I'm going to define caring by the way. Think of... Don't think of love for a minute, 'cause a lot of people are wounded about love, but think of what it would be like for you guys to completely and totally care about yourself, completely and totally honor yourself, completely and totally care for yourself the same way you would a child, a pet, a loved one. And, what would it be like for you guys to care about yourself that much every day. Everything that doesn't allow that to be your normal existence in your life, everything that is, will you please delete, uncreate, and de-story all of that. Awesome, okay. One more time. All the abundance and wealth that you're not allowing into your life, and all the reasons why, 'cause it's really the reasons why that we're going to blow up, all the reasons why you won't let this happen, will you please delete, uncreate, and de-story the whole thing. So, I want you guys... I want to see if more stuff connects up, okay? So, what other abundance and wealth are you not allowing? I want to just see if there's more stuff that comes up. What other abundance and wealth are you not allowing into your life, because you can't care or love yourself enough to go for it? So, what else is coming up for you guys? Being able to write what you need in order to graduate, flow, feeling energetically solid, giving more than you get, receiving a loving relationship with source, afraid to not have a stable job, receiving money for your services. I don't ask money owed to me, freedom and independence, and becoming certified in energy techniques, courage to take action, loving myself as foreign, caring for myself feels false, spending for pleasure, living a really abundant life without any limits, my soulmate, free spirit, can't seem to graduate college, have major blocks and I was so close, feeling confident about my decisions, living the life of my dreams. Again, I feel I derive a part of my identity from financial struggles, how to write, not sure why, luxurious lifestyle, not allowing enough clients into my life, not allowing enough clients into my life to pay for the lifestyle, because I'm not worthy of receiving the money for my services. Alright, so these are amazing. Being able to have all that I want and need, receiving vast amounts of money by generating good sales on a consistent basis, allowing trust, believing in myself enough to go for it by opening a blog and writing, feeling safe, feeling lucky. It's like I'm keeping myself stuck out of habit, allowing myself to be organized enough to run a business, receiving compliments, fear of disapproval. Second guessing, Arthur is second guessing. Intuition. My father's childhood beliefs about money, being opposite of integrity, not go foring it and writing a book, conditioned to not be rich, fear to believe that it could easily happen, living with a man who doesn't cut off, but doesn't believe in it probably. Okay, so we're going to go to the next slide, but let me know how... What's going on. I'm feeling heavy in my chest. So, Trisha's... If you're feeling a little heavy in your chest, just kind of expand out a little bit, okay? So, that's just a, maybe, an expansion that needs to happen. Sarah, the top of her head's tingling, and Ashley's laughing, laughing your tush off, right? Sarah is saying she appreciates us all, the whole body vibrating. Nicholas was wondering, 'cause I faded, he said, but he wasn't sleeping. And, he was no longer hearing me. Does that mean I'm processing? Yeah, it's kind of funny that when your soul wants you to go to a deeper level, sometimes you'll kind of expand out so much that you don't hear as well. I know it sounds kind of funny. Michelle's a little tired and weak. Okay, so this is... We're just in the middle of your junk, and by the end of the call, it should be a little better. Slightly energized, a little tired, a little vulnerable. And, as we said, vulnerable is who we are. That means we've dropped our barriers and we're being really real with ourselves. So, anywhere you guys are feeling any energy in your head, some denseness in your body take some energy right now, connect to source, let the energy flow in, and wherever your body feels tightness or heaviness, okay? That just means some stuff stirred up. I want you to just go into that part of your body, uncreate, delete, and de-story all of those things, okay? So, anywhere else, you're just kind of heavy or dense, delete, uncreate, and de-story all of it. Anywhere else you guys are heavier or dense in your body and any cell memory of all this old emotion that wants to come out, delete, uncreate, and de-story all of it. Mark's wanting to know where is $100 bills are. Okay, anywhere else that you guys are feeling a little dense in your body, just send a little love there, alright? A little love, fill in with source, send some gratitude to your body for showing you where some of your blocks are, 'cause that's all your body's doing, is showing you what's up. Raven's wondering if the negative vibrations of being online affect the clearing. No, not at all. So, just you connected to source and, also, all as a group is going to completely and totally help everything, alright? Any negative vibrations by being online isn't going to affect your clearing. So, what programs did your family have in abundance and love that may be blocking your abilities to get abundance, 'cause remember, your family had some programs too going on, right? So, what is some of these programs that your families had in abundance and, or love that may be blocking your abilities to get abundance? What are those summer programs? Alright, Sharine, that suffering is noble, having a hard time making ends meet makes you a person of character, and more authentic than someone who has lots of money. Yes, struggle is normal and having it all is abnormal, right? Mark wants to know, what about the role models and ruts he created. Okay, so just what are those role models and ruts you created, Mark? Have to work hard to earn money, there isn't enough need to conserve. You have to work hard and it's still never enough. Thanks, buddy. Have to work very hard. And, my mother's constant worry that abundance would end. It would all come crashing down, right, Ashley? Selfishness, the less you have materialistically, the more pure your love. Yeah, but you're also more stressed, so you have some negative vibrations in there, right? I bet you, everybody here could agree that when you don't have enough, you're so stressed. It doesn't help your vibration at all, right? You must work hard to make money, born poor, forever poor. Money doesn't grow on trees, have to work hard. Money means love. Yeah, in some families, love is bought, instead of generated from the person's soul. So, parents might buy their kids things to prove they love them. Money is hard to get, harder to keep. Poor, but proud. Oh, I love that. Poor, but proud. Lack of love and understanding. There is not enough for the children. All the money went to the parents addiction. Struggling means you really achieved something. Yeah, you brought yourselves up by your bootstraps, right? You're not good enough to own a home. It doesn't matter how much you make, but how much you spend. What doesn't kill you. Wow, Annette, what doesn't kill you makes you stronger, right? If money comes easy, it leaves easy. Say grandpa had an airplane and dad did not. That was one of Mark's stories about his ruts. Just be grateful for what you have, demand my attention and involvement in almost all things in family. Yeah, so their family demanded all the attention. Wealth obtained must be done dishonestly. Family equals scarcity. Don't spend too much, work hard. Good things for others. Stop asking for money is what Varsha heard. My mother was always angry and violent with kids. We learned to be submissive. Yeah, and, probably, Debra, probably, you learned not to ask for things, right? Because, otherwise, mom would go off. So, that's kind of a tricky place to be. So, then you don't want to ask the universe for things. Business will never take off. Sarah thinks she's naturally lazy and hard to love. Following religious authority figures, having abundance spoils you. You have to work hard to create a certain lifestyle. Can't afford it. Living hand to mouth. From dad, having just enough money is good enough. From grandma, money goes out like running water. Working hard builds character. Life is not easy. People like us work in shops and don't go to college. In order to make a lot of money, you must be doing something illegal or taking advantage of others. Children in Ethiopia don't even have food. Money does not buy happiness. Wow, it is kind of fun though, right? Wouldn't you all agree, money is pretty fun. Having enough money and no stress is pretty okay. To assist my children in their financial issues, they are already adults. Alright, so all these things that you guys are all writing, just take a moment right now, and all these programs and all these lies, right? And, all those crap, and garbage, baggage, that you guys bought into from your families, will you please, please, please, uncreate, delete, and de-story all of them. So, just to expand your energy out past the earth, so you get really big, okay? So, all the programs that you have going on, delete, uncreate, and de-story all of them. Delete, uncreate, and de-story all of them. Delete, uncreate, and de-story all of these things that came up for you guys. Okay, any other family programs that you bought or sold to yourself, and took in, so that you could get love from your family, right? You did it so you could get love, everything that is, delete, destroy, and uncreate all of it. Everywhere you have no idea how to get love from your family, 'cause what that does from a kid is it creates confusion, right? Because, you know what you really want, which is you want to have plenty, and enough, and play, and have fun, right? That's what all children want. They want to have fun, play, woo-hoo, party, have plenty. There's always enough, share with our friends, right? And, everywhere you became confused, stopped that flow, and believed your mom and dad, or any other religious authority figure, or any authority figure for that matter, delete, uncreate, and de-story all of it. All the places that you think you're going to get love by bending into the rules of society and your parents, which, basically, you just become kind of miserable and kind of like them, right? Everything that makes you think that's going to get you love, delete, uncreate, and de-story all of it. So, there's some people that are letting it go. There's some other people that are having a little bit... These are deep programs, okay, you guys? So, I'm so happy you guys are here. So, for those of you who have some of these deeper programs going on, I want to just think for a moment of all the places where you wanted to have some love, when you were a kid, okay? Think of how you wanted your mom and dad to love you, and think of how you wanted your mom and dad to care for you just as you are, and think of how you wanted your mom and dad to just give you just enough, and more than enough love so that you could feel completely and totally adored and honored for being here. Okay, so think of that energy. Let's let that energy come into your life, come into your abundance, so just magnetically, like a magnet in the middle of your heart, just attract to you all your needs, wants, and desires of how you want the abundance to show up in your life, as if the universe just totally cared for you. And, then we're going to ask that you feel the love and genuine caring from the soul of your mother, father, 'cause at the soul of them, they're just like you and I, right? At the soul of them, they're just source energy, and just think of source energy from mom and dad just totally loving you and giving you what you need. So, there's more than enough abundance, more than enough love. And, everyone on this call can receive more than enough. And, everybody on this call can receive exactly what they need. And, everyone on this call can receive unlimited abundance in their life, whatever that form that takes for you, unlimited abundance and love, money, career, family, relationships, joy, and joy and fun. I hear joy and fun. So, think of an unlimited abundance of joy, and fun, and plenty. Alright, you guys feel amazing. Let me know what's going on for you guys, just send me some little love notes, and let's see what's going on. Yeah, I just saw a lot of flowers in the air. So, she got a picture of flowers, hearts, and stuff. Lots of hearts in her head, heart chakra felt energize. My heart feels like it has vibration in it. Freer, more energized, buzzing in the heart chakra. A little teary from that, quite a shift, peaceful, a lot of emerging energy, closer to receiving love, energy, and more love. Lighter heart, more help, hope and belief. Relieves, hot flashes, a more complete with my parents. Soul love. I just realized how much this program, money doesn't buy happiness has blocked me from receiving abundance. Thank you for this realization, and helping me clear this. Pulsing vibrations of love and light, lighter, a little bit like crying, stillness. Finally receiving. Emotions came up and dissipated. That felt really good. My father never, ever called me by my name even. It is good to feel this tingle inside. Wow, thanks for sharing that, Rita. We totally adore and love you. Thank you for being here. Jane's got some crying going on. You're just really... Sometimes there's literally a biological chemistry that your body wants to release, okay? Susan can't imagine source love from her parents, and that's okay. So, just take a directly from God for right now, but that might be a good thing that you could practice visualizing for a little bit, 'cause at the end of the day, if they probably grew up different, they'd probably be different. And, I don't know your story, so I can't say that 100% true, but let's just consider the possibility, and just kind of invite that in, and see what kind of shifts for you. And, it's really okay that you feel completely blocked, right now. So, I completely acknowledge that, and just take some more source energy in, as like total light and love, and just kind of feel the possibilities that, maybe, if your parents grew up in this day, and age, or this era, maybe they would be a little different, or maybe if they had different parents, right? Let's see, Karen's got some stomach stuff. Okay, so just go into it, Karen, as much as you can, and to say thank you for showing me where my block is, but it's time to go now. Feels like it's got some fear attached to it. Patricia felt some forgiveness, a lot of love from her parents on the other side, a little tight in her body. So, anywhere you guys feel tight in your body, just send some more energy there, as much as you can. Somebody is asking, could I help them tell them what to visualize, to help them delete, uncreate, and de-story it? Basically, just imagine source energy coming in, and like a little like light bomb, for lack of a better way to say it, just kind of imagine the energy exploding the darkness. Alright, you guys did awesome. Woo! We're going to do one more. This is... We're going to fill up with some more good stuff to help you guys shift some things. And, what things can you be great fuel? Right? So, gratitude is a huge amount of fuel on a scale of zero to a thousand, a thousand being enlightened, gratefulness is in the seven hundreds, and above, okay? So, gratitude is really who we are, just gracious and thankful. So, what things can you guys be great fuel for that would allow more abundance and wealth to come in. So, what could you add some energy of gratitude to, or for, that would let some more things come in? Health and family, all the love that I have in my life, amazing children, passion, my family, my family. Two families in a row. Ability to change old patterns, good friends, incredible friends, grateful to be part of this journey. My happy, lovely clients. Good friends, all the wonderful people who helped me in my life, ability to change, the money I have, my perfect mate, to live in an area with abundant, organic foods, five children, three grandchildren. Wow. Thanks, Sarah. My husband, who is my soulmate, fantastic hubby and kids, meeting my soul mate, that I have all I need, friends, having met the Silva method, support from source, loving relationship with parents, sisters, brothers. I got a grateful for you, Christie, for my deepest gifts and radiance of love, peace, and connectedness. My dad, inspired ideas that come in the shower, serendipitous moments, love of adventure, love over dark, having children, being different, for who I am. That I love myself enough to do this course. Awesome, Ashley, we love that. To be able to participate in this with all of you, sharing the love for my pets, my health, being aware, being here, great friends, the talents given to me, the courage to expand. I love that. Learning meditation, having help with all these energy clearings. I love my job. Okay, so all these things that you guys are totally grateful for, I want you to just think of the energy of pure source coming through your body, into your heart, from above and below. And, I want you to think about what it would be like to just let more and more gratitude fill you. And, then, when you're ready, just imagine this gratitude going out into the universe and there's like an energy attached to it. So, the more gratitude you send out, you just see it kind of loop back around, and just come back to you like a boomerang, right? So, the more you send out, the more you get back, filling your life with the specific needs, and wants and desires that will make you happy, right? So, sending out gratitude, and like a magnet, and a boomerang, it attracts more and more things to be grateful for towards you. Alright, that feels good. Can you guys feel that? Okay, that's a really, really, really good exercise you guys could do. And, we're going to give you one more little exercise to do today, and that is for one and a half hours this week, part of your thing to do is to do something that you totally and absolutely love to do just for yourself as a gift and an acknowledgement that you're going to love yourself today. Okay? So, one and a half hours, everybody I'm sure can find one and a half hours to totally indulge in something you love, like a massage, a back rub, a pedicure, a bath, reading a book uninterrupted, going to the movies, watching a sunset, whatever your hour and a half pure, indulgent, pleasurable thing is, okay? That's one of your play at home things to do this week. Alright, let me know how you guys are feeling so we can all kind of connect. Free, tired, but in a good way. Sometimes the tiredness is 'cause you're just letting go of things. So, that's awesome. It's tired, 'cause you know why? It's like a relief in a way, right? It's like you let down all your barriers. So, it's like, ah, I can breathe. Grateful, grateful, grateful. She's grateful that she got lipo yesterday, but she would like to be able to connect a little better to source. Okay, cool. Alright, inspired, calm, kind of empty. Empty is good, 'cause empty leaves enough space for more abundance to show up. Oftentimes, we just want to be filled up with stuff even if it's garbage, but spaciousness is actually who we are, light and fluffy, like a puppy, tingles up and down my spine. Sherine doesn't feel anything, but she hopes it works. You know what, Sherine? That's okay, 'cause I love that you said this. Remember, in the beginnings, everybody feels a little bit differently, and some of us have our feelings shut off a little bit. So, it's okay. It's still working, honestly, if you're imagining it happening, it's totally working. Buzzing, feeling hungry. Jane is doing some crying. So, Jane, sometimes that's literally a chemical release. So, let's everybody sends some love and gratitude to Jane. So, Jane wants some love and gratitude. So, let's just send a big whoosh and a big love blessing to Jane, that whatever energy she is holding on to, she just lets go of. My heart is tingling. Mark is going to go motorcycling. Awesome, grateful for my gifts, hopeful. Rita's saying that she saw that loop and that boomerang go wider and wider, brighter and brighter, and it feels so much better than I did at the beginning of the session. So, she's saying her stomach feels better. Okay, cool. And, Jane sent us love and blessings for us sending energy to her. So, you guys are awesome. Let's clap that out. You guys are so great. Feeling the love and can feel that everything's a little different. I don't know if you guys can feel how breezy everything is. Alright, so we're going to do one more clearing. Any old messages that are locked in your unconsciousness, the hidden treasures of the old news that we're going to change today. So, any other stories that you guys are holding on to that if you would let go of now would improve your wealth and abundance. So, what other stories do you guys have going on that you need to let go of? Well, let's see. That I'm not smart enough. Maggie, thank you for being brave, and just kind of saying this out loud, so we can help you clear it. My mother was killed for money. So, we're sorry that happened to you. We're going to help you clear some of that story, so that you can feel a little better about that. Can't enjoy life. Not smart enough, not good enough, pretty enough, or smart enough to have all that I want and desire. Men can't be trusted. If I want something, I have to grab it. Yeah, you have to grab it before anybody else to get it, right? Victorian beliefs about women not owning their lives. I have no power to do anything. Not allowed to shine. I have a story. Need to pay all my bills on time and have plenty of leftover. Mother, greedy, father, powerless, can't seem to get back up when I've been knocked down, believing other people's stories. Having more than others makes them jealous, and you never know their true intentions towards you, not having enough money and I can't buy all I want. Story telling that I'm a loner. Limited, not slim enough. You know what? It's not weird. Rebecca goes not slim enough. I know that's weird. You know what? It's not weird. If it comes up for you, it comes up for you. That's really perpetrated in the society, right? That if you're not a size two, starving yourself, that you're not okay in some way. So, that's a good story to get rid of. So, you can just be you and love your body. Guilt over some bad investments. Amish beliefs on plainness, too fat to be loved. Awe, thanks, Nancy. I don't know where to start. When I get it, I won't have a goal. Oh, interesting. What if you always had targets, and you just shoot for new targets, and you don't have this particular endpoint, that's just targets that you can keep shooting at, and you can choose new ones or bigger ones. Life's not fair. Women are weaker than men. Not lucky enough. Feeling like an outsider. A betrayal happened when we were about to receive a lot of money. Money is elusive, there's not enough to go around, my mother said repeatedly, I am as bad as my father. Thanks for bringing that up, Patricia, that's actually, particularly, one of the reasons I did the lover above course, because I was so tired of seeing parents that the programs they were putting in their kids like that. So, Bonnie's saying she doesn't think the same way her parents do, so she's not a good daughter. If I shine too bright, others will be diminished, and feel bad, if I shine, people will hate me, shining spoils and makes you vain. It's really funny, you guys. You know what's really cool about this? How would you guys all know that you were going to basically type the shine thing in all at one time? So, I had three comments about shining too brightly all in a row. That's so cool. And, you guys wouldn't randomly know that, right? So, it's in the air. My parents did not give me the tools to succeed. Losing all my childhood friends due to my dad's ignorance, guilt. I don't have the keys to unlock the secrets of abundance. Not rich enough to prove my skills. Powerless. Mother was powerless and depressed. Not worthy enough, not perfect enough, fear of upsetting others, 'cause you're a selfish about your money, too talkative, mother brainwashing me. I have to help brothers and sisters, and Patricia's going, well, what about me? I will never make a lot of money, if I keep focusing on money. I give away a lot of belongings, 'cause I didn't deserve it. So, Sarah was saying she didn't feel like she deserved it. So, one of the stories Louise says is, what if this program doesn't work for me? Alright, well, blow that one up too. People don't have enough money to pay me. Okay, so trauma, abuse, beat down, and submissive, some resentment towards my ex. Can't be lucky. So, all these programs, okay? I'm going to bring this one up too. Ashley brought it up, my father made millions and didn't leave it to any of his kids. Okay, so all these stories that you guys are holding onto, alright? Will you please, please, please uncreate, delete, and de-story all of them. Uncreate, delete, and de-story all of them, times a gazillion, okay? Everything else you guys are holding onto about all this, that's stopping you from manifesting the life you truly desire, will you please, now, delete, uncreate, and de-story all of these. Okay, any other place where your family, and friends, and any stories that you learned as a youngster are basically perpetrating doubt, guilt, fear, worry, anger, or any other suppression or depression of your true wealth and abundance, will you please uncreate, delete, and de-story all of it. All the other suppression and depression that you guys are feeling, will you please uncreate, delete, and de-story all of it. Okay, awesome. You guys just let go of a huge amount of stuff right there. So, any other stories that you guys are holding onto, known or unknown to you, that are somehow holding you back, please delete, uncreate, and de-story all of them. Alright. So, here's what we're going to do now, we're going to fill in, okay? And, my favorite way to fill in with things is say, what would it take? Okay? So, what would it take for you to have more abundance than you could ever, ever, ever expect? What would it take for you to live your dream life with ease? And, I want you guys to fill in for a minute with something that you really want to have happen, okay? And, just kind of say out loud, wherever you are, repeat in your head, whatever you have to do, what would it take, universe, to deliver to me? And, then, fill in the blank. What would it take, universe, to deliver to me? Okay, and I'm just going to keep filling in with what you want. What would it take, universe, to deliver everybody unlimited abundance, plenty of cash, total love and caring for themselves, the life that is easy, and loving, and kind, and gorgeous, and glorious to them. What would it take, universe, for everybody on this call and their family to upgrade their money consciousness, or abundance so easily that they laugh about it? You guys just laugh at how easy it is. What would it take for all your unlimited abundance just to open up and bring you whatever it is you'd need, want and desire? Awesome. So, asking the universe to treat you to a grateful experiences, happy experiences, joyful, fun, really cool experiences, whatever those look like in your life. Now, another way you can phrase this is what vibrational energy can you become to have unlimited resources and ease? What vibrational energy can you invite into your body to have unlimited resources and ease? What vibrational energy can you all become to have all your dreams come to fruition? What vibrational energy can you become to have all your dreams come to fruition? What vibrational energy, and I'm going to let you guys fill in the blank, what vibrational energy can bring you... Okay, one more time. What vibrational energy can bring you... Okay, so I, if you notice, use questions to open the door. Okay? So, that's why I do my affirmation sort of as a question. I, also, think that you can probably just say, I'm so grateful and thankful for XYZ to show up in my life. Okay, so blessing it along the way, do all the energy statements on everything that comes up for lower, dense energies. So, everything that brings up anything negative, delete, uncreate, and de-story. Remember, live in truth. So, ask, is this really true? Is it something that you want to be a part of you? When you're clearing things, you're moving a lot of energy. You have to really get this, you're an infinite being, and if you have blocks, you're using infinite energy against your own self, okay? So, infinite energy releasing, sometimes, takes a lot of energy. So, good nutrition while you're doing this is really important. So, eat fruits, veggies, clean food, you guys, okay? Drink a lot of water, vitamins, and minerals. Keep your energy up. At the end of the day, minerals are crystalline structures, and they allow energy to flow. And, all the little building blocks in your body like sugar, salt, water, all those things have like an energy or a matrix to them in a way, that allow the energy to flow in and out of your body quickly. So, get some rest, processing can also happen overnight. So, get a little extra rest while you're doing this. If you notice you're a little tired, maybe you need another hour sleep. If any old emotions are passing, uncreate them. If you guys are still feeling anything, just keep uncreating and deleting it all. You can also try something, it's called Bach remedies, rescue remedy. You can buy it at the health food store or online. Some people like it. It's a homeopathic. Some people say it makes them feel a little better, okay? And, again, the ideal would be is to ask your body what it really needs from you, or you can try it on, you can say body, do you need some more water? Yes, no. And, whichever one feels light is the truth, right? Body, do you need some more minerals or vitamins? Yes, no. And, whichever one feels light, that's the truth. So, just kind of get a little more expansive, questioning, giving your body what it needs. Alright. Awesome. Woo-hoo! Okay, everybody give yourself a high five, a clap. Congratulate yourselves. Give yourself a big hug. Thank you very much. Love you all and bye. Please continue to the next unlimited abundance journey session.

LESSON 4: Clearing Money Zapping Decisions (Clearing Session Only)

So we're going to start with connecting you guys to the light. I don't know if you guys know this, but you're actually way more connected to the light than you normally have been. So just as good measure and good cheer for everybody. Close your eyes for a minute. Connect up to the light. Go about 300 feet up into the air. See your sensor. Feel the light. Let the light come in. Let that come into your bodies, into your head, your throat, your heart, your stomach, your legs, down your arms, into the ground, into the center of the planet. Find that really cool happy place in the center of the planet. Let that energy come back up and nourish and fill your body so that source energy can work through the material world called Earth and help support you. And ask that energy to bounce. Up your legs, into your torso, into your heart, and radiate 360 degrees all the way around like a great big central sunshine. See this light getting bigger than the building that you're in, bigger than the town that you're in, bigger than the state that you're in, bigger than the country you're in, and bigger than the planet. All right, you guys are awesome. You guys are doing this so well. I can completely tell. This is why I forgot because you guys are actually more connected. So everything, everything, everything that is defined in your life, that you don't care or love yourself enough, like that's the energy behind it all, that you won't go for it, that energy where you don't care or love yourself, will you please uncreate, delete it, and de -story it? Okay, this one's heavy for some of you. So just stay pretty expanded. We're going to do this a few more times. All the energies where you don't care or love yourself for whatever reason, please, please, please delete, uncreate, and destroy all of it. Wow, there's a lot of energy here. Okay, so all the other places that, you know, all these beautiful things that you guys really want to have happen in your life. And every story and every place behind that that doesn't let you have that, will you please, please, please uncreate, delete, and de -story the whole thing? Think of what it would be like for you guys to completely and totally care about yourself, completely and totally honor yourself, completely and totally care for yourself the same way you would a child, a pet, a loved one. And what would it be like for you guys to care about yourself that much every day? Everything that doesn't allow that to be your normal existence in your life, everything that is, will you please delete, uncreate, and de -story all of that? Awesome. Okay, one more time. All the abundance and wealth that you're not allowing into your life and all the reasons why, because it's really the reasons why that we're going to blow up, all the reasons why you won't let this happen, will you please delete? uncreate, and de -story the whole thing. So anywhere else you're just kind of heavy or dense, delete, uncreate, and de -story all of it. Anywhere else you guys are heavier or dense in your body and any cell memory of all this old emotion that wants to come out, delete, uncreate, and de -story all of it. All these programs and all these lies, right, and all those crap and garbage, baggage. that you guys bought into from your families, will you please, please, please uncreate, delete, and destroy all of them. So just to expand your energy out past the earth so you get really big, okay? So all the programs that you have going on, delete, uncreate, and destroy all of them. Delete, uncreate, and destroy all of them. Delete, uncreate, and destroy all of these things that came up for you guys. Okay, any other family programs that you bought or sold to yourself and took in so that you could get love from your family, right? You did it so you could get love. Everything that is, delete, destroy, and uncreate all of it. Everywhere you have no idea how to get love from your family because what that does for a kid is it creates confusion, right? Because you know what you really want, which is you want to have plenty and enough and play and have fun, right? That's what all children want. They want to have fun, play, woohoo, party, have plenty, there's always enough, share with our friends, right? And everywhere you became confused, stopped that flow and believed your mom and dad or any other religious authority figure or any authority figure for that matter. Delete, uncreate, and de -story all of it. All the places that you think you're going to get love by bending into the rules of society and your parents, which basically you just become kind of miserable and kind of like them, right? Everything that makes you think that's going to get you love. delete, uncreate, and destroy all of it. I want you to just think for a moment of all the places where you wanted to have some love when you were a kid. Okay, think of how you wanted your mom and dad to love you. And think of how you wanted your mom and dad to care for you just as you are. And think of how you wanted your mom and dad to just give you just enough and more than enough love so that you could feel completely and totally adored and honored for being here. Okay, so think of that energy. Let's let that energy come into your life, come into your abundance. So just magnetically, like a magnet in the middle of your heart, just attract to you all your needs, wants, and desires of how you want the abundance to show up in your life, as if the universe just totally cared for you. And then we're going to ask that you feel the love and genuine caring from the soul of your mother, father, because at the soul of them, they're just like you and I, right? At the soul of them, they're just source energy. And just think of source energy from mom and dad just totally loving you and giving you what you need. So there's more than enough abundance, more than enough love, and everyone on this call can receive more than enough. And everybody on this call can receive exactly what they need. And everyone on this call can receive unlimited abundance in their life, whatever form that takes for you. Unlimited abundance in love, money, career, family, relationships, joy, and joy and fun. I hear joy and fun. So think of unlimited abundance of joy and fun and plenty. All right, you guys feel amazing. So anywhere you guys feel tight in your body, just send some more energy there as much as you can. Somebody's asking, could I help them tell them what to visualize to help them delete, uncreate, and de -story it? Basically, just imagine source energy coming in and like a little light bomb, for lack of a better way to say it, just kind of imagine the energy exploding the darkness. This is, we're going to fill up with some more good stuff to help you guys shift some things. And what things can you be great fuel? Right? So gratitude is a huge amount of fuel on the scale of zero to a thousand, a thousand being enlightened. Gratefulness is in the 700s and above. Okay? So gratitude is really who we are, just gracious and thankful. So what things can you guys be great fuel for that would allow more abundance? and wealth to come in so what could you add some energy of gratitude to or for that would let some more things come in okay so all these things that you guys are totally grateful for i want you to just think of the energy of pure source coming through your body into your heart from above and below and i want you to think about what it would be like to just let more and more gratitude fill you And then when you're ready, just imagine this gratitude going out into the universe and there's like an energy attached to it. So the more gratitude you send out, you just see it kind of loop back around and just come back to you like a boomerang, right? So the more you send out, the more you get back, filling your life with the specific needs and wants and desires that will make you happy, right? So sending out gratitude. And like a magnet and a boomerang, it attracts more and more things to be grateful for towards you. All right, that feels good. Can you guys feel that? Okay, that's a really, really, really good exercise you guys could do. Okay, so all these stories that you guys are holding on to, all right, will you please, please, please uncreate, delete, and de -story all of them. uncreate, delete, and destroy all of them times a gazillion. Okay, everything else you guys are holding on to about all this that's stopping you from manifesting the life you truly desire, will you please now delete, uncreate, and destroy all of these. Okay, any other place where your family and friends and any stories that you learned as a youngster are basically perpetrating doubt, guilt, fear, worry, anger, or any other suppression or depression of your true wealth and abundance, will you please uncreate, delete, and destroy all of it? All the other suppression and depression that you guys are feeling, will you please uncreate, delete, and destroy all of it? Okay, awesome. You guys just let go of a huge amount of stuff right there. So any other stories that you guys are holding on to, known or unknown to you, that are somehow holding you back, please delete, uncreate, and de -story all of them. So here's what we're gonna do now. We're gonna fill in, okay? And my favorite way to fill in with things is say, what would it take, okay? So what would it take for you to have more abundance than you could ever, ever, ever expect? What would it take? for you to live your dream life with ease. And I want you guys to fill in for a minute with something that you really want to have happen, okay? And just kind of, you know, say out loud wherever you are, repeat in your head, whatever you have to do. What would it take, universe, to deliver to me? And then fill in the blank. What would it take, universe, to deliver to me? Okay, I'm just going to keep filling in with what you want. What would it take universe to deliver everybody in limited abundance, plenty of cash, hold a loving caring for themselves, the life that is easy and loving and kind and gorgeous and glorious to them? What would it take universe for everybody on this call and their family to upgrade their money consciousness, their abundance so easily that they laugh about it? You know, you guys just laugh at how easy it is. What would it take for all your unlimited abundance to just open up and bring you whatever it is you need, want, and desire? Awesome. So asking the universe to treat you to grateful experiences, happy experiences, joyful, fun, really cool experiences, whatever those look like in your life. Now another way you can phrase this is what vibrational energy can you become to have unlimited resources and ease? What vibrational energy can you invite into your body to have unlimited resources and ease? What vibrational energy can you all become to have all your dreams come to fruition? What vibrational energy can you become to have all your dreams come to fruition? What vibrational energy, and I'm going to let you guys fill in the blank, what vibrational energy can bring you, okay, one more time, what vibrational energy can bring you, please continue to the next Unlimited Abundance Journey session.

LESSON 5: Clearing Fear of Growth

- Hey, this is Christie Marie Sheldon and you're listening to a recording I did of a series of 24 live group sessions on clearing your abundance blocks. And here's where we're going to cover it in today's session number five. We're going to do something a little bit different, we're going to take a look at how your garden grows. How does your wealth garden grow, is it contrary? That's what we're going to do and we're going to have a little meditation that reveals to us how it's growing and what your future garden has in store for you. Once we see how our gardens are growing, we're going to figure out what we want to plant and nurture in our future. And we're going to start by focusing on three of our pots. We're going to start focusing on how you want your life-view to look like, what you want your love-view to look like, and what you want your money-view to look like. And we're going to design our future garden to more closely match that which you really want. And as we go through our garden and design your future garden, we're going to clear any blocked energy that comes up that's not going to allow this garden to grow. And I'm going to teach you a few techniques along the way, so let's begin. Hi, welcome, how are you guys? This is Christie, today is going to be a little bit different than the other days. We're going to open up some more specific things about filling in with how you guys want to fill in with your money and abundance and wealth and all these kinds of cool things. So as you guys know, grab a journal or a piece of paper, you're going to need to jot down some things. Be open to any new awareness that comes in, set your intents and what you hope to achieve today in this clearing session, bring any of your baggage so we can clear it and we're going to journey together and generate unlimited abundance. So here is my favorite part of the day, Inspiring Stories. First off, we have Jeanne, Jeanne wrote me and she said she was torn and confused by what appeared to be a possible disillusion, dissolving basically, of a relationship. She was able to use the tools that I was showing you guys, delete, destroy and uncreate it all and she did that for all the sadness and grief. She said for the first time she was able to ease her pain and feel freer. She was able to gain peace and perspective. Within an hour, the friend that was in the relationship contacted her ready to commit to an honest sharing of feelings. Now for Jeanne this was a valuable tool, because it assisted her in keeping her heart open even when her fear and her hurt could become more important. Whenever we're kind of hurt or fear we react right? So she cleared it all and started living from the levels of Love or Above. This week she's been feeling more open and connected than she has ever in her whole life and she said people are responding. They're approaching her to connect and share, talk to her. She said she's no longer burdened by the sense of being a loner. So how many of you guys have probably felt a little lonely or alone or want to cut yourself off from people, those are usually your filters and you'll notice that those are going to get cleared in this journey. She's actively openly connecting and letting her light shine as she reveals the beauty of herself and others. Anita now this is like a really touching story. Anita had a really hard time dealing with shame and self worth when she went from an abundant life to having to receive government assistance to provide for her three kids. When her unemployment and food stamps stopped right after she decided it was time to get off the assistance, it was even more scary for her. I mean, imagine that, she doesn't have cash coming in and the unemployment and food stamps stopped. But then she said amazing things started to happen. She was gifted with participating in the Unlimited Abundance journey. So somebody was gracious enough to give her tuition and gift this to her which is so amazing. $1,000 towards school tuition, a ticket to a high priced fundraiser so she could meet and greet with potential, people who could help her, right? Two weeks of Summer Camp for her kids. She said that for one of her kids, this is worth $600. Support from family members for some necessities. $250 for her performing her art. She had also had a professional director of photography tape that for her, so she manifested that. And this is all in the last few weeks since she joined the Unlimited Abundance Journey. She is now openly receiving and surrounded by wealth in her consciousness and her life. That's a really, really, really amazing story. All of us are probably grateful that we don't have to necessarily be in that situation, so that's inspiring. Okay, today's exciting, we're going to do something a little bit different, how does your garden grow? How does your wealth garden grow? So that's what we're going to work on today. We are going to do a little meditation today, then I'll just give you a little preview. So I'm going to guide you and I'm going to guide you to see what your subconscious is sort of trying to show you, okay? So I found that these meditations are really powerful. I woke up one day and I had to do a meditation on this myself and I found in my garden, some places where it was a little patchy, where it needed a little weeding, where it needed some water and all sorts of things. And I often look at my garden and check in on it and see what I need to tend to, so I can help increase my abundance in all parts of my life. So we're going to connect to your garden, see what's needed and usually when we do meditations like this, some people will say, well, I don't really meditate. So we're going to clear that first. So anybody who thinks they can't meditate or can't connect to the light, or do any of those things that we were going to do today, delete, destroy and uncreate, all of it. So all of that stuff's got to go. But here's what happens, just allow and imagine, okay, because that's really all it is when we connect to our subconscious, which can give us pictures and forms and just even if you think you're making it up, just go along with whatever kind of shows itself. And you can even just gently nudge yourself and say, well, if I could make it up, what would my garden look like and just allow itself to fill you in as best you can, okay? So some people are saying, again, I can't visualize, but if I said to you right now, think of a lemon. So everybody, right now think of a lemon. So somewhere in your energy system, you just perceived a lemon. If I tell you to think of a pink elephant, every one of you just thought of a pink elephant. If I say to you think of your right foot, you know what your right foot looks like and you can think of it, all right? So if you can do all of those things, which I know every one of you can do, that's your other senses, okay, Like I call your imagination, your image machine. So it's the same place that meditation or visualization comes in, you just think of something and you kind of get a sense of it, all right? So don't get too caught up in the semantics of it all. So here's what we're going to do. I'm going to do it one more time, everywhere you guys think you can't visualize or can't connect or any of those things, delete, destroy and uncreate it all. So now this is just a check-in, it's just information, it can't hurt you 'cause we're going to show you how to change it at the end, so it's all good news. We're going to start by connecting to the light. So close your eyes, look up. See or sense the light. And allow this light and love to just come right in. So take your energy up about 300 feet and allow the light to shine right into your head, right into your third eye. Right into your ears. Right into your throat. Right into your chest. Okay, right down your arms. Right into your torso. Right into your stomach. Right into your hips, to some people it will feel like a light beam coming into you and to some people it will feel like liquid light. So whichever way it comes in for you is perfect, okay. Allow it to come into your thighs, your knees, your feet. And just think and we're open to receiving this much source energy and this much love. I'm open to receiving source energy and love. Okay, and let this light go into the center of the planet where there's another space, so as above and so below, there's another space that feels like pure source energy in the middle of the planet, it feels totally happy and welcoming. like, I'm so glad you're here. Yeah, all right and then let that light kind of bounce back up like a mini trampoline and just bounce right back up your feet, your calves are thaws your hips and into your heart, radiating out 360 degrees, all the way around you. Okay, so this light is radiating out, so you're in a big bubble of love and light from above and below. And this big bubble of love and light wants to expand out past the building you're in. Past the city you're in. Expand out, just imagine this big bubble of love goes past the state you're in, pass the country you're in and past the Earth, until you're connected all the way around the Earth. Being that infinite being that you truly are. Alright, you guys are doing great, all right. So let's play 'cause this is all play time, it's all fun, it's all play, it's just checking in. Imagine if you can, there's a little pathway, okay? And allow that pathway to show up how it shows up for you. So it could be a little grass pathway, it could be a little mossy, it could be a little rocky. But follow this pathway up until you get to the top of a hill and it's probably about 30, 40 feet. So just keep walking and the path, it just feels kind of nice. All right and once you get to the top of the hill, I want you to notice in front of you a garden. And this garden can be any shape, it can be like a cactus garden or it could be a cornfield, or it could be a rose garden, whatever your garden is, but this is your present-time abundance garden. Your present time abundance garden. And I want you to walk over to it and just gently notice whatever it is that you are drawn to, like it could be a weed that you want to pull out. It could be a bush, it could be a tree. It could be something that you want to cut, or burn or get rid of wherever you go, just notice what it is and then say to that object, what do you represent in my current, wealth garden, abundance garden? What do you up present in my current abundance garden? It could be credit cards, it could be money. It could be anything, it could be your job, career, how you love yourself. And once you get that answer, what do you represent to me, then the next thing is, is I would love it if you ask, how can I change you? And then whatever it says like cut it off, burn it off, anything, just change it. Okay, you guys are doing great, all right? So now take your time and just kind of notice something else that draws your attention. So is there anything else that feels like it kind of needs a little look at? So go to that section and look at that and ask what do you represent in my life? What part of my abundance garden do you represent in my life, okay? And ask what do I need to do to change you? What do I need to do to change you? Okay and then when you're ready, just notice any other thing in your wealth garden, that you're drawn to, your abundance garden. Okay and ask what do you represent in my life? And what do I need to do to change you? Okay, so just take that information with no judgment, okay? You're not going to judge yourself 'cause we're going to change everything, all right? And now, let's go take a look at your future garden. So kind of look around, there should be another path and follow that path up until you get to the next little hill. So again it's about 30, 40 feet away from you and just travel that up till you get to the next hill. Okay, great, now what does this garden look like? Notice your future abundance garden. It should be happier in some way for you. All right, so notice one thing in this garden and just wherever you're drawn, just go to it. And then ask what do you represent in my life? And what steps can I take to get you? What steps can I take to get you? And now notice any other object in this garden that you're drawn to and walk over to it and say, what do you represent in my life? And how do I get you? All right and just notice one more thing in your abundance garden and ask, what do you represent for me and how can I get you? And when you're ready, when you feel complete, just kind of gently open your eyes and on your piece of paper, in your journal, whatever you have in front of you, just take some notes, and just ask yourself some of the following questions. What did your first garden look like and was there anybody with you? What kind of garden was it, you know, was it vegetables? Was it dry, barren land, was it rocky? Did it have like some potholes in it? Did it have tons of weeds and how were you feeling in this garden? And then any insight that you received when you asked how can you change it? And the next one, what did it change into, in your future garden, how was this different? So basically, were you with anyone, what did it look like? What kind of garden was it? What steps did you need to take to get to this garden and how did you feel in this garden? Share some of the things that you guys received. What does the Tree of Life represent? So just ask yourself, everybody's interpretation of things is usually personal, so Ilam, what does the Tree of Life represent to you? So Tara found out she needs to water her current garden. Dante the future garden was hazy, so we're going to work on getting it more clear. First garden was weeded, organized and full of sprouting trees, so you're probably planting some new things. So Ilam, maybe you're anchoring some new Tree of Life in your life right? Maybe it's anchoring things from you. Marcia was like I thought the garden was yours. Shareeka saw that the willow tree represented a healthy pregnant lady. So Bill's saying he's frustrated because he couldn't imagine a garden, as I had to ask the garden to respond I went blank. Okay, so Bill so any block that you have for seeing, knowing or believing that this could work at any level for you, will you please, please, please, delete, uncreate and destroy it all. And here's just your subconscious mind kind of blocking you a little bit so you have a few beliefs that say I can't like move forward somehow and I can't do things right. So those are the couple ones you're going to have to work on for a couple of weeks like everywhere you don't feel like you can do things right or everywhere you don't think you can get ahead or everywhere you don't think you can perceive and know everything to lead all those. So those are you clearing statements for a couple of weeks and then you'll be able to do it. So it's good that this came up Bill, okay, so it's just a block and it can easily be released. So I understand you're feeling frustrated but it was just your subconscious just showing you what your next step is, which is to clear this, okay, so it's perfect. Even though it doesn't feel perfect in the minute, I get it. "I love the garden it was fun. "The first garden had some dry grass "and bare spots, empty of people. "Second one was lush, had a man in it, "water flowed and was told to plant more seeds. "The Weed of Doubt became a blossoming flower, happy. "First one was overgrown, full of weeds, "the future one was vast and lush and far, "but couldn't work out what it was telling me." well it's probably there was infinite, unlimited, plant what you want, let's see, the first garden had a few clumps and she burned them and felt like then she needed to exercise and be an extrovert. Saw hose in the future garden. She checked the hose for any kinks and it was a very beautiful garden. Nancy had some barren patches, sweet smelling I felt trapped and bad, so Roz basically met her childhood self at age four and she promised to nurture her and get good advice from her. So yeah, so it's probably just some part of you that needed help. Well, these are all amazing. Now what we're going to do is we're going to just do some clearings and even those that may not have gotten, are a little frustrated, 'cause you didn't get anything you're going to clear with us to, okay? So you did it right because it just showed up whatever was next for you, so all the things that are creating anything negative that you really didn't want to see in the first garden. Okay, so all the things behind the scenes subconsciously, that you didn't prefer or like or appreciate in the first garden, will you please please, please, uncreate, delete and destroy it all. Okay, everywhere you're blocked on getting to your new future, delete, uncreate and destroy it all now. Anywhere you had some weeds that needed pulled, anything creating those weeds, delete, unreate and destroy it all now. Everywhere you had some barren patches that needed to fix, everything that's creating those barren patches, delete, uncreate and destroy them all now. Everywhere you feel a little unkind to yourself, because you kind of noticed what was needed, so anyone who's feeling a little badly about anything, delete, uncreate and destroy all that now. Any other thing that needs to go, that's inhibiting you and locking you down from going to the next garden, will you please uncreate, delete and destroy it all now? Okay, that was a big one. Okay, everywhere you guys don't feel like you have the proper guidance to get you to the next step, will you please uncreate, delete and destroy it all now? Any other place where you feel a lot has gone on in your life that won't let you go to the next step, like so you're letting history dictate your future, delete, uncreate and destroy it all now. Okay, any other subconscious thing that's fighting you from knowing your future, being your future and having your future and have it be abundant, healthy, wealthy and wise, delete, uncreate and destroy it all now? Everywhere you guys feel anxious or afraid or ashamed or guilt or fear about anything that you uncovered in your garden and anything we uncovered in your subconscious, right, that didn't maybe let you get to your garden. All those things, delete, uncreate and destroy them all now. Okay, any other place that you guys feel like a victim that you can't change your future, delete, uncreate and destroy it all now. So we are going to go to the next section where we're going to design your future garden, okay? So we just kind of allowed your future garden to pop up, but you're going to have to plant some seeds in the future, right, in order to create your future garden. Now, some of you may or may not have heard of things called a vision board. What a vision board is, is a vision board is what sometimes people will do to kind of like map out with pictures, thoughts and words, what they want their future to look like. And so what we're going to do is we have these garden plots that we're basically going to fill in, that are going to be your future garden. Okay, so we're plotting your future life, okay? And in each garden plot, we're going to put what we see in the next part of your life, all right? So let's do the first, we're going to lay out how you want your future and then this will give you the next level of clearing that we're going to do, right? Because if we don't know what your future is specifically, because you haven't created it, then we don't really know what to get out of the way, okay? So the very first thing that we're going to work on is what I call your life view. So here's where your life view is. So your life view is the way you desire to look at the world, so I gave a few examples, but I want you guys to really think about this for yourself and really be creative, okay? I want you to jot down three ways that you desire to look at the world. One of them could be to live my life as if everything is a blessing or to live my life as if I am a gift to the world, right? So what if you loved yourself so much that you knew you were a gift to the world? You could do it to stop complaining and take more action to see something good in everything, to live as if there is no tomorrow which means to live so presently that only the good stuff shows up right? So jot down the three ways you desire to have in your life-view plot how you're going to look at the world, all right? And then jot them down and type them in at the same time to me, basically be your ADD self and multitask, 'cause maybe what you wrote down will inspire somebody else. So what's one thing, thank you Heather, sources around me at all times. That's one way she desires to look at the world. The world is a safe and happy place, living a loving and abundant life, just ask and it's given. View the world as fun every day. Hey, remember the last time there was an inspiring story where somebody said she wanted $100 bills to show up in her life, right? Well, that's like a life view, right? Patricia to always feel inspired, be grateful for everyone and everything, hopeful, enthusiastic and gracious. I react in powerful and positive ways that empower me and those around me. No judgments, to command, it is all at my command. No fear, get paid for being me. Connected to source at all times, knowing that I am one with source. Total abundance, gratitude and joy for being given the gift of life to always see the possibilities, so that's a good one, seeing what's possible and everything. To accomplish my desires, totally surrender and align with source, yes. That only good can come from this experience right now, to live glory in the moment. See the whole world as a whole and connected. To live without fear, fearless, healing powers activated. The world is comforting. To see abundance in everything, view material abundance flowing in my life, live with purpose and value. Master my life with joy and love. Awesome relationship with my inner child, be a life unhampered. With knowledge that I will not always be a struggle. Okay, all is in the flow, infinite joy. Life is effortless, all right, these are all excellent. So thinks you guys, these are awesome. Confidence, fearless, choose love and be brave. Cool, okay, so now here's the next one that we're going to fill in your life plot or your garden plot, your love view. Remember that was over to the left? So jot down three ways you wish to share love in the world. Some example, bless yourself every day, bless everybody every day, right? Volunteer patience with your family. So what are some ways, so type some in and write them down in your journal. Three ways you wish to share love in the world 'cause how you love is basically the underlying feeling that will generate your future, okay? So how you feel will generate your future. "Calm and patient with everybody. "Don't forget to be kind in myself and get some happy time." I like it, happy time to ourselves. "Having a healing clinic that heals everyone that comes. "Laugh, receive, be authentic. "helping others believe in themselves by example. "Without limitation, full out." I love that, and limitless. "Available for my kids and grandkids. "Blessing ball of light for the whole planet. "Random acts of kindness, making others feel happy "and uplifted and uplifted when I am around them. "Inspire youth to be their best. "Be a transmitter of universal love. "Have a magic wand that heals everybody. "Dance with others, sing every day, "be enjoyed and laughing each day." I love that. "Allow others to be what they are, "even if it's not what you'd like. "See love in everything, cherish myself." That there are actually practical solutions for every problem, which is totally true. There are solutions for every problem. "Be balanced by filling myself up first, "so I can raise everybody's vibe. "Don't judge others, know that everyone "has their own things going on and don't get offended. "Volunteer at orphanages, facilitate healing, give fun. "Keep my own energy clean and clear." I love all that, get out of my head and into my heart. "Be the source of love, be inspiring and heartwarming. "Acceptance, compassion, raise my vibe, "meditate more, play more. "I am a shiny fun, generous, powerful light fairy, "sharing my gifts with all that want them and to enjoy "the pleasure of others and see beauty and love everywhere." I love it, it'd be cool if you guys could come up like a powerful one that feels really juicy that you totally love saying about yourself every day. All right, cool and love others enough to let them learn their own life lessons and consequences. So that's like total allowance, right? Let people be and let them figure it out. Okay, and to teach, so you guys are awesome. All right, these are all great. This is a really great way to look at the world and love people and yourself. Okay, so now we're going to work on the next one. And this is the one that my last group, they had a little bit of energy on. So this is good, if you have energy on it, we can clear. So I'm going to try to be a little more specific. So on that plot, this is going to be your garden, you have your finances and material world abundance plot. Okay, so this is your little place in the garden, okay? So imagine that it's your garden and there's two ways we're going to do this, okay? Because ultimately, what we want for you is to get everything you want, right? But the second thing that we want for you is we want, your next two or three steps to show up in your world. So like there's this big picture blueprint that we want in your life but we also want, the smaller things, so for instance, if you said I want to get out of debt, okay? And maybe you're debt is like five grand, what if it's okay to write the total thing that you want, debt-free lifestyle, right? But also, it's okay to write down the second part of that, which is, it's okay for my first $100 to show up to pay off my debt and it's okay, for my next $1,000 to show up to pay off my debt, okay? So we're going to have like, literally on your piece of paper you can have two lists that you're going to get started with, all right? I want you to just kind of jot down without thinking too much just kind of allow it to pop up in your head, to jot down the material needs that you require for your abundant, financially secure, loving, comfortable financial world, okay? So if you want a home be a little more specific. Like, so there's two things that happen. So if you want a three bedroom, say, I want a three bedroom home that's comfortable, when I walk into it, it feels like love to me. Me and my family can easily and effortlessly receive it and afford it and it's tastefully furnished in a way that makes me happy. So you don't have to know specifically that the bedroom is painted, whatever tan, right? Or the bathroom is painted blue. You don't have to know that specifically, because what if you find a house that has a better color scheme than what you're currently thinking of, okay? So just kind of fill in the general what you want, with the overlying feeling of being completely and totally happy that you have it. And then next to that write down a couple of little baby steps that you could take that could help you move towards that. So it might be calling up a realtor and looking at a couple houses. Or it could be basically asking your boss for a raise so that later on, eventually, you could afford it right? Like whatever your happy next step is that kind of pops up in your head, write that down too. All those, you know, if you know for sure that you want an SUV, put SUV, kind of the color that you can easily afford, if the price put the price and then let's just say somebody is out there asking for a Learjet but currently you only make 100 grand, okay? Now, let's just say put down whatever one of the baby steps is that would help you get the Learjet. Okay and it's okay to put the Learjet down, because maybe you have a friend or you meet a new friend, like I have lots of friends with Learjets actually, so I get rides to places pretty frequently. So now isn't that cool, I don't actually have to pay for one myself, so I just get to go with them and I don't have to pay for it. Which completely and totally works for me, by the way. You can write those things down. Your adventure fund, your philanthropy fund, a lot of people want to make a lot of money so that they can help people, so whatever that is for you, if you need school and training for yourself or your kids, put that in retirement, like how much do you need to retire in order to generate X amount of dollars? How much cash do you want to have on hand? How much do you need or really need for your clothes and all those kinds of things. So whatever you require, okay, so just share with me a couple things that you guys are thinking about. "So energetically bring in or receive money. "That the home I have seen and the loan to buy it for "and the loan to be paid up as soon as possible. "My dream home in Sausalito. "The Mega Lottery with 50 million or more." Buy lottery tickets, that's her little baby step. Tara says it's so neat that she's writing this down, it's like having a little contract with herself. Well, yeah, if you don't think about it, and I mean it's easier what you put energy in is going to magnetize more things, 15k a month. Sarah is saying this is overwhelming to me to do it all at once. Well just pick a couple things, Sara. So I just put a couple things to kind of trigger you, so what you're going to do is we're starting on this, but you're going to do this a little bit on your own over the next couple of days. So I'm glad you wrote that, by the way. So just start with why you can start. So just think overall, Sara and anybody who's a little confused, like, how do you generally want your life to be? So I'll give you an example. At one time in my life, I actually had three homes. Okay, but do what I had to do? I had to, like take care of the three homes. I had to then take care of extra people, there was extra money to be spent on the homes. So currently, for instance, I only have one home, it's a nice home, it's not a huge home, because truthfully, I don't want to take care of that stuff anymore, okay? So that's just where I'm at right now. Now, if you, for instance want a really big home, and you want to do all those kinds of things, then for sure, write it down 'cause at that time when I had the three homes, I was completely and totally joyful, that I had them and I was grateful and I loved it and I love decorating and I loved all that stuff. And then what happened at some point, I actually didn't really like it as much and then I just simplified my life, okay? So it didn't mean that the first part of it was wrong and the second part of it was more right, it just means that my energy changed, okay? So whatever it is for you, whatever your lifestyle is, so just get a picture in your head. I mean, do you want to live a big life? Do you want to live a more simplistic life? Whatever makes you totally thrilled and happy okay? See this is all about you. So people are putting to earn more money, re-modify a home loan, I love this. So this is a little baby step right? Re-modify the home loan to 2,500 a month at 4% loan fixed. Okay, so that's like a very solid goal. 100,000 tax-free, passive income per month. So that's our big one, so Caroline's going to have to like put that down into smaller, little baby steps somewhere, right, so you can have both. "Minimum 4K a month, a car that's energy efficient. "To buy a weekend house on the sea, "manifested buyer for my home in Hawaii "for top dollar that is both fair to the buyer and seller." I have seen a lot of people when they really focus on things I knew this chick she wanted to buy an investment property and she found this little old lady, somehow randomly, her realtor did, who sold her a house that was worth, I don't know let's just say half a million for like 350. Good things like that can happen. Let's see a secretary, an editor, a camera person, a limo or motorcycle, a Learjet, 10 million bucks, a beautiful house. Sara thanks me for all her baby steps. Let's see, always have more than enough cash available every day of my life so that I never need to worry about money. Three bedroom home in New Jersey, the best location for me to call home so Marie you're going to have to have that as one of your energy statements this week. What would it take for me to figure out where I truly want to live that I'd be totally happy with loving friends, kindness to myself and a vibration that really makes me feel like at home right? Swimming pool, a gardener or maid, bills paid off, all that stuff. Energy efficient and feel peaceful when I walk in the home. Jenny wants a job all right, so we'll bless Jenny. We'll do that step, whatever it takes for her to get a job that she truly loves and enjoys that pays a lot of money, that's had to show up. New tires on the cars, repair exhaust. Have someone give me a home that they need to get rid of. I love it, learn about investments, pick a good one that feels good. Get out of debt and start getting five grand a month. My own website, get the home in order, use the formal area. So Christina is saying I can't see the baby steps. The only step that seems to give me what I wish for is winning the lottery. Okay, well, Christina, again, just put that you want to win the lottery. But sometimes when we're focusing on a big thing, again, remember last week we were talking about, if you want like $100,000 make sure you ask for $100, $1,000, $200, $20,000, like asked for all the amounts in-between. So Christina, what I would do is ask, what would it take for an extra grand to show up and just start there and ask for the big thing all at the same time, okay? All right, home with a fenced-in yard. Best selling book author, paying off my debt. No co-dependence, joyous, loving, creative, peaceful, laughter-filled. A safe home, yeah, how about that? Manifest happy, happy, money that makes babies like rabbits. She wants her money to make baby money. Okay, residual income off the internet, seven grand or more, 10 clients a month totaling six grand. These are great, so I'm curious, any of this stuff talking about money has it brought anything up for you guys? Because we're going to clear some stuff. So this is about money and sometimes it stirs up some things, so anything you guys have going on that prevents you from getting the big picture as well as the baby steps, all right, will you please, please, please, uncreate, delete and destroy all of it, okay? Any other thing that's blocking you guys from your future abundance, the big picture, financial, whatever the big picture for you guys, everything that is delete, destroy and uncreate all of it. Everywhere you guys are feeling a little insecure about manifesting the big picture, delete, uncreate and destroy it all. Focus on a couple of the baby steps for a minute you guys, I want to see what your energy does. Okay, so some people are kind of like, oh, they ain't going to happen either. Okay, everything that's preventing that from happening, delete, uncreate and destroy all of it. Okay, anything else attached to that, delete, uncreate and destroy all of it. Okay, everything preventing you from getting your life the way you absolutely truly desire it, delete, uncreate and destroy all of it. Okay, how are you guys feeling right now? Okay, we just got some choking in our throat. So any of you guys that have any weird thing going on in your body just send some energy to it, okay, and just think whatever this energy is, whatever it is delete, uncreate, and destroy it all now. Money is one of the weirdest things for people on this planet. We have so much energy attached to it. But all it is a means of exchange in the old days, right? Like if I grew corn and you had horses, I would take my corn and give you some corn and you give me a horse but then what happened is, maybe it's the wrong time of year for all the bartering. So because it's the wrong time of year for all the bartering, then they created money. So it's just a means of exchange, right? 'Cause maybe I need eggs at some other point, in the future, but at that point, I won't have any corn left, right, so then what do I do? So it just saves a lot of hassles with all the trading that's got to happen. So people are a little heavy. Yeah, okay, so anything else? Okay, any little pressure, any little heaviness still in your body? Okay, just think this is all my money crap and it's ready to go, okay, so all my stuff that has to do about money and manifesting, delete, uncreate and destroy all of it. Any other money crap, manifesting stuff, delete, destroy and uncreate it all. Everywhere you guys don't think there's enough time to manifest what you truly desire, delete, uncreate and destroy all of it. So what percentage of your finances do you guys have handled, 45% of you, 25% or less, 29? Okay, that's kind of about what the last group was too. All right, so we're going to have to work some more in handling your finances. And I'm curious about this one. Where are you guys at on the scale? 100% competent and manifesting? 75 to 100, 50 to 75, 25 to 50, one to 25? What do you guys feel about competence over manifesting? Capable of manifesting your life your way? This will be a cool poll to do. And then we're going to do this poll at the end and see what happens. That's kind of again pretty similar to the last group. Okay, so that's okay, we're all going to fix this. And I'm going to ask this one question too. How many of you have ever completed a vision board? A vision board, again, is just the picture of all the things that you wanted in your future. So it's just basically people like will either do it on their computer or do it on a piece of paper, where they rip out pictures and use words and they kind of focus on it so that they manifest their life. More people in this group it feels like have completed a vision board. Okay, now here's a different question, okay, watch this one. If yes, the people who answered yes, how often have you used it? If the answer is yes, that you have used a vision board, how often did you use it? Here's what they were. "I used it a few times and then I quit." And that's kind of actually pretty normal, okay, in my experience too with clients, but see, here's what's going to happen. This thing that we're plotting out for you guys, this was going to be the exact who, what, where, how and when, like, what's going to happen is, is you're going to take the statement, so you're going to say, I want a three bedroom home. Okay, so then you're going to take the energy statement and you're going to say, what would it take for me to get this home and have it show up pretty quickly and everything in the way of that, I delete it, uncreate it and destroy all of it. What would it take for an idea to pop in my head so I can get this new home. And so that's why we're doing this, okay? The reason the vision boards might not have worked for you before, if they didn't, or that you might not felt drawn to use them is because if you don't do the energy statements with it, then it's kind of like what the heck, because the more important thing in the whole thing is the energy. Like, here's an example of some things you could do. So take one of those things that you guys thought about that you wanted in your financial plot, all right, or even your life view, it doesn't matter. And I want you to just all think right now with me, what would it take for you to have that happen in your life? So if you asked for money in the bank, so what would it take for you to have the money in the bank that you asked for? And everything in the way of that, delete, uncreate and destroy it all? What would it take for you guys to have the home that you're looking for? And everything in the way that, delete, destroy and uncreate it all. What would it take for you guys to have the credit card debt paid off? Exactly how you want it, really quick and everything in the way of that, delete, destroy and uncreate it all. What would it take for you guys to manifest the right idea, the right thought, the right pattern, the right whatever, in order to create the idea or thought that brings a cash in for you. And everything in the way of that, delete, uncreate and destroy all of it. Everywhere you guys are procrastinating your future, delete, destroy and uncreate all of it. Yeah, so that's what you do, what would it take? And then you're going to do also another way to say remember, there's two ways you can do it. What would it take or you can say what vibrational energy. So we can do this one, what vibrational energy can you guys be to manifest the retirement security that you're seeking and everything in the way of that, delete, uncreate and destroy all of it. What would it take for you guys to manifest the retirement security that you're seeking, or the school funds that you're seeking and everything in the way of that, delete it, uncreate it and destroy it all. And I would just like pick one, like take a sticky note. Okay, I saw this friend of mine, I got in her car and she had a sticky note up on her dashboard and it had her little energy statement of the week that she was going to invite in. So it could be what would it take for me to generate whatever, an extra 200 bucks, so I can treat myself to a massage, right? Or it could be what would it take for me to generate an extra $1,000 to pay off my credit card bills. And that will be your little mantra while you're driving and every time you see it, or you can put it on your phone and you can set an alarm and have it go off every hour. Okay, so all of those things will work. So this is what you're to do all week. Start filling in your entire garden. There's other parts of the garden, right? Okay, so there's like career path and life purpose, everything you wish to do in life, that's kind of your bucket list, you know? If it's like go to Taiwan, if it's like jumping off a bungee bridge, if it's parachute jumping, whatever it is, put those wishlist things right there. Spirituality, connection to source, how you want your life to look like spiritually. One of the things I would put if I were you guys on that list is to know the truth about anything, okay? Like if you know truth about anything, it saves a lot of hassles in life. Self expression, intellectual, emotional and physical relationships, self and the relationship is with yourself, with your love mate, with your life mate, with your family and with others. Now, I'm going to go back to self expression. So I'm sorry, intellectual, what that means is, how you want to appear in the world and what you're learning. I'm always trying to practice or learn something new. Like right now, I'm learning guitar. Now do I completely totally suck at it, yes. I really do, but you know what, in six months, I'll be better. Emotional, what would it take for you guys to be emotionally balanced, always living at love, peace, joy, enlightenment, right? Physical, you express yourself through your physicality. So what do you want your physicality to look like? Do you want to look hot, sexy and feel good about yourself? No, I don't think that weight has anything to do with how hot and sexy you feel. We've all seen the voluptuous, gorgeous woman, who feels completely and totally at peace with herself, who just kind of shows up in the world. But I would agree that you should probably work out to take care of your body so that it's generally healthy. So self expression, how do you want to appear in the world, to yourself and to others? so you can start filling in those things. Now, just keep it kind of simple. Just take one page, maybe one page a day for a little while, finance is the material world and just write down what you want and then write a couple of baby steps right next to it, okay? Career and life path and life purpose, write down what you want and a couple of little baby steps that you can take to get to it. So start filling in your entire garden. Do the what would it take concept on your financial abundance? So all the things that you're writing in your financial abundance, just start going, what would it take for this to show up in my life? And then say the energy statements all week that, if there's anything negative in your life, just say everything creating this energy, I delete it, uncreate it and destroy it all for lower dense energies? And ask is this true? Truth is light, lies are heavy. Self care for your body, good nutrition is important. Vitamins and minerals keep the energy up. Minerals are crystalline and allow all the energy to flow. Drink water, it's a conductor of energy. Get rest, processing can happen overnight. If old emotions are passing, uncreate them and you can always try the Bach Remedies if you're feeling a little moody. So let's all applaud yourself. Thanks for like really being great to yourself and showing up and do as much as you can. And if it's a little overwhelming just start with the basics. Just work on your financial plot just a little bit and do a little sticky note on the dashboard of your car or the alarm on your phone, okay? And say a couple of energy statements. Day six and we're going to work on the financial wealth guard and some more. Love you all, many, many blessings, all right, bye.

====================

LESSON 5: Clearing Fear of Growth (Clearing Session Only)

We're going to start by connecting to the light, so close your eyes, look up, see or sense the light, and allow this light and love to just come right in. So take your energy up about 300 feet and allow the light to just shine right into your head, right into your third eye, right into your ears, right into your throat, right into your chest. Okay, right down your arms, right into your torso, right into your stomach, right into your hips. Some people it'll feel like a light beam coming in you and some people it'll feel like liquid light. So whichever way it comes in for you is perfect. Okay, allow it to come into your thighs, your knees, your feet. Just think I'm open to receiving this much source energy and this much love. I am open to receiving source energy and love. Okay, and then let this light go into the center of the planet where there's another space, so as above and so below, there's another space that feels like pure source energy in the middle of the planet, feels totally happy and welcoming, like, whew, I am so glad you're here. Yeah, all right, and then let that light... Kind of bounce back up like a mini trampoline and just bounce right back up your feet, your calves, your thighs, your hips, and into your heart, radiating out 360 degrees all the way around you. Okay, so this light that's radiating out, so you're in a big bubble of love and light from above and below. And this big bubble of love and light wants to expand out past the building you're in. past the city you're in, expand out. Just imagine this big bubble of love goes past the state you're in, past the country you're in, and past the earth until you're connected all the way around the earth, being the infinite being that you truly are. All right, you guys are doing great. All right. So let's play. This is all playtime. It's all fun. It's all play. It's just checking in. Imagine if you can, there's a little pathway. Okay, and allow that pathway to show up how it shows up for you. So it could be a little grass pathway. It could be a little mossy. It could be a little rocky. But follow this pathway up until you get to the top of the hill. It's probably about 30, 40 feet. So just keep walking. The path just feels kind of nice. All right. And once you get to the top of the hill, I want you to notice in front of you a garden. And this garden can be any shape. It can be like a cactus garden, or it could be a cornfield, or it could be a rose garden, whatever your garden is. But this is your present time abundance garden. Your present time abundance garden. And I want you to walk over to it and just gently notice whatever it is that you are drawn to. Like it could be something, a weed that you want to pull out. It could be a bush. It could be a tree. It could be something that you want to cut or burn or get rid of. Wherever you go, just notice what it is. And then say to that object, what do you represent in my current wealth garden, abundance garden? What do you represent in my current abundance garden? It could be credit cards. It could be money. It could be anything. It could be your job, career, how you love yourself. And once you get the answer, what do you represent to me? Then the next thing is, is I would love it. If you ask, how can I change you? And then whatever it says, like cut it off, burn it off, anything, just change it. Okay, you guys are doing great. All right, so now take your time and just kind of notice something else that draws your attention. So is there anything else that feels like it kind of needs a little look at? So go to that section and look at that and ask, what do you represent in my life? What part of my abundance garden do you represent in my life? Okay, and ask, what do I need to do to change you? What do I need to do to change you? Okay, and then when you're ready, just notice any other thing in your wealth garden that you're drawn to, your abundance garden. Okay, and ask, what do you represent in my life? And what do I need to do to change you? Okay, so just take that information with no judgment, okay? You're not going to judge yourself because we're going to change everything, all right? And now let's go take a look at your future garden. So kind of look around. There should be another path. And follow that path up until you get to the next little hill. So again, it's about 30, 40 feet away from you. And just travel that up until you get to the next hill. Okay, great. Now, what does this garden look like? Notice your future abundance garden. Should be happier in some way for you. All right, so notice one thing in this garden. And just wherever you're drawn, just go to it. And then ask, what do you represent in my life? And what steps can I take to get you? What steps can I take to get you? And now... Notice any other object in this garden that you're drawn to and walk over to it and say, what do you represent in my life and how do I get you? And just notice one more thing in your abundance garden and ask, what do you represent for me and how can I get you? And when you're ready, when you feel complete, just kind of gently open your eyes and on your piece of paper, in your journal, whatever you have in front of you, just take some notes. And just ask yourself some of the following questions. What did your first garden look like? And was there anybody with you? What kind of garden was it? You know, was it vegetables? Was it dry, barren land? Was it rocky? Did it have, like, some potholes in it? Did it have tons of weeds? And how were you feeling in this garden? And then any insights that you received when you asked how can you change it? And the next one, what did it change into in your future garden? How was this different? So basically, were you with anyone? What did it look like? What kind of garden was it? What steps did you need to take to get to this garden? And how did you feel in this garden? Share some of the things that you guys received. What does a tree of life represent? So just ask yourself. Everybody's interpretation of things is usually personal. So Ilum, what does a tree of life represent to you? So Tara found out she needs to water her current garden. Dante, the future garden was hazy, so we're going to work on getting it more clear. First garden was weeded, organized, and full of sprouting trees, so you're probably planting some new things. So Ilum, maybe you're anchoring some new tree of life in your life, right? Maybe it's anchoring things from you. Marsha was like, I thought the garden was yours. Sharika saw that the willow tree represented a healthy pregnant lady. So Bill's saying he's frustrated because he couldn't imagine a garden. As I had to ask the garden to respond, I went blank. Okay, so Bill, so any block that you have for seeing, knowing, or believing that this could work at any level for you, will you please, please, please delete, uncreate, and destroy it all? Here's just your subconscious mind kind of blocking you a little bit, so you have a few beliefs that say, I can't move forward somehow, and I can't do things right. So those are the couple ones you're going to have to work on for a couple weeks, like everywhere you don't feel like you can do things right, or everywhere you don't think you can get ahead, or everywhere you don't think you can perceive and know everything. Delete all those. So those are your clearing statements for a couple weeks, and then you'll be able to do it. So it's good that this came up, Bill, okay? So it's just a block, and it can easily be released. So I understand you're feeling frustrated, but it was just your subconscious just showing you what your next step is, which is to clear this, okay? So it's perfect, even though it doesn't feel perfect in the minute. I get it. I love the garden. It was fun. The first garden had some dry grass and bare spots, empty of people. Second one was lush, had a man in it. Water flowed and was told to plant more seeds. The weed of doubt became a blossoming flower. Happy. First one was overgrown full of weeds. The future one was vast and lush and far, but couldn't work out what it was telling me. Well, it's probably that it was infinite, unlimited. Plant what you want. Let's see. The first garden had a few clumps and she burnt them. And felt like then she needed to exercise and be an extrovert. Saw a hose in the future garden. She checked the hose for any kinks. And it was a very beautiful garden. Nancy had some barren patches. Sweet smelling. I felt trapped and bad. So Roz basically met her childhood self, age four, and she promised to nurture her and get good advice from her. So yeah, so it's probably just some part of you that needed help. So these are all amazing. Now what we're going to do is we're going to just do some clearings. And even those that may not have gotten, you know, are a little frustrated because you didn't get anything, you're going to clear with us too, okay? So you did it right because it just showed up whatever was next for you. So all the things that are creating anything negative that you really didn't want to see in the first garden. Okay, so all the things behind the scenes subconsciously that you didn't prefer or like or appreciate in the first garden, will you please, please, please uncreate, delete, and de -story it all. Okay, everywhere you're blocked on getting to your new future, Delete, uncreate, and destroy it all now. Anywhere you had some weeds that needed pulled, anything creating those weeds, delete, uncreate, and destroy it all now. Everywhere you had some barren patches that needed fixed, everything that's creating those barren patches, delete, uncreate, and destroy them all now. Everywhere you feel a little unkind to yourself because you kind of noticed what was needed, so anyone who's feeling a little badly about anything, delete, uncreate, and de -story all that now. Any other thing that needs to go that's inhibiting you and locking you down from going to the next garden, will you please uncreate, delete, and de -story it all now? Okay, that was a big one. Okay, everywhere you guys don't feel like you have the proper guidance to get you to the next step, will you please uncreate, delete, and destroy it all now. Any other place where you feel a lot has gone on in your life that won't let you go to the next step, like so you're letting history dictate your future, delete, uncreate, and destroy it all now. Okay, any other subconscious thing that's fighting you from knowing your future, being your future, and having your future, and have it be abundant, healthy, wealthy, and wise. Delete, uncreate, and destroy it all now. Everywhere you guys feel anxious or afraid or ashamed or guilt or fear about anything that you uncovered in your garden and anything we uncovered in your subconscious, right, that didn't maybe let you get to your garden. All those things, delete, uncreate, and de -story them all now. Okay, any other place that you guys feel I hear like a victim that you can't change your future? Delete, uncreate, and de -story it all now. So we are going to go to the next section where we're going to design your future garden. Okay, so we just kind of allowed your future garden to pop up. But you're going to have to plant some seeds in the future, right, in order to create your future garden. Now, some of you may or may not have heard of things called a vision board. What a vision board is, is a vision board is what sometimes people will do to kind of like map out with pictures, thoughts, and words what they want their future to look like. And so what we're going to do is we have these garden plots. that we're basically going to fill in that are going to be your future garden. Okay, so we're plotting your future life, okay? And in each garden plot, we're going to put what we see in the next part of your life, all right? So let's do the first, we're going to lay out how you want your future, and then this will give you the next level of clearing that we're going to do, right? Because if we don't know what your future is specifically because you haven't created it, then we don't really know what to get out of the way, okay? So the very first thing that we're going to work on is what I call your life view. So here's what your life view is. So your life view is the way you desire to look at the world. So I gave a few examples, but I want you guys to really think about this for yourself and really be creative, okay? I want you to jot down three ways. that you desire to look at the world. One of them could be to live my life as if everything is a blessing or to live my life as if I am a gift to the world, right? So what if you loved yourself so much that you knew you were a gift to the world? You could do it to stop complaining and take more action to see something good in everything, to live as if there is no tomorrow, which means to live so presently that only the good stuff shows up, right? So jot down the three ways you desire to have in your life view plot how you're going to look at the world, all right? And then jot them down and type them in at the same time to me, whatever. Basically be your ADD self and multitask. Because maybe what you wrote down will inspire somebody else. So what's one thing? Thank you, Heather. Sources around me at all times. That's one way she desires to look at the world. The world is safe and happy place. Living a loving and abundant life. Just ask and it's given. View the world as fun every day. Hey, remember the last time there was an inspiring story where somebody said she wanted $100 bills to show up in her life, right? Well, that's like a life view, right? Patricia, to always feel inspired. Be grateful for everyone and everything. Hopeful, enthusiastic, and gracious. I react in powerful and positive ways that empower me and those around me. No judgment. To command, it is all at my command. No fear. Get paid for being me. Connected to source at all times. Knowing that I am one with source. Total abundance. Gratitude and joy for being given the gift of life. To always see the possibilities. Oh, that's a good one. Seeing what's possible and everything, right? To accomplish my desires. Totally surrender and align with source. Yes. That only good can come from this experience right now. To live glory in the moment. See the whole world. As a whole and connected. To live without fear. Fearless. Healing powers activated. The world is comforting. To see abundance in everything. View material abundance flowing in my life. Live with purpose and value. Master my life with joy and love. Awesome relationship with my inner child. Feel life unhampered. With knowledge that I will not always be a struggle. Okay, all is in the flow. Infinite joy. Life is effortless. All right, these are all excellent, excellent. So thanks, you guys. These are awesome. Confidence. Fearless, choose love, and be brave. Cool. Okay, so now here's the next one that we're going to fill in in your life plot or your garden plot. Your love view. Remember that was over to the left? So jot down three ways you wish to share love in the world. Some example, bless yourself every day. Bless everybody every day, right? Volunteer. Patience with your family. So what are some ways? So type some in and write them down in your journal. Three ways you wish to share love in the world. Because how you love is basically the underlying feeling that will generate your future. Okay? So how you feel will generate your future. Calm and patient with everybody. Don't forget to be kind to myself and get some happy time. I like it. Happy time to herself. Having a healing clinic that heals everyone that comes. Laugh, receive, be authentic. Helping others believe in themselves by example. Without limitation. Full out. I love that. And limitless. Available for my kids and grandkids. Blessing ball of light for the whole planet. Random acts of kindness. Making others feel happy and uplifted when I am around them. Inspire youth to be their best. Be a transmitter of universal love. Have a magic wand that heals everybody. Dance with others. Sing every day. Be in joy and laughing each day. I love that. Allow others to be what they are, even if it's not what you'd like. See love in everything. Cherish myself. That there are actually practical solutions for every problem, which is totally true. There are solutions for every problem. Be balanced by filling myself up first so I can raise everybody's vibe. Don't judge others. Know that everyone has their own things going on. And don't get offended. Volunteer at orphanages. Facilitate healing. Give fun. Keep my own energy clean and clear. I love all that. Get out of my head and into my heart. Be the source of love. Be inspiring and heartwarming. acceptance, compassion, raise my vibe, meditate more, play more. I am a shiny, fun, generous, powerful, light fairy sharing my gifts with all that want them and to enjoy the pleasure of others and see beauty and love everywhere. I love it. It'd be cool if you guys could come up with a powerful one that feels really juicy that you totally love saying about yourself every day. All right. Cool. And love others enough to let them learn their own life lessons and consequences. So that's like total allowance, right? Let people be and let them figure it out. Okay. And to teach. So you guys are awesome. All right. These are all great. This is a really great way to look at the world and love people and yourself. Okay. So now we're going to work on the next one. And this is the one that my last group, they had a little bit of energy on. So this is good. If you have energy on it, we can clear it. So I'm going to try to be a little more specific. So on that plot that's going to be your garden, you have your finances and material world abundance plot. Okay, so this is your little place in the garden. Okay, so imagine it's your garden. And there's two ways we're going to do this, okay? Because ultimately what we want for you is to get everything you want, right? But the second thing that we want for you is we want, you know, your next two or three steps to show up in your world, okay? So like there's this big picture blueprint that we want in your life, but we also want, you know, the smaller things. So for instance, if you said, I want to get out of debt, okay? And maybe your debt is like five grand. What if it's okay to write the total thing that you want, debt -free lifestyle, right? But also it's okay to write down the second part of that, which is, you know, it's okay. for my first $100 to show up to pay off my debt. And it's okay for my next $1 ,000 to show up to pay off my debt. Okay? So we're going to have like literally on your piece of paper, you're going to have two lists that you're going to get started with. All right? I want you to just kind of jot down without thinking too much. Just kind of allow it to pop up in your head to jot down. the material needs that you require for your abundant, financially secure, loving, comfortable financial world. So if you want a home, be a little more specific. So there's two things that happen. So if you want a three -bedroom, say I want a three -bedroom home that's comfortable. When I walk into it, it feels like love to me. Me and my family can easily and effortlessly receive it. and afford it and it's tastefully furnished in a way that makes me happy. So you don't have to know specifically that the bedroom is painted, you know, whatever tan, right? Or the bathroom's painted blue. You don't have to know that specifically because what if you find a house that has a better color scheme than what you're currently thinking of, okay? So just kind of fill in the general what you want. with the over -lighting feeling of being completely and totally happy that you have it. And then next to that, write down a couple little baby steps that you could take that could help you move towards that. So it might be calling up a realtor and looking at a couple houses. Or it could be... Basically asking your boss for a raise so that later on eventually you could afford it. Whatever your happy next step is that kind of pops up in your head, write that down too. Autos. If you know for sure that you want an SUV, put SUV, kind of the color that you can easily afford. If you know the price, put the price. And then let's just say somebody is out there asking for a Learjet, but currently you only make a hundred grand. Okay. Now let's just say, put down whatever one of the baby steps is that would help you get the Learjet. Okay. And it's okay to put the Learjet down because maybe you have a friend or you meet a new friend. Like I have lots of friends with Learjets actually. So I get rides places pretty frequently. So now isn't that cool? I don't actually have to pay for one myself. So I just get to go with them and I don't have to pay for it. Which completely and totally works for me, by the way. You can write those things down. Your adventure fund, your philanthropy fund. A lot of people want to make a lot of money so that they can help people. So whatever that is for you. You know, if you need school and training for yourself or your kids, put that in. Retirement, like how much do you need to retire in order to generate X amount of dollars? How much cash do you want to have on hand? How much do you need or really need for your clothes and all those kind of things? So whatever you require. Okay, so just share with me a couple things that you guys are thinking about. So energetically bring in and receive money. The home I have seen and the loan to buy it for and the loan to be paid up as soon as possible. My dream home in Sausalita. The mega lottery with 50 million or more. Buy lottery tickets. That's her little baby step. Tara says it's so neat that she's writing this down. It's like having a little contract with herself. Well, yeah, if you don't think about it, you know what I mean? It's easier to what you put energy in is going to magnetize more things to you. 15K a month. Sarah is saying this is overwhelming to me to do it all at once. Well, just pick a couple things, Sarah. So I just put a couple things to kind of trigger you. See, what you're going to do is we're starting on this, but you're going to do this a little bit on your own over the next couple of days. So I'm glad you wrote that, by the way. So just start with what you can start. So just think overall, Sarah, and anybody who's a little confused, like how do you generally want your life to be? So I'll give you an example. At one time in my life, I actually had three homes, okay? But do you know what I had to do? I had to like take care of the three homes. I had people taking, I had to then take care of extra people. There was extra money to be spent on the home. So currently, for instance, I only have one home. It's a nice home. It's not a huge home because truthfully, I don't want to take care of that stuff anymore, okay? So that's just where I'm at right now. Now, if you, for instance, want a really big home and you want to, you know, do all those kind of things, then for sure write it down. Because at that time when I had the three homes, I was completely and totally joyful that I had them and I was grateful and I loved it and I loved decorating and I loved all that stuff. And then what happened, at some point I actually didn't really like it as much and then I just simplified my life, okay? So it didn't mean that the first part of it was wrong and the second part of it was more right. It just means that my energy changed, okay? So whatever it is for you, whatever your lifestyle is, so just get a picture in your head. I mean, do you want to live a big life? Do you want to live a more simplistic life? You know, whatever makes you totally thrilled and happy, okay? See, this is all about you. So people are putting to earn more money, remodify a home loan. I love this. So this is a little baby step, right? Remodify the home loan to $2 ,500 a month. At 4 % loan fixed. Okay, so that's like a very solid goal. $100 ,000 tax -free passive income per month. So that's her big one. So Caroline's going to have to like put that down into a smaller little baby step somewhere, right? So you can have both. Minimum $4K a month. Car that's energy efficient. To buy a weekend house on the sea. Manifest a buyer for my home in Hawaii for top dollar that is both fair to the buyer and seller. I've seen a lot of people, when they really focus on things, I knew this chick, she wanted to buy an investment property, and she found this little old lady, somehow randomly, her realtor did, who sold her a house that was worth, I don't know, let's just say half a million for like $350. Good things like that can happen. Let's see, a secretary, an editor, a camera person, a limo, a motorcycle, a Learjet, $10 million. A beautiful house. Sarah thanked me for all her baby steps. Let's see. Always have more than enough cash available every day of my life so that I never need to worry about money. Three -bedroom home in New Jersey. The best location for me to call home. So Marie, you're going to have to have that as one of your energy statements this week. What would it take for me to figure out where I truly want to live that I'd be totally happy with loving friends, kindness to myself, and a vibration that really makes me feel like at home, right? Swimming pool gardener, maid, bills paid off, all that stuff. Energy efficient and feel peaceful when I walk in the home. Jenny wants a job. All right, so we'll bless Jenny. We'll just ask that whatever it takes for her to get a job that she truly and truly loves and enjoys that pays her a lot of money, ask that to show up. New tires on the cars. Pair exhaust. Have someone help give me a home that they need to get rid of. I love it. Learn about investments. Pick a good one that feels good. Get out of debt and start getting five grand a month. My own website. Get the home in order. Use the formal area. So Christina is saying, I can't see the baby steps. The only step that seems to give me what I wish for is winning the lottery. Okay, well, Christina, again, just put that you want to win the lottery. But sometimes when we're focusing on a big thing, you know, again, remember last week we were talking about if you want like $100 ,000, Make sure you ask for $100, $1 ,000, $200, $20 ,000. Like, ask for all the amounts in between. So, Christina, what I would do is ask, what would it take for an extra grand to show up? And just start there and ask for the big thing all at the same time. Okay? All right. Home with a fenced -in yard. Best -selling book author. Paying off my debt. No codependence. Joyous, loving, creative, peaceful, laughter -filled. A safe home. Yeah, how about that? Manifest happy, happy money that makes babies like rabbits. She wants her money to make baby money. Okay, residual income off the internet, seven grand or more. Ten clients a month totaling six grand. These are great. So I'm curious, is any of this stuff talking about money, has it brought anything up for you guys? Because we're going to clear some stuff. So this is about money, and sometimes it stirs up something. So anything you guys have going on that prevents you from getting the big picture as well as the baby steps, all right, will you please, please, please uncreate, delete, and de -story all of it? Okay, any other thing that's blocking you guys from your future abundance, the big picture, financial, whatever, the big picture for you guys, everything that is, delete, de -story, and uncreate all of it. Everywhere you guys are feeling a little insecure about manifesting the big picture, delete, uncreate, and de -story it all. Focus on a couple of the baby steps for a minute, you guys. I want to see what your energy does. Okay, so some people are kind of like, oh, they ain't going to happen either. Okay, everything that's preventing that from happening, delete, uncreate, and de -story all of it. Okay, anything else attached to that? Delete, uncreate, and destroy all of it. Okay, everything preventing you from getting your life the way you absolutely truly desire it. Delete, uncreate, and destroy all of it. Okay, how are you guys feeling right now? Okay, Rita's got some choking in her throat. So any of you guys that have any weird thing going on in your body, just send some energy to it. Okay, and just think whatever this energy is, whatever it is, delete, uncreate, and de -story it all now. Money is one of the weirdest things for people on this planet. We have so much energy attached to it, but all it is is a means of exchange. In the old days, right, like if I grew corn and you had horses, I would take my corn and give you some corn and you'd give me a horse. But then what happened is maybe it's the wrong time of year for all the bartering. So because it's the wrong time of year for all the bartering, then they created money, so it's just a means of exchange, right? Because maybe I need eggs at some other point, you know, in the future, but at that point I won't have any corn left, right? So then what do I do? So it just saves a lot of hassles with all the trading that's got to happen. So people are a little heavy. Yeah, okay, so anything else? Okay, any little pressure, any little heaviness still in your body? Okay, just think this is all my money crap and it's ready to go. Okay, so all my stuff that has to do about money and manifesting. Delete, uncreate, and de -story all of it. Any other money crap, manifesting stuff, delete, de -story, and uncreate it all. Everywhere you guys aren't, don't think there's enough time to manifest what you truly desire. Delete, uncreate, and de -story all of it. So what percentage of your finances do you guys have handled? 45 % of you. 25 % or less, 29%. Okay, that's kind of about what the last group was too. All right, so we're going to have to work some more on handling your finances. And I'm curious about this one. Where are you guys at on the scale? 100 % competent in manifesting, 75 to 100, 50 to 75, 25 to 50, 1 to 25. Where do you guys feel about competence over manifesting, capable of manifesting your life, your way? This will be a cool poll to do. And then we're going to do this poll at the end and see what happens. That's kind of, again, pretty similar to the last group. Okay, so that's okay. We're all going to fix this. And I'm going to ask this one question too. How many of you have ever completed a vision board? A vision board, again, is just the picture of all the things that you wanted in your future. So it's just basically people like will either do it on their computer or do it on a piece of paper where they rip out pictures and use words and they kind of focus on it so that they manifest their life. More people in this group feels like have completed a vision board. Okay, now here's a different question. Okay, watch this one. If yes, the people answered yes, how often have you used it? If the answer was yes, that you have used a vision board. How often did you use it? Here's what they were. I used it a few times and then I quit. And that's kind of actually pretty normal, okay, in my experience too with clients. But see, here's what's going to happen. This thing that we're plotting up for you guys, this is going to be the exact who, what, where, how, and when. Like what's going to happen is you're going to take the statement. So you're going to say, I want a three -bedroom home, okay? So then you're going to take the energy statement. And you're going to say, what would it take for me to get this home and have it show up pretty quickly? And everything in the way of that, I delete it, uncreate it, and de -story all of it. What would it take for an idea to pop in my head so I can get this new home? And so that's why we're doing this, okay? The reason the vision boards might not have worked for you before, if they didn't, or that you might not felt drawn to use them, is because if you don't do the energy statements with it, then it's kind of like, what the heck? Because the more important thing in the whole thing is the energy. Like here's an example of some things you could do. So take one of those things that you guys thought about that you wanted in your financial plot, all right? Or even your life view, it doesn't matter. And I want you to just all think right now with me, what would it take for you to have that happen in your life? So if you ask for money in the bank, so what would it take for you to have the money in the bank that you asked for? Everything in the way of that, delete, uncreate it, and destroy it all. What would it take for you guys to have the home that you're looking for? And everything in the way of that, delete, destroy, and uncreate it all. What would it take for you guys to have the credit card debt paid off exactly how you want it, really quick? And everything in the way of that, delete, destroy, and uncreate it all. What would it take for you guys to manifest the right idea, the right thought, the right pattern, the right whatever? in order to create the idea or thought that brings a cash in for you. And everything in the way of that, delete, uncreate, and de -story all of it. Everywhere you guys are procrastinating your future, delete, de -story, and uncreate all of it. Yeah, so that's what you do. What would it take? And then you're going to do also another way to say, remember, there's two ways you can do it. What would it take? Or you can say what vibrational energy. So we can do this one. What vibrational energy can you guys be to manifest the retirement security that you're seeking? And everything in the way of that, delete, uncreate, and destroy all of it. What would it take for you guys to manifest the retirement security that you're seeking? or the school fund that you're seeking and everything in the way of that, delete it, uncreate it, and de -story it all. And I would just, like, pick one. Like take a sticky note, okay? I saw this friend of mine, I got in her car and she had a sticky note up on her dashboard and it had her little energy statement of the week that she was going to invite in. So it could be, what would it take for me to generate whatever, an extra 200 bucks so I can treat myself to a massage, right? Or it could be, what would it take for me to generate an extra $1 ,000 to pay off my credit card bills? And that will be your little mantra while you're driving and every time you see it. Or you can put it on your phone and you can set an alarm and have it go off every hour. Okay, so all of those things will work. So this is what you're to do all week. Start filling in your entire garden. There's other parts of the garden, right? Okay, so there's the career path and life purpose. Everything you wish to do in life, that's kind of your bucket list. If it's like go to Taiwan, if it's like jumping off a bungee bridge, if it's parachute jumping, whatever it is, put those wish list things right there. Spirituality, connection to source, how you want your life to look like spiritually. One of the things I would put if I were you guys on that list is to know the truth about anything. If you know the truth about anything, it saves a lot of hassles in life. Self -expression, intellectual, emotional, and physical. Relationships, self. And the relationship is with yourself, with your love mate, with your life mate, with your family, and with others. Now, I'm going to go back to self -expression. So I'm sorry. Intellectual, what that means is how you want to appear in the world and what you're learning. I'm always trying to practice or learn something new. Like right now, I'm learning guitar. Now, do I completely and totally suck at it? Yes. I really do. But you know what? In six months, I'll be better. Emotional. What would it take for you guys to be emotionally balanced, always living at love, peace, joy, enlightenment, right? Physical. You express yourself through your physicality. So what do you want your physicality to look like? Do you want to look hot, sexy, and feel good about yourself? Now, I don't think that weight has anything to do with how hot and sexy you feel. We've all seen the voluptuous, gorgeous woman who feels completely and totally at peace with herself, who just kind of shows up in the world. But I would agree that you should probably work out to take care of your body so that it's generally healthy, okay? So self -expression, how do you want to appear in the world? To yourself and to others. So you can start filling in those things. Now just keep it kind of simple. Just take one page, maybe one page a day for a little while. Finance is a material world and just write down what you want and then write a couple baby steps right next to it. Okay, career and life path and life purpose. Write down what you want and a couple little baby steps that you can take to get to it. So start filling in your entire garden. Do the what would it take. Concept on your financial abundance. So all the things that you're writing in your financial abundance, just start going, what would it take for this to show up in my life? And then say the energy statements all week that if there's anything negative in your life, just say everything creating this energy, I delete it, uncreate it, and de -story it all for lower dense energies. And ask, is this true? Truth is light. Lies are heavy. Self -care for your body. Good nutrition is important. Vitamins and minerals keep the energy up. Minerals are crystalline and allow all the energy to flow. Drink water. It's a conductor of energy. Get rest. Processing can happen overnight. If old emotions are passing, uncreate them, and you can always try the Bach remedies if you're feeling a little moody. So let's all applaud yourself. Thanks for like really being great to yourself and showing up and do as much as you can. And if it's a little overwhelming, just start with the basics. Just work on your financial plot just a little bit and do a little sticky note on the dashboard of your car or the alarm on your phone. Okay, and say a couple energy statements. Day six, and we're going to work on the financial wealth garden some more. Love you all. Many, many blessings. All right. Bye. Please continue to the next unlimited abundance journey session. 

====================

LESSON 6: Clearing Fear of Success

- Hey, this is Christie Marie Sheldon, and you're listening to a recording I did of a series of 24 live group sessions on Clearing Your Abundance Blocks. And here's what we're going to cover in this session. Session number six. We're going to continue focusing on our garden today, and we're going to cover some new ground. We're going to focus on your career path and your life purpose. And I'm going to define for you what I would consider a life purpose, because I think people get a little stymied here, what I think a true life purpose is, is that which makes you happy. If we go from the whole Truth with a capital T, the real purpose for us living here is to express our joy and happiness, to be so full of life that everybody around us can feel it. And the next focus in our Garden Exercise is going to be our connection to source our spirituality. Abundance comes in all forms, including our connection to source. So we're going to figure out what you require and need to clear to be completely and totally connected to the big power source, let's begin. Hey there, how are you guys? I am so happy to be here. We're going to work some more on your Wealth Garden today. So these were the plots that we've worked on. We worked on jotting down three ways that you desire to look at the world yourself, your life view plot, how you look at life and to live life as it's, everything's a blessing to stop complaining would be a good one. You could live life to see something good and everything to live as if there's no tomorrow, which means totally present. Then we went through your Love You Plot, right? Where you dotted down three ways that you wish to share love in the world. And that could be blessing yourself every day, volunteering, practicing patience with your family. Any of those things are notable. And again, this is your wealth garden. So whatever energy that is your next phase to embody in your life, that's what you should put here. Okay, all right. And then as part of the practice, remember, this is all about being actionable and taking action. So on each of these plots, you know, make it practical, like bless yourself every day. That's something you can do, volunteer, maybe you say volunteer twice a month, patience with your family, well, what action would that be? That might be like, not yelling at Joey when he pulls his sister hair or something, I don't know, but you know what I mean, right? So make it actionable. The second part of that is really do the energy statements of what would it take for me to be blessed every day. What would it take for me to have plenty of time, money and freedom to volunteer twice a month? What would it take for me to have infinite patience for my family and give them what they truly truly need for me? Right, so what would it take, would help anchor this into your whole life basically and give you some new awareness of how you can apply it. And then we went to the next one. Now this was a doozy, I just like, kind of threw you guys in here, finances and material, world abundance, garden plot. And I had you guys just start jotting down some things about what you require for your lifestyle and home autos, personal effects, cash on hand, retirement, schooling. All those things would fit in here. Now, some people were asking me a question last time. They said that I wasn't very clear for some reason about what a vision board is. And so I kind of mocked a little bit of one up, a vision board though, is very, very, very personal. All of these things that you want in the abundance plot of your finances, you basically take pictures of what it is that you truly want and desire. And again, you can do them on the computer, you can do it on a little notebook that you keep by your bed and you look at every night before you go to bed, you could put it on your computer screen, when you get all done with it, take a photo, and then you always have it with you. But basically what you do is like, let's just say I was manifesting a home. If I was manifesting a home, basically what I would do is I'd get a picture of, let's just say a cozy room in the home or a picture of the overall home. And then I put some general things, because again, as we referenced in the one example, the universe told her did not get new clothes, but then she did get some clothes, right? Had she said new clothes, when she was saying new clothes, it blocked her. But when she said, what would it take to get some clothes, them she got him for a price that she could easily and effortlessly afford. And that was gorgeous for her. I'm sure she bought clothes that she totally loved. Basically in this section, you just write, something general, like I want three bedrooms, two bathrooms, a pool, and a garden with a little bit of view. Or you could say a pool and a, I may want to have a fence around it. So I have total privacy, or I just want a condo because I want to take all my money and I want to go travel around the world, right? So whatever your thing is, it doesn't matter what anybody else wants. It's what you want, what's fits your lifestyle, and then put quality that kind of fill in maybe the blank things that you don't know yet, because if I had a home, what I'd want is it feels warm, it feels cozy. When people walk in my door, one of the first things they say is, oh, it feels so good here, right? And the trick to that by the way is blessing your home, okay? So I feel my home was so much love that everybody who walks in feels blessed. So that's like my little blessing that I do. And now some of you are going to go, this is really interesting. So I live in a place where, as some of us know, the economy has gone a little to crap, but what's really interesting is whenever I buy something, I always ask, will it make me profit? Because I don't really want to buy things that take away, now profit can be money, but it can also be energy 'cause I don't want to have things in my life that drain me or take anything away from my energy and so I would put on a lot of these things that whatever you do that, it feels warm and cozy, loving, but it also makes you profit in some way. My house completely and totally makes me profit because it keeps me safe, it makes me feel a little anchored. It's not like so big or time consuming or expensive, meaning I don't have to spend my life like taking care of it. So I bought the perfect size for me so that it gives to me like the house is a gift and it gives to me, right? If you have families, you can put things like in the school district or near work, everybody who walks in loves my home, any of those things. So whatever words trigger the energy for you about what your home would be like. Now regarding money, 'cause of the finances and material world, right? So regarding money, you put it like a picture of something that's kind of inspiring to you. And then you put some words and qualities around what you want, just X amount of dollars of income every month, a certain amount in savings, retirement, school. And again, it's about taking action, right? So you can put in this section, you can put, I take massive action and have a plan to follow whatever the action step is. Like, maybe the action step is finding a financial analyst who will help you figure out the numbers, so you can get to your goal. And maybe your action step is I'm going to do that within the next two weeks. The next picture would just be that you want to travel, right? And you need some money for travel. So in order to need money for travel, you just could put, I create enough funding to live happily and have four adventures a year, or I create enough money to retire by the age of 45 or whatever your thing is, all right. And then if you want, and again, it's totally personal, but I would do this just so it kind of anchors it in for you. I would put something here that just says, action, steps and dates to follow through, so maybe you decide by the end of this week that you're going to just go through the financial, like, add everything up and figure out how much it costs to live. You wouldn't believe how many people, when they finally add up how much it costs to live, realize that every month they're spending five to a thousand dollars more than what they actually bring in, right? And so sometimes it's helpful to just know what your numbers are. Find a financial analyst, ask for a raise, right? And then on your vision board, you can take, what would it take for me to, and then do all the fill in the blanks, like your house and your, what would it take for me to manifest the perfect house for me and my family? What vibration could I be to manifest, the perfect home that matches all these qualities for my family? What profitable adventures could I create to come my way? What would it take for life and money to be easy? What would it take for my happy home to manifest? I'm going to ask you to just stretch a little, okay? Remember what I said when I first started manifesting, I just asked for everything and I didn't really care. I thought, you know what, if I get 50% of it, I'm really happy because the whole truth is if you're asking for an extra 20 grand, like, I know our friends here, she had asked for 10 grand or more, right? And when she did that, literally within one day she manifested 20 grand, okay? But maybe if she wouldn't have asked, maybe she wouldn't have gotten it, like who knows somebody Mobashir. I'm sure, I just didn't say the name right. But he said, what did we call it an inspired step? I love it, love it, love it. And Bazell was asking any website that you could recommend to do it on the computer? Honestly, I just use PowerPoint, okay? So all of my stuff is on PowerPoint or sometimes I use the Apple program pages and I just draw it out for myself. And then I just have them in a little notebook by my bed. And I look at them every night and do some energy stuff on them. So now we're going to go to the next ones. We are going to work on the career path and life purpose. And I am going to define for you what I consider a life purpose, 'cause I think life purpose, I think actually gets people a little stymied and a little frustrated and a little overwhelmed. And I want to take all that, overwhelm and stuff away from you because what I think a life purpose is is that which makes you happy. So if we go from the whole truth, and this is like Truth with a capital T, the real purpose for us living here is to express our joy and happiness, okay? To like, be so full of life that everybody around us can feel it. And it's not about everybody else. If everybody else can feel it, what that means is you're feeling it too. I don't think it has to be specifically tied to a doing this, but I usually notice that the life purpose somebody does is usually the one that's easiest for them. So for instance, Oprah, she is an excellent communicator. So she figured out how to do her life purpose as a communicator. Now I'm sure when she first started, I don't think she ever envisioned all the way, what her life became, but she just kept doing what made her happy. All right, and if your life purpose is to be a really great parent and raise really absolutely happy kids, you know what? That is an admirable life purpose. So I want to take money out of the life purposing thing and just really, really do that which makes you happy. If helping others is part of your life purpose, you can make a lot of money helping others and the universe isn't going to judge you. Nobody's going to judge how you do it because we need people who have a life purpose. And let's just say a financial analyst, right? Like helping people generate money so that they can have whatever tool they need to live their life. There are people who are midwives, right? And their life purpose is to help bring life into the planet. I would not be so overwhelmed about it, I would just start making a list of the things that make you happy and then figure out how you can get paid for it. So right now, I'm going to ask you guys to just jot down what kind of comes to you, what you require if you were truly doing the career slash life purpose that you really wanted, and includes some qualities like I'm thrilled to do it, I'm happy with the people I work with. And I work with, fill in the blank means, you could say, I work with celebrities, I work with executives, I work with entrepreneurs, I work with stay-at-home moms, I work with people who are having a midlife crisis, right? I mean, it doesn't matter what your niche is. Just work with the kind of people that you actually really liked being around. Okay, another example for somebody might be, I get to help others in my career path. You can put it generates over six, seven figures, whatever your number is, somebody was asking me, do you do a separate vision board for each area? There's more than one way. Some people just do their whole life on one board. And some people like to have like the little segments, I would just do the thing that makes you feel happy, that will allow you to get it done. If doing the whole life makes you overwhelmed, do you five things that you really want to have in your life next. 'Cause remember I was talking about, you want to have the big picture, but we need the little baby steps to kind of anchor it in for you, okay? So we're going to, we're going to do the big picture, but the action steps are the things that will create, whatever the next level for you is, okay? So let's see what you guys said. Okay, so I'm independent and it gives me a sense of freedom and joy. Diane said, what would it take to have a lucrative career change, where my work feels like play and total freedom. Galena wants to play with energy stuff for a living. I'm thrilled to see people change spiritually from my work and watch the light on the planet increase. Learning, discover something new and exciting every day and be thrilled about it. Writing, sharing, and writing. All right, cool, kindness. Coaching others, travel to beautiful remote tropical areas. I bring business that creates jobs in third world countries, working with people that are happy, motivated, full of energy and make over six figures. I get to work unsupervised and get to do the nitpicky details of what I'm doing. I get to be excited about what I'm working on. That's really awesome. I mean, look, you go to work for, I mean, some people work 8-10 hours a day, right? You should be doing what you love at some level. I mean, some people love being organized, right? Some people love being in charge. Some people love being the person, behind the person in charge. It doesn't really matter, but do what you love. Margaret wants to heal middle aged women who are at the crossroads in their lives. That's a really good place to be. A lot of people need that. Transforming lives, inspirational speaker, Francine, my perfect job. Me being me laughing, healing, others, teaching, loving, learning, earning a hundred thousand a month. All right, sense of satisfaction to express my divine spiritual gifts. I am very happy with the people I work with, a bunch of programmers. I'm very happy to work on the internet on the side, by myself, earning money by creating websites. That's great Kim, a lot of people need that right now. A lot of people need to know how to get that stuff done too. So teaching people would be great. It feels like play my hours are flexible earning 200,000 a year. Interesting, inspiring, generous people. I love generous people, right? 'Cause the cool thing about generosity is generosity means you have a feeling in your body that you always have enough. I work with people who share a passion, intellectual and spiritual freedom to work my own hours, helping the hopeless and empower humanity, help the decision-makers, personal growth, helping others, gets to travel, work with aware people. Movie industry, help people with my love and creativity, travel first-class all over the world. Animals and conducting research as well as working with the aged and disabled, raising the vibration of everybody that I come in contact with. I am thrilled to run a large corporation and provide a great environment to people, advance spiritually and materially and live a life of 200%, I love it. All right, so let's do a clearing 'cause this is all about clearing too. So close your eyes for a minute. Take your energy about 300 feet above your head. See sense or feel the light, whatever that means to you. You can visualize it as a great big central sunshine. You're going to envision it as a feeling of light and love and allow that light and love to come into your head, your third eye, your ears, your throat, your chest, and it can be liquid light and kind of flowed down your arms and into your chest and into your torso, okay, into your abdomen and through your hips and into your thighs, knees, calves, feet to the center of the planet. And let's ask that light to come from the center of the planet and come right up to your feet, thighs, hips, and up your heart radiating out like a great central sunshine, 360 degrees, all the way around and expand this light past your building, past your city, past the state, past the country, past the earth. Okay, so everywhere you guys feel, believe and think that you cannot generate the career or life purpose of your own dreams. Will you please, please, please, Delete, Uncreate, and DeStory all of it. Okay, every person, place or thing that's around you that does not help you get what you want at a life, all your connections to those things, we're going to Delete, Uncreate and DeStory all of them. We're just going to clear some old connections to things that don't serve you anymore. All right, now, everybody who's frightened to make a change in their life, Will you please Uncreate, Delete, and DeStory all of it. Okay, so all the places where you feel, I hear victimized by anybody that you've ever worked with or worked for, will you please Uncreate, Delete and DeStory all of it. Everywhere you have to think you have to work like hard and for a paycheck and that you have no other option, Delete, Uncreate, and DeStory all of it, okay? All the places that you guys are living your parents' dream instead of your own dream, right? So anywhere you're living anybody else's dream except for your own, Delete, Uncreate, and DeStory all of it, okay? Every other place where you guys don't feel that you have the worthwhileness to get the kind of career or lifestyle that you deserve, will you please Uncreate, Delete, and DeStory all of that. Everywhere you feel like your life is not easy, Delete, Uncreate, and DeStory all of that, okay? So we're going to do some what would it take, so I want you guys to like fill in with some of your own, what would it takes that you typed me, right? So what would it take for everybody on this webinar to generate the kind of career, life purpose, fun lifestyle that they truly deserve? And everything in the way of that we're going to Delete all of it. What would it take for everybody on this phone call to generate the kind of lifestyle that they truly deserve, want and desire and everything in the way of that, we're going to Delete it, Uncreate it, and DeStory all of it. Okay, so whatever vibration you can bring in right now, so that you can have your fill in the blanks, plenty of money, plenty of love, working with the kind of people that you really truly enjoy, working in the kind of space that you really truly enjoy, transforming the people around you, by you just being you, that does tune into your inner guidance a minute and ask the universe, what would it take for you to bring me my next big step in my career slash life purpose upgrade? And what would my next step be? Is it calling your boss and asking for a raise, is it sending 20 resumes out? What is the next step for you? So any insider awareness, what is the next step for you? Okay, so make sure you fill that in. What is the next step for me to take? All right, and when you're ready, just to kind of open your eyes. Okay, so type in for me and for everybody else, this is the career path in life, kind of a filled in version. So you can do yours the way you want, of course, but this is just a little mock up of what your version might be. But tell me what, what it is that you guys got for action steps. I would love to hear some of those. Now Adriana said, I keep getting do nothing. Well, that's kind of an interesting one because sometimes you will get a piece of information that says do nothing. Now here's usually what that means. That means what if you're growing right now and you just kind of need a little bit of a break while you grow into the next part of yourself, right? Maybe do nothing is really, work on yourself, do the 12 week abundance and just fill in with the kind of life that you really want. Jenny is wondering, she was re-listening to the recordings and today felt heavy and motivated and lost. It could, it's probably just the next layer Jenny. Sometimes that happens. You can listen to the same thing over and over again. And then one day, all of a sudden it just pulls up some old stuff. So anybody listening, who's still feeling a little heavy about anything, Delete, Uncreate and DeStory all of it. Go back to school, Tracy, play more. Mary didn't get anything. Well, Mary, just keep asking the question, okay? Maybe the universe is formulating. You could have just put in a brand new request that you never have requested and maybe the universe needs to like sort it out for you. So just because you don't get it in two seconds, doesn't mean it's coming. I call it a theoric email, right? So you could be walking or doing something. And then all of a sudden, who knows what? It just pops into your head, clients coming in, asking for a bonus. All right, Allah, we're going to hold you to that. Self-love, return a phone call, do a project at a local school, publish my spiritual books. Jenny says, I was told that I'm doing it. I'm on this course. Buy a lottery ticket, awesome. Do an action step that I just purchased. Do a timetable to stay organized and purposeful. Work with friends. Come see Christie for one-on-one. Start making phone calls and sending emails to see where people stand on helping me. I love it, you know what? Asking for help, that would be a really cool thing to do. I'm going to just, I'm going to actually do that right now. I'm going to hold you guys accountable, ask people for help, that you would normally never ask help from. I have noticed this one phrase, like really inspires people. Even if you're talking to the checkout person or calling somebody on the phone, like a business and just saying, can you help me? Would you mind helping me? Yeah, what would it take to get tons of help from the universe, for no apparent reason, right? Get up trading plan. So Asha was saying that she's in conflict 'cause what she wants to do is different than maybe what her partner wants to do. Asha, I would basically just ask to clear everything in the way of you getting this done. So just keep saying everything in the way of me, getting XYZ done in a way that works for me. I Delete it, Uncreate it and DeStory it all. And then we'll see what happens. Like maybe he changes his mind or you figure out a different angle. Do you a website, I used to deal, I like that. Stir the pot, talk to three people, nothing came to me. Maria, just keep doing the same thing, which is what would it take for my next big step to show up for me, okay? Just do that for 30 times a day for a couple of days and see if something pops up. Update my resume, work with a business coach. All right, these are awesome you guys. So now we're going to go to the spirituality and connection to source garden plot because you're going to, abundance comes in all forms, right? So just jot down right now, some things that you require for your spirituality and connection to source. So I gave you some examples, like feeling loved all the time, always being connected to source, grateful for my life. Personally, I want to activate and help 1 million people reach love or above energy. That is my goal, and I'm going to hit it. I should have put 10 million, right? Or it could be traveled to the spiritual sites around the world and see what others have been doing for spirituality. So tell me what you guys have going on. Somebody just said, I've been asking to join two wonderful people in their business because they are going to levels I wish to be at, but I haven't been able to afford to join. And he just sent me a text to say they have a 50% discount and I just received $1,700 yesterday, that is so awesome Raven. Talk about fast action, right in the middle of the phone call. And that's probably about your life purpose, right? Okay, cool I love this. Being comfortable with myself, assist in spiritual events. Maria is saying woo, congrats to Raven. Great, and be constant with meditation practice, make 10 million crystal blankets to heal people. Oh, I like that Arthur. I can feel the energy of that, I really love that. I'm going to shift to this other one to kind of inspire you a little bit too. Crystal blankets, I want to hear more about that. Total love, guidance, security from source. Team up with spiritual business partners and never ending zest for spiritual knowledge. Daily connection, daily understanding and clarity, daily direction from source, connected to spouse, I think, and helping others feel connected. That's a good one, okay. So Wanda is saying she doesn't understand connection to source. Well, Wanda what I'm really just trying to do is some people have like funny issues on the word God and source and all that stuff. So, whatever you would consider being just totally connected to divine energy, divine, whatever your word is, God, source, divine energy, love. What would make you feel connected to that every day? Because really at the end of the day, people die. And before they die, they say, the thing that I really wish that I did different in my life was somehow feel a certain happiness or peace in my body. Well, that's your spirituality, right? It's feeling connected to something that makes you really happy. But that's a really good question Wanda. I'm really glad you asked that because you didn't know, or you didn't understand what I was saying, so thank you. We feel the universe support me, supported and connected. All is connected to my life purpose and hearing my intuitive guidance. Read the scriptures daily, quit judging myself harshly. I love that one, that would change everybody's life. If we could judge ourselves. Be enlightened, feel grateful for the source in my life, help others realize the potential. Spend one to two hours, immersing yourself in gratitude, energy by meditating or learning about energy. Ella says she does pink blankets, they help people a lot. Okay, ponder in play. Those are great. Give love and hope to people who are in pain and overwhelmed. Find my perfect mate. So we're going to connect to the light for a minute. So just go up 300 feet, and for those of you wondering, why do I go up 300 feet? If you're kind of in tune enough and you might not be yet, but you can feel that there's like an opening that happens around that space. That just kind of opens the light to come in. I don't know why 300 or so feet, but it feels like right about there, okay? So open up, let light in, okay? And magnetize it, basically imagine you have a magnet in your heart and you're going to pull it from above into your heart and from the center of the planet, up into your heart. And you're going to radiate 360 degrees around like a great central sun. We're going to just clear this, everything that blocks you stops you from feeling connected to the love of all things. Will you please, please, please, Uncreate, Delete and DeStory it all, cool. Okay, so everything preventing you from connecting to the happiness of all things and all of life, will you please Uncreate, Delete and DeStory it all? Yeah, so all the ways that you don't allow yourself to receive love, guidance, abundance, you need to Uncreate and DeStory it all. Everywhere you shut off your spiritual light for whatever reason, Delete, Uncreate and DeStory it all, okay? So I can feel that some people are having a hard time changing and that's what some of the heaviness is and I'm feeling, so everywhere, it's really hard to change and move into something that you don't know anything about because it is true, you'll be like different. But basically I'm going to just tell you the secret, you'll be happier. You could be doing the exact same things that you're doing currently, but you'll be a heck of a lot happier doing it. So everything that doesn't allow you guys to change, including yourself, Delete, Uncreate and DeStory it all now. All right, got to let go off that stuff. Okay, a couple more times, I'm going to do the change thing. 'Cause I can feel some people, a little stopping themselves. So everywhere you don't want to change, can't change and change could not believe that you can change, Delete, DeStory and Uncreate it all. Everywhere you guys think that you have no idea how to change, Delete it across all time, dimension space, reality. So everything that is, Delete, Uncreate and DeStory it all. Okay, everywhere you guys don't want to change your pocket book I heard, for whatever reason, like is comfortable, the old you, like where you're at, it's just comfortable for some reason, even if it's comfortably uncomfortable, Delete, Uncreate and DeStory all of that. Everywhere you guys have a hard time listening to your guidance, which could just tell you anything you want to do, how to live a rockstar life, whatever that is for you, Delete, Uncreate and DeStory it all now. Wow, this is really cool. You guys just let go a lot of stuff right there, okay? So open your eyes when you're ready. And I noticed something, I love this question by the way, Margaret. Margaret sends me a little note that said, "if my happiness energy was a material expression, what would it be?" 'Cause she's asking the universe that question, right? She's asking, what would it take basically for my happiness energy to express itself, materially? Somebody's asking Wanda, you can do this with your eyes open if you're driving, okay? Literally if I'm driving, I'm either doing two things. I'm either blessing people or I am deleting, like a bunch of stuff that I don't want in my life anymore. So you can do it with your eyes open for sure. The reason I'm doing this on the web, and eventually what I want you to do is always be connected. So there's nothing that says you can't, if I say to you all right now, connect up 300 feet, let light come in you, right? You can all do that in two seconds. So you don't really need to close your eyes. I just want you guys to have an experience. And I haven't a place where you're allowing yourself to go a little deeper. Dave wants to know why his throat's burning after clearings. It just means there's some energy in your throat. A lot of creative expression gets stuck in your throat. So whatever you guys let go of, you guys are doing an awesome job. I want to comment on this one part like the to-do section of the source and spirituality section. You know it's really funny, I've had people tied to me, okay. I've had clients just randomly call me up and say, you gifted me so much in my life. I really want to give my tithing or donation to the universe to you. And I thought, wow, I mean, honestly, I was so grateful. I thought, wow, that's like a blessing. And when I learned a long, long time ago is to make sure that I tithe myself because I'm a gift to myself. Like I have God's source energy running through me. So I also deserve to be taken care of, right? So I tithed myself 10% out of everything I ever get. It ends up being more now, but when I first started, it was 10%. And of course I still do charity and give to other things, right? But I just kind of pointed that out. It just, my guides asked me to put that there for you guys, so that you realize that paying yourself, 'cause why else would you work? Derek is asking, how do I know that the things I'm asking for are really the things which the source has intended for me? That's a good question Derek, but you have to understand the source just really wants at the end of the day for you to be happy, okay? Like whatever that means for you. And you had just know when I'm saying happy, I'm not talking about, go get drunk party, that kind of happiness. 'Cause we all know at the end of the day, there's a little bit of a check-out there, go have a drink, but you know what I'm saying? If you spend your life like sleeping on the couch, watching TV and drinking, I don't think you're truly totally happy. You might be comfortable. I don't know if that would be really happy. Ask, if you could envision like the highest and best path for you, when you might not know what that is yet, but just keep asking me universe with the highest and best path for you. Kavita asking what is tithing? Tithing is when some people tithe to their church, where they give 10% of their money to the church. And what I say is you also are a source energy, so you should make sure you tithe to yourself, okay? And Karen thanking everybody because she's really learning from the member questions. So she's thanking guys for asking questions. All right, so woo, you guys just so awesome today. So let's do a couple of fill in the blank kind of things with you, all right? This is what to do as much as you can all week, practice filling in some of your career, life purpose and spiritual garden plots. So we'll do a couple of these right now. So what would it take for you to be on the highest and best life path for you and everything in the way of that? Delete it, Uncreate it, and DeStory it all now. What would it take for you guys to have your dream life, your dream career with ease and everything in the way of that? Delete it all, DeStory it all, and Uncreate it all. What would it take universe to deliver for you the perfect career opportunity, whatever that is for you and have it show up really, really, really quickly. Even if it's one that you've never even thought of. Like, wouldn't it be cool if it does landed in your lap and you go, oh my God, of course that's what I should do with my life, okay? And everything in the way of that, Delete it, Uncreate it all, and DeStory it all. You know it's really funny, I went to school and I quit because I just kept, I went to school for finance, but in the end I quit. And you know why? Because I kept thinking, this is not what I'm supposed to do as the totality of my life. Like I felt like I learned what I needed to learn. And I knew that there was something more and I knew that they didn't teach in school what I wanted to know. So yeah, that's kind of what happened. So I'm not advocating quitting school, but what I'm saying is wouldn't it be great if the universe just delivers to you, it's like some career that is so completely authentically perfect for you, whatever that is, that it was just completely made for you, okay? So everything in the way of that, Delete it, Uncreate it, and DeStory it all, because truthfully, I mean, technically I could actually just retire, but I actually love what I do. So I can't, I really don't want to, you know what I mean? So wouldn't it be great to have a career like that? That is my greatest wish for all of you. Okay, so what vibrational energy, can you guys be to have unlimited resources deliver you the perfect life purpose, career, and spiritual connection, and everything in the way of that, Delete it, Uncreate it, and DeStory it all. What would it take for you guys to have the perfect career for you? And everything in the way of that, Delete it, Uncreate it, and DeStory it all. What would it take for the universe to give you the perfect divine idea, divine action step or divine guidance and what it is that would be the next best step for you, like asking for a raise, taking a class, doing some additional training, doing some research for whatever that is for you, and everything in the way of that, Delete it, Uncreate it, and DeStory it all. And anywhere you guys are confused about your guidance, we're going to do what would it take for you guys to have total clarity that you can connect to source that you are connected, and everything in the way of that, Delete it, Uncreate it, and DeStory it all. So tell me how you guys are feeling before we go. Somebody wanted to know what is the web address to go in order to print out this page? It's in the Mindvalley Library, start filling in your entire garden this week, do any, what would it take kind of fill in the blank on your Garden Plots. And again, what I love is that you guys were doing all the Deleting, Uncreating and DeStorying of all the stuff that felt heavier dense. And if somebody is telling you something, just go, okay, is this really true? Or if you're telling yourself a story, is this really true in my universe? Do I really, really, really want this? Okay, again, good nutrition is important. Vitamins and minerals, when you're processing, it takes a lot of energy. It's like different kind of energy than you're used to using. So some of you might be a little tired, tired is not bad. It just means that you're processing, drink some water, take good nutrition, get some extra rest, Uncreate any old emotions. As I said, you can always try the Bach remedies if you're feeling a little moody. Thanks for everybody for contributing all your generosity of spirit to these clearing calls. It's important, it's like so important and I love you. Alright, ciao for now, see you. Please continue to the next Unlimited Abundance Journey Session.

LESSON 6: Clearing Fear of Success (Clearing Session Only)

All right, so let's do a clearing. So close your eyes for a minute. Take your energy about 300 feet above your head. See, sense, or feel the light, whatever that means to you. You can visualize it as a great big central sunshine. You can envision it as a feeling of light and love. And allow that light and love to come into your head, your third eye, your ears, your throat, your chest. And it can be liquid light and kind of flow down your arms. And into your chest and into your torso. Okay, and into your abdomen and through your hips and into your thighs, knees, calves, feet to the center of the planet. And let's ask that light to come from the center of the planet and come right up to your feet. thighs hips and up your heart radiating out like a great central sunshine 360 degrees all the way around and expand this light past your building past your city past the state past the country past the earth okay so everywhere you guys feel believe and think that you cannot generate the career or life purpose of your own dreams Will you please, please, please delete, uncreate, and destroy all of it? Okay, every person, place, or thing that's around you that does not help you get what you want out of life, all your connections to those things, we're going to delete, uncreate, and destroy all of them. We're just going to clear some old connections to things that don't serve you anymore. All right, now everybody who's frightened to make a change in their life, will you please uncreate, delete, and destroy all of it? Okay, so all the places where you feel, I hear, victimized by anybody that you've ever worked with or worked for, will you please uncreate, delete, and destroy all of it. Everywhere you think you have to work hard and for a paycheck and that you have no other option, delete, uncreate, and destroy all of it. Okay, all the places that you guys are living your parents' dream instead of your own dream, right? So anywhere you're living anybody else's dream except for your own. Delete, uncreate, and destroy all of it. Okay, every other place where you guys don't feel that you have the worthwhileness to get the kind of career or lifestyle that you deserve, will you please uncreate, delete, and destroy all of that? Everywhere you feel like your life is not easy, delete, uncreate, and destroy all of that. Okay, so we're going to do some what would it take. So I want you guys to like fill in with some of your own what would it takes that you typed me, right? So what would it take for everybody on this webinar to generate the kind of career, life purpose, fun lifestyle that they truly deserve? And everything in the way of that, we're going to delete all of it. What would it take for everybody on this phone call to generate the kind of lifestyle that they truly deserve, want, and desire? And everything in the way of that, we're going to delete it, uncreate it, and destory all of it. So we're going to connect to the light for a minute. So just go up 300 feet. And for those of you wondering, why do I go up 300 feet? If you're kind of in tune enough, and you might not be yet, but you can feel that there's like an opening that happens around that space that just kind of opens the light to come in. I don't know why it's 300 or so feet, but it feels like right about there. Okay, so open up, let light in, okay, and magnetize it. Basically, imagine you have a magnet in your heart, and you're going to pull it from above into your heart and from the center of the planet up into your heart. and you're going to radiate 360 degrees around like a great central sun. We're going to just clear this. Everything that blocks you, stops you from feeling connected to the love of all things, will you please, please, please uncreate, delete, and destroy it all? Cool. Okay, so everything preventing you from connecting to the happiness of all things and all of life, will you please uncreate, delete, and destroy it all? Yeah, so all the ways that you don't allow yourself to receive love, guidance, abundance, delete, uncreate, and destroy it all? Everywhere you've shut off your spiritual light for whatever reason, delete, uncreate, and destroy it all. Okay, so I can feel that some people are having a hard time changing, and that's what some of the heaviness is that I'm feeling. So everywhere, it's really hard to change and move into something that you don't know anything about because it is true. You'll be, like, different. But basically, I'm going to tell you the secret. You'll be happier. So everything that doesn't allow you guys to change, including yourself, delete, uncreate, and de -story it all now. So everywhere you don't want to change, can't change, shouldn't change, could not believe that you can change, delete, de -story, and uncreate it all. Everywhere you guys think that you have no idea how to change, delete it, cross all time, dimensions, space, reality. So everything that is, delete, uncreate, and de -story it all. Okay, everywhere you guys don't want to change your pocketbook, I heard, for whatever reason, like it's comfortable, the old you, like where you're at, it's just comfortable for some reason, even if it's comfortably uncomfortable. Delete, uncreate, and destroy all of that. Everywhere you guys have a hard time listening to your guidance, which could just tell you anything you want to know, how to live a rockstar life, whatever that is for you, delete, uncreate, and destroy it all now. Wow, this is really cool. You guys just let go of a lot of stuff right there. What would it take for you to be on the highest and best life path for you and everything in the way of that, delete it, uncreate it and destroy it all now? What would it take for you guys to have your dream life, your dream career with ease and everything in the way of that, delete it all, destroy it all and uncreate it all? What would it take universe to deliver for you the perfect career opportunity, whatever that is for you? and have it show up really really really quickly even if it's one that you've never even thought of like wouldn't it be cool if it just landed in your lap and you go oh my god of course that's what I should do with my life okay and everything in the way of that delete it uncreate it all and destroy it all Wouldn't it be great if the universe just delivers to you like some career that is so completely authentically perfect for you, whatever that is, that, you know, it was just completely made for you. Okay, so everything in the way of that, delete it, uncreate it, and destroy it off. Okay, so what vibrational energy can you guys be to have unlimited resources deliver you the perfect life purpose, career, and spiritual connection? And everything in the way of that, delete it, uncreate it, and destroy it all. What would it take for you guys to have the perfect career for you? And everything in the way of that, delete it, uncreate it, and destroy it all. What would it take for the universe to give you the perfect divine idea? divine action step or divine guidance on what it is that would be the next best step for you like asking for a raise taking a class doing some additional training you know doing some research for whatever that is for you and everything in the way of that delete it uncreate it and destroy it all and anywhere you guys are confused about your guidance we're gonna do what would it take for you guys to have total clarity that you can connect to source, that you are connected. And everything in the way of that, delete it, uncreate it, and de -store it all. So tell me how you guys are feeling before we go. Somebody wanted to know, what is the web address to go in order to print out this page? It's in the Mindvalley library. Start filling in your entire garden this week. Do any, what would it take? to fill in the blank on your garden plots and again what I love is that you guys were doing all the deleting uncreating and de -storying of all the stuff that felt heavy or dense and if somebody's telling you something just go okay is this really true or if you're telling yourself a story is this really true in my universe do I really really really want this okay again good nutrition is important Vitamins and minerals, when you're processing, it takes a lot of energy. It's like different kind of energy than you're used to using. So some of you might be a little tired. Tired is not bad. It just means that you're processing. Drink some water. Take good nutrition. Get some extra rest. Uncreate any old emotions. All right. Ciao for now. See you. Please continue to the next Unlimited Abundance Journey session.

LESSON 7: Clearing Fear of Rejection

- [Christie] Hey, this is Christie Marie Sheldon, and you're listening to a recording I did of a series of 24 live group sessions on clearing your abundance blocks. And here's what we're going to cover today in session number seven. We're going to cover how to stop living in a jail cell. Everywhere you block yourself, and don't allow yourself to move forward, we're going to clear all of that. I'm going to teach you some energy statements to clear the baggage every day. And we're also going to talk about the two steps to manifesting. We're also heading back to your wealth garden. You'll learn about the last two pathways, self-expression and relationships. And when I say self-expression what I mean is how you show up in the world intellectually, what you're studying, what you think about, what you know, are you inputting good information in your energy system every day. And finally, we're going to rip up the weeds, dig up the plot, plant some seeds, and fertilize your relationship garden. You have relationships with love, love matches, boyfriends, girlfriends, money, a tree. You have relationships with everything in your life. And we're going to find out if these relationships either profit you or suck energy away from you. So we're going to get into all of that today. So let's begin.

- Welcome, welcome. How are you? I'm so happy to be here today. We have an exciting day today. Grab a journal, piece of paper. Cause I want you to write down any new awareness that's going to show up for you today. Be open to anything new, and let's just pause for two seconds, and set any intent that you need to for yourself, and what you hope to achieve both tonight and in the, you know, next month of your life or so. Okay, good job. I can feel that, love it. Everybody dropped into their heart there. Okay, bring any baggage that you want to clear today. Today, we're going to get into some heavy duty stuff, in a good way, heavy duty. And let's begin. My favorite part of the day, inspiring stories. Let's see Deborah, she manifested a new place to live in a place where she loves to be. She managed to get things together to make those happen soon. Like she's basically moving in a week and a half. And that all happened from like three or four days ago, right? And was able to attend a seminar on writing a book in 90 days, gained a friend. So she got some new friends, Julie, Julie's in the middle of a breakup. And she said, she called it a miracle. You know, she says, I'm experiencing so many miracles in my life. I do not even know where to start. She was been in a relationship that hasn't worked for her for awhile, but she kept making excuses to stay. But she said all the excuses in the last week or so have basically taken care of themselves. So number one, she had to find out where the dog should go. And I guess her son agreed to take it and wanted the dog. She needed to pay her spouse or her mate, $10,000 for the profit in the home, basically. So that the equity was all split and even. So what happened is nobody's ever come to them about a house that they bought six years ago and offered to buy this property, which basically brought in the 10 grand that she needed so that the equity would be a fair. She said she paid off all her bills. You know, for the month of July, her ex gave her two months child support. And she said, the kids are adults now. And he used to never give child support when the kids were small. So this was completely unexpected and random, plus an extra $1,500 to pay off her attorney without her even having to ask for it. Her son paid her $200 from an old debt that she thought she'd never get paid for. Her daughter paid her a hundred dollars for some insurance that she had been paying for the first time ever. And she said, and plus the split with the mate, instead of being a lot of drama is nice, and respectful, and loving, and kind, and lots of goodwill. So, you know, in the end, that's really the most important part, right? So she said she called this whole experience a miracle for her. So you guys are amazing, amazing inspiring stories. All right, we have an exciting, exciting day. I am going to answer one of these questions. Sarah sent a little note saying, could you give a clearing statement that we can use every night to clear anything that we might have created as baggage during our day? Yes, okay, so just say every, everything of a lower density, lower than love that I've taken into my system today, I delete, uncreate, and destory all of it. And everything that I was today that wasn't generous, inviting, kind, and full of love for me, I deleted it, uncreate it, and destory it all. Yep, and I hear one more. Everywhere, I have no idea who I am to be. I deleted, uncreate it, and destory it all and then fill in with what you vision your life to be, okay. And we're going to work on that today. So this is kind of exciting. Gabriel wanted to know what was I talking about over the unlocking jails again. So basically it's this, I think I did a clearing statement that said, and you can all connect to light right now and do this with me. So close your eyes and connect to the light. And if you're driving, you can't obviously close your eyes, but you can always follow the energy and connect to the light. Okay, so close your eyes, connect to the light, get 300 feet tall, see your sense or feel the light. And then let that light come into your crown. The top of your head, let it swirl around your third eye, opening up anything there and open up your ears, your throat, so you can communicate your truth and see it go into your heart. So you have compassion for yourself and all others. See it going down your arms, unlocking anything in the way of you creating your future. See it going into your stomach, opening up all your power centers. See it, go into your hips and down your legs. Growing roots into the center of the planet and right in the center of the planet is this really ooey gooey love kind of energy, pure source energy in the center of the planet so that you can feel safe and supported in your journey while you're here. Okay, awesome. Okay, let that light come back up your calves, your knees, your thighs, your hips, your torso into your heart, radiating out 360 degrees all the way around like a big sunshine radiating from your heart and see this light expand past the building you're in, and see this light expanding past the town you're in, and radiate a circle of light past the state you're in, radiate a circle of light past the country you're in, then radiate a ball of light past the planet. Okay, so now you're connected to all things. So everywhere you have a feeling in you that makes you feel like you're in jail or that you can't do, be, or have something, will you please uncreate, delete, and de-story all of it. All the places where you're locked in a jail cell that you can't get out, delete, uncreate, and de-story all of it. All your cant's, won't, couldn't, shouldn't, could nevers delete, uncreate and destory them all across all time, dimensions, space, reality across, the history of you, across any other unhealed vibration. Will you please let yourself out of jail so that you can have a life that you truly want, desire and need. Okay, awesome. Oh, you guys are great. All right, so I'm going to go, we're working a little bit more on your wealth garden. Remembered today we're working on the final two pathways. We're working on the self-expression and your relationship to yourself and others. And here's what self-expression is. So I'm going to skip right here. So here's what self-expression is. Okay, self-expression so how you show up in the world intellectually. What that means is that's, you know, what you studying, what you know, what you think about kind of on a daily basis, right? So are you inputting good information into your system every day. Emotionally, how do you show up? Do you wake up and you're cranky and you want to gripe at people or do you wake up and think, holy crap, I am so excited about today. And physically, your self expression physically, do you show up full of energy, your body fit healthy, happy, and alive, or are you showing up kind of sluggish? You don't take the time to take care of your body or do something that's good for you, right? Like a massage. It's very interesting physically. I could do a whole 12 week course just on the physicality of things. Like, I'll give you an example because I really truly know for sure that our emotions and our thoughts get stuck in our body tissues. I mean, that's really one of the ways that I look at somebody, I literally look at their body and it kind of lights up like a pinball machine. And I can see where their emotions are stuck. And generally speaking, if somebody's emotions, like if you have a lot of physical problems on the right side of your body, that means that you either have one of these things going on. You're afraid to go forward in life because the right side of your body's the masculine part, where it takes charge, takes a step forward, you know, goes into the future. Does the hard work or does the work, or does the action step, whatever it is, the playful step. And if you had some problems with your dad, that can be locked on the right side. If you had problems with men, even if you are a man that can be locked on the right side of your body, if you have problems on the left side, it means that the feminine part of you, the part of you, you know, there's two parts to manifesting part one, taking action of some form, you know, putting the energy out there. Part two would be the receiving of it, okay. Because you have to be open to receive that which you put out. If you're blocked on that, it'll probably be on the left side of your body. And again, this is generalizing. This is pretty much 80% true. There's some, at the end of the day, pure awareness always wins, okay. So the best way is if you have something going on with your body, is you just literally ask it to tell you what's up with it, but the left side of the body, if you have problems with the feminine part of you, if you had problems with women or mom, okay, that will be on the left side of your body. If you don't like being a woman and you're a woman that can be in the left side of your body, just like if you're a guy and you don't like being a guy, that'll be in the right side of your body. So generally that's how you show up physically, you know, your face shows a lot how you face the world. Pain in the tush, right. Pain in the neck. So a lot of the emotions get stuck in your tissues. And remember, last week we had that inspiring story about somebody who lost 20 pounds since starting the journey, crazy right? 20 bounds just from starting the journey. And that was because she was releasing a lot of emotions. Ah, somebody wants to know where's your third eye. It's take like right in between your eyebrows and go back in a little bit, okay. So it's pretty much right in between your eyebrows. Somebody had a lower sore back, and now it's gone after clearing the money. Pain on the lower right side, in your case it's because you don't want to move forward in some way, okay. So here's what I want you guys to jot down and share with all of us, the things that you require in your life for yourself expression. So if money were no object and you could show up any way that you wanted to show up in the world, how are you going to show up intellectually, emotionally, and physically? So let's all share with us. You guys are all asking me body questions. Okay, so let's just set what all the bodies stuff that you guys have... Okay, I'll just answer a couple of them. Pain in the mid, low back. Generally speaking for you, Samira, lovelessness feeling unloved. Pain in the left spleen and the heart. You feel like you have no choice over your world. Connected to the lungs is grief. Irene wants to know what that is. Not feeling comfortable in your own skin at some level. Okay, so public speaking. So if you're doing your life the way that you really should be doing it, Margaret would be public speaking. Debra would be excelling at painting and writing a book. Lex wants to be a personality who helps and is recognized for his energy and appreciation. Cook a really good meal a day. I like that. Go surfing and have fun, more aliveness, a singer, energy healer, going to Bali, getting inspiration for a new painting, a healing clinic, radiating positive energy, traveling around the world. Okay, so like intellectually, if you guys were expressing things intellectually, how could you create that in your life? That you're somehow working on your smarts? What about, does any of you guys want to build a website and you haven't taken care of that, or learned something new. If you're studying, what do you want to study ? Emotionally, how do you want to wake up feeling in your life? Physically, what is it that you can do every day that would generate your physical life the way you want it? Singing every day, Katya wants to sing every day. Growing and learning, investing savvy, being in peace, getting a degree, a hundred percent happy. Roselyn says that being what she's already doing an occupational therapist and life coach, but always growing. Writing and more languages, Welsh, Russian, and Chinese, and Swedish, learn Spanish. Building a website, wake up full of energy. All right, so you guys channel a blog post every day. I love it. Use my expertise and intellect to get a doctoral degree. Wake up refreshed, full of trust and gratitude, energized in the morning, Eat lovely food without putting on weight. Getting the gunk out, learning to dance, learn piano, Japanese and French, meditate. Okay, so we're going to clear some of these things. Business planning for Basil, joy in everything you do say and think, a lucrative profitable website, lose weight. Okay, so some people are saying they have a block to even seeing their future. Perfect, okay, so we're going to do a clearing on all this stuff. Okay, so connect back up to the light and then just imagine that the, your heart center is radiating out 360 degrees all the way around in a circle. Okay, so everything that is preventing you from reaching your full self expression potential, will you please, please, please uncreate, delete, and de-story it all now, across all time, dimension, space, and reality. Okay, so this is a kind of a big deal because this is how you guys want to be in the world, right? So what I'm going to encourage you to do is like really, when I'm saying uncreate, delete, and de-story it all, does really say it along with me and feel it a lot. So you blow up all your stuff. Okay, all the places where you feel that you can't express yourself, delete, uncreate, and de-story it all. Everywhere you feel that you have no value that you can't show up in the world as yourself, delete, uncreate, and de-story it all now. Everywhere your feelings are that you can't be you, delete, uncreate, and de-story it all now. Everywhere you're not smart enough or good enough intellectually to show up as yourself, everywhere you play dumb and small, and I don't know, delete, uncreate, and de-story all that now. Okay, I don't think you guys are dumb, but somewhere you guys think you're dumb. Cause there's was a lot of energy on that. Okay, I think your infinite beings that have tons of potential, right. Okay, so every, everywhere you guys are playing small and playing I don't know, I don't care, I can't, I shouldn't, I wouldn't, I couldn't, I'm not that smart, I have no clue, I don't know what to do, I could never know what to do, nobody is telling me what to do. Okay, everything that is delete, uncreate, and de-story, all that now. So everywhere you guys are waiting for somebody else to tell you what to do, like your mom and dad, instead of just creating your future and go in for it, delete, uncreate, and de-story it all now. Everywhere you guys are waiting for a blessing or permission, or guidance, instead of just taking massive action. Even if it's wrong, you know, just take some action so that at least you can move forward in some way in your life. Everything that is delete, uncreate, and de-story it all now. Because you have to look at it like this, if you make a choice, but you learn something, it really wasn't that bad a choice, right? Because you figured something out. So everywhere, you guys are afraid to take any action because you're waiting for the right choice. So therefore you keep saying, I don't know what to do or how to do it. Delete, uncreate, and destroy the whole thing now. Everywhere you have no clue what it is that you were supposed to do in the world, delete, uncreate, and de-story all that now. Everywhere you have repressed your emotional connection to life and loved, delete, uncreate, and de-story all this now. Everywhere you have no idea emotionally, how to keep yourself balanced, and happy, and alive, and well, delete, uncreate, and de-story all that now. Everywhere you have no clue what your life is, life's potential could truly be, delete, uncreate, and de-story all that now. Everywhere you have no idea why you're here and what you're about, delete, uncreate, and de-story all that now. Everywhere you guys have denial systems. Yeah, delete all that. Any other authority figures that you let push you around, tell you what to do and be, and everywhere you're living their truth, delete, uncreate, and de-story it all now. Everywhere you guys are living your mom and dad's reality or authority figures reality instead of your own choice and your own expression, delete, uncreate, and de-story it all now. Everywhere you guys are living the family lineage, you know, you're living like basically your parents' stories and their parents' stories and everywhere, all those things are locked in your tissue, not letting you create and generate your own ideal situation, delete, uncreate, and de-story the whole thing now. Everywhere you guys are still giving your parents the power to control you. Even if it's a illogical, and emotional, and irrational, delete, uncreate, and de-story it all now. Everywhere you guys are refusing to be weird and be yourself, delete, uncreate, and de-story it all now. If you guys look at the definition of weird, you will see the definition of weird says supernatural. One time I asked my mother if I was weird. And she said, yes, because I was, I was a weirdo, I was supernatural. So everywhere you guys are pretending to be normal when you're so completely abnormal, that you're just pretty much light workers in a human body and everywhere you're pretending to be something other than that and be small, delete, uncreate, and de-story all that now. Everywhere you guys are afraid to show up as your full, infinite being potential in your body, delete, uncreate, and de-story all that. And all the crap that you bought about what being a human looks like. Like that it's limited, that it sucks, that it's full of drama, that you have to do what everybody tells you to do, and only do it that way, and then you fit in, and then you're part of the sheeple. And then you can never get out. So anywhere you guys are doing that, delete, uncreate, and de-story all that now. Because what if your natural birthright was to show up the full expression of you as you and everywhere, you don't even know what that looks like. And you're pretending that you don't know what you really like when you already know what you like, because you want to do it anyway. Like, you know what you really want. So everywhere you guys are pretending that you don't really know, delete, uncreate, and de-story it all now. Okay, all the historical knowledge that you guys are using against yourself to stop yourself, delete, uncreate, and de-story the whole thing now. Okay, everywhere you guys are locking in your emotions in your physical tissue and you can't get out of jail, delete, uncreate, de-story all that now. Everywhere you guys are emotionally bondaging yourself to your body in a way that makes your body want to shut down, delete, uncreate, and de-story the whole thing. Now, all the parts of you that feel ripped in pieces, delete, uncreate, and de-story all that now. Yeah, you guys let go of a lot of stuff, all right. Okay, cool. So what would it take? Now, I want you guys to just imagine and just try this on for a little bit. Any part of it that you can get a glimmer, if you could package and make the perfect model, like imagine you're like the perfect car model, right? You can be any model you want to be. You want to be a sporty. You want to be free. You want to be fun. You want to be bubbly, whatever expression that you want to show up as intellectually, you want to be a smart and moody, or you want to be like, you know, smart and happy, physically fit, energetically strong, feeling hot in your clothes, whatever that is for you, you know, and to love it. Even our inspiring story, right. She's wearing a yellow blouse, but because her energy was like so strong, people are like, woo, look at you girl. Okay, cool. Okay, so I want you to just imagine like money's no object, you could wake up tomorrow, what qualities in your energy field do you want to have? Whatever that looks like for you. All right, and everything in the way of that, you're going to delete it all, and then just keep filling in with the smart you, the vocal you, the part of you that can speak and tell your truth. The part of you that's happy, kind to people, bubbly, but you also have good boundaries. You don't let people dump on you. You're strong, and you're loving, and you're kind, and you're generous, and you have more than enough. And you share your wisdom with the world. You let everybody know that there's a spark of God in you, a spark of source energy in you that completely fills you up. Yeah, makes you feel like yourself and loves everybody and everything in the world. So please fill up with that. All right, so tell me what's going on for you guys. I like this. I don't know how to say your name, but Voco, Vojo tell at least three jokes and laugh every day. An herbalist, Christina called herself a witch doctor. Gabriel was saying being her size will bring pain to her others. All right, somebody put the definition of weird up for us. Involving or suggesting the supernatural, unearthly, or uncanny. Somebody is complimenting me saying, I was not normal. Okay, somebody was saying I feel heaviness in my body. Okay, so everybody who has any other extra heaviness, or weepiness, or stuff in your body, delete, uncreate. Yeah, all that. So anybody who's cutting themselves off from their full expression for any reason, delete, uncreate, and de-story all that now. All right, you guys are feeling great. Happy, so my light will shine, joyful and hopeful. Raven saying she's a little scattered. Sometimes when you're clearing things, Raven, you'll feel a little scattered because the old stuff that's not going to be with you anymore is leaving. Somebody said, when I, she heard, when she was growing up to always telling the truth or answering your person's question to be honored for telling the truth. Okay, successful inspirational leader. Let go of people in my life who are negative, needy, judgmental, and lie about me. I think that's a profound, whew. I'm going to give you a hand on that. You know, you don't have to fight with them. Just let it go and move to some new friends. Unleash my inner wizard. Represent the totality of me wherever I go. Gillen's feeling some heaviness when she's filling up. It just means that there's some things that are still being booted, rebooted out of you. Cause we have a whole other section to go that your soul probably knows about. All right, Sabrina. I love it. New times are coming, I'm a light being now. Kathleen says she gets so tired, she can barely stay awake. That's okay, Kathleen, your soul's just trying to kind of knock you out a little bit so that you can go to a deeper level. So it's just some unconsciousness of leaving. Realize I had been suffering from feelings of not being good enough in the light of others who have walked before me in greatness. Dynamic, Patricia wants to be dynamic, enthusiastic, generous, warm, happy, and making people happy. A dancer's body, all right. Sarah's saying thank you, I felt so alone in this and I feel so connected to everybody that my light is seen and knows that it is love. Christina's saying she thinks she's still has some blocks. Yes, all right, so we're going to do one more clearing on this, okay. All right, so any other leftover thing that you guys are resisting, giving up for whatever reason. Okay, known to you or unknown to you anywhere you're resisting giving up some stuff that doesn't serve you anymore. Okay, delete, uncreate, and de-story all of it. And let's just fill in with the totality of you. Pure source energy is who you are, pure source energy expressing itself through your emotional field, your intellectual field, and your physical field, right. And so you get to model yourself, however you want to model yourself. So happy, fit, alive, well, youthful, vibrant. Yeah, consider it over your own feelings, honoring yourself. The never quit kind of attitude. Like I'm going to do whatever it takes, no matter what it is and I'm going to get it done, right. I'm going to keep asking the universe to show up for me and I'm going to show up for it. It's going to be a mutual collaboration with the universe so that it responds to me, and I respond to it. It brings me abundance. And I open up for the abundance to flow through to me. And everywhere you guys are blocked and think abundance is somehow separate from you, not a part of you and not even like you, which is totally untrue by the way, all the lies and bull crap that you did with that, delete, uncreate, and de-story all of it. Any other crap that you guys are hanging on to whatever that is for you, delete, uncreate, and de-story all of it. All right, I like this. Sarah be radically herself. All right, you guys are going to love this next section because I can feel that you guys are already ready for it. Okay, that's your blank one. You can go back in and fill in what you want. Okay, filling with your own pictures. All right, so we're going to work on relationships. This is what you guys are kind of feeling ahead of time. So jot down the things that you require for your relationships. Now, remember you have a relationship with yourself, okay. You are in relationship with yourself and hopefully you're allowing the God part of you, the soul part of you, the higher reality part of you to just keep coming through you, okay. You have relationships with your love matches, you know, boyfriend, girlfriend, all of that. And you're also have relationships with family, and you have relationships with coworkers, and you have relationships with the store clerk for the two seconds that you deal with him or her and all of these relationships, you know, either bring you profit, okay, because here's the whole point of this. They either bring you profit or they suck energy away from you, okay. And if they suck energy away from you somewhere, you're allowing it. Because if you're truly being an infinite being, nobody can really drain you unless you allow it. And an infinite being would know oneself enough and feel with oneself up enough that it doesn't matter where they walk in the world. You could walk in the darkest of dark and truly, if you're filled up with yourself, it won't really affect you, okay. Now, some people aren't in that place yet. So if you're not in that place yet, and you have kind of negative people or needy people around you, you might have to make a choice that's loving and kind to yourself for a little while, which is so that you just kind of go recuperate, kind of fill up, kind of take the next step for your own self. Okay, so jot down and email me, but basically you type here, some of the things that you require in your own relationships. A relationship of equals. Christina wants to know how her partner is financially challenged. And she's worried that his stuff is rubbing off on her. Basically, you're going to have to delete and uncreate all of his thought forms, all of his thought forms towards you. Galen says everything is sucking energy out of me, even me. Well, that's why we're going to get you to walk around connected to source all the time. Then you're always in the flow. Okay, so somebody is saying my mom's been sucking my energy since I was a kid. Well, we're going to clear those today. It's never too late to be free, somebody said. Understanding, patience and nurturing, honesty, kindness, and awareness. Looking after myself better. Respect, love, and honesty. A relationship that gives back as much as I give. That's a good one. Honesty, respect and intimacy. They're all good. But I actually put that on my wishlist, you know, with people that as much love as I give, I get that much back because I know I'm a good lover. I love a lot. Relationships that are easy, fun, and joyful. Loving kindness. Being in love with myself. I treat others by the golden rule. Now I want others to treat me by the golden rule. I love that. I want to be my divine self inner goddess queen take the wheel and the drama queen gets the backseat. She can't even ride shot gun. I love it, Sarah. All right, making things easier for myself. Space and time to do what I'm doing without boundaries or pressure, loving affection and understanding, a deep connection to all, transparent communication, yep. And that everybody can just see everybody's baggage. I'm going for integrity, especially with myself. Open to meeting my love partner. Honesty and relationship. Truth, honesty, listening, honoring, respect, balance, good boundaries, win, win, win. Nurturing and caring, playful, happy family who enjoys each other's company. Sense of humor, kindness. No shouting, yelling, affection. Spiritually minded. Okay, so we're going to cut some cords with all the family members that don't fit. All right, so connect to the light. Yep, connect to light for a minute. Expand your energy out. Okay, now, can you guys like feel that, you feel really different? Just expanding your energy out. Remember when you expand your energy out, all the other stuff that's bothering you becomes like a little net, like a little fly it's it's you know, it doesn't take up your whole world. All right, so everywhere you guys are allowing interference in the relationship with yourself and not truly adoring and loving yourself, will you please uncreate, delete, and de-story all of it. Everywhere you have no idea who you are and what you're here for, delete, uncreate, and de-story all of it across all time, dimension, space, and realities. Across all soul decisions, across all karma, will you please uncreate and delete all the places where you don't let yourself be you. Okay, all the historical baggage, delete, uncreate, and de-story all of it. All right, so all the past relationships with lovers, any of those that you need to cut the cords to that are still energetically tied to you, and sucking the life out of you in any way, making your relationship with your, any mate unprofitable, delete, uncreate, and de-story it all now. All the unprofitable relationships that you have in your life, we're going to cut the cords, delete, uncreate, and de-story all of those now. All the places where you don't want to let go of things that no longer serve you, delete, uncreate, and de-story it all now. Everywhere you won't allow abundance in the form of happy, profitable relationships, delete, uncreate, and de-story all of that now. Okay, so let's think of your mom, okay? Any contracts that you have with your mother that are no longer serving either of you, you know, let's let her be free and let's let you be free, right? So everybody's connected to source. We'd love everybody, but not judge them, but anywhere your mom's ideas, thoughts or beliefs are in any way, creating a lack of abundance for you, delete, uncreate, and de-story all of it now. Anywhere else, your mother or your mother's family lineage is creating a lack of abundance in your life, delete, uncreate, and de-story all of it now. All the personal agendas that you have between you and your mother or your mother's energy towards you that are creating any place where you're blocked in generating profitable, fun, loving life for you, delete, uncreate, and de-story all that now. Okay, cool. Anywhere you care less about something in your life, that's there for creating a place where you have no, like less profit, delete, uncreate, and de-story it all now. Okay, so how many places are you guys hung up and not profitable in your life? Delete, uncreate, and de-story all that now. All right, everywhere you have your dad connected to you. Think of your dad, anywhere your father is connected to you in any way that's unprofitable, delete, uncreate, and de-story all that now. Anywhere your father's lineage or your father in any way has a contract or an agreement with you that in any way, limits your life, delete, uncreate, and de-story all that now. Anywhere you're giving your power over to your mom, mom and dad, waiting for their approval, delete, uncreate, and de-story all that now. Everywhere you and your father have tons of agendas, keeping each other stuck to each other in a way that doesn't give life to each other. All those ways, delete, uncreate, and de-story all that now. So let's give your father and mother permission to let go of you in a way, if they're holding you in any way that's kind of negative, even though they might think it's positive. So just give them permission to do it. They're connected to the source. You're connected to source and all is well. Okay, any other relationship that pops up that you want to clear right now, that you have any contracts with, any friends, coworkers, bosses, exes, ex lovers, ex friends, anybody, that siblings. So any other person that you want to cut cords to kind of just allow them to pop up in your mind and we're going to delete them, uncreate them, and de-story all that now. Any other person plays their thing that's blocking your profitable, happy life, delete, uncreate, and de-story the whole thing now. All right, that's kind of exciting. You let go of a lot of things there. Okay, there's no other place in your hearts that allows for abundance. Anywhere you have places that are you're blocking abundance in your own heart, your own relationship with yourself, delete, uncreate, and de-story all that too. Everywhere you're not allowing the creative expression of you to show up in your life and your body, delete, uncreate, and de-story all that now, across all time, dimension, space, realities, yeah. There, okay. And any other game you're playing with yourself where you have to block your abundance and pretend you don't remember who you are. Delete, uncreate, and de-story all that too. All right, you guys are doing good. All right, so fill in with profitable, happy, abundant, glorious relationships. Okay, so just kind of Rolodex and see all the people in your life and just see that they shine light on you and you shine light on them, and all is well. And for those of you that don't think people can change, I've seen it when you send a lot of light to somebody, things can change, okay. So you send light to them. They send light to you. You give yourself permission to be you, no matter what anybody else is doing. All right, you guys are amazing. Let me know how you guys are doing. If my parents are passed, does it clear? Yes. You have relationships with everybody. Okay, no matter where. All right, so you guys, I'm going to tell you the truth. You might have to listen to this one more time for some of you to get rid of all the cord, cutting, okay. But you're doing a good job. And it feels like most of you got most of it, but a few people still might have some stuff. In falling asleep, is falling asleep a form of resistance or denial. It could be. But most of the time I found that it's yourself, trying to just go a little deeper, because if you fall asleep, you'll let yourself do it a little bit deeper, okay. Lighter after the clearing, feeling much better than I was at the beginning of the call. Kylie, who is thanking everybody for helping. I hope this all clear, this works. Even though I don't feel much now. This is heavy stuff. You know, it's just, you have to look at energy as just energy. It's just energy. So even though it's a little heavy, a little compact, like who cares, it can go. It can't really hurt you. You know what I mean? Yes, you can uncreate and delete family events from past lives. Are we supposed to listen or just say what I'm saying? Well, you can say it out loud if it feels more real to you. Kay, has found some chords and she cut them. Should you keep cords attached to your kids? There's good cords of energy that you keep your kids safe. And there's negative cords that have fear attached. So only keep the good ones. So Anka's saying she's in the room with her sick father, we'll pull in a lot of light, Anka, just imagine a beam of light going into the whole room. Some people are feeling the clearing lighter now. Okay, Bill's saying he can't meet a mate until he gets beyond his financial issues, but also wants to make sure you meet somebody who loves him. So Bill everywhere, you're right, that will create a block, okay. That belief where you, so anybody who's thinking, oh, I can't be with somebody until I'm wealthy or whatever. Delete, uncreate, and de-story all of that. And then at the same time, anywhere you're thinking, well, I want to meet somebody who loves me for me, not just my money, delete, uncreate, and de-story all of that. What have you had this belief that I have so much money, so much more than enough money, that it doesn't really matter. Wouldn't that be cool, right. Okay, so everything in the way of that happening for you guys, delete, uncreate, and de-story all of it. Any other family lineage that you guys are holding on to, delete, uncreate, and de-story it all. Anywhere you guys still insist on holding all this energy in your tissues, delete, uncreate, and de-story all of it now. Yeah, so just imagine that you just kind of cut the cords and then send them back with a, you know, like a bolt of love, you know, like a lightning bolt of love. So some people are saying I can see why I was pretending to be smaller. I'm now feeling excited to show up and co-create with a universal part of me. Some of you guys have some things going on where you still feel a little stuck. Okay, so everything this is, I'm going to tell you, you guys are probably going to be processing this for about another hour and a half. Cause this is really heavy. So everything creating all this, we can bypass time if you'll let it, okay. So any of you guys stuck in time and you won't let this stuff go out, delete, uncreate, and de-story all of it. Everywhere you guys don't want to clear the main root cause of all your problems, delete, uncreate, and de-story all the main root causes. Basically the only main root cause of a problem is everywhere you think you can't. You can't, you shouldn't, or you won't. Okay, delete, uncreate, and de-story all of that. All right, she was saying that all the things I'm reading are going on with her. Yeah, so somebody is saying, don't worry about all the hows because you know, remember now you're going to fill in the, with the, what would it takes, right? You don't have to worry about the, how it's going to work out, sort of right. We're going to ask the universe to just kind of put the thought in your head, that feeling in your body so that you know what it is that you need to do. Because here's the real truth, at the end of the day, if you're being you, you're truly, truly, truly being you, everything shows up for you the way it needs to from the energy that you radiate, okay. So you can see that holding onto all these fears and all this stuff is really not going to serve you because it just generates more of the same. And you guys are in the middle of this. This is only the sixth or seventh day, okay. I mean, look at how many really cool things have happened. And somebody is asking about if they've taken drugs in the past, is kind of a good one to do, if you've taken a lot of drugs or alcohol or all of those things that just saying anything that I thought or felt while on drugs that is of a lower frequency, I delete it, uncreate it, and de-story at all. I would do that, you know, 40, 50, 60 times. Okay, so I'd like really get rid of all that stuff. What happens when you do drugs, you go a little unconscious and you kind of store it in a different part of your brain. Let's just say it kind of goes in a different part of you and you can't always recall what you thought. All right, so here's your blank place where you can play with it or make it in a journal, do whatever you want to do with it. All right, ready? So here's what you guys are going to play with. What would it take, fill these in with all the things that you filled in, what would it take for you to express more abundance than you ever could believe you could. And everything in the way of that, delete it all. What would it take for you to live your dream life with ease? What would it take for the universe to deliver to you the perfect person who can help you get your physical expression the way you really want it? What would it take for the universe to deliver to you the perfect formula for how to live your life, your way? What would it take for the universe to deliver to you all the thoughts, feelings, ideas, know-how knowledge, information, so that you can express yourself in the way that you truly wish and desire to express yourself, right? Or it could be, what would it take for me to have an abundant grateful relationship with my mother? Even if that's not the case, just put the, do the, what would it take? See what happens. What would it take for you and your kids to get along, you know, amazingly? What would it take for any old cords that you have with any exes be deleted? What would it take for everything in your life that doesn't help your relationship with yourself to be made happy in some way? What vibrational energy can you become to have unlimited resources brought to you in your relationships and your self-expression? What vibrational energy can you become to have, you know, 20 new friends that are on the path of light with you, right? What would it take for 10 of your other friends to turn to the light and be on this path with you? What vibrational energy can you be to radiate so much love that people ask what you're doing? And then you could maybe be a life coach for them and get paid, right? What would it take for so much vibrational energy to come through you, that you are a walking light beam? You know, that people just turn around and look at you cause you are just so radiating light and they want to give you money because they want to have what you have. How about that? Now, that's how you can get paid for being you. All right, awesome. I wanted to go to this one slide right here. As you guys know that you can click here, download the audio and the PDF. I would probably listen to this session one more time because we did so many cord cuttings, okay. You know, on this page right here in the journal below this, there's like places where you can ask questions and post some comments and help each other out. You can always go into Facebook and make some comments about what's going on for you. And some of the wins that you've had while you're doing this. So in your entire garden, do some more, what would it takes. Say the energy statements and try to live in as much truth as you can. All right, many blessings. Mwah.

====================

LESSON 7: Clearing Fear of Rejection (Clearing Session Only)

Yes. Okay, so just say everything of a lower density, lower than love, that I've taken into my system today, I delete, uncreate, and destroy all of it. And everything that I was today that wasn't generous, inviting, kind, and full of love for me, I delete it, uncreate it, and destroy it all. Yep. And I hear one more. Everywhere, I have no idea who I'm to be. I delete it, uncreate it, and destroy it all. And then fill in with what you vision your life to be. Okay? And we're going to work on that today. So this is kind of exciting. Gabrielle wanted to know, what was I talking about over the unlocking jails again? So basically it's this. I think I did a clearing statement that said, and you can all connect to the light right now and do this with me. So close your eyes and connect to the light. And if you're driving, you can't obviously close your eyes, but you can always follow the energy and connect to the light. Okay, so close your eyes, connect to the light. Get 300 feet tall, see your sensor, feel the light. And then let that light come into your crown, the top of your head, and let it swirl around your third eye, opening up anything there. And open up your ears. your throat so you can communicate your truth and see it go into your heart so you have compassion for yourself and all others. See it going down your arms, unlocking anything in the way of you creating your future. See it going into your stomach, opening up all your power centers. See it go into your hips and down your legs, growing roots into the center of the planet. And right in the center of the planet is this really ooey -gooey love kind of energy, pure source energy in the center of the planet so that you can feel safe and supported in your journey while you're here. Okay, awesome. Okay, and let that light come back up your calves, your knees, your thighs, your hips, your torso, into your heart, radiating out 360 degrees all the way around. Like a big sunshine radiating from your heart. And see this light expand past the building you're in. And see this light expanding past the town you're in. And radiate a circle of light past the state you're in. Radiate a circle of light past the country you're in. Radiate a ball of light past the planet. Okay, so now you're connected to all things. So everywhere you have a feeling in you that makes you feel like you're in jail or that you can't do, be, or have something, will you please uncreate, delete, and de -story all of it? All the places where you're locked in a jail cell that you can't get out, delete, uncreate, and de -story all of it. All your can'ts, won'ts, couldn'ts, shouldn'ts, couldnevers, delete. Un -create and destroy them all across all time, dimensions, space, reality, across the history of you, across any other unhealed vibration. Will you please let yourself out of jail so that you can have the life that you truly want, desire, and need? Okay, awesome. You guys are great. Okay, so we're going to do a clearing on all this stuff, okay? So connect back up to the light. And then just imagine that your heart center is radiating out 360 degrees all the way around in a circle. Okay, so everything that is preventing you from reaching your full self -expression potential, will you please, please, please uncreate, delete, and destroy it all now across all time, dimension, space, and reality. Okay, so this is kind of a big deal because this is how you guys want to be in the world, right? So what I'm going to encourage you to do is like really, when I'm saying uncreate, delete, and de -story it all, just really say it along with me and feel it a lot so you blow up all your stuff. Okay, all the places where you feel that you can't express yourself, delete, uncreate, and de -story it all, everywhere you feel that you have no value. that you can't show up in the world as yourself, delete, uncreate, and destroy it all now. Everywhere your feelings are that you can't be you, delete, uncreate, and destroy it all now. Everywhere you're not smart enough or good enough intellectually to show up as yourself, everywhere you play dumb and small and I don't know, delete, uncreate, and destroy all that now. Okay, I don't think you guys are dumb, but somewhere you guys think you're dumb because there's a lot of energy on that. Okay, I think you're infinite beings who have tons of potential, right? Okay, so everywhere you guys are playing small and playing I don't know, I don't care, I can't, I shouldn't, I wouldn't, I couldn't, I'm not that smart, I have no clue, I don't know what to do, I could never know what to do, nobody is telling me what to do. Okay, everything that is, delete, uncreate, and de -story all that now. So everywhere you guys are waiting for somebody else to tell you what to do, like your mom and dad, instead of just creating your future and going for it, delete, uncreate, and destroy it all now. Everywhere you guys are waiting for a blessing or permission or guidance, instead of just taking massive action, even if it's wrong, you know, just take some action so that at least you can move forward in some way in your life. Everything that is, delete, uncreate, and destroy it all now. Because you have to look at it like this. If you make a choice but you learn something, it really wasn't that bad a choice, right? Because you figured something out. So everywhere you guys are afraid to take any action because you're waiting for the right choice, so therefore you keep saying, I don't know what to do or how to do it, delete, uncreate, and destroy the whole thing now. Everywhere you have no clue what it is that you are supposed to do in the world, Delete, uncreate, and destroy all that now. Everywhere you have repressed your emotional connection to life and love, delete, uncreate, and destroy all this now. Everywhere you have no idea emotionally how to keep yourself balanced and happy and alive and well, delete, uncreate, and destroy all that now. Everywhere you have no clue what your life's potential could truly be, delete, uncreate, and de -story all that now. Everywhere you have no idea why you're here and what you're about, delete, uncreate, and de -story all that now. Everywhere you guys have denial systems, yeah, delete all that. Any other authority figures that you let push you around, tell you what to do and be? and everywhere you're living their truth delete uncreate and destroy it all now everywhere you guys are living your mom and dad's reality or authority figures reality instead of your own choice and your own expression delete uncreate and destroy it all now everywhere you guys are living the family lineage you know you're living like basically your parents stories and their parents stories and everywhere all those things are locked in your tissue not letting you create and generate your own ideal situation delete uncreate and destroy the whole thing now Everywhere you guys are still giving your parents the power to control you, even if it's illogical and emotional and irrational. Delete, uncreate, and destroy it all now. Everywhere you guys are refusing to be weird and be yourself. Delete, uncreate, and destroy it all now. If you guys look up the definition of weird, you will see the definition of weird says supernatural. One time I asked my mother if I was weird and she said yes. Because I was. I was a weirdo. It's supernatural. So everywhere you guys are pretending to be normal when you're so completely abnormal that you're just pretty much light workers in the human body and everywhere you're pretending to be something other than that and be small, delete, uncreate, and destroy all that now. Everywhere you guys are afraid to show up as your full infinite being potential in your body. delete, uncreate, and destroy all that and all the crap that you bought about what being a human looks like, like that it's limited, that it sucks, that it's full of drama, that you have to do what everybody tells you to do and only do it that way, and then you fit in, and then you're part of the sheeple, and then you can never get out. So anywhere you guys are doing that, delete, uncreate, and destroy all that now. Because what if your natural birthright was to show up the full expression of you as you? And everywhere you don't even know what that looks like, and you're pretending that you don't know what you really like when you already know what you like, because you want to do it anyway, like you know what you really want. So everywhere you guys are pretending that you don't really know, delete, uncreate, and destroy it all now. Okay, all the historical knowledge that you guys are using against yourself to stop yourself. Delete, uncreate, and destroy the whole thing now. Okay, everywhere you guys are locking in your emotions and your physical tissue and you can't get out of jail, delete, uncreate, destroy all that now. Everywhere you guys are emotionally bondaging yourself to your body in a way that makes your body want to shut down, delete, uncreate, and destroy the whole thing now. All the parts of you that feel ripped in pieces. Delete, uncreate, and destroy all that now. Yeah. You guys let go a lot of stuff. All right. Okay, cool. So what would it take? Now I want you guys to just imagine and just try this on for a little bit. Any part of it that you can get a glimmer. If you could package and make the perfect model, like imagine you're like the perfect car model, right? You can be any model you want to be. You want to be sporty? You want to be free? You want to be fun? You want to be bubbly? Whatever expression that you want to show up as intellectually. You want to be smart and moody or you want to be like, you know, smart and happy? Physically fit? Energetically strong? Okay, cool. Okay, so I want you to just imagine like money is no object. You could wake up tomorrow. What qualities in your energy field do you want to have? Whatever that looks like for you. All right. And everything in the way of that, you're going to delete it all and then just keep filling in with the smart you, the vocal you, the part of you that can speak and tell your truth, the part of you that's happy, kind to people, bubbly, but you also have good boundaries. You don't let people dump on you. You're strong and you're loving and you're kind and you're generous and you have more than enough and you share your wisdom with the world. You let everybody know that there's a spark of God in you, a spark of source energy in you that completely fills you up. Yeah. Makes you feel like yourself and loves everybody and everything in the world. So please fill up with that. Somebody was complimenting me saying I was not normal. Okay. Somebody was saying I feel heaviness in my body. Okay, so everybody who has any other extra heaviness or weepiness or stuff in your body, delete, uncreate. Yeah, all that. So anybody who's cutting themselves off from their full expression for any reason, delete, uncreate, and destroy all that now. All right, you guys are feeling great, happy, so my light will shine, joyful and hopeful. Raven's saying she's a little scattered. Sometimes when you're clearing things, Raven, you'll feel a little scattered because the old, Stuff that's not going to be with you anymore is leaving. Yes. All right, so we're going to do one more clearing on this, okay? All right, so any other leftover thing that you guys are resisting giving up for whatever reason, okay? Known to you or unknown to you. Anywhere you're resisting giving up some stuff that doesn't serve you anymore, okay? Delete, uncreate, destory, all of it. And let's just fill in with the totality of you. Pure source energy is who you are. Pure source energy expressing itself through your emotional field, your intellectual field, and your physical field, right? And so you get to model yourself however you want to model yourself. And everywhere you guys are blocked and think abundance is somehow separate from you, not a part of you, and not even like you, which is totally untrue, by the way. All the lies and bullcrap that you did with that. Delete, uncreate, and destory all of it. Any other crap that you guys are hanging on to, whatever that is for you. Delete, uncreate, and destroy all of it. All right. Okay, so we're going to cut some cords with all the family members that don't fit. All right. So connect to the light. Yep, connect to the light for a minute. Expand your energy out. Okay. Now, can you guys, like, feel that? You feel really different just expanding your energy out. Remember, when you expand your energy out, all the other stuff that's bothering you becomes like a little gnat, like a little fly. It's, you know, it doesn't take up your whole world. All right. So, everywhere you guys are allowing interference in the relationship with yourself and not truly adoring and loving yourself, will you please uncreate, delete, and destroy all of it. Everywhere you have no idea who you are and what you're here for. Delete, uncreate, and de -story all of it. Across all time dimensions, space, and realities. Across all soul decisions. Across all karma. Will you please uncreate and delete all the places where you don't let yourself be you? Okay, all the historical baggage. Delete, uncreate, and de -story all of it. Alright, so. All the past relationships with lovers, any of those that you need to cut the cords to that are still energetically tied to you and sucking the life out of you in any way, making your relationship with your enemy mate unprofitable, delete. Uncreate and destroy it all now. All the unprofitable relationships that you have in your life. We're going to cut the cords. Delete, uncreate, and destroy all of those now. All the places where you don't want to let go of things that no longer serve you. Delete, uncreate, and destroy it all now. Everywhere you won't allow abundance in the form of happy, profitable relationships. Delete, uncreate, and destroy all of that now. Okay, so let's think of your mom. Okay, any contracts that you have with your mother that are no longer serving either of you. You know, let's let her be free and let's let you be free, right? So everybody's connected to source. We love everybody but not judge them. But anywhere your mom's ideas, thoughts, or beliefs are in any way. creating a lack of abundance for you, delete, uncreate, and destroy all of it now. Anywhere else your mother or your mother's family lineage is creating a lack of abundance in your life, delete, uncreate, and destroy all of it now. All the personal agendas that you have between you and your mother or your mother's energy towards you that are creating any place where you're blocked in generating profitable, fun, loving life. for you. Delete, uncreate, and destroy all that now. Okay, cool. Anywhere you care less about something in your life that's therefore creating a place where you have no, like, less profit, delete, uncreate, and destroy it all now. Okay, so how many places are you guys hung up and not profitable in your life? Delete, uncreate, and destroy all that now. Alright, everywhere you have your dad connected to you, think of your dad. Anywhere your father is connected to you in any way that's unprofitable. Delete, uncreate, and destroy all that now. Anywhere your father's lineage or your father in any way has a contract or an agreement with you that in any way limits your life. Delete, uncreate, and destroy all that now. anywhere you're giving your power over to your mom and dad, waiting for their approval. Delete, uncreate, and destroy all that now. Everywhere you and your father have tons of agendas keeping each other stuck to each other in a way that doesn't give life to each other. All those ways, delete, uncreate, and destroy all that now. So let's give your father and mother permission to let go of you. in a way, if they're holding you in any way that's kind of negative, even though they might think it's positive. So just give them permission to do it. They're connected to source, you're connected to source, and all is well. Okay, any other relationship that pops up that you want to clear right now, that you have any contracts with, any friends, coworkers, bosses, exes, ex -lovers, ex -friends, anybody, siblings, so any other... that you want to cut cords to kind of just allow them to pop up in your mind and we're going to delete them uncreate them and destroy all that now any other person place or thing that's blocking your profitable happy life delete uncreate and destroy the whole thing now all right that's kind of exciting you let go of a lot of things there Okay, there's no other place in your hearts that allows for abundance. Anywhere you have places that you're blocking abundance in your own heart, your own relationship with yourself, delete, uncreate, and de -story all that too. Everywhere you're not allowing the creative expression of you to show up in your life, in your body, delete, uncreate, and de -story all that now across all time, dimension, space, realities. Yeah, there. Okay, and any other game you're playing with yourself where you have to block your abundance and pretend you don't remember who you are. Delete, uncreate, and do story, all that too? All right, you guys are doing good. All right, so fill in with profitable, happy, abundant, glorious relationships. Okay, Bill's saying he can't meet a maid until he gets beyond his financial issues, but also wants to make sure he meets somebody who loves him. So Bill, everywhere. You're right, that will create a block, okay? That belief where you, so anybody who's thinking, oh, I can't be with somebody until I'm wealthy or whatever, delete, uncreate, and just story all of that. And then at the same time, anywhere you're thinking, well, I want to meet somebody who loves me for me, not just my money, delete, uncreate, and de -story all of that. What if you had this belief that I have so much money, so much more than enough money that it doesn't really matter? Wouldn't that be cool, right? Okay, so everything in the way of that happening for you guys. Delete, uncreate, and destroy all of it. Any other family lineage that you guys are holding on to, delete, uncreate, and destroy it all. Anywhere you guys still insist on holding all this energy in your tissues, delete, uncreate, and destroy all of it now. Yeah, so just imagine that you just kind of cut the cords and then send them back with a, you know, like a bolt of love, you know, like a lightning bolt of love. So some people are saying, I can see why I was pretending to be smaller. I'm now feeling excited to show up and co -create with the universal part of me. Some of you guys have some things going on where you still feel a little stuck. Okay, so everything this is, I'm going to tell you, you guys are probably going to be processing this for another hour and a half because this is really heavy. So everything creating all this, we can bypass time if you'll let it. Okay, so any of you guys stuck in time and you won't let this stuff go out, delete, uncreate, and destory all of it. Everywhere you guys don't want to clear the main root cause of all your problems, delete, uncreate, and destory all the main root causes. Basically, the only main root cause of a problem is everywhere you think you can't. You can't, you shouldn't, or you won't. Okay, delete, uncreate, and destory all of that. All right. She was saying that all the things I'm reading are going on with her. Yeah, so somebody is saying don't worry about all the hows because, you know, remember, now you're going to fill in with the what would it takes, right? You don't have to worry about the how it's going to work out sort of, right? We're going to ask the universe to just kind of put the thought in your head, the feeling in your body so that you know what it is that you need to do. Because here's the real truth. At the end of the day, if you're being you, you're truly, truly, truly being you. Everything shows up for you the way it needs to from the energy that you radiate, okay? So you can see that holding on to all these fears and all this stuff is really not going to serve you because it just generates more of the same. And you guys are in the middle of this. This is only the sixth or seventh day, okay? I mean, look at how many really cool things have happened. And somebody's asking about if they've taken drugs in the past. It's kind of a good one to do if you've taken a lot of drugs or alcohol or all those things. It's just saying anything that I thought or felt. While on drugs, that is of a lower frequency. I delete it, uncreate it, and de -story it all. I would do that, you know, 40, 50, 60 times. Okay, so I'd like really get rid of all that stuff. What happens when you do drugs, you go a little unconscious and you kind of store it in a different part of your brain, let's just say. It kind of goes in a different part of you and you can't always recall what you thought. All right, so here's your blank place where you can play with it. make it in a journal do whatever you want to do with it all right ready so here's what you guys are going to play with what would it take fill these in with all the things that you filled in what would it take for you to express more abundance than you ever could believe you could and everything in the way of that delete it all what would it take for you to live your dream life with ease what would it take for the universe to deliver to you the perfect person who can help you get your physical expression the way you really want it What would it take for the universe to deliver to you the perfect formula for how to live your life, your way? What would it take for the universe to deliver to you all the thoughts, feelings, ideas, know -how, knowledge, information so that you can express yourself in the way that you truly wish and desire to express yourself, right? Or it could be, what would it take for me to have an abundant, grateful relationship with my mother? Even if that's not the case, just do the what would it take, see what happens. What would it take for you and your kids to get along amazingly? What would it take for any old cords that you have with any exes be deleted? What would it take for everything in your life that doesn't help your relationship with yourself to be made happy in some way? What vibrational energy can you become to have unlimited resources brought to you? in your relationships and your self -expression? What vibrational energy can you become to have, you know, 20 new friends that are on the path of light with you, right? What would it take for 10 of your other friends to turn to the light and be on this path with you? What vibrational energy can you be to radiate so much love that people ask what you're doing? And then you can maybe be a life coach for them and get paid, right? What would it take for so much vibrational energy to come through you that you are a walking light beam, you know, that people just turn around and look at you because you are just so radiating light. And they want to give you money because they want to have what you have. How about that? And that's how you can get paid for being you. All right, awesome. I wanted to go to this one slide right here. As you guys know, You can click here, download the audio and the PDF. I would probably listen to this session one more time because we did so many cord cuttings. On this page right here in the journal below this, there's places where you can ask questions and post some comments and help each other out. You can always go on Facebook and make some comments about what's going on for you and some of the wins that you've had while you're doing this. So fill in your entire garden, do some more what would it takes, say the energy statements, and try to live in as much truth as you can. All right, many blessings. 

====================

LESSON 8: Clearing the Fear of Numbers

- Hey, this is Christie Marie Sheldon, and you're listening to a recording I did of a series of 24 live group sessions on clearing your abundance blocks and here's what we're going to cover today in this session number eight. First, we're going to check in with your wealth garden. We'll do a mini meditation to see how things look after you've done all the work in the last three sessions. We're going to see what's changed, how you and your garden have grown together and then I'm going to ask you for your digits. So what's your number is the focus of today's work. In my work, I've really noticed that there are two things that bog people down on planet earth, relationships and money. Today, we tackle money and we're going to figure out what number or amount of money you want and the steps to get you there. And if there's any energy blocks or patterns holding you back, we're going to clear all that gunk out today, too. So let's begin. Hey, hi, how are you guys doing? I hope you guys had a great day today and it's just going to get better. So grab a journal or a piece of paper for your notes, be open to some love and some fun. Let's set your intent for a moment of what you hope to achieve today. So if there's just something that's kind of annoying you, you want to get rid of it, let's bring that up. Is there something you hope to achieve in the next 10 weeks? Bring that up. Is there something you wish to achieve in the next year? You know what I noticed? I can feel all your energy of course, but what I noticed is it's easier for you guys to conjure up what you want. And I want you to do a little check in and notice when you get really clear with the universe, it makes it easier for the universe to deliver the goods to you. So again, it goes back to when I first started consciously really, really manifesting, I thought, you know if I manifest 50% of everything I'm asking for, I have a really, really, really, really good life, you know? And now it's pretty much more than that. But if I hadn't learned to ask so much, where would I be? So any energy you guys want to release, bring that to the forefront, let's journey together and generate some unlimited abundance. All right, so we have some success stories. Jean found out that a manager at her company nominated her for a $500 recognition award. Combined with an another award that she won, saving money on car repairs, She's already manifested $10,050. She says well on her way to manifesting $5,000 in two weeks. All right, Jean, woohoo! Jean's probably never really just asked for $5,000 randomly to the universe and she already manifested $1,050 from it. Sharon had a great trip to Hong Kong and on the plane home, she sat next to a Chinese doctor who ended up hiring her to tutor his daughter. And she was basically retiring from academia and wanting to have like her own consulting business. So as soon as she set that intent in the world, she asked for $100 an hour two hours a week for the next 18 months for the Chinese doctor's daughter, which is an extra $12,000, as soon as she said, hey, I want the university to give me private consults so that's what happened. So what if all of you guys are pretending to be normal when you're truly actually weird? So Laurine is enjoying being weird, listening to her inner guidance. She's experiencing ease in cashflow and income through temporary means while she's still looking for a permanent job, but she's also started to release a lot of weight, she said, from all the clearings. And she said that she had some diabetes and that she's noticed some changes in how her food tastes and she's craving a little bit more fresh fruit and veggies because a lot of the stuff we eat, the sugar and the stimulants and all that, sometimes we're craving those things because it's like a cover so that we can dumb ourselves down so to speak. So sometimes all the stuff that we're craving is just covering us so that we check out some more in our lives so we can justify everything else that we've manifested. All right so today is an exciting day. We're going to put you through a mini mini meditation so we can check and see what your garden looks like and you'll see that it's probably a little different. So close your eyes, and if you're driving, just follow along and just trust that you can totally know the answer with your eyes wide awake. Okay, so for the rest of us, close your eyes, see, sense or feel the light, take your energy up 300 feet, open, open, open, and allow the light, pure source energy to come through your crown, opening up your third eye for total clarity and knowing, opening up your ears so you can hear your inner guidance, opening up your throat so you can use your creativity, your expression in the world. Opening up your chest, so you have deep compassion, gratitude, love for yourself and others. Down your arms as a full extension of this love outwardly in the world, into your stomach area where all your power is generated. Okay, into your hips and then literally see roots growing into the center of the planet. In the center of the planet is a really, really lovely, lovely place. It feels like pure love so as above and so below. So as this pure love to kind of like a trampoline, just like bounce the light right back up into your body, connecting to your heart and radiating like a 360 degree sunshine. So you are connected now from above and below. Okay, ask this light to expand past your body, ask this light to radiate love and light past your house or the building you're in. Okay ask this light to radiate past your town. Ask this light to radiate past the state you're in. Ask this light to radiate past the country you're in. And ask this light to radiate past planet earth. All right so look down at your feet and you will see, sense or know that there is a path before you and just notice the texture. Is it grass, rocky, sandy? Just trust whatever pops in your head first and just take the path up the hill. There's a little mound or a little hill around you and just follow the path up that. And once you get to the top of the hill, see, look around, feel the energy, feel the goodness that's around you, and just notice somewhere there's a garden and it can be whatever version of garden shows up for you, a veggie garden, a cactus garden, whatever your deal is. And I want you to just walk into the garden and ask this garden to kind of feed your soul for a minute because you and this garden are going to be together for a little while. And ask this garden if it would show you one thing in it that's new that's going to be invited into your life. And whatever this item is ask it what it represents in your abundance. What does it represent in your life? And if you want more of it, ask it, how do I get more of you? Okay. And send love to it and ask it to send love to you. It supports you and you support it. It's a mutual relationship. All right, notice any other thing in the garden that's new and ask whatever this item is, ask what does this represent in your abundant life? And then notice, ask what do I do to get more of you? And if anybody's having trouble visualizing, just it's kind of like pretend, you just kind of make it up as you go along even if it doesn't make sense. Okay so how do I get more of you into my life? Okay and then send love to it and ask it to send love to you. It's a mutually satisfying relationship. And notice one more thing in that garden that's new, any other thing. Okay and what does it represent in your abundant life and how can you get more of it? And then send love to it and ask it to send love to you, completely and totally supporting you, mutually satisfying relationship. Now, if there's any other thing you would like to plant in your garden for your future, please plant that now. Send it some love, water it with kindness, ask it to grow in your life, ask it to show up magnificently. I love the word magnificent, magnifies scent, ask it to show up magnificently. And if there's any little thing that you would like to change in your garden, something you notice that you don't prefer, just like fix that right now. You and your garden are one. You can communicate with it and it'll do what you need and it will completely support you and act as a representational energy for what you're manifesting in your life. It's your sacred garden, the place where you can come and create the future that you desire. So any other thing you need to gift it or have it gift to you, just ask for that one more time to show up. All right. And when you're ready, just open your eyes, take out your journal and tell us a couple of things that happened for you guys. So write down what you noticed. Let's see how it's different from everything that you'd done before. Torah planted a money tree. Then, I decided I wanted a money orchard. All right, I love it. Got a blue azalea, which was a new client. So this is really cool Raya and you're going to have to email us and let us know when that new client shows up. That's really awesome. Wanda had more connection to source. Julia said it was spectacular, had no problems, a wild wave of color and light. A red poppy for love for Rosalynn. When I asked how to get the life partner, she didn't hear a response. So I would just keep going to your garden Rosalynn and just keep asking. Maybe it's being set up and they don't know the what yet. I don't know what krugerrands are. Alison said she had a tree with krugerrands as leaves. I'm sure that something, I don't know what it is. A big rosebush for love, juicy green, tomato plant and then a fountain. Benches, I was told to relax and allow. Kavita had so many trees bearing so many fruits that the trees were like just overloaded and the fruits keep falling down wanting her to catch 'em. Sunlight and joy. Garden, fame with publishing her book. Money tree and sowed some more prosperity seeds. She said she's single, Aaliyah, but her husband in the future showed up. My garden said love my body, and if I want more money because it's in the physical dimension. So love your body and then more money will show up. Yeah 'cause you're spreading love and good cheer to who you are here. A bunny which represents abundance. And when I asked for more, lots of bunnies showed up. A waterfall, rain forest, fields and bridges. Tree with all the family members as branches. I kind of, ooh, that'd be kind of cool. A grotto with an image of Madonna, a black Madonna, representing total faith, nurturing and cared for. Peace and calmness. I planted my husband, who I haven't met yet. You guys are manifesting some good stuff. I allowed myself to create my garden exactly as I want, a rose garden, gold. Two big trees, which indicated two steady strong sources of income. You know, that was great, Terrence, that would make a lot of people happy. German currency. A sneaker representing lacing and tying the pieces of my life together. I have a path in the back, but still dark. So Raven, you could go back and manifest a lot of sunlight and kind of change it to how you want it to be and then literally that will show up in your life, right? So this isn't just an imaginary play thing. Whatever energy you're involving yourself in will show up. Lilacs in bloom, courage, enthusiasm, a pirate chest basically full of gold and coins and under and other jewels under the root of the apple tree. A lot of gold. Oh, thank you, Alison. Krugerrands are gold money bars. Thank you, I did not know that. Now I'm going to look 'em up. Lush and beautiful, new gorgeous orange tree filled with heavy golden oranges that represent gold and money, hummingbirds. Well hummingbirds are usually fast and light. So just go back in your garden and ask a hummingbird to show up and ask it what it means for you. A garden with no weeds and no work. All right so this is so awesome, you guys, because it's different probably than the first garden that you had. So adventures, spicy radishes, love and comfort, tomatoes, romantic love, rich purple eggplant, money tree with roots in the center of the earth. So this is great. So I encourage you guys to go back to your wealth garden and sow some seeds and plant the things that you want to plant. All right, I got so many of these cool things from you guys. So we're going to go to the next thing. So I wanted you to know that there was things that could show up in your life that are different and if you're willing to check in, even in the form of a meditation, a meditation will get your conscious mind out of the way if it's in the way for whatever you need to show up. So here we go. Today is about what is your number? Okay, so you guys worked on your wealth garden and now some things cost money on planet earth and one of, there's two things that pretty much screw up people on planet Earth I have noticed, relationships, number one, and not in any particular order, 'cause for everybody it's different, and money, number two, because both things have a lot of emotion attached to them. 'Cause if we want it, we can't have it, it creates like a lot of stress and fear and emotion. So we're going to work on clearing, we took it in the metaphysical and now we're going to make it real. Okay, we have to anchor this in your real world. Okay so every choice that you make on a daily basis, so I want you to think for a minute, how many times a day do you guys actually handle cash in some way? So I am curious, you guys, email me your, send a little note here, I want to see how much you guys are, one to two times a day, 10 times a day, every day, not enough, zero, five to six, 10 to 15, two to three, none, 30 times a day, five times a day, two times a day, none today, zero to six, three to four. Actual cash? Thank you, Michelle for asking that, no not actual cash. It could be your debit card. It could be paying your mortgage, paying your rent, writing a check, anything that has to do with the monetary transaction. Okay all day, all day? I wonder what you do Keena for a living. Mostly everybody, the average I'm seeing is usually about three to five and then there's some people it's like 10 to 20, but about three to five is usually about the average is what I'm getting right now. Okay, every choice has energy attached to it and when you added up what you wanted, there's literally a number that could get you that. Now, things can also come for free, I get that, but let's just say you had to buy it all and I want you to just think for a minute, okay, so write some numbers down and kind of add it up for yourself. Okay, pay me first. So I believe that we need to pay ourself first, okay? 'Cause you are basically source energy personified and you deserve to be paid for all the work that you do. So you have to determine first off what your number is that you're going to pay yourself. Like for instance, a number I suggest people do if they can is start paying yourself 10% of everything that comes in the door. And some people go gross or net, whatever you want, but just pick a 10% on one of the things, that's your little rule. And once you pick that number, it just goes into call it your self-love fund. Now I put fun divining because if you look at funding, it's kind of like fun with a D. And I look at the D as part of divine energy, right? So funding is really just divine fun energy that shows up in your life. And the more divine, fun energy that you have in your life, the more money you will generate. So just write a number of how much it will cost you per month, we're going to determine this per month, for your home, your car, your clothes, your utilities, all the kid activities that you got to pay for, I know those cost a lot, your retirement, future schooling, and any amount of money that you need to bring in to pay down your debts. And I know I just threw you a lot of stuff, but hopefully you guys have been playing with us a little bit and that you kind of know a little bit about what your numbers are. Now for some of you in this process, you decided, hey, I want to open my own, sorry, business. And so when you want to open your own business, sometimes you need a little funding, just like I think it was, I can't remember who it was earlier, that started opening her new business, basically. So she needed like office and a little startup fund, it was Maggie. Okay so if you need some extra training, 'cause you want to do something different with your life, like how much is that going to cost you? I know a lot of people that start businesses with nothing. I pretty much have always started my businesses with basically nothing. Okay so Emily was asking, what can I use the self self-love funding for? Okay, what I would encourage you to do is just never, ever, ever, ever touch it. And some of you are going, why would I never touch it? Okay so here's what I've noticed, 'cause I've practiced this and I've had clients do this and I've done this for about the last 15 years of my life. I put away a certain amount of money, it goes into an account that I never touch. I do invest it so I get some money from it, but I don't really do anything crazy with it okay 'cause I want it to feel secure. And then what I do is what I noticed is once I got to a certain number in the self-love funding thing, I actually felt my body relax. Like once I knew I had that much money put away that I was never going to touch some sort of energy came over me where I felt totally secure in the world. And then what happened is making money after that was completely and totally joyful and easy. So I think that everybody has a number and once you hit it, like usually for, it depends where people are at, but normally in the 10,000 people that I've read so far and worked with one-on-one, usually the number is usually between 30 to 50,000. And once somebody has that much money in their bank account, they generally feel comfortable. So start with 10% and go from there. If you only have three percent or five percent just start where you can start. Okay any action, like setting an intention in the universe for something to show up is better than no action. All right so remember we had different parts of your garden. So spirituality, if you want to go visit someplace, you need a little cash for that. If you want to go train with some courses or books or like the lover above thing, all those kinds of things, basically have a little cash funding need. Self-expression, again, trips, self-care, massages, a personal chef, all the fun stuff that you really want to show up in your life emotionally, intellectually and physically, like maybe a personal trainer. Now let's just say you want to have great relationships. Well, great relationships are usually with time and compassion and kindness and love and fun. So what kind of activities would you be doing to generate more of that? It could be just family game night, it doesn't have to cost a lot of money, but for some people, hey, I want to go to France on a honeymoon and have the most romantic experience of my life. So whatever those things are. All right and for those of you who are going I have no clue, hopefully that's not anyone, just a pick a number that seems, just resonates. And yes, I was asking Samir for monthly. Okay so basically you're picking the number of the wealth garden that you generated. So the wealth garden that you generated, how much is that going to cost you? So what's your number?

- So Basil says 50,000. Saradel said 20 grand, 10,000, 10,000. Any other numbers you guys have? 18,000, 250,000. Okay Gabriela, it feels a little overwhelming because I'm behind in the number. Well, this is okay because we're going to break it down. Okay so how do you eat anything? You eat it one bite at a time. Okay seven grand a month, 40,000 a month, 31,000 a month, 50,000 a month, 320,000 a month, 20K a month, 10K, 20K, 10K, 8,000, 500,000, 15,000, 50K, 20K, 25K, 32. Now Susan, no, this is your total number, but I was explaining what the self-fund number was. So it's the total number. Okay so I got lots of numbers, anywhere from 800,000 to 100 million. Okay so now that you guys have at least a number that you want to play with, and I'm going to encourage you to pick a number that currently resonates and you can change it at any time, that is your monthly number. Now, if it's a super-duper big number and like if it's you're picking I want to be a millionaire monthly, but currently you're only earning $5,000 a month, what I'm going to encourage you to do is now pick a secondary number. And the secondary number is what your next big jump is. And we're going to ask for both numbers. We're not going to limit how much you can make in the world. So we're going to ask for both numbers. Remember I told the story in one of the first sessions about how when I just randomly started asking for lots of numbers and all those numbers showed up, which then created the total that I was looking for? Okay, so do you guys have your secondary number? Okay so now we're going to do a clearing. We're just going to do a general clearing for a minute, okay? So all the places, all the self-doubts, I hear all the party pooper attitudes that make you believe, think, feel that you cannot get your monthly nugget, like your monthly number that you need. So anywhere you bought and sold that bunch of crap to yourself, delete, uncreate and de-story the whole thing. So everywhere I hear you've digested everybody else's bad news about money, including your mom and dad and any authority figure you grew up with, will you please now uncreate, delete and de-story the whole thing across all time, dimension, space, reality, across the board wherever it lies. Okay now all the places where you're feeling like you're funding will never, ever, ever, ever show up, will you please now delete, uncreate and de-story the whole thing across all time, dimensions, space and reality? Okay I don't know why, but party poopers, the energy keeps coming up. So all the party pooper naysayer, oh, you could never do that kind of stuff that you guys bought about yourself, delete, uncreate and de-story at all, everywhere you guys are pretending to be the same kind of humans that everybody else is, worry, worry, worry, stress, stress, stress about money, delete, uncreate, and de-story all of that. Okay, anywhere this is overwhelming, delete, uncreate and de-story all of it. Everywhere you are underwhelmed in such a way that you don't ever think you'll achieve it, so therefore why bother, delete, uncreate and de-story all of that, across all time, dimension, space, reality. Okay so now we're going to fill in, what would it take for your number monthly to show up in your life? And everything in the way of that, we're going to delete all that. What would it take for this number and the idea that generates this number to be brought into your world? And everything in the way of that, delete it all. Everywhere you guys are scared of money, delete, uncreate and de-story all of that. Everywhere you believe that money is an object that you can never attain, delete, uncreate and de-story all of that. So whatever your secondary number is, what would it take for the next big jump? What would it take for you to take a new step towards this? And everything in the way of that, delete all that. Okay so what divine inspiration are you hiding from yourself so that it will never, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever manifest? Anywhere you're blocking your inspiration of how that could show up, delete, uncreate, and de-story all of it. Everywhere you're pretending to not know what to do with your life, delete, uncreate, and de-story all of it 'cause I can read it in the energy field. You guys really do know what to do. You might be a little afraid of taking action or you might need a little more training on something, but ultimately, you guys know what you want to do it feels like generally. Okay there. And if anybody listening says, oh, I really don't know what to do, then take the first step. If your whole thing is I want to help people or do something I love, then pick something you love and keep asking how can I make money doing this? So all the things that you guys are hiding from yourselves 'cause you don't think you can make money doing something you love, delete all that. And generally speaking, owning a business or having some sort of business creates the most freedom for yourself as long as you're not working 24/7. But something that you create the own funding and time structure for would make you the most amount of money generally. And so if you wanted to start your own business, what would you do to make a lot of money? Okay and everything in the way of that, delete all that. Okay, so how are you guys doing? You still feeling heavy about it or you feeling lighter? Kavita, if you have a headache, just let go of anywhere you don't think that you can do this. I started seeing swirly lights that I've never seen before, yawning. Remember yawning is rebooting. So everywhere you guys are not letting go of everybody else's preconceived notions about how you do money 'cause really what I feel like you guys are running into is that you're trying to do money the way everybody else does money. Honestly, I could tell you story after story of all the really cool miracle things that have happened for me about generating random amounts of money, but honestly how I did it was I just pretended I didn't believe anybody else that I couldn't have it and I kept walking around and telling the universe that I fricking deserved it and it's going to happen now and what would it take? And then literally with that kind of energy, I deserve it, this is going to happen now and what would it take, it would just show up. All right, so fun, fun, fun, very lighthearted exercise, heavy and have no clue what I'd do. Feeling a little bit odd, slightly nauseated. So no, you're not really cutting off numbers if you pick a number, you're just picking something that you can kind of start with, okay? But you could say, literally, you guys can all wake up tomorrow morning and say, what would it take for me to generate $100? What would it take for me to generate your $999? What would it take for me to generate today $2,500? What would it take for me to generate four grand? What would it take for me to generate 20 grand this month? What would it take for me to generate a 44,000 this month? What would it take for me to generate 64,000 this month? And all those numbers will kind of get popped into your reality field so that something new can show up. Okay so everywhere you guys don't feel like you deserve it to be this easy, delete all this. So again, any societal programming that says you have to do money, it has to be hard, you have to work your tush off and then there's no reward, okay, delete all that. Anywhere you guys think only millionaires have money, you don't, okay, delete all that stuff. Okay there. Okay if your neck is hurting, what creativity are you blocking? So anywhere you guys are blocking your knowing and creativity in your head, heart, neck, and shoulders, delete all that. Anywhere else you're blocking your creativity, head, heart, neck, and shoulders, delete all that. Okay so any idea that you have, funding can come through a partner. Funding can come through random money. I remember this story of, I think it was Anthony Robbins, but supposedly this lady went on stage and she said, "I need funding for my business." And she focused on I think it was like 250,000 and basically she won the lottery, that's how it showed up. So, you know what I mean? If you focus enough and just keep asking, money is not a serious subject, money has just got a lot of issues, like a lot of energy tied on from society. So anywhere money sucks, okay delete all that, anywhere credit card debt sucks, delete all that. Everywhere you guys have prior wounding about money, delete all that. Everywhere it's like shameful to have and be and need, delete all that. I'm telling you this money stuff is heavy 'cause people have so much significant on it. Okay so everywhere you guys are overwhelmed, stressed with this whole pick a number thing, delete and uncreate all of that. Okay so we're going to get a little more focused. Okay so we're kind of in the middle of clearing so the energy is stirred up. Okay so I'm going to ask a few more questions and I put these on a slide so that you guys can ask them all week, but we're going to start now. So stay connected to light and expand your energy field, all right? You guys are doing a good job. So what are you avoiding being that you can become to be completely capable of manifesting your financial number? And everything in the way of you guys being completely capable of manifesting your financial number, uncreate, delete and de-story all of it. What are you avoiding becoming to be completely capable of manifesting your financial number? And everything in the way of that, delete, uncreate and de-story all of it. What other things are you avoiding because you cannot become completely capable of manifesting your financial number? Okay everything that is, delete, uncreate, de-story it all, across all time, dimension, space, reality. Okay everything that's getting turned on right now, like all this weird heavy energy that everybody's like turning on in a good way, we're going to ask to delete it, uncreate it and de-story all of it 'cause an infinite being is infinitely capable of creating infinite possibilities to basically create a reality around you where anything can show up. So remember you have a reality bubble and in this reality bubble is all your points of view, thoughts, and feelings. So if you change your thoughts and feelings and points of view, the reality bubble changes. And so again, you can kind of just all of a sudden pull that into your field. So everywhere you guys think is going to take a long time and you're trying to manifest through time like normal people where you do creating and de-storying and like all the polarity stuff of hard work, yeah that's what you guys are doing, okay everywhere you guys are doing that stuff, delete, uncreate and de-story all of it. Okay anywhere you guys are pretending to be human instead of an infinite being in a human body, delete, uncreate and de-story all of it. Okay all the time that you guys are trying to push everything through instead of just getting above it, being infinite and popping it into your field. So some of you I can feel don't know what I'm talking about. Basically, imagine you have a reality bubble and it's full of all your stuff. What we're doing when we're clearing things is we're blowing up all the misinformation that's in your reality field. And all the stuff in your reality field that's in the way gets blown out, then you allow infinite possibilities in. So all of this stuff is being in, like when we say this, you guys are actually pulling this energy up and so it might be intuitive, it might not be a conscious thought, okay. So this is kind of just all those weird stuff that you guys have behind the scenes that you're probably not aware of to even know to ask for to clear, that's why I'm doing it this way, that's why I gave you these statements 'cause you won't really remember 'em 'cause your mind, we're kind of taking your mind out of it, going behind the scenes and finding all your back programs, like all those like logged in data points that keep you stuck. Okay so what are you guys not becoming to pretend you can't become it? Okay again, it's not a logical thing. You guys just pulled up all the energy. Most of you guys are keeping this kind of pretending energy behind your back. So what are you guys not becoming, basically avoiding, to pretend that you can't become it? 'Cause an infinite being can be anything. So if you're not being it, then you're pretending. So everywhere you guys are pretending that you can't be it, delete all that. Okay any other energy that you guys are not becoming for any reason that would manifest your future desires, delete, uncreate and de-story the whole darn thing okay, across all time, dimension, space, reality, all the places that you guys are avoiding and pretending that you can't become whatever's needed to manifest your financial number. Okay so your number is kind of up in the air because some parts of you don't believe you can get it. So all the places where you guys don't believe that you can actually manifest this number completely randomly from out of nowhere, delete, uncreate and de-story all of it. All the historical evidence that you guys are using as the way to create your future, 'cause you're trying to create your future from your historical evidence, I never create my future from my history, I create it from my now and every choice that I make now, right? So everywhere you guys are dragging your historical evidence into the future, delete, uncreate and de-story all of it now. Okay you guys just let go of a lot of stuff right there, that's really good. Okay any other history, any other soul choice, any other karma, any other parental genetic imprinting, anywhere in your holographic field or morphic field of energy that you're holding all this stuff that you pretend that you can't be, delete all that. All right, Sharika is going, oh my God, the pain is gone. Gloria is saying, look at this, we're going to clear this for Gloria, she's feeling little guilty because her boss offered to give her stocks for her future today and she doesn't want to take it from his kids. All right everything creating that stuff, delete, uncreate and de-story at all. Gloria, what if it's his greatest gift and pleasure to see you happy? What if he gets a gift from you by seeing you happy? All right, awesome. So everywhere you guys don't accept the freebie gifts that the universe is going to just like bring to you, what if the universe was this vibrating gift giving machine that just keeps wanting to give you gifts over and over and over and over and over again? And you guys are thinking, wow, I feel guilt, I'm not good enough, I can't do it, don't bring it to me, bring it to somebody else. Yeah, what if that's what you guys are doing? So everything creating that, delete it, uncreate it, de-story it across all time, dimension, space and reality. What vibrational mismatches are you inviting into your life so you cannot be, do and have you? Yep, so vibrational mismatches are the lower energy fields, right? Fear, anger, worry, all that stuff. So any of those things that you're bringing into your field so you can't be you, have you, love you, get you, delete all that 'cause you're the greatest gift in your life. You're the greatest pleasure in your life. You're the greatest joy in your life. You getting you creates the most amount of energy towards anything in your world. Whew, all right. If you doze off Javier, while I'm clearing, your soul is just taking you a little deeper so you get some more. It's okay if you can't stay focused, this is a lot of unconscious stuff that we're clearing. I'm basically clearing millions and millions of thoughts, ideas and feelings from you guys and trying to do it in a half hour. Like seriously, I'm not exaggerating. I wish I was. But what energetic frequencies do I need to invite in to see my money manifest? And everything in the way of my money manifesting now, delete all that, uncreate all that and de-story all that. What magnificent gift am I refusing that if I would let it in would help me make more money, have a life I enjoy and let my wealth garden grow? And everything in the way of that, delete, uncreate, de-story it all across all time, dimension, space, reality, all history fields of energy, genetic fields of energy, morphic fields of energy. Yeah, all of that stuff. What conditions are you placing on manifesting money that if you gave those up would instantly bypass all the preconditions and gets you the cash that you deserve? Okay so everything that is, delete, uncreate and de-story all of it now across all time, dimension, space, reality. Yeah, a lot of shifting going on in this one. You guys are doing awesome. Okay all the preconditions that you are placing on manifesting money, like for instance, it can only come in this one door or it can only come if my husband gives it to me or it can only come through through my boss or it could only come through blah, blah, blah, all that crap and conditioning that limits everything that could show up in your life, will you please give it up right now? Uncreate, delete and de-story all of that stuff. And everywhere you guys are bargaining with God instead of reaching up to God and just choosing you right, see again, the universe will deliver it to you, but what if the universe is just waiting for you to step up and be a receiving field of invitation for all the cash to show up? What if it's the other way instead of do do do and what if you have to be a receiver? So everything in the way, delete, uncreate and de-story all of that. Whew, what formal invitation are you not giving yourself to manifest the love, the self-love, the self-worth, the self-esteem that will generate all the cash to come in your life? Okay so everywhere you won't allow yourself this invitation to open to a new level of energy, delete, uncreate and de-story all of that. All the invitations and receiving of gifts that you guys are refusing, delete all of those. What certainty are you pretending that you can't have in order to not manifest your life basically? Everything that is, uncreate, delete and de-story all of it. All the certainty that you're avoiding, you know, the knowing, right, the knowing? 'Cause if you know what to do, you'll do it, right? So all the knowing that you're avoiding, all the certainty and knowing that you're avoiding so that you can't manifest your cash, delete, uncreate and de-story all of it. Okay all the other career advice that the universe is trying to give you that you guys are avoiding and not choosing, delete, uncreate and de-story all of it across all time, dimension, space, reality. Any other career choice that you guys are avoiding knowing about, feeling about, living in, delete, uncreate and de-story all of it. What timing are you guys missing that if you would allow it now, like basically bypass time so you can show up all the energy needed to manifest the hundreds of dollars, the thousands of dollars, the hundreds of thousands of dollars and the millions of dollars? And everything that you guys are not letting in, delete, uncreate, de-story all of it across all time, dimension, space, reality, yep, all genetic imprinting from your parents and your parent's lineage that does not allow you to have so much fricking money, delete, uncreate and de-story all of it. There, okay that's really good. Whew, what energy can I become to make manifest all of my desires now? And everything in the way of that, delete, uncreate and de-story all your stories about that right now. Anywhere you guys want a different career, but you're avoiding choosing it because you think it's too hard and nobody will take you, delete, uncreate and de-story all of that. Everything else you guys think is too hard that it'll never manifest, delete, uncreate and de-story all that now. Okay, any other place, thing, idea, thought, feeling that you are avoiding becoming, delete, uncreate and de-story all of that now. What karma can you release right now, karma's just any unhealed stuff, okay, it's just a different way of phrasing it. So what karma can you release right now to make manifest your financial funding? And everything in the way of that, delete, uncreate, de-story all of it now. Somebody's saying, I'm not sure if I am experiencing pain or excitement. Well, here's what happens. The problem is when you're a kid, you're excited. You crawl up the tree, you want to jump off the tree and you're saying, woohoo, I want to jump off this tree. And your mom says, be careful and projects all her fear upon you. So what if excitement is really actually who you are and you are just psychically feeling your parent's fears about too much excitement in your life? So all the places where you won't let this much excitement into your life, this much joy into your life, this much knowing into your life, this much fun in your life, this much divine energy in your life, will you now uncreate, delete and de-story the whole thing? Any other karma that you guys are not allowing for whatever reason into your life, delete, uncreate and de-story all of it. Okay you guys are doing so good because whatever we're clearing right now, seriously, this is like millions and millions of thoughts, ideas, and feelings. If you think about it, you know, you have a thought, like, I don't know, let's just say 10 to 20 thoughts in a few seconds, let's just say 10 thoughts in a second. Okay so in every second, then you have thoughts times 60, it's a minute, times 60, that's an hour, times 24, that's a day. So how many thoughts and feelings are you guys conjuring up in a day? Okay so all of those that misalign you with your true intention which is to have wealth and abundance, will you please uncreate, delete and de-story all of that? And again, anywhere you guys are avoiding the career that you really desire, and career, when I say career, I'm not talking about just doing something for the money, I'm talking about something that you love, that supports you. All right there. Cool, you guys let go of that. Kyloo has said, I'm literally feeling all this popping in my body as the old stuff's getting kicked out. Wow, you guys are sending me love notes, thank you. Joanne, thank you this is what I need to be reminded that I am just this awesome. So are you, thank you everybody. I got popping in my body too. Seriously, you guys, you guys are doing so great. I threw you into a bunch of heavy stuff 'cause somewhere we need to get rid of this, okay? So some days are going to be light and some days are going to be heavy and this is one of those heavy days that we're going to just blow through a bunch of stuff. So let's keep turning on the energy a couple more times. So any other thing that you guys are holding onto that keeps you from knowing what your true financial abundance really could be, should be and everywhere you guys have these stupid blinders on that don't let you see the potential in everything, delete, uncreate and de-story all of it. Everywhere you guys can't look at something and see the potential money-making ability in it, delete, uncreate and de-story all of it. Everywhere you guys are desiring something and you won't let your heart feel it, delete, uncreate, de-story it all times a gazillion. Plus, all the other places where you don't have a life that you want a life, anywhere you could never, ever, ever have a life the way you want, delete, uncreate, de-story all of that. And anywhere you don't think you can move mountains to get something done. Could an infinite being truly, truly, if they really chose something, could you make it happen? Of course is the answer, of course, as long as you keep choosing it and don't waffle. So everything that creates this whole wishy washy waffly thing that you guys are doing, delete, uncreate and de-story all of it. Okay so Margaret's blanking out. That's just because honey, you're just clearing some unconscious stuff and it's literally, we're taking you so deep, it's going to, it's not going to make any sense to your mind so it just blanks out. Okay, people feeling better, powerful processes, sending you galaxies of love and light. Connie saying I can't possibly delete tons of negative stuff this quickly. Connie, you're an infinite being, you truly, truly can. Like you know those like stories about a mom lifts a car off her baby? Okay, how does she do that? She takes her infinite being and decides in that 10 seconds, this crap is not going to happen to me anymore, right? So you're totally capable. So you let go, I'll tell you, Connie, you let go of about 40% of what you need to let go of in order to like really get over your hump, okay? So you might want to listen to this one more time and then just decide I'm going to get over the 60% hump. All right, Nicholas is finally getting back to himself. So even though I'm doing them fast, seriously, you guys just, as long as you're connected to light, we're all connected to the energy that we're putting in here, your stuff is going to go. A cool buzzing on the line. I bet you if you guys look around right now, there's probably a lot more light in everything. It's like there's a lifting of filters were taken off. Okay any dark limiting part of you guys that's splitting you in half, delete, uncreate and de-story all of that. Samir's wondering why it starts heavy. And then it gets lighter? 'Cause light is truth and heavy is false. So you're not going to start light because you brought all your crap up when you started the session. Your soul soul knows you're doing this session so you're going to clear it all. If you don't feel anything, is it still going on? Yes, Ella, I can see that you let go of about 40% as well so you might want to like listen to it one more time. Exhausted is just your stuff leaving, Steve. So Steve, you have some cords with your mother. So cut any cords. Any of you guys that have any energetic cords with your mother that's limiting your abundance, delete, uncreate and blow those things up. Any cords of energy that are negative, limiting, holding you guys back with your father, delete, uncreate and de-story all of it. Any of your parents' stories about money, delete, uncreate and blow that up too. Okay, anywhere you guys don't want to get bigger than your parents, better than your parents or ahead of your parents 'cause you want their love, delete, uncreate, destroy all of that. Why don't you just go make tons and tons of money and have some fun and then you can take them along, right? All right, that feels better. Hopeful and optimistic. So here's what I'm kind of getting. You guys are probably going to still process the stuff for about four more hours, okay? So I'm just going to, we're going to keep the energy kind of going. And so what I'm going to just ask you to do like after this call, just kind of keep saying anything that Christie talked about, you can just say it like this 'cause the universe totally knows you guys were around, anything that Christie talked about that I am still holding onto that I need to let go of, I delete it all, okay? Okay. So fill in the blanks. What would it take for you to have more abundance than you could ever experience? What would it take for you to choose and do what's needed to make your number show up? What would it take, universe, to deliver my financial abundance funding number? What vibrational energy can I become to have unlimited resources and ease? Okay so you know the drill, you can go to this section, download the audio, the PDF slides, journal what happened for you, send some really cool, fun stories to the lover above people, let them know how you're doing, send love and light to them, give them a big old blessing. Decide what your next step to manifesting your financial expression number is. Whatever it is, okay? If it's cleaning out the closet, that's a first step. If it's calling a financial analyst so you can figure out what your real number might be and how you could do that, figure that out. And everything creating all this that's negative and lower just keep doing that. And if it's light, it's true, if it's heavy, it's false. Okay so when people are telling you stories, you're telling yourself stories, is it light or is it heavy? So just make sure in between sessions, you uncreate and delete a lot of things. Sometimes before a session, some of you might notice that you feel a little like you don't want to join or it's not very fun or I don't want to do it. That's your stuff, that's not really your rational part of you. So listen to the true part of you that says, you know what? I better show up so I can clear this stuff and be done with it once and for all. All right, you guys are so amazing. Thank you for letting me take you apart and put you into a new reality. Ciao for now.

====================

LESSON 8: Clearing the Fear of Numbers (Clearing Session Only)

Close your eyes. And if you're driving, just follow along and just trust that you can totally know the answer with your eyes wide awake. Okay. So for the rest of us, close your eyes. See, sense, or feel the light. Take your energy up 300 feet. Open, open, open. And allow the light, pure source energy, to come through your crown. Opening up your third eye for total clarity and knowing. Opening up your ear so you can hear your inner guidance. Opening up your throat so you can use your creativity, your expression in the world. Opening up your chest so you have deep compassion, gratitude, love for yourself and others. Down your arms as a full extension of this love outwardly in the world. Into your stomach area. where all your power is generated okay into your hips and then literally see roots growing into the center of the planet in the center of the planet is a really really lovely lovely place it feels like pure love so as above and so below so as this pure love to kind of like a trampoline just like bounce the light right back up into your body connecting to your heart and radiating like a 360 degree sunshine. So you are connected now from above and below. Okay, ask this light to expand past your body. Ask this light to radiate love and light past your house or the building you're in. Okay, ask this light to radiate past your town. Ask this light to radiate past the state you're in. Ask this light to radiate past the country you're in. And ask this light to radiate past planet Earth. So all the places, all the self -doubts, I hear all the party pooper attitudes that make you believe, think, feel that you cannot get your monthly nugget, like your monthly number that you need. So anywhere you bought and sold that bunch of crap to yourself, delete, uncreate, and destroy the whole thing. So everywhere I hear you've digested everybody else's bad news about money, including your mom and dad and any authority figure you grew up with, will you please now uncreate, delete, and destroy the whole thing across all time, dimensions, space, reality, across the board, wherever it lies. Okay, now all the places where you're feeling like your funding will never, ever, ever, ever show up, will you please now delete, Uncreate and destroy the whole thing across all time dimensions, space, and reality. Okay, I don't know why, but party pooper is the energy that keeps coming up. So all the party pooper, naysayer, oh, you could never do that kind of stuff that you guys bought about yourself. Delete, uncreate, and destroy it all. Everywhere you guys are pretending to be the same kind of humans that everybody else is. Worry, worry, worry. Stress, stress, stress about money. Delete, uncreate, and destroy all of that. Okay, anywhere this is overwhelming, delete, uncreate, and destroy all of it. Everywhere you are underwhelmed in such a way that you don't ever think you'll achieve it, so therefore why bother? Delete, uncreate, and destroy all of that. Cross all time dimensions, space, reality. Okay, so now we're going to fill in. What would it take for your number? monthly to show up in your life. And everything in the way of that, we're going to delete all that. What would it take for this number and the idea that generates this number to be brought into your world? And everything in the way of that, delete it all. Everywhere you guys are scared of money, delete, uncreate, and destroy all of that. Everywhere you believe that money is an object that you can never attain. Delete, uncreate, and destroy all of that. So whatever your secondary number is, what would it take for the next big jump? What would it take for you to take a new step towards this? And everything in the way of that, delete all that. Okay, so what divine inspiration are you hiding from yourself so that it'll never, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever manifest? Anywhere you're blocking your inspiration of how that could show up, delete, uncreate, and destroy all of it. Everywhere you're pretending to not know what to do with your life, delete, uncreate, and de -story all of it. So all the things that you guys are hiding from yourselves because you don't think you can make money doing something you love, delete all that. And so if you wanted to start your own business, what would you do to make a lot of money? Okay, and everything in the way of that, delete all that. Literally, you guys can all wake up tomorrow morning and say, what would it take for me to generate $100? What would it take for me to generate $999? What would it take for me to generate today $2 ,500? What would it take for me to generate $4 ,000? What would it take for me to generate $20 ,000 this month? What would it take for me to generate $44 ,000 this month? What would it take for me to generate $64 ,000 this month? And all those numbers will kind of get popped into your reality field. so that something new can show up. Okay, so everywhere you guys don't feel like you deserve it to be this easy, delete all this. So again, any societal programming that says you have to do money, it has to be hard, you have to work your tush off, and then there's no reward. Okay, delete all that. Anywhere you guys think only millionaires have money, you don't. Okay, delete all that stuff. Okay, there. Okay, if your neck is hurting, what creativity are you blocking? So anywhere you guys are blocking your knowing and creativity in your head, heart, neck, and shoulders, delete all that. Anywhere else you're blocking your creativity, head, heart, neck, and shoulders, delete all that. Money is not a serious subject. Money has just got a lot of issues, like a lot of energy tied on from society. So anywhere money sucks. Okay, delete all that. Anywhere credit card debt sucks. Delete all that. Everywhere you guys have prior wounding about money, delete all that. Everywhere it's shameful to have and be in need, delete all that. So stay connected to light and expand your energy field, all right? You guys are doing a good job. So what are you avoiding being that you can become to be completely capable? of manifesting your financial number and everything in the way of you guys being completely capable of manifesting your financial number? Uncreate, delete, and destroy all of it. What are you avoiding becoming to be completely capable of manifesting your financial number and everything in the way of that? Delete, uncreate, and destroy all of it. What other things are you avoiding because you cannot become completely capable of manifesting your financial number? Okay, everything that is, delete, uncreate, destroy it all across all time, dimension, space, reality. Okay, everything that's getting turned on right now, like all this weird heavy energy that everybody's like turning on in a good way, we're going to ask to delete it, uncreate it, and de -story all of it because an infinite being is infinitely capable of creating infinite possibilities to basically create a reality around you where anything can show up. So everywhere you guys think is going to take a long time and you're trying to manifest through time like normal people where you do creating and destroying and like all the polarity stuff of hard work. Yeah, that's what you guys are doing. Okay, everywhere you guys are doing that stuff, delete, uncreate, and destroy all of it. Okay, anywhere you guys are pretending to be human instead of an infinite being doing in a human body, delete, uncreate, and destroy all of it. Okay, all the time that you guys are trying to push everything through instead of just getting above it, being infinite and popping it into your field. Okay, so what are you guys not becoming to pretend you can't become it? Okay, again, it's not a logical thing. You guys just pulled up all the energy. Most of you guys are keeping this kind of pretending energy behind your back. So what are you guys not becoming? Basically avoiding to pretend that you can't become it because an infinite being can be anything. So if you're not being it, then you're pretending. So everywhere you guys are pretending that you can't be it, delete all that. Okay, any other energy that you guys are not becoming for any reason that would manifest your future desires, delete, uncreate, and destroy the whole darn thing. Okay, across all time to mention space reality, all the places that you guys are avoiding and pretending that you can't become whatever is needed to manifest your financial number. Got it. So all the places where you guys don't believe that you can actually manifest this number completely randomly from out of nowhere, delete, uncreate, and de -story all of it. All the historical evidence that you guys are using as the way to create your future because you're trying to create your future from your historical evidence. I never create my future from my history. I create it from my now and every choice that I make now, right? So everywhere you guys are dragging your historical evidence into the future. Delete, uncreate, and destroy all of it now. Okay, you guys just let go of a lot of stuff right there. That's really good. Okay, any other history, any other soul choice, any other karma, any other parental genetic imprinting, anywhere in your holographic field or morphic field of energy that you're holding all this stuff that you pretend that you can't be to lead all that. All right, Gloria is saying, look at this. We're going to clear this for Gloria. She's feeling a little guilty because her boss offered to give her stocks for her future today, and she doesn't want to take it from his kids. All right, everything creating that stuff, delete, uncreate, and destroy it all. What if the universe was this vibrating gift -giving machine that just keeps wanting to give you gifts over and over and over and over and over again? And you guys are thinking, wow, I feel guilt. I'm not good enough. I can't do it. Don't bring it to me. Bring it to somebody else. Yeah, what if that's what you guys are doing? So everything creating that, delete it, uncreate it. Do you story it across all time, dimension, space, and reality? What vibrational mismatches are you inviting into your life so you cannot be, do, and have you? Yep, so vibrational mismatches are the lower energy fields, right? Fear, anger, worry, all that stuff. So any of those things that you're bringing into your field so you can't be you, have you, love you, get you, delete all that. But what energetic frequencies do I need to invite in? To see my money manifest and everything in the way of my money manifesting now? Delete all that. Uncreate all that. And de -story all that. What magnificent gift am I refusing that if I would let it in would help me make more money, have a life I enjoy, and let my wealth garden grow? And everything in the way of that, delete, uncreate, destroy it all across all time, dimension, space, reality, all history fields of energy, genetic fields of energy, morphic fields of energy. Yeah, all of that stuff. What conditions are you placing on manifesting money that if you gave those up would instantly bypass all the preconditions and get you the cash that you deserve? Okay, so everything that is, delete, uncreate, and destroy all of it now. Cross all time, dimension, space, reality. Yeah, a lot of shifting going on in this one. You guys are doing awesome. Okay, all the preconditions that you're placing on manifesting money, like for instance, it can only come in this one door, or it can only come if my husband gives it to me, or it can only come through my boss, or it could only come through blah, blah, blah. All that crap and conditioning that limits everything that could show up in your life. Will you please give it up right now? Uncreate, delete, and destroy all of that stuff. And everywhere you guys are bargaining with God instead of reaching up to God and just choosing you, right? So everything in the way, delete, uncreate, and destroy all of that. What formal invitation are you not giving yourself to manifest the love, the self -love, the self -worth, the self -esteem that will generate all the cash to come into your life? Okay, so everywhere you won't allow yourself this invitation to open to a new level of energy, delete, uncreate, and destroy all of that. All the invitations and receiving of gifts that you guys are refusing, delete all of those. What certainty are you pretending that you can't have in order to not manifest your life, basically? Everything that is, uncreate, delete, and destroy all of it. So all the knowing that you're avoiding, all the certainty and knowing that you're avoiding so that you can't manifest your cash, delete, uncreate, and destroy all of it. Okay, all the other career advice that the universe is trying to give you that you guys are avoiding and not choosing, delete, uncreate, and destroy all of it across all time dimensions, space, reality. Any other career choice that you guys are avoiding, knowing about, feeling about, living in, Delete, uncreate, and destroy all of it. What timing are you guys missing? That if you would allow it now, like basically bypass time, so you can show up all the energy needed to manifest the hundreds of dollars, the thousands of dollars, the hundreds of thousands of dollars, and the millions of dollars, and everything that you guys are not letting in, delete, uncreate, destroy all of it. Across all time, dimension, space, reality. Yep, all genetic imprinting from your parents and your parents' lineage that does not allow you to have so much frickin' money. Delete, uncreate, and destory all of it. There. Okay, that's really good. What energy can I become to make manifest all of my desires now and everything in the way of that? Delete, uncreate, and destory all your stories about that right now. Anywhere you guys want a different career, but you're avoiding choosing it because you think it's too hard and nobody will take you? Delete, uncreate, and destroy all of that. Everything else you guys think is too hard that it'll never manifest. Delete, uncreate, and destroy all that now. Okay, any other place, thing, idea, thought, feeling that you are avoiding becoming? Delete, uncreate, and destroy all of that now. What karma can you release right now? Karma is just any unhealed stuff, okay? It's just a different way of phrasing it. So what karma can you release right now to make manifest your financial funding? And everything in the way of that, delete, uncreate, destroy all of it now. Somebody is saying, I'm not sure if I'm experiencing pain or excitement. Well, here's what happens. The problem is when you're a kid, you're excited. You crawl up the tree. You want to jump off the tree. And you're saying, I want to jump off this tree. And your mom says, be careful and projects all her fear upon you. So what if excitement is really actually who you are and you are just psychically feeling your parents' fears about too much excitement in your life? So, all the places where you won't let this much excitement into your life, this much joy into your life, this much knowing into your life, this much fun into your life, this much divine energy in your life, will you now uncreate, delete, and destroy the whole thing? Any other karma that you guys are not allowing for whatever reason into your life, delete, uncreate, and destroy all of it. Okay, you guys are doing so good because whatever we're clearing right now, seriously, this is like millions and millions of thoughts, ideas, and feelings. If you think about it, you know, you have a thought, like, I don't know, let's just say 10 to 20 thoughts in a few seconds. Let's just say 10 thoughts in a second, okay? So in every second, then you have thoughts times, you know, 60, it's a minute, times 60, that's an hour, times 24, that's a day. So how many thoughts and feelings are you guys conjuring up in a day? Okay, so all of those that misalign you with your true intention, which is to have wealth and abundance, will you please uncreate, delete, and destroy all of that? And again, anywhere you guys are avoiding the career that you really desire. And career, when I say career, I'm not talking about just doing something for the money. I'm talking about something that you love, that supports you. All right, there. Cool, you guys let go of that. So let's keep turning on the energy a couple more times. So any other thing that you guys are holding on to that keeps you from knowing what your true financial abundance really could be, should be, and everywhere you guys have these stupid blinders on that don't let you see the potential and everything, delete, uncreate, and destroy all of it. Everywhere you guys can look at something and see the potential money -making ability in it. Delete, uncreate, and destroy all of it. Everywhere you guys are desiring something and you won't let your heart feel it. Delete, uncreate, destroy it all times a gazillion. Plus all the other places where you don't have a life that you want a life. Anywhere you could never, ever, ever, ever, ever have a life the way you want. Delete, uncreate, destroy all of that. And anywhere you don't think you can move mountains to get something done. Could an infinite being truly, truly. If they really chose something, could you make it happen? Of course, is the answer. Of course. As long as you keep choosing it and don't waffle. So everything that creates this whole wishy -washy -waffly thing that you guys are doing, delete, uncreate, and de -story, all of it. Okay, any dark limiting part of you guys that's splitting you in half, delete, uncreate, and de -story, all of that. Exhausted is just your stuff leaving, Steve. So Steve, you have some cords with your mother. So cut any cords, any of you guys that have any energetic cords with your mother that's limiting your abundance. Delete, uncreate, and blow those things up. Any cords of energy that are negative, limiting, holding you guys back with your father, delete, uncreate, and de -story all of it. Any of your parents' stories about money, delete, uncreate, and... blow that up too okay anywhere you guys don't want to get bigger than your parents better than your parents or ahead of your parents because you want their love delete uncreate destroy all of that why don't you just go make tons and tons of money and have some fun and then you can take them along right all right that feels better so i'm just gonna we're gonna keep the energy kind of going and so what i'm gonna just ask you to do like after this call Just kind of keep saying anything that Christy talked about. You can just say it like this because the universe totally knows you guys are around. Anything that Christy talked about that I am still holding on to that I need to let go of, I delete it all. Okay? Okay. So fill in the blanks. What would it take for you to have more abundance than you could ever experience it? What would it take for you to choose and do what's needed to make your number show up? What would it take, universe, to deliver my financial... funding number okay what vibrational energy can i become to have unlimited resources and ease so just make sure in between sessions uh you uncreate and delete a lot of things sometimes before a session some of you might notice that you feel a little like you don't want to join or It's not very fun or I don't want to do it. That's your stuff. That's not really your rational part of you. So listen to the true part of you that says, you know what? I better show up so I can clear this stuff and be done with it once and for all. All right. You guys are so amazing. Thank you for letting me take you apart and put you into a new reality. Ciao for now. 

====================

LESSON 9: Speeding Up Manifestation by Clearing Indecision

- [Christie] Hi, this is Christie Marie Sheldon, and you're listening to a recording I did of a series of 24 live group sessions on clearing your abundance blocks and today we're going to cover a lot. This is day number nine. Today we're going to talk about the two places where you can live from, you can live from choice, or you can live from re-action. Notice that word re-action, doing the same thing over and over again. Choice equals empowerment, you're empowered when you make a choice. So are you making a choice in generating change or are you flying by the seat of your pants and reacting? Second, we're going to work on your plan of action. I want to talk to you a little bit about the overwhelming negative spiral of having no plan. I even have a little saying; 'Have a plan, get a life.' I'm going to teach you two different ways to manifest your plan, but I promise you if you have a plan, you'll feel less overwhelmed. So let's begin. Hi welcome, welcome. This is Christie, how are you guys today? Today, we are going to work on getting you guys out of negative spirals of overwhelm and get you on the right path for you. So as you know, grab a journal or a piece of paper, so you can jot down notes, whatever comes up for you, be open to some love and some fun, set your intent on what you hope to achieve today and bring the energy that you want to release to the forefront, because we're going to be doing a lot of deep clearing today, and let's journey together and generate some unlimited abundance. All right, so it's the month of July all about fireworks and celebration and I am going to start talking about some inspiring stories. Meredith, she kept asking, what would it take to manifest a thousand dollars? She got her answer when she was inspired to sell some old, gold jewelry and received $2,000 for it. And given the 50/50 split she was doing with her mom and the jewelry, she received exactly what she asked for. So good job Meredith, and I'm just going to clap for everybody. Kate Robertson manifested Jimmy Buffet tickets which she really, really, really, really wanted. Several recent wins, she said she turned her frustration regarding issues with her insurance company into a savings of $300 per year. She said her daughter found a $150 tech, and they're now getting back over $3,000 state and federal instead of having to pay out as they previously thought. She also used a higher vibration when dealing with her satellite provider and the agent was so struck with her higher frequency from where she was coming from that he said it made his whole week. He ended up giving her a number of freebies and discounts and special packages that gave them more service for less money. I love it, good job Kate. Okay, so we didn't set our intents for today, so let's set our intent. So what do you hope to achieve in this session? I could feel those, so whatever you guys did, you asked for some good things. My heart lit up when you were doing that. So we are going to talk about the two places where you can live from. Living from choice or living from re-action. So notice that word re-action. Doing the same thing over and over and over again. And as you know, the Chinese word for insanity is doing the same thing over and over and over again. So we're going to do a lot of clearing through this, and then we're going to go to some things we're going to have to write things down. So we're going to clear in this section. So I want you to just kind of check in for a minute and think of something that you're really, really stuck on. That you don't think that you can manifest. So it might be like paying off your credit card debt. It might be getting a new job. It might be, I don't know whatever it is. So in that session, in that part of you, are you living in fear or are you making a choice? Are you living in fear or are you making choices? So everywhere in this particular thing, so let me know what you guys are stuck on, I am curious. Somebody is saying, this is driving me crazy. My ex-husband doesn't allow me to communicate with my 14 year old. Margaret's saying she hasn't seen any evidence yet. Credit card debt, a relationship, finishing my book, having a beautiful home, manifesting money, selling my home, doing my intuitive leads, paying off credit card debt, finding a wonderful partner, profitable business, author, speaker and coach, debt. Underemployed, debt-free and moving on from a stuck relationship, attracting a trusted friend, paying off debt. So now in all of these things, are you guys living in fear or are you actually saying to the universe, "No matter fricking what, "like no matter what I'm going to make this happen." So we're going to do a clearing, so everybody let's just connect to the light for a minute. So close your eyes, connect to the light. So see sense or feel the light and take your energy up about 300 feet. Okay, so at this level, allow the light to come into your crown and allow the light to come into your third eye and allow the light to come into your ear chakras, and allow the light to come into your throat, allow the light to come into your chest, allow the light to come down your arms, allow the light to come into your stomach, torso. Allow the light to come into your hips, allow the light to come into your legs, allow the light to come into your feet and into the center of the planet. So imagine a big beam of light is connected from source all the way through you, and it dives into the planet into the center or earth. And imagine there's a nice little sweet spot in the center of the planet, where you can feel all was always, always, always connected. Okay, and like a trampoline, imagine that light just kind of bounces back up your feet, your hips, your torso, your heart, and it radiates out like a great central sun from your heart, 360 degrees in all directions and expand this light past the building you're in, and expand this light past the city you're in, and expand this light past the state you're in, and expand this light past the country you're in, and expand this light past planet earth. You guys are doing great. So all these things that you guys were saying that you still feel stuck in that you might be living in fear and you can't make a choice, everything this is will you please, please, please uncreate, delete, and destroy the whole thing across all time, dimension space and reality across all genetic boundaries, karma boundaries, any other soul choice that you made to keep yourself stuck, delete, uncreate and destroy the whole thing. Okay, this is good. Now everywhere you guys are planning on staying stuck in fear in the present moment and in the future where you just won't budge for whatever reason, all those reasons why you won't budge, will you please now delete, uncreate, and destroy the whole thing across all time, dimension, space, reality, anywhere in your life genetics, karma, any other place you have this stuck. Delete, uncreate and destroy all of it. Everywhere you think that there are boundaries between you and your future. There's like anywhere you have some fear-based agendas and boundaries where you're not going to let yourself get what it is that you truly, truly want, delete uncreate and destroy all of it times a gazillion. Everywhere you guys are choosing to stay stuck or live in some sort of fear re-action or pattern re-action, or anger re-action or historical re-action, anywhere you're choosing to keep reacting all those same things, delete uncreate and destroy all of it times a gazillion. Across all time, dimension space, reality, anywhere you're choosing to stay stuck for any reactive part of you, delete uncreate and destroy all of that. Anywhere your heart is closed to a new option, a new choice, delete, uncreate and destroy all of that. I'm going to ask you guys to conjure up a moment when you decided no matter what, something was going to happen in your life. Okay, I remember one of those moments myself. There was a couple of them, but I used to play sports like basketball and softball and I remember this chick her name was Joy, and she smacked a home run or what appeared to be a home run, Okay? So, I mean it went all the way to the fence, the left fielder was running for it, and I remember standing in the middle, almost in the middle of left field I was the shortstop and I was thinking, no matter fricking what today, she is not going to get a home run on my turf, no way. So from the deepest part of my belly, I decided it wasn't going to happen. So Wendy, the left fielder threw me the ball and I was in the middle of left field and I just, I don't even, it's like it was an autobody experience. I just turned around and just threw it towards the catcher because Joy was heading for home. And the thing was basically, I heard the glove pop, you know, that pop that happens with the softball, it went pop and then boom, and joy was out. Now Lisa, the catcher and you have to understand, I'm probably 12 years old, so this is from a while ago. So Lisa, the catcher says, "Christie, I have never had "a more perfect throw from you in my whole life." She said that was like amazing, like that was like perfect. What I know for sure in the deepest part of my belly is I decided the moment that ball went over my head and Wendy was running for the outfield that no matter what, Joy was not going to get a home run that day. So the reason I'm kind of trying to mock that energy up for you guys so you can feel it, because it was cellular, it was not going to happen. And there was no ifs, and, or buts about it. So I'm talking about making a choice like that for yourself. That whatever this thing is that you want to get unstuck about, are you willing completely and totally willing to devote your energy to no matter what this thing is not going to be a problem in my life anymore. So are you so willing to have that energy for this? So everywhere you guys are unwilling to create that much of a powerful choice, will you please uncreate delete, and destroy the whole thing. Everywhere you guys are still holding your boundaries, I can see some of you, I'm going to call you out. Cause I love you enough to call you out. There's about 30% of you guys that are still holding your boundaries up. and you're saying, "You know what, "I'm not willing to make that kind of choice, okay?" So for whatever reason that you're not willing to do that for yourself, will you please uncreate, delete, and destroy the whole thing? No matter what it takes. Because there's some part about you that is so restless that made you want to get on this phone call. There's some part of you that's so deserves your good, okay? So anywhere you're holding this energy in for whatever reason, and maybe it's not yours, maybe it's your parents, maybe it's genetic, maybe it's some karma, maybe it's some past life, maybe it's not from here. Okay, but anywhere you bought and sold this energy to yourself and it's still there, just please now uncreate, delete, and destroy the whole thing. All those stupid propaganda that you've attached to why you can't get un-stuck, all that stupid stuff delete, uncreate and destroy the whole thing. That's better some of you want to go, all right. And the rest of you guys that are holding onto these stories, delete, uncreate and blow them up now, destroy them all. All right, cool. So now I want to talk about making a choice. So we're going to go to the third one for a minute. Are you creating and generating a choice or are you flying by the seat of your pants? So any of you that are living in the no choice world where you're just not willing to make a choice for yourself and you pretend that you can't make a choice and you're doing la..la..la..la..la with your life, okay, everywhere you guys are doing that for whatever crazy reason, delete uncreate and destroy the whole thing. Okay, all the points of view, decisions, justifications, yeah, reasons why that you can't make a choice, delete uncreate and destroy the whole thing. Everywhere you're locking your future out because you're unwilling to move forward and make a choice, you just want to pretend that you can't make a choice? Okay, delete uncreate and destroy all of that too. So are you willing to create an action that's so powerful that it basically destroys all of your stuckness? Are you guys willing to take an action so powerful, like some bold new step that you've been pretending that you can't do, are you willing to do that today? Everywhere you guys are not willing to do that, or you pretend that you don't know what to do, okay, delete, uncreate and destroy all of that. It could be making a phone call, It could be asking your boss for a raise, It could be just deciding, hey I'm not going to do this anymore, I'm going to send out 20 resumes and see what happens. Or I'm going to start the business I've been procrastinating on. Okay, any of those things that you guys have been stopping yourself, and unwilling to take a bold action, delete, uncreate and destroy all of that too. And everywhere you guys are convincing yourself. I can't, I shouldn't, I don't know how, I don't know what to do, all of that stuff which will then block you in the future, right? Because basically all those I don't knows is basically locking off your intuition so you can even figure out what you're supposed to do Okay. So everything matters delete, uncreate and destroy all of it. Okay an infinite being knows what to do Remember there's two rules to an infinite being. They are totally aware and they can make choices and everything else is just a story. It really is, it's just history it's just a story make a choice, move forward that's all you have to do. And everything in the way of that, delete, uncreate and destroy all of that. Now remember the other day, we went over your financial expression fund and you guys came up with some numbers, some amounts of money that you need to live the life of your dreams and there was two numbers. There was the small number and the larger number and the big number was like the holy crap I get to live this kind of life number, and the other one was the in-between number. So we're going to work on your plans of action a little bit today. And I want to talk to you about the overwhelming negative spiral of having no plan. So if you've noticed some times when you can kind of like, think something through, if you have a plan, it makes it easier, right? So I have a little thing that I sometimes say to my clients which is have a plan, get a life. If you have a plan, then you can go get a life. Now, does everything always happen exactly according to plan? No and thank God because happy expectations, like happy really cool fun abundant things, can show up if you allow something new to show up but the plan will point you in a direction. And once you get down that road, you can therefore practice your manifesting, you can try it out, you can try something new on, you can like it or not like it, but you won't figure it out unless you get out of your stuckness or homeostasis, you got to move to a new direction. So if you don't have a plan, it's basically like you're saying, I don't really care enough to give myself a plan so I can actually get what I want, which is what I've been talking about what I want. And the whole thing is, is you get to create the recipe along the way. So there's chocolate chip cookies and we go through a zillion cookbooks and there's always, always, always a different chocolate chip cookie recipes right? But there is like only one recipe that you might prefer and so you're going to create your own recipe You know that the happy outcome is like chocolate chip cookies. But you get to pick the recipe, You get to pick the formula, you get to be in the middle of experimenting and maybe making some new creational recipe that nobody else has ever discovered, it's your choice. And so I'm going to to talk to you a little bit right now about the difference between specific outcomes and specific routines. So it's kind of like what I just talked about with the chocolate chip cookie, we all know what a chocolate chip cookie has in it. Butter, flour, sugar, vanilla, baking soda and chocolate chips. Now, you can choose a different kind of eggs. Somebody was beaming into my head you forgot the eggs. Okay so the eggs are in there too. But the thing is, is you get to choose what kind of flour, what kind of sugar, organic, no-organic, what kind of eggs, You know what I mean brown eggs, white eggs, farm fresh eggs, whatever kind of eggs. The red vanilla, vanilla extract, dark chocolate milk chocolate. So the thing is, is if you're stuck in the same routine, doing the same thing, and you say that you want to have different outcomes as far as the abundance, can you kind of see the mismatch a little bit? There's a vibrational mismatch. You're going to have to change your vibration, which is doing something different in order to create the new happy outcome. And energetically, when we connect up 300 feet, some people have been asking me why do we connect up like that? Because what I'm doing is forcing you guys energetically to be bigger than any problem. So imagine that your energy was the size of your body so anywhere between five feet and six feet something. But let's just say you meet up with another like arch nemesis and they're about the same size. It's going to seem kind of intimidating, right? But what if you made your energy what if you made your body like a hundred feet tall, 200 feet tall, 300 feet tall or expanded out past planet earth. What happens is you're being willing to create a larger force field of energy, a larger force field of light, a larger energetic dimension that you then can control more of the space and more of the outcome. So that's why you need to get bigger than the happy end result you can't really just be kind of stuck in a small place or a disempowered place and you know, its a little harder to manifest from that place. So your choices create your future, so every choice you're making, like if you're making a choice like right now, I'm vibing and I'm really happy that creates my future. Or right now I'm vibing and I'm like really irritated about X, Y, Z, whatever that is. With that energy also creates your future. So every choice has a vibration attached to it of either empowering or uplifting or the negative spiral of disempowering or being overwhelmed or all of those things. Okay so I'm going to to clear overwhelm cause I can feel that you guys have a lot of energy on this. So everywhere, everywhere, everywhere, you guys are completely overwhelmed and don't want to get alive and don't want to get a plan, delete, uncreate and destroy all of it. It's kind of funny when we talk about taking actions people get a little bogged down. Okay anywhere else you're overwhelmed what do I do? What do we do, I can't see the future so I don't know what to do everything that is uncreate, delete and destroy all of it. What would it take to create your future? Remember the story of somebody wanting to buy new clothes and she said, "Is it in my highest good to buy new clothes?" And she kept getting a no, but then she said, "What would it take for me to get some new clothes?" And she was guided to the secondhand shop where she got some really nice clothes for hardly anything. So what would it take opened up the door. All right so your life's happy end result is dependent on you figuring out your worthiness to go for it or not. So everywhere you guys do not think that you were worthy to get your really big happy end result, your financial expression number, delete, uncreate and destroy all of it. Everywhere you guys are stuck and you aren't going to let yourself get your financial expression number delete, uncreate and destroy all of it times a gazillion that's good. So now we're going to to go to the next section. Okay so the positive spiral is to have a plan. So if you have a plan, you can get a life. You can create a future with a lot of love, a lot of heart and that's like the from the positive vibration, manifesting abundance is easier, any way you manifest things is okay. You know one of the greatest stuck points I have to deal with, with clients is a well if I do this am I right? Well it's kind of like if you don't do this, you'll just be the same so choosing any choice is actually better than choosing no choice, Okay? Taking some kind of action which will generate a result, is way better than sitting around not making a choice. Because if you generate at least one result, then you know that you're manifesting works number one and once you got the one result, you'll say, "Wow, I didn't really like that." But you wouldn't know that you don't like that, unless you actually went for it and maybe, maybe, maybe you'll actually love what you got. Okay, so any choice is better than no choice. Taking action is better than no action. One of the lowest vibrations I've found on people, is waiting, okay you want to stick yourself? Just sit around and wait okay and don't do anything because then you'll start feeling guilty and shame because you're not doing anything or fearful or angry, or just really stuck in the mud but usually it's guilt and shame that makes people wait. So any of you guys that are waiting for some future to show up, but not actually do the work for it delete, uncreate and destroy all of it. Everywhere you guys are not willing to take proactive measures and create your future, delete, uncreate and destroy all of that. Anywhere you guys are stalling and creating a future like you're not going to create new habits, you won't take any new action, you won't make any new phone calls, you won't meet new people, you won't open new doors, you won't try anything new, and you expecting the same results, everything matters delete, uncreate and destroy all of it. Okay I'm hitting few people's buttons I can really feel that Cause some of you feel stuff is going, but I don't know what to do. Again, simpler is better just take some massive action, okay? Just say, "Hey, I'm going to to go out one place this week "and meet two new people." Okay? That's an action, that's a doable action that could get you something. So everything in the way of that delete, uncreate and destroy all of that. You can all send out five resumes and just see what happened, right? Everybody can do that. You can all call four more people and ask if they know anybody to refer people to you and you know, all just do some form of action. You can put up a Facebook page, you could put up a website, you could do anything right? Okay so anything in the way of you guys taking all the actions that you know you need to do, uncreate, delete and destroy all of those. So now we're going to to go to the thing. So here's what I want you guys to do right now this is where the pieces of paper and I'm going to like really, really push you cause I love you. So I want you to pick one target so one of those financial expression numbers that you picked the other day on your dream board, I want you to pick one of those for example, I'm going to use the example of somebody that wants to pay off credit card debt. So let's just say you have a $25,000 credit card debt. And I talked to a lot of people, Okay and a lot of my clients have a lot of credit card debt. So I picked something that would probably push your buttons. So now some of you might be manifesting $25,000, how do I make $25,000 so that I can get out of credit card debt Okay? And for some people it's achievable because they really believe that it'll show up and for other people, it'll take a little while and it'll get them stuck and overwhelmed because they're thinking how am I going to manifest 25,000? So I'm going to ask you to do your manifesting two different ways. One way is to keep asking, what would it take for you to manifest 25 grand, because I want you to have the miracle show up in your life. And the other thing I'm going to ask you to do is just keep it real and practical, and we're going to ask what would it take to release or to earn $500 of it, okay? Or you can pick a thousand, it doesn't matter but I'm just saying pick a low enough amount that won't overwhelm you that seems completely doable in some way, whatever your number is, okay? So pick your large number and pick your small number and then I want you guys to tell me what your numbers are like, what are you working on? 40 K, 100 K, 50 K, 1 K, 10 K, 10,000 and 1000, 3000, 50,000 and 300,000, 10,000 pounds and 500 pounds, 40 K, 5,000, 2,500 a week, 20,000 and 1000, 20,000 and 100,000, college debt, 100,000, 100,000, 5,000, now 15,000 soon. I kind of like that soon. 10,000 or 100,000, 9,000 small, 18,000 a month. Cool, 500 and 3500. So whatever your smaller amount is, I want you to just jot down some ideas without really thinking or caring about the how, okay? Just write down some potential ways that just pop in your head even if they seem a little absurd and you're not currently doing them, of ways that you could generate this extra cash. So for some people it could be getting a raise, for other people it could be selling stuff. For some people it could be another source of income or an idea or a thought that they've had before. For some people it could be starting a business. So what other talents do you have that you could get paid for? And then just send them to me now so we can kind of share and talk about it a little bit. Derek said he is going to start trading. Couple other potential things that you guys could do just type them to me. Commissions, photography, consulting, Forex trading, teaching, speaking engagements, counseling, selling clothes, selling affiliate products, buy shares which quadruple in value, create more websites, sell some of my paintings, get a consulting client, online marketing, readings, sell some stuff on eBay but never have. Well you know what Michelle, I love that, that you said, "But I never have." Because you know what, Craigslist eBay, you can try somethings right? Work over time, pet-sitting. Get a proposal of a new business from a friend who is very successful. Yeah, like you guys could find a mentor, I know a lot of business owners who actually just called four to 10 people and asked, "Would you mentor me?" You know, "I have an insurance business, "would you mentor me?" And they lived in some other state and they got mentors. Okay, writing reports, online businesses, the lottery, cooking classes in your home, selling stuff in your garage, Reiki sessions. So all of these things are amazing, amazing getting four new clients. So then what you're going to do is whatever like that thing is, so let's just start with if it's like getting a client right? Or getting four clients, I want you to break it down a little bit more specifically, okay? So that it becomes part of your everyday life and it seems doable, so you're going to ask now, what would it take for somebody to pay you, what would it take for for new clients to show up in your life? So you guys are going to have to phrase these more specifically for what your doing. So just do a few what would it takes that's what the WWIT is, what would it take for you to get a raise? What would it take for somebody to give you X amount of dollars? What would it take for five new people to give you X amount of dollars? Some people are saying change jobs. So Lisa for you, what would it take for me to send out 20 resumes and have four people say they want to to hire me for over X amount of dollars? Chris had an idea to go to a new way that he could open doors to new customers. So selling a different kind of business. Somebody was going to speak to groups once or twice a week. You know, that's pretty easy if you do that, if you just ask around, depends where your niche is. If you want to get new coaching clients, you're a life coach, you just make a promise with yourself that you're going to to talk to 10 new people, ask them what their problem is and tell them you can help them and then get them to sign up with you. Teaching hypnosis, getting discovered, a free consultation and show how I can help them. So have you guys written down some of your, what would it takes for you to get a raise, for you to get somebody to give you $500, whatever that is. Now, I want you to take a little moment and put, no I hesitate a little bit about the time, but I want to kind of push you guys. When I asked for my manifestations to happen, I asked them to happen now because I want everything to happen now. But I really want you to say by a certain date so that you say within or by, so then you can break it down. Like for instance, if you want to go speak to two groups every week, that means you'll probably have to make, I don't know, between five and 20 phone calls, right? And kind of get those set up. So everything's usually just kind of a numbers game if you just break it down. If you want to get a job, that means you have to send out, like, make a little promise with yourself, five to 10 resumes a week. If you want to get new clients, that means you might have to put advertising in or put something or advertise in Craigslist or the newspaper, or you might have to go to self-help workshops and meet other people that need help and you could be their coach. Or if you're a trader, you might have to really, really super duper focus on doing the what would it take statements, what would it take to find an extra 50 grand somehow, right? So you're going to have to just do some statements. Like what would it take for me to find the trade that will make me you know, 10 grand or what will it take for me to find the trade that'll make me 2,500 or what will it take for me to make the trade that makes me five grand within two hours, whatever that is. Or what would it take for me to like try a few things on eBay and Craigslist and see which one pays me more money? Somebody who was saying that her heart fluttered when she put it out. Okay, and Ella saying WWIT that means what would it take when we ask the universe, what would it take for something to happen, it opens up the big doors for something to happen. Now, what I'm going to ask you to do is you all have your big financial expression number, okay? Whatever that number is, so some of you guys were typing me your numbers like 25,000, you know 10,000. I want you to take that and make it four targets. So for instance, if you had that debt of 25,000, for instance, the first target was 500. So maybe that paid off one credit card bill. And the second target is $1,200, which will now pay off another credit card bill. And again, I want you to just be in this moment and maybe some new idea pops up in your head now that you've been thinking about it, okay? So I want you to just think in this new, fresh time and I'm going to clear something right now. So anything in the way that's blocking you guys from having a plan, having an idea, having a thought, having a something, you know that straightens this out so that you know, what would it take to get your next target? Okay, whatever that is delete, uncreate and destroy it all. Anywhere you're blocked and having some new, fresh idea pop in your head or some practical, rational thing that you could go do to manifest money, pop in your head everything that is, delete, uncreate and destroy all of it. Okay, so tell me what some of your other targets are you guys. Margaret saying, "What would it take "to feel dynamically envisioned "to really handle my payout with excellence?" Wow, I usually know a lot of big words, but I don't know that word. Alacrity, peacefulness joy, and make it grow. Let's say, what would it take to stay on a budget? You know what Margaret, that's a great idea too, just get on a budget and just plan, you know, you're taking an action step and then you won't go over that budget and you can feel good about your life, like in control of your finances. So Lucy is saying something must be shifting because she sees how talented she is and all she can do for extra cash and she's willing to put herself out there. She says, "I've been hiding, so something's shifting." So the second target, 10 K, 450, 1300 Euros in the bank, $1,200 release of 30K mortgage, finding my partner. Somebody wants us to clear why doing things is hard. Okay, so everywhere doing this is hard for you guys, getting things done, taking care of business, doing things is hard delete, uncreate and destroy all of it. Everywhere doing something new is hard, delete, uncreate and destroy it. The reason things are usually hard is because you're doing it from that small space instead of the big place. Remember how I told you guys to get big and get over it? Because you're overwhelmed if you keep your energy small and you be over it, if you keep your energy 300 feet tall, right? It's like if you're trying to understand where you're stuck, then you're always going to be standing under it instead of getting over it. So everywhere you guys won't let yourself get over this, and just like really get your life, delete, uncreate and destroy all of it. All right Serena is going to get a job paying over 64 a year. All right, Margaret likes her numbers 555,555. She's got all the fives. Okay, get an apartment, get referral sources. Hey, that's a good idea Gabriela. Find extra referral services. What would it take to start making money? Haven't worked for 10 years. Stay on plan. These are good, so it seems like you guys have your second plan. Now let's try something again. So I want you to just write down some potential ways that you're going to get some of the second targets. So anything else that you guys can do on your second targets. So anything in way of all this delete, uncreate and destroy all of it. Anything else in the way of you guys writing down your second targets delete, uncreate and destroy all of it. Alison, I liked that. She said she's going to complete a book in the next seven days. Bazel is going to receive some money from people who owe him. Okay, are there any other ways or talents that you guys are going to do for the second target? Freelance work, okay. So target number three is like let's just say you had this huge credit card debt and we paid off a little of it already. Now you're going to release the five grand. So what's the next thing you're going to do to release any of the potential $5,000? Conduct a webinar . I like it use my vision board, wake up early or start working earlier, believe, close some sales, booking an appointment, buy a condo, all right? Anything in a way of this, delete, uncreate and destroy all of it. Okay, anything else in the way of this, delete uncreate and destroy all of it. Okay, so what do you some of your third targets? Okay cool, leverage my talents, open get my body in balance, get more clients, okay. Buy something at a thrift store and sell it to an auction house. You know what Karen, I know a lady who does that. She makes like at least 10K a month, and what she does is she goes to garage sales, she buys things for five bucks and 10 bucks, sometimes a lot of furniture and she'll buy furniture, she'll paint it up, just put in some little grunt work, paint it up or reupholster it, and then she'll sell it and she makes a great deal of money every month. So now whatever the second one is. Okay, so the fourth target. So let's just say you had a big credit card debt, now you're going to release another five grand, okay? And then I guess you guys get the idea. Then you're going to have your big target, okay? Like your big blueprint. So you're going to work on your what would it takes and released a big number, the 25K now. What would it take for an idea and a plan to make this happen? What would you be doing to make this happen? So everything in the way of you not being able to figure out how to make the 25 grand or the 50 grand or the 30 grand or the $1,000 or the $250, anything in the way of that, delete, uncreate and destroy all of it. And these questions right here, I'm going to ask you guys to play with these for the whole week, okay? I want you to just throw out to the universe, what would it take for an idea or plan to make this happen, to show up okay? And everything in the way of that, delete, uncreate and destroy it all. And I want you to say this phrase and say it like 10 to 20 times. What would I be doing to make this happen? Everything in the way of me knowing what to do, delete, uncreate and destroy it all. How can I reach this target quicker? Everything in the way of that delete, uncreate and destroy all of that. How many things can I release from my life to make this happen and everything in the way of that, delete, uncreate and destroy it all. Who can I call to make this money come into my life, delete, uncreate and destroy all of this. What would it take for this to show up right now? Everything in the way of that, delete, uncreate and destroy it. What would it take for life to easily manifest for you and me? Everything that is delete, uncreate and destroy it all. What vibration can my life be to make this happen, and everything in the way of that, delete, uncreate and destroy all of it. I'm going to give you guys a poll. So here's my poll. I want to know if you guys have a financial plan. Do you guys have a financial plan? Okay, now this number isn't really surprising to me. It's about 35% Yes and 65% No. Okay, and this is why I did this section today. So a lot of you guys might not want to go do what I'm going to ask you to do, which is get a plan . Okay, but I promise you, if you have a plan, you'll feel less overwhelmed. Okay, so look at this you guys, if no, are you willing to get one? I want to know if you guys are willing to do whatever it takes to get a plan. Okay, I like this. Are you willing to do it this week? Okay, so here's the results. I want to know if you guys are willing to do it this week. All right, if you have a plan I'm wanting to know, are you taking action on it consistently? If you're one of the ones that said you had a plan, are you willing to take action on it consistently? All right, so most of them okay good. And I'm curious just for curiosity. How much credit card debt does everybody have? Okay, this is again, this is a all right. So that's what's kind of going on with everybody and I want to know, are you guys willing to write down your happy end results and targets? So everything that we did today, are you willing to just write that down and see what happens? Just pick one thing at least. Cause you know, I know what'll happen is you'll actually get it . Okay, all right awesome. I'm loving this number, look at this. 100% Yes, that is I'm going to applaud for that, thank you guys. You know why, thank you for you because I know that something different will happen in your life so thank you, thank you. All right, this is awesome. So you guys know the drill for the week. You're going to fill in yourself all day with intentful energy statements and the what would it takes and what would it take for you to have more choice than you could ever expect? What would it take for you to do what's needed to create your happy end result? What would it take for the universe to deliver you the target number one, two, three, and four? What vibrational energy can you become to have unlimited resources and ease in your life? What vibrational energy can you become to have all the dreams come to fruition? What vibrational energy can bring you your happy end result? And everything in the way of all those things happening, we delete it, uncreate it and destroy all of it. Okay, so let's do a blessing, one more blessing I feel like. So everybody listening, who doesn't feel like they've received whatever they need to receive as quickly as they need to receive it for whatever reason okay, for whatever reason you feel blocked. Let's just uncreate, delete, and destroy all of that. Let's ask for a really cool miracle to show up in your life. Let's ask for some positive change. Positive change in attitude, positive change in actions, positive change in your life, positive change going forward, something new to show up. I can promise you if you write down these targets, some things will change because once your soul knows that you're willing to focus on these targets, it opens up new doors for things to show up. So everything in the way of any of these new targets showing up and anything in the way of something new showing up in your life delete, uncreate and destroy all of it. All right, many, many blessings. and I love you all and send me your stories okay, bye.

LESSON 9: Clearing Indecision (Clearing Session Only)

So we're going to do a clearing. So everybody, let's just connect to the light for a minute. So close your eyes. Connect to the light. So see, sense, or feel the light. And take your energy up about 300 feet. Okay, so at this level, allow the light to come into your crown and allow the light to come into your third eye and allow the light to come into your ear chakras. And allow the light to come into your throat. Allow the light to come into your chest. Allow the light to come down your arms. Allow the light to come into your stomach, torso. Allow the light to come into your hips. Allow the light to come into your legs. Allow the light to come into your feet and into the center of the planet. So imagine a big beam of light. It's connected from source all the way through you, and it dives into the planet, into the center of Earth. And imagine there's a nice little sweet spot in the center of the planet where you can feel always, always, always, always connected. Okay, and like a trampoline, imagine that light just kind of bounces back up your feet, your hips, your torso, your heart. And it radiates out like a great central sun from your heart. 360 degrees in all directions. And expand this light past the building you're in. And expand this light past the city you're in. And expand this light. past the state you're in, and expand this light past the country you're in, and expand this light past planet Earth. You guys are doing great. So all these things that you guys were saying that you still feel stuck in, that you might be living in fear and you can't make a choice, everything this is, will you please, please, please uncreate, delete, and destroy the whole thing across all time, dimension, space, and reality, across all genetic boundaries, karma boundaries, any other soul choice that you made to keep yourself stuck. Delete, uncreate, and destroy the whole thing. Okay, this is good. Now, everywhere you guys are planning on staying stuck in fear in the present moment and in the future, where you just won't budge for whatever reason, all those reasons why you won't budge, will you please now delete, uncreate, and de -story the whole thing across all time, dimension, space, reality, anywhere in your life, genetics, karma, any other place you have this stuck. Delete, uncreate, and de -story all of it. Everywhere you think that there are boundaries between you and your future. There's like anywhere you have some fear -based agendas and boundaries where you're not going to let yourself get what it is that you truly, truly want. Delete, uncreate, and destroy all of it. Times a gazillion. Everywhere you guys are choosing to stay stuck or live in some sort of fear reaction or pattern reaction or... reaction or historical reaction, anywhere you're choosing to keep reacting all those same things, delete, uncreate, and destroy all of it times a gazillion. Across all time, dimension, space, reality, anywhere you're choosing to stay stuck for any reactive part of you, delete, uncreate, and destroy all of that. Anywhere your heart is closed to a new option, a new choice. Delete, uncreate, and destroy all of that. Whatever this thing is that you want to get unstuck about, are you willing, completely and totally willing, to devote your energy to no matter what, this thing is not going to be a problem in my life anymore. So are you so willing to have that energy for this? So everywhere you guys are unwilling to create that much of a powerful choice, will you please uncreate, delete, and destroy the whole thing? Everywhere you guys are still holding your boundaries. I can see some of you. I'm going to call you out because I love you enough to call you out. There's about 30 % of you guys that are still holding your boundaries up. And you're saying, you know what? I'm not willing to make that kind of choice. Okay? So for whatever reason that you're not willing to do that for yourself, will you please uncreate, delete, and destroy the whole thing? No matter what it takes. Because there's some part about you that is so restless that made you want to get on this phone call. There's some part of you that so deserves your good. okay so anywhere you're holding this energy in for whatever reason and maybe it's not yours maybe it's your parents maybe it's genetic maybe it's some karma maybe it's some past life maybe it's not from here okay but anywhere you bought and sold this energy to yourself and it's still there just please now uncreate delete and destroy the whole thing all the stupid propaganda that you've attached to why you can't get unstuck All that stupid stuff. Delete, uncreate, and destroy the whole thing. That's better. Some of you let it go. All right. And the rest of you guys that are holding on to these stories, delete, uncreate, and blow them up now. Destroy them all. All right, cool. So now I want to talk about making a choice. So we're going to go to the third one for a minute. Are you creating and generating a choice? Or are you flying by the seat of your pants? So any of you that are living in the no choice world where you're just not willing to make a choice for yourself and you pretend that you can't make a choice and you're doing la, la, la, la, la, la with your life. Okay. Everywhere you guys are doing that for whatever crazy reason, delete, uncreate, and destroy the whole thing. Okay. All the points of view, decisions, justifications. Yeah. Reasons why. Okay, that you can't make a choice. Delete, uncreate and destroy the whole thing. Everywhere you're locking your future up because you're unwilling to move forward and make a choice. You just want to pretend that you can't make a choice. Okay, delete, uncreate and destroy all of that too. So are you willing to create an action that's so powerful that it... Basically, it destroys all of your stuckness. Are you guys willing to take an action so powerful, like some bold new step that you've been pretending that you can't do? Are you willing to do that today? Everywhere you guys are not willing to do that or you pretend that you don't know what to do, okay, delete, uncreate, and de -story all of that. It could be making a phone call. It could be asking your boss for a raise. It could be just deciding, hey, I'm not going to do this anymore. I'm going to send out 20 resumes and see what happens. Or I'm going to start the business I've been procrastinating on. Any of those things that you guys have been stopping yourself and unwilling to take a bold action, delete, uncreate, and de -story all of that too. And everywhere you guys are convincing yourself, I can't, I shouldn't, I don't know how, I don't know what to do. All of that stuff, which will then block you in the future, right? Because basically, all those I don't knows is basically locking off your intuition. so you can even figure out what you're supposed to do. Okay, so everything that is, delete, uncreate, and de -story all of it. Okay, an infinite being knows what to do. Remember, there's two rules to an infinite being. They are totally aware, and they can make choices, and everything else is just a story. It really is. It's just history. It's just a story. Make a choice. Move forward. That's all you have to do. And everything in the way of that, delete, uncreate, and destroy all of that. Okay, so I'm going to clear overwhelm because I can feel that you guys have a lot of energy on this. So everywhere, everywhere, everywhere, you guys are completely overwhelmed and don't want to get a life and don't want to get a plan. Delete, uncreate, and destroy all of it. It's kind of funny when we talk about taking actions, people get a little bogged down. Okay, anywhere else, you're overwhelmed. What do I do? What do I do? I can't see the future, so I don't know what to do. Everything that is. Uncreate, delete, and destroy all of it. What would it take? Create your future. Remember the story of somebody wanting to buy new clothes, and she said, is it my highest good to buy new clothes? And she kept getting a no, but then she said, what would it take for me to get some new clothes? And when she said she was guided to the secondhand shop where she got some really nice clothes for hardly anything. So the what would it take opened up the door. All right, so your life's happy end result is dependent on you figuring out your worthiness to go for it or not. So everywhere you guys, do not think that you are worthy to get your really big happy end result, your financial expression number. Delete, uncreate, and destroy all of it. Everywhere you guys are stuck and you aren't going to let yourself get your financial expression number, delete, uncreate, and destroy all of it times a gazillion. So any of you guys that are waiting for some future to show up but not actually do the work for it, delete, uncreate, and destroy all of it. Everywhere you guys are not willing to take proactive measures and create your future, delete, uncreate, and destroy all of that. anywhere you guys are stalling and creating a future like you're not going to take any new you're not going to create new habits you won't take any new action you won't make any new phone calls you won't meet new people you won't open new doors you won't try anything new and you expecting the same results everything that is delete uncreate and de -story all of it Okay, I'm hitting a few people's buttons. I can really feel that because some people's stuff is going, but I don't know what to do. Again, simpler is better. Just take some massive action, okay? Just say, hey, I'm going to go out one place this week and meet two new people, okay? That's an action. That's a doable action that could get you something. So everything in the way of that, delete, uncreate, and de -story, all of that. You can all send out five resumes and just see what happened, right? Everybody can do that. You can all call four more people and ask if they know anybody to refer people to you. And you can all just do some form of action. You can put up a Facebook page. You could put up a website. You could do anything, right? Okay, so anything in the way of you guys taking all the actions that you know you need to do, uncreate, delete, and destroy all of those. So just do a few. What would it take? That's what the WWIT is. What would it take for you to get a raise? What would it take for somebody to give you X amount of dollars? What would it take for five new people to give you X amount of dollars? And I'm going to clear something right now. So anything in the way that's blocking you guys from having a plan, having an idea, having a thought, having a something, you know, that straightens this out so that you know what would it take to get your next target. Okay, whatever that is, delete, uncreate, and do story at all. anywhere you're blocked and having some new fresh idea pop in your head or some practical rational thing that you could go do to manifest money pop in your head everything that is delete uncreate and destroy all of it somebody wants us to clear why doing things is hard okay so everywhere doing this is hard for you guys getting things done taking care of business doing things is hard delete uncreate and destroy all of it everywhere doing something new is hard delete uncreate and destroy it so everywhere you guys won't let yourself get over this and just like really get your life delete uncreate and destroy all of it i like it use my vision board wake up earlier start working earlier leave close some sales book an appointment buy a condo all right anything in the way of this delete uncreate and destroy all of it Okay, anything else in the way of this? Delete, uncreate, and destroy all of it. So everything in the way of you not being able to figure out how to make the $25 ,000 or the $50 ,000 or the $30 ,000 or the $1 ,000 or the $250. Anything in the way of that? Delete, uncreate, and destroy all of it. I want you to just throw out to the universe what would it take for an idea or plan to make this happen, to show up, okay? And everything in the way of that, delete, uncreate, and destroy it all. And I want you to say this phrase, and say it like 10 to 20 times. What would I be doing to make this happen? Everything in the way of me knowing what to do, delete, uncreate, and destroy it all. How could I reach this target quicker? Everything in the way of that, delete, uncreate, and destroy all of that. How many things can I release from my life to make this happen and everything in the way of that? Delete, uncreate, and destroy it all. Who can I call to make this money come into my life? Delete, uncreate, and destroy all of this. What would it take for this to show up right now? Everything in the way of that? Delete, uncreate, and destroy it. What would it take for life to easily manifest for you and me? Everything that is? Delete, uncreate, and destroy it all. What vibration can my life be to make this happen? And everything in the way of that, delete, uncreate, and destroy all of it. So you guys know the drill for the week. You're going to fill in yourself all day with intentful energy statements and the what would it takes. And what would it take for you to have more choice than you could ever expect? What would it take for you to... Do what's needed to create your happy end result. What would it take for the universe to deliver you the target number one, two, three, and four? What vibrational energy can you become to have unlimited resources and ease in your life? What vibrational energy can you become to have all the dreams come to fruition? What vibrational energy can bring you your happy end result? And everything in the way of all those things happening. We delete it, uncreate it, and destroy all of it. Okay, so let's do a blessing. One more blessing, I feel like. So everybody listening who doesn't feel like they've received whatever they need to receive as quickly as they need to receive it, for whatever reason, okay? For whatever reason you feel blocked. Let's just uncreate, delete, and destroy all of that. Let's ask for a really cool miracle to show up in your life. Let's ask for some positive change, positive change in attitude. positive change in actions, positive change in your life, positive change going forward, something new to show up. So everything in the way of any of these new targets showing up and anything in the way of something new showing up in your life, delete, uncreate, and destroy all of it. All right, many, many blessings, and I love you all, and send me your stories. Okay, bye. Please continue to the next Unlimited Abundance Journey session. 

====================

LESSON 10: Clear the Feeling of Being Stuck

- Hey, this is Christie Marie Sheldon, and you're listening to a recording I did of a series of 24 live group sessions on clearing abundance blocks. And here's what we're going to cover in today's session, number 10. We're going to talk about values and alignment. If you say you value something, are you truly living that value on a day to day basis? And if you say you value saving a lot of money, but at the same time you're spending it all, that's not alignment. If you value your free time, but you're working 80 hours a week, that's not alignment. If you say you need to work hard for your family, but you can't have the time to see them, that's not alignment. So we're going to work on this unconscious programming and work to bring your values into alignment with your life. And we're also going to take a look at these values in the context of manifesting abundance. Do you hold loving energy towards manifesting abundance? We're going to take a good long look at this and do a massive clearing so that you can manifest the life of your dreams. Let's begin. Hey, this is Christie. How are you, guys? It is so good to be here. Today is super, super exciting. We're going to clear from a different angle and all these clearings are cumulative. So, hopefully by now you guys have all seen some shifts and if you haven't, there's two things. First off, I want you to not worry so much, I know it's hard not to worry about that, but I have seen that happen sometimes where somebody just clears and clears and clears and clears and clears and they always show up. And then just somewhere kaboom, it's like the big door opens and then something comes in. But I am going to ask you to make sure you do some more clearings on change. So everywhere you're not allowing change, can't take change, don't like to change, or afraid of change, any of those things I'm going to suggest to you that you do some extra clearings on that if you want to speed up the ability of you to change. All right, all right, all right. So grab a journal or a piece of paper so that you guys can tune in, be open to love and fun, set your intents on what you hope to achieve and bring the energy you want to release to the forefront and let's journey together and generate some abundance. So I'm going to stop on number three for a minute. So set an intent of what you guys hope to have happen for you, whatever it is that you want to clear for you. All right, okay. So whatever the intent is, some of you intended that I do some more clearing on the word change. So we'll do that when we get to the clearing section, we'll do that first thing, all right? All right, cool. And whoo! Inspiring stories. I am so impressed with the group of people that I have on these phone calls, I can't even tell you. I mean, it's completely, completely, completely exceeded all my expectations. I mean, I get such cool stories from you guys. So here's some more, Zebrina from Denmark, she said, manifesting is paying off big time. She just found two checks she had forgotten about totaling $2,500. Yay Zebrina, all right. One of Amber's goals joining the unlimited abundance journey was to manifest enough to pay for the rest of the course. She kept seeing pennies on the ground and felt confident that prosperity was trying to find her, and she was right. Within weeks, we've only been doing this for however long, about four weeks. She got two new massage clients and a $2,000 check from her grandfather for graduating from massage school. All right, another inspiring story was shared by Jean. Her friend's brother who is a musician recently left his $3,000 Mac Book Pro in a cab. Understandably, he was very upset as was her friend, but instead of commiserating with her friend, Jean told her to stop in her tracks and every time she thought the laptop was lost or that the situation was hopeless, she was to instead visualize someone showing up at her brother's doorstep to return it, and she was to visualize him being estatically happy and grateful. A few days later, her friend's brother got a knock on the door and it was the cab driver returning the computer. So that's really great. Again, what I call a multi-level marketing for consciousness, right? So Jean's having some breakthroughs and then she made sure she shared some things with her friends, and then it changed not only her friend, but her friend's brother. Arthur is feeling surrounded by positive vibrations, he's feeling clear every day, receiving a lot of interesting invitations and he's manifested $1,000 in sales for the second week in a row. All right, good job, Arthur. Okay, again, the reason I'm sharing these stories is to keep you all inspired and so that you can see that, the different ways that things can show up in somebody's life. Thelma wants to know how do you send blessings to other people? Basically just how we teach you to be connected to the light, just kind of connect for a moment, just get into the middle of your heart, to see a lot of energy in your heart and just send that energy, just like a fire hose, you know, just send a beam of light out to people and just say, I just kind of keep it neutral because I don't want to put my will upon somebody else's will and so I just say, I bless you with pure love and light, I bless you with pure consciousness and let that do the whatever work it is that they need for themselves. So I don't play God and, you know, pretend I know what they need. I just kind of send a lot of love and light, but that's a really, really good question. All right, so we're going to talk today about values and alignment. So, if you value something like let's just say you have a value that you value, the energy of saving cash, because you like to have lots of cash around. So, let's just say you value that. But at the same time, what you're doing in your world is you're actually spending it all manifesting broken things that you have to buy new things or manifesting troubled relationships, where people take your money or manifesting that you don't want to open your bills and pay attention. So that's just one thing. But some people could say, well, I value having a lot of free time. Okay, well, if you value having a lot of free time, but you're working 80 hours a week again, can you see how those stories don't really match? And so we're going to work on a little different angle today, about some of these other unconscious programming. We're going to kind of root out some of the other ones that are still lying around there so that you don't have them anymore. And all of your stories, so I'm going to say that these are your stories, right? So all of these stories that you have basically create some sort of either attraction or retraction, okay? So, attraction or retraction, and you can't achieve your desired outcome in a field of lower energy. And some of you have heard about me talk about my scale of consciousness, where zero to 1,000, you know, shame and guilt are 20 and 30, anger is 150, fear is 100, apathy I think is like 50, reasoning and things like that are around 300, 400, but love, love energy is at 500, peace of mind energy is at 560. Gratitude is in the I've calibrated it a couple of different ways. Sometimes it's in the 600s to the 800s. So gratitude can be a really, really, really high frequency. So, if you can achieve your desired outcome, then it means that there has to be some lower, energetic story that's still attached and we're going to like root out some more of those. And even if you try really, really, really hard to like manifest some cash, but you still have some of these other stories, even unconscious to you, then it's going to be a problem. So I've had lots of people, I clear them and they say, oh, but I've worked on that issue, I still have, you know, I've really, really, really, really, really worked on that issue, I don't have that issue anymore. And what I say to them is, well, if I can still energetically see it, if I can psychically still see that pattern in you, it's still somewhere locked there, otherwise, why would I be able to pick that up out of your energy field? If it's not in your energy field, it's not in your energy field. So we're going to work today on clearing some of these stories. So we're going to look at some of your values in the context to manifesting abundance. Do you hold loving energy towards manifesting abundance? Do you love to manifest things or do you think, oh, it's just a pain in my trash and I don't really want to work on myself, I don't really want to do that. It's like this whole thing about you guys have some tools now, do you do them 10, 20, 30 times a day? 10 times like, ah, but literally I'm walking around all the time in my free time, just kind of saying little energy statements and putting cool energy out in the world. Now, is it hard work? No, because it's part of my life. So it's not like an extra thing I have to do, that's not how I look at, I look at it like it makes me feel good, I feel love when I do it, I feel light. And I'd rather my mind be focused on doing something that's loving and light and fun instead of like doing drama, trauma, worry, fear, and creating any of those kinds of stories. So, we're going to look at some of the ways that you guys speak about manifesting abundance, the way you look at manifesting abundance, and the way you feel about making it happen. Now, before we go to the next slide, I want to hook you guys up to the light a little bit and we'll do some clearing on change first. So, close your eyes, if you're driving, just do the energy thing without your eyes closed because you can multitask. So close your eyes and take your energy about 300 feet up and see, sense, or feel, see, sense, or feel the light, pure consciousness itself there to support and serve you. And let that light come into your crown and imagine like... Let's imagine it like a swirly purple vacuum for a little bit, we're going to just kind of vacuum out some things. Imagine it going into your crown and the light's going in but at the same time, the bad stuff's getting sucked out. So, it's going to suck out anything in the crown around your third eyes so you can see and know the truth about everything, and then we're going to suck out some energy around your ear so you can hear true guidance. And I would encourage everybody to put on their wishlist so that they can see, hear, and know true guidance. Yes, okay, cool. Let's see here and know the truth about anything. It's a really cool tool to have. And imagine this light comes into your throat, kind of clearing out anywhere you're blocked on your creativity. And we're going to let this light go into your heart and just kind of vanquish, vanish, eliminate any place where you don't have compassion or kindness for yourself on your journey. Anywhere you're hard on yourself, anywhere you beat yourself up, anywhere you talk to yourself the way your parents talk to you. Okay, cool. Imagine there's a light that comes after that just kind of fills you in, it goes down your arms, into your heart, through your head, into your heart. Now imagine this vacuum kind of sucks up anything in your solar plexus, anything that's where all the nerves are in your body, there's a big nerve centers that kind of gravitate right there as above so below. So any nervous gut reactions, any fear-based agendas, any place that you don't want to be here on the planet in your body and you feel not very grounded. Can you delete all that. You have lot of energy right there leaving, some of you guys didn't really want to be here, that's kind of a common belief by the way. Imagine taking infinite being shoving them in a little baby body, sometimes it's not very fun. So take this vacuum and kind of suck out some energy in your navel area, that's where your power center is. Okay, awesome. Take this energy, go around your root anywhere you can't feel rooted, safe, anywhere you're angry, fearful, untrusting. Don't like men or women or the opposite sex or the same sex. Anywhere you feel misguided and don't trust your path, delete all that stuff there. And then let the light just come in, so it's going through your body now, all the way down your legs, into your knees, into your feet, into the center of the planet, where it joins with this gorgeous energy in the center of the planet, where it just feels pure light, love, kind of giggly. Imagine there's a trampoline down there and it just kind of bounces the energy right back up into your heart. Yeah, so into your heart like a 360 degrees on time, all the way around. Okay, cool. Okay, awesome. So just radiate this light around your body, 360 degrees at great big central sunshine. The light's coming from above and below, completely filling you. And imagine this light gets bigger than the building you're in and the light gets bigger than the city are in, and the light gets yeah, bigger than that state you're in and bigger than the country you're in and bigger than the planet. Okay, awesome. All right, so now you guys we're going to clear some stuff today. So it might be one of those days where it's like, for some of you, it might be heavy stuff, so we're just going to like get through it, so just kind of laugh at all your junk follower, clearing it, all right? So you can still be present to it, pay attention to it, go into it, feel the heaviness of it, and then love that we're going to clear it. So, let's work on change. So, everywhere you guys are having hard time changing, don't think you can change, don't think money can change, everything that is, uncreate, delete, and de-story the whole thing across all time dimension space reality. Yep, across all morphic fields. Okay, right there. Anywhere you or your genetic lineage has any blocks on change or manifesting something different, delete, uncreate, and de-story all of that. Now I'm going to clear this a minute. Some of you believe you can change, but you don't think your money can change, or your abundance can change, or your ability to manifest really cool stuff, whatever that is can change. So everywhere you don't believe that you can manifest really cool stuff in your life or manifest a lot of cash or manifest something different, even if it's in love or relationships or any of that, everything that is delete, uncreate, and de-story the whole thing. Everywhere you guys feel like you have to bargain with source, like sources like the big Santa Claus, some sources aren't going to deliver to you unless you beg and borrow any of that kind of energy, delete, uncreate, and de-story the whole thing. Anywhere you guys think you're bad and you don't deserve it, delete, uncreate, and de-story all that. Anywhere you think source abandoned you, delete, uncreate, and de-story all that. Okay, that's some good stuff. Anywhere else change is not possible, delete, uncreate, and de-story across all time dimensions, space and reality. Some people are saying that they are feeling a little angry as soon as we pulled the light in, 'cause that's just some energy. So everywhere you guys are angry over things didn't change earlier than now, delete, uncreate, and de-story all of that. Anywhere else you guys feel like things don't change right away, delete all that. Now, when I say, see, sense, or feel the light, again, anywhere you guys turned down your perception, so you can't see, sense, or feel, and anywhere you guys put a veil over your eyes, your third eye, or your ears, or any of that, delete, uncreate, and de-story all of that too please. Everywhere you guys have no idea how to make a difference in the world in your own life, delete, uncreate, and de-story all of that. Cause literally how you make a difference is you just clear out your stuff and keep asking, what would it take, and keep putting forward some new energy. That's how you make a difference in the world because you change your life, you change everybody else around you. Okay, awesome. Everywhere you guys are afraid that they'll abandon you if you actually get too big for your britches. Everything that is, uncreate, delete, and de-story the whole thing. Everywhere you're afraid your change will be taken away eventually and you won't be able to keep it, delete, uncreate, and de-story the whole thing. That's a lot of cool stuff. Everywhere you guys have some anger over perceived mistreatments or anger over you're not ahead of time, you didn't change it to quickly, delete, uncreate, and de-story all that. Everywhere you have no idea how much time you've wasted, delete, uncreate, and de-story all of that too. So anybody who has a comment about they fall asleep when I do clearings, really that's actually so okay. It's like, you're just getting a deeper download. Some people really worry about this, but I'm telling you, there's completely nothing to worry about, you're still receiving the energy and your soul knows what's going on, so your soul is kind enough to you, to just take you out a little bit so that you can get a deeper healing. So if it happens, it'll happen on some nights, it might happen not on other nights. On the nights that it happens, I would listen to it maybe two or three more times, just so that you make sure you clear everything out. Okay, awesome. So now I'm going to say something here. So everywhere you guys aren't taking new actions, because the other part of manifesting is you ask, then you have to take some new actions or put yourself in front of new people. You can't be a sitting in the house and not change. You have to be in front of some new people, or do something different, or take some guided action. Did I ever tell you guys the story about one time I moved to a city and I said, hey, I want some new friends. I was guided to go, I heard go to the bar tonight, it was a wine bar in my little town. I think I was like an 8:00 or 9:30 or something, it was just kind of a weird time. And literally I'm arguing with my guides, I say, I don't want to go to the bar 'cause it's not my thing. So I heard just go anyway. So I walk in, it's like a Tuesday or Wednesday night, it's the middle of the week, there's nobody there except for three people. There was this nice older couple, there was one other person sitting somewhere else. So I sat by the friendly, looking older people. I sat down and I just started talking with them. and what happened is they offered me an invitation. I got an invitation to a party. They said, oh, we have kids your age, you should come to the party, there'll be tons of people your age, you'll meet lots and lots and lots of new friends. And literally there was like 50, 60, I don't know, I don't know a lot of people my age, and I made a lot of really great and interesting contacts. Now had I not went to the bar, I didn't want to, but if I hadn't gone that one night, that would have never happened. So again, anybody who I'm talking to right now and I'm pushing your buttons 'cause I'm talking about, oh, you mean I have to do something different? So everything that is, delete all that and anybody who's listening right now and thinks, well, yeah, that's you Christie, but I don't hear my guidance or any of that kind of stuff, so everything that is delete, uncreate, and de-story the whole thing. Now, I didn't always hear my guidance, but you can ask your guides and your higher self to just permanently, permanently, permanently resolve any place where you don't feel that you can hear them. So let's all ask your higher self, your guides, the light right now to permanently resolve anything in the way that's blocking you from hearing them or knowing. All right, cool, we're seeing. So everything that is delete, uncreate, and de-story the whole thing. Anywhere you guys have some sort of thing where you have to please other people, so if you change, then you're going to like, you're afraid that other people won't like you and your family, delete, uncreate, and de-story all of that. Ooh, all right. So, I'm going to encourage you guys to just one more time, if some things aren't changing really quickly for you, what I'm going to ask you to do is a little different statement and that's, what would it take for the most change that has ever happened in my life to happen now in the form of abundance. So what would it take for the most amount of change that I've ever received to show up in my life now and everything in the way of that, delete it, uncreate it, and de-story it. Okay there. So now we're going to go to some of the other stories that you guys have about manifesting, probably a weird picture, yes, yes. So it's, what's your story. I want to know what your story is. Is your story about manifesting your ideas and manifesting abundance? Is your story filled with scary stories and fear-based mayhem? Or is your story about manifesting about love and gratitude and the alignment of that? So we're going to have you guys share some things right now. Before we go to the next section, I want you to just write down a few of your stories that you have about money and manifesting and abundance. Some people are saying my story has been that I had changed behavior and consciousness at different ages, started a relationship. Oh, so somewhere she said, she thought change equals you lose loved ones. Okay, so she's got some belief about that. Sharika, her story is about procrastination. Lucy's story is about follow-through and belief. Jennifer's story is money as controlling. Margaret draws a little blank. So Margaret, just look at what your history is like, do you spend it? Do you keep it? Do you lose it? Do you have plenty of it and you love it? What's your story? Jean's got mixed stories which is kind of normal, that's actually more normal. She loves having money around and enjoys spending and sharing it, but still avoid paying bills sometimes and it feels anxiety over not having enough and then counts to pay them all. Margaret stories come from the fear side. Nicholas's stories have some self doubt that plague is manifesting. Kathleen, ah, she does the invisible program, afraid of being seen by others yet I want to be seen fully and I feel frustrated I'm not seeing now. So we're going to clear all that, Kathleen. So you're going to really work on the next couple of weeks for everywhere you don't want to be seen, heard, felt, or known, you're going to delete all that, seen, heard, felt, or known. Jenny I keep trying, but money doesn't manifest. I have a block that says things don't work for me. Oh, that's an interesting one. I'm going to clear some of the ones I just read. So all the ones that we just read and all the energy that's attached to that we're going to uncreate it, we're going to delete it and we're going to story all of those things, all of those things about procrastinating, that things don't work, that we can't be seen and heard or acknowledged, everything that is, delete, uncreate, and de-story the whole thing, everywhere else you guys can't be seen and heard and acknowledged, delete, de-story, and uncreate the whole thing across all time dimensions space reality. Everywhere you have self doubt, delete, uncreate, and de-story all of that. Yeah, you guys got some self doubt. Now I'm going to show you something for a minute. I want you guys to remember, truth is light and lies are heavy. I want you to just check inside for a minute and just say, is it true, is it totally true that the self-doubt, did it come from you originally, or did it come from people around you, you or someone else? And for the majority of you, the answer should have been someone else. So, everywhere you're picking up everybody else's self self-doubt and then thinking it's yours and everywhere you decided to be like everybody else around you being normal, right? Every already decided to be normal and be like everybody else, delete, uncreate, and de-story all of that too. Everywhere money is controlling, procrastinating, and you lose loved ones if you change, everything that is, delete, uncreate, and de-story. Everywhere you guys have trouble moving from A to B and getting it done, delete, uncreate, and de-story. Every time you guys think you'll lose love, or it keeps you safe if you don't manifest it, delete, uncreate, de-story across all time dimension space reality, across all genetic lines, all heritage lines, all morphic fields, everything that is, everything that is, delete, uncreate, and de-story the whole thing. Margaret says she's manifested a beautiful diamond ring and a perfect husband, now she procrastinates. Actually Margaret, I want you to check inside. It feels like you didn't set another target. Sometimes what happens is we set a target, we manifest it and then we forget to set another target. And so I want you to check inside and see if that's true for you. So everything that is where you're procrastinating settings some new goals, delete, uncreate, and de-story the whole thing. Everywhere things are hard to attain in life, delete, uncreate, and de-story the whole thing. Everywhere, sometimes easy and sometimes hard and you spend too much, delete, uncreate and de-story all that. Everywhere you procrastinate and block your abundance and you know you do it, but you can't stop it like you're compelled to do it. So any of your compulsion's and your secret agendas and all your crap that makes you, oh, I know what I'm doing, but I'm going to still keep doing it, everything that is, delete, uncreate, and de-story all of that. Somebody spends money by marketing. Hates to answer the phone. I want to clear that one, I used to have that, I don't like answering the phone either, I really don't. So any of you who don't want to make phone calls, even though you know you should, and you don't want to pick up the phone and call people back even though you know you should, everything that is, uncreate, delete, and de-story it all. And everywhere the reason you don't want to call people back or pick up the phone is because you're just tired of dealing with people's objections and their points of view, delete, uncreate, and de-story the whole thing. Everywhere you're afraid to get your hopes up, you hope this works, but you're afraid to get your hopes up, delete, uncreate, and de-story. Money and love can't be together, delete, uncreate, and de-story. Everywhere you're rejecting money and everywhere you get money from your family and it feels like prison, delete, uncreate, and de-story all of that. Jack is saying it's changing, I can't even remember what a stories were. I'm going to give you a hand for that one, Jack, that's awesome. Okay, I'll only save to do in small increments. Big changes are not good. Everywhere big changes are not good, delete, uncreate, and de-story the whole thing. Everywhere you guys can't pay cash for everything. Marianne saying, she can pay cash for everything. So everywhere you guys have to live on credit card debt and credit, instead of just paying for cash and living below your means, delete, uncreate, and de-story it all, or manifest so much that you have more than enough money that you don't even know how to spend it all. Everywhere you can't do that, delete, uncreate, and de-story at all. Everywhere you don't trust yourself with handling your money, everywhere you're untrustworthy. delete, uncreate, de-story. Everywhere money burns a hole in your pocket, everything that is, delete, uncreate, and de-story it. Everywhere money doesn't last and everywhere money is evil, delete, uncreate, and de-story. Everywhere you feel like you have no value, so you have nothing to offer for the money in exchange, delete, uncreate, and de-story it. Everywhere you have no value, delete, uncreate, and de-story it. Everywhere you don't deserve it, everything that is, uncreate, delete, de-story across all time dimension space reality, across all genetic lines. Anywhere you guys have a backwards flow of money where you give it out but you don't receive it, everything that is, uncreate, delete, de-story across all time dimension space reality. You guys are letting go of a lot today. I have it, I love it then it goes away. delete, uncreate, and de-story. Everywhere money is never yours to keep or hold or have delete, uncreate, and de-story, kind of like a love affair. We should be able to have a love affair with our money and we like love it and it loves us back and we coddle it and it takes care of us back. Everywhere you guys are doing the love hate romance of money, delete, uncreate, and de-story all of that. Everywhere abundance is out there instead of in you, delete, uncreate, and de-story it all. Everywhere you have to spend it because you're afraid you won't get anymore. Like you got to spend it really fast and hope you get more kind of like gambling, right? Delete, uncreate, de-story the whole thing. Everywhere you're a giver instead of a taker, the truth is you have to be both and usually the taker is more important because the taker is the receiver. You have to receive it first and then once you have it, you can give it out. You have to be able to intake oxygen and only after you intake it, are you allowed to let it out. Everywhere you've manifested large mounts and then lost it all, delete, uncreate, and de-story it all. The cool thing is, is you know how to manifest a lot then, so that's good. Fear of acting upon the guidance, everywhere you lose confidence in your guidance, delete, uncreate, and de-story the whole thing. Everywhere you admit that you really want something and then it gets ruined, delete, uncreate, and de-story all that. Everywhere if you really, really, really, really, really let your heart feel what it wants to feel about something you'll lose it, delete, uncreate, and de-story it all. Anywhere anybody's been cruel or controlling with money towards you, delete, uncreate, and de-story all that. I love this word allowance. I see some really funny things happen with allowance. So anywhere, if you had parents that like told you they'd pay you the allowance, but then they never paid you your allowance, everything that is, delete all that. Anywhere you've had parents steal your allowance, delete, uncreate, and de-story all that. Everywhere you wanted an allowance, but you were never allowed to keep it. Or what about some kids where they get money, but they have to put it all in the bank and then they learn the lesson that they never get to keep any of things that they got, everything that is, uncreate, delete, and de-story all of it. Most important thing to teach a kid is how to budget. And ask if they buy this, will it make them money? So everything in the way of that, delete, uncreate, and de-story all of that. Both level alignment and being changed from gentle trusting to fear-based by bullying, but I have to accept responsibility. Chris I don't understand exactly what you're saying, so maybe you can clarify, but any part of that that's about bullying, delete, uncreate, and de-story all of it. Anywhere you spend impulsively, shopaholics, yes. All the addicted to shopping, addicted to spending, all your addictions about money, all your secret agendas to keep these addictions in place, uncreate, delete, and de-story the whole thing. All the karmic value you guys get from being shopaholics, delete, uncreate, and de-story the whole thing. Everywhere you've made bad investments, bad loan, loan people money, got screwed, delete, and uncreate, and de-story the whole thing across all time dimension space reality. So manifesting money used to be easy, but now it's difficult. And she thinks it's tied to confidence in a relationship. Well, usually what happens is the reason we don't manifest as easily when we're young is usually because we have more points of view. So basically as we get older, it's harder for people to change theoretically, because they don't have the tools to uncreate and delete their reality. But the more you uncreate and delete your reality basically the more freeing it is, that's why kids are like happy go lucky and things manifest easier is because they haven't lived long enough to know any better. Cause I really remember that. Well, I'm going to clear this. Everything this is, I brought this up with you guys, delete, uncreate, and de-story all of it. Everywhere you guys have so many points of view that nothing else will change, delete, uncreate, and de-story all of it. Anywhere you have thoughts, feelings, ideas, and beliefs that are blocking anything significant showing up in your life, delete, uncreate, and de-story all of it. Everywhere you guys are thinking small, delete, uncreate, and de-story all of it. Everywhere you got to spend everything you have and be invisible, delete, uncreate, and de-story it all. Everywhere you can't invest in the stock market and make money because you can make money if you're willing to be totally aware. If I buy this, will it go up or down in the next months or years. So everything that is, delete, uncreate, and de-story it all. Everywhere you guys are doing poverty as the norm for you or middle-class as the norm for you, everything that is, uncreate, delete, and de-story. Everywhere you're doing your mom and dad's class, whatever that was, delete, uncreate, and de-story. Everywhere you can't ask for what you want, delete, uncreate, and de-story. Everywhere you have health issues that are somehow blocking your ability to go manifest money, delete, uncreate, and de-story it all. So what you would do is what would it take for me to, number one, get healthy, happy alive well, and number two, what would it take for me to get all the assistance and financial assistance I need to take care of my body, number one, and to create my life the way I want, and then just see how the universe shows it up. I've heard really cool stories of people are getting gifts and guidance and grants and insurance pays extra something to kind of help that stuff along. So everything in the way of that, delete it all. Okay, that's funny. Tara is saying, are you talking with your hands? I feel like I'm seeing some movement in the light as if someone was moving their hands while they talk. I always talk with my hands, Tara. I love it 'cause I send energy out my hands and it's just what happens. Father committed suicide, left me with a lot of money, someone has to die for me to receive money. So everything creating all that, delete, uncreate, and de-story it all. Everywhere you guys are waiting for people to die so you got money, instead of just manifesting it yourself, delete, uncreate, and de-story it all. Everywhere you guys are waiting for your inheritance, delete, uncreate, and de-story everything that's fear based about that. Everything that is delete all that. Anywhere you guys want to spend it all because you're afraid that you don't want to like leave it to anybody, got to spend it all, delete all that. Now I'm going to trigger some other ways that I want you guys to look for it. So I want you to go into the feeling center part of you for a minute. We're going to break it down into your senses. What do you feel about manifesting abundance? Feel, that's a different energy. Everywhere you guys are staying in unhappy relationships because you think you need the money, everything that is, uncreate, delete, and de-story all that story. Everywhere else you guys are afraid, afraid, afraid to leave a relationship because you're afraid that you won't get the lifestyle that you need, delete, uncreate, and de-story the whole thing. Remember, we had a cool story about that a couple of weeks ago, great testimonial about, she manifested leaving her mate and the mate was really nice about it, which she wasn't expecting. And she manifested the sale of some property, which then gave her all the money she needed, and she kind of set up her life. So anywhere you guys think that would be hard to do, if that's what you feel guided to do, delete, uncreate, and de-story all that. Anywhere anybody controls you about money, delete, uncreate, de-story across all time dimension space reality, across all genetic lines, across the whole morphic field of you. So who holds on to your purse strings? You or somebody else? Everywhere that was somebody else, the answer was somebody else, delete, uncreate, and de-story the whole thing. Everywhere you guys are embarrassed to ask for more, feel guilt or shame asking for more cash, everything that is, delete, uncreate, and de-story the whole thing. Everywhere you guys think you are so freaking damaged, that you can't be different, delete, uncreate, and de-story it all. Everywhere you guys pay off your credit card bill, and then you run it right back up. How many of you do that scenario? Delete, uncreate, and de-story all of that, 'cause it's kind of like gambling, free money empty cards. Everything that is, delete, uncreate, de-story. Feel that I am not responsible, everything that is, delete, uncreate, and de-story the whole thing. Feel that I spend too much, everything that is, delete uncreate, and de-story it all. Feel that I can't seem to gain financial independence delete, uncreate, and de-story the whole thing. Feel that money cannot appear for no reason, that you didn't work for it, everything that is, delete, uncreate, de-story the whole thing all time dimension space reality. Anywhere you guys are hurt because money doesn't show up, it shows up for others, but it doesn't for you. Everywhere you guys have had resentful feelings about that, and every time you guys have seen like kind of jerks or I'm just going to cuss for a minute. jerks or assholes or bitches or any of those people, that they get all the money and all the luck, and then you're a nice person and then you don't get anything. Everywhere you guys are feeling like that or thinking that everything that is, delete, uncreate, and de-story the whole thing. Yes, all right, I know. It wasn't very spiritual that I cussed, but honestly the energy wanted it. So everything creating you guys, feeling resentful that all the unhappy people have all the good luck and you don't, delete, uncreate, and de-story all of that. Everywhere you guys are not lucky, delete, uncreate, and de-story all of that. Everywhere you guys have some issues with your bodies that are manifesting as part of like, you know, your abundance stuff stirred up, just uncreate, delete, and de-story all of it. Time is a gazillion, boom, that was a big deal. Chris is saying something about heart palpitations. It's going to sound funny, but there's actually an energy around your heart, your heart center really wants to open. And once you get more conscious, it wants to feel more light. So your body wants to soak up more light, just like once just soak up water, right? In a way, what have you guys have been walking around like dehydrated for light, for lack of a better way to say it. You know what I mean? And you just needed more spiritual light in your life. And what will happen is your body makes all these yawnings and little heart flutters or things like this, because it wants to open, open, open to receive more light. So everywhere you guys don't open, delete, uncreate, de-story. Parents taught me that money can only be spent once, and once it's gone, it's gone, everything that is delete all that. Everywhere there's cash and love affairs and sexual abuse and romantic abuse and having to be with a person who's a negative for the money, everything that is, uncreate, delete, and de-story the whole thing. All right, let's see. Okay, so let's go to the next one really quick. How do you look at achieving your abundance and goals? That is hard, so do it from the seeing sense, hard. So everything that is where you guys cannot see the way into a new regulatory money manifesting idea, everything that is, uncreate, delete, and de-story the whole thing. Somebody is asking how do you do these, some people are saying it's confusing, everywhere it's confusing to see what you need to see, everything that is uncreate, delete, and de-story the whole thing. You guys are letting go of a lot of stuff. Somebody was asking, should you do the clearing statement on the heaviest thing? Well, what I'm going to encourage you to do is hopefully you jotted down some of the things that came up and I would just do them five to seven to 10 times. And if they still feel a little heavy after you've done them, do them a few more times. Everywhere you guys see a wall right in front of you and you can't see anything other than your own reality, delete, uncreate, and de-story it all. Everywhere you guys are doing the reality like everybody else does in this silly planet, everything that is, delete, uncreate, and de-story the whole thing. Everywhere you guys are afraid to just go create your own world in the world, 'cause that's really the objection or the objective is to just go create your own world and let everybody have their reactions, whatever they are, but just go get happy and you know, kind of screw them if they can't take a joke. Everything that is, uncreate, delete, and de-story it all. Everywhere your future is too far away from you and you can't even see it, delete, uncreate, and de-story the whole thing. Everywhere you guys are afraid to do the wrong thing and not the right thing, uncreate, delete, and de-story it all. Everywhere you guys are connected to the matrix and you're allowing the matrix to control you, delete, uncreate, and de-story it all. Everywhere you guys have been brainwashed by the matrix and let the matrix tell you what you should be do and have regarding money, everything that is delete all of it. So any of your childhood symptomology that manifested as control there where you didn't feel like you could be in control of your life, this is for you, Irene, delete, uncreate, and de-story all of that. Everywhere you are afraid to just like let's just say the first time you made money, you worked your touch off, and everywhere you guys are just afraid to go do that again, because honestly I work a lot, but honestly I do it because I like it, it's really not because I have to. Do you understand? There's a difference. I actually kind of like it. So everything in the way of you guys liking that, delete, uncreate, and de-story it all, and everywhere you're afraid to do it no matter what it takes, if it took that for a little while, like three months, six months, and then your life changed, great. Everywhere you're afraid to do that, uncreate, delete, and de-story the whole thing. Brainwashed by the matrix. Basically there's an energy that's wrapped around the planet, and it basically is sort of controlling and kind of programs us all. So everywhere you guys are connected to the matrix and the matrix doesn't want you to be free, uncreate, delete, and de-story it all, yes. It's basically like all of our thoughts, feelings, and ideas about life as a collective, and we're all kind of connected to it and to free yourself, you basically just have to go live a life really happy and lovely and then you'll be free of it. Chris wants to know if he can re-story after de-storying, yes, I was going to do that Sunday. We're going to fill in what your new story is, but you can work on it sooner. So what do you say about manifesting and achieving your desired outcomes? So what do you say out loud to your friends, to your hubby, to your wife about cash? What do you guys say out loud to yourself? Everywhere you guys who are the oldest who are the youngest or the middle, and somehow where you were born in the lineage, somehow determined how much you can have, be, or do, everything that is, uncreate, delete, and de-story it all. Usually the oldest has to take the most burden, usually the middle child gets stuck in the middle and usually thinks they're second best, generally speaking, everything that is delete all that. And the youngest is a baby and it was coddled and sometimes doesn't learn how to do for him or herself, so any of that resonated, uncreate, delete, and de-story the whole thing. How did these bills get so high? Thank you, Elizabeth. Everything that is, uncreate, delete and, de-story it all. Don't spend it, there's not enough.

Everything that is, uncreate, delete, and de-story it all. Everywhere you guys are trying 'cause trying never happens, we all know, you can't try, you can only do. So who said that? Yoda I think, Yoda. So everything that is uncreate, delete, and de-story it all. I would just lie to myself for awhile, Shareen and just say I'm manifesting it no matter what 'cause that's really the truth. You're in the middle of manifesting it no matter what. I don't have it right now, everything that is, uncreate, delete, and de-story it all. Everywhere you guys are so private about your money, you don't talk to anybody about it, okay, that's cool, but what do you say inside your own self? What do you say in your own head, Margaret? What do you say to yourself? Good at juggling credit cards, everything that is, delete, uncreate, and de-story. There's a talent and an ability, so you could also be good at juggling income, huh? Everywhere it's good if it's earned, honestly, and if it's earned not honestly, you'll reject it. Everything that is, delete, uncreate, and de-story the whole thing. Life is hard, I'm not worthy of comfort. Everything that is, uncreate, delete, and de-story it all. Somebody is asking me if cigarettes and weed are negative for him. The answer would be probably because the truth is, the real, real, real truth is if it's shutting down your energy at some level and you need something to amp you up, there's like a crutch there. So anything that's a crutch that you guys are using as a crutch to numb and dumb yourself at some level, uncreate, delete, and de-story it all. Everywhere you don't think infinite being, I mean seriously, when you're just walking around being totally infinite in your infinite being self, the amount of joy that runs through your body is more like lovely orgasmic and gorgeous than anything else that we could ever ingest or put in our body, probably too much information but honestly, when pure bliss hits your body and it just runs through it, that's a good, good day. So everywhere you guys can't have that good a day, delete, uncreate, and de-story the whole thing. How did I screw this up again? Good one, Torah. How did I screw this money thing up again?

Everywhere you guys are grounded in your troubles, delete, uncreate, and de-story it all. Anywhere you guys are holding this stuff in your body, hiding it from yourself, delete, uncreate, and de-story all of that. You guys could pick a body part and just do what, I'm sorry, I can't remember the guy's name where he just blissfully like kept clearing all the stuff in his body and it went away. Oh, I saw robbed Peter to pay Paul. Anytime you guys have anything about that, delete, uncreate, and de-story all of it. Oh, Savannah, thank you, Savannah. Savannah is online tonight, so we told a story about him. He is the one that fixed his leg, great. Your core foundational values. These stories need to align with what you're going to achieve. I want to clarify this because somebody was asking, do we have to fill up with something? I'm going to just tell you the real, real truth. You're an infinite being full of infinite source pure energy. And when we clear things, you automatically fill in with yourself. It's really, really okay to just get to the root of things. When I clear things on myself, I just keep digging, digging, digging, digging, digging, clearing, clearing, clearing, clearing, clearing until I get to like this place where it feels kind of happy and then I fill myself up. All right, I just want to say I am so happy for you guys. This is some really deep stuff and I just love that you're willing to go along with this. Okay, love you bunches. Chao for now, love you, bye.

====================

LESSON 10: Clearing Feeling Stuck (Clearing Session Only)

All right, so we're going to talk today about values and alignment. Close your eyes. If you're driving, just do the energy thing without your eyes closed because you can multitask. All right, so close your eyes and take your energy about 300 feet up and see, sense, or feel, see, sense, or feel the light, pure consciousness itself. there to support and serve you okay and let that light come into your crown and imagine like um let's imagine it like a swirly purple vacuum for a little bit we're gonna just kind of vacuum out some things imagine it going into your crown and the light's going in but at the same time the bad stuff's getting sucked out all right so it's gonna suck out anything in the crown And round your third eye so you can see and know the truth about everything. And then we're going to suck out some energy around your ears so you can hear true guidance. And I would encourage everybody to put on their wish list so they can see, hear, and know true guidance. Yes? Okay, cool. See, hear, and know the truth about anything. It's a really cool tool to have. All right. Okay, and imagine this light comes into your throat, kind of clearing out anywhere you're blocked on your creativity. All right, and we're going to let this light go into your heart and just kind of, you know, vanquish, vanish, eliminate any place where you don't have compassion or kindness for yourself on your journey, anywhere you're hard on yourself, anywhere you beat yourself up, anywhere you talk to yourself the way your parents talk to you. Right? Okay, cool. Imagine there's a light that comes after that and just kind of fills you in. It goes down your arms, into your heart, through your head, into your heart. Okay, now imagine this vacuum kind of sucks up anything in your solar plexus. Anything, that's where all the nerves are in your body. There's a big nerve centers that kind of gravitate right there as above, so below. So any nervous gut reactions, any fear -based agendas. any place that you don't want to be here on the planet in your body and you feel not very grounded. Okay, delete all that. Yeah, a lot of energy right there leaving. Some of you guys didn't really want to be here. That's kind of a common belief, by the way. Imagine taking an infinite being and shoving him in a little baby body. Sometimes it's not very fun. Okay, all right. Okay, so take this vacuum and kind of suck out some energy in your navel area. That's where your power center is. Okay, awesome. Take this energy, go around your root, anywhere you can't feel rooted, safe, anywhere you're angry, fearful, untrusting, don't like men or women or the opposite sex or the same sex, anywhere you feel misguided and don't trust your path, delete all that stuff there. Okay, and then let the light just come in so it's going through your body now, all the way down your legs, into your knees, into your feet. into the center of the planet where it joins with this gorgeous energy in the center of the planet where it just feels pure light love kind of giggly imagine there's a trampoline down there and it just kind of bounces the energy right back up into your heart yeah so into your heart like a 360 degree sunshine all the way around okay cool okay awesome So just radiate this light around your body. 360 degrees, a great big central sunshine. The light's coming from above and below, completely filling you. And imagine this light gets bigger than the building you're in. And the light gets bigger than the city you're in. And the light gets, yeah, bigger than the state you're in. And bigger than the country you're in. And bigger than the planet. Okay. Awesome. All right. So now you guys, we're going to clear some stuff today. So it might be one of those days where it's like, for some of you, it might be heavy stuff. Okay. So we're just going to like get through it. So just kind of laugh at all your junk while we're clearing it. All right. So you can still be present to it, pay attention to it, go into it, feel the heaviness of it, and then love that we're going to clear it. Okay. So let's work on change. So everywhere, you guys are having a hard time changing. Don't think you can change. Don't think money can change. Okay, everything that is, uncreate, delete, and destroy the whole thing across all time, dimensions, space, reality. Yep, across all morphic fields. Yep. Okay, right there. Anywhere you or your genetic lineage has any blocks on change, or manifesting something different. Delete, uncreate, and de -story all of that. Now I'm going to clear this a minute. Some of you believe you can change, but you don't think your money can change, right? Or your abundance can change, or your ability to manifest really cool stuff, whatever that is, can change. So everywhere, you don't believe that you can manifest really cool stuff in your life, or manifest a lot of cash, or manifest something different, even if it's in love, or relationships, or any of that. Everything that is, delete, uncreate, and destroy the whole thing. Everywhere you guys feel like you have to bargain with Source, like Source is like the big Santa Claus, and Source isn't going to deliver to you unless you beg and borrow any of that kind of energy. Delete, uncreate, and destroy the whole thing. Anywhere you guys think you're bad and you don't deserve it, delete, uncreate, and destroy all that. Anywhere you think Source abandoned you, delete, uncreate, and destroy all that. Okay, that's some good stuff. Okay, anywhere else change is not possible. Delete, uncreate, and destory across all time dimensions, space, and reality. So everywhere you guys are angry over things didn't change earlier than now. Okay, delete, uncreate, and destory all of that. Okay, anywhere else you guys feel like things don't change right away, delete all that. Okay, now when I say see, sense, or feel the light, Again, anywhere you guys turn down your perception so you can't see, sense, or feel, and anywhere you guys put a veil over your eyes, your third eye, or your ears, or any of that, delete, uncreate, and destroy all of that too, please. Everywhere you guys have no idea how to make a difference in the world in your own life, delete, uncreate, and destroy all that. Because literally how you make a difference is you just clear out your stuff and Keep asking what would it take and keep putting forward some new energy, right? That's how you make a difference in the world because you change your life, you change everybody else around you. Okay, awesome. Everywhere you guys are afraid that they'll abandon you if you actually get too big for your britches, right? Everything that is, uncreate, delete, and destroy the whole thing. Everywhere you're afraid your change will be taken away eventually and you won't be able to keep it, delete, uncreate, and destroy the whole thing. Okay. that's a lot of cool stuff hey everywhere you guys have some Anger over perceived mistreatments or anger over you're not ahead of time, right? You didn't change it too quickly. Delete, uncreate, and destory all that. Everywhere you have no idea how much time you've wasted, delete, uncreate, and destory all of that too. All right. So I'm going to say something here. So everywhere you guys aren't taking new actions, right? Because the other part of manifesting is you ask, then you have to take some new actions or put yourself in front of new people, right? You can't be sitting in the house and not change. You have to be in front of some new people, right? Or do something different or take some guided action. So again, I'm not anybody who I'm talking to right now and I'm pushing your buttons because I'm talking about, oh, you may have to do something different. Okay, so everything that is, delete all that. And anybody who's listening right now and thinks, well, yeah, that's you, Christy, but I don't hear my guidance or any of that kind of stuff. Okay, so everything that is, delete, uncreate, and destroy the whole thing. Now, I didn't always hear my guidance, but you can ask your guides and your higher self to just permanently, permanently, permanently resolve any place where you don't feel that you can hear them. So let's all ask your higher self, your guides, the light right now to permanently resolve anything in the way that's blocking you from hearing them or knowing. All right, cool. We're seeing. Okay, so everything that is, delete, uncreate, and destroy the whole thing. Okay, anywhere you guys have some sort of thing where you have to please other people, so if you change, then you're going to like, you're afraid that other people won't like you and your family. Delete, uncreate, and destory all of that. All right. So I'm going to encourage you guys to just one more time. If some things aren't changing really quickly for you, what I'm going to ask you to do is a little different statement. And that's, you know, what would it take for the most change that has ever happened in my life to happen now, right, in the form of abundance? So what would it take for the most amount of change that I've ever received to show up in my life now? And everything in the way of that, delete it, uncreate it, and destroy it. Okay, there. All right. We're going to uncreate it, we're going to delete it, and we're going to story all of those things. All of those things about procrastinating, that things don't work, that we can't be seen and heard, or acknowledged. Okay, everything that is, delete, uncreate, and destroy the whole thing.

Uncreate, delete, and destroy it all. Yes. It's basically like all of our thoughts, feelings, and ideas about life as a collective, and we're all kind of connected to it. And to free yourself, you basically just have to go live a life really happy and lovely and then you'll be free of it. So what do you say out loud to your friends, to your hubby, to your wife about cash? What do you guys say out loud to yourself?

LESSON 11: Aligning With What You Truly Desire

- Hey, this is Christie Marie Sheldon, and you're listening to a recording I did of a series of 24 live group sessions on "Clearing Your Abundance Blocks." And here's where we're going to cover in today's session, number 11. We're going to work on creating your life story, your vision of what you always wanted. And what this means is we're going to have to discover what you really value in life. And after we figure this out, you're going to know the exact steps to take towards manifesting this dream life. You're going to create a pathway so that what you really value is manifested in loving relationship with yourself. And the one way we're going to do this is using tools to create a vibrational alignment that pulls it right to you. And as always, we're going to take a look at some of the common and specific blocks that you're going to face that are in your way. And we're going to get all that junk, that stuff that blocks you cleared up so that you walk right down the path of living a life that matches how you believe it should be. So let's begin. Hi, welcome, welcome. It's Christie, how are you? It is so good to be here. So we are on day 11 and we are going to really, really work on you getting clear what you want your new story to be in your life, okay? Like how you really want your future to be, and how do you have to be and show up in order for that to manifest. So grab a journal and a piece of paper. There's going to be a little bit of writing today again, because we're going to really write out your story basically. Be open to fun and love, which are light. Remember, truth is light. Love is light. Fun is light. Anything that opens your heart is light. Lies and untruths are heavy, okay? So if you feel heaviness around you, it's probably because you bought and sold yourself some form of lie. So set your intent tonight of what you hope to achieve. If there is a specific thing that you really want to have happen in your life, just set your intent. So that that energy comes in for you. You guys are opening my heart. I can completely feel what you're feeling. All right, and then bring any energy you want to release to the forefront because we're going to clear that. So today, we're going to rewrite your stories. So if you remember, I'm just going to go over a couple of little things. Last week, we talked about how, if you value something and you still have some unconscious programming, the alignment is broken because all your stories, for instance, if you say I'm a saver yet you can't save money, like that's not the action you take in the world, right? Then you're out of alignment. That means there's some subconscious programming of a lower frequency, fear, worry, anger, sadness, something, right? And so you try to align, you try to align, but it doesn't work and you kind of delete your programming. And today is very exciting because we are going to fill you up with some different core foundational values and different stories, okay? So that manifesting your future abundance is going to be a lot, lot easier, and your stories should align with love and gratitude so that everything is filled with the higher frequencies of love, gratitude, joy, peace, fun. Because every day that you guys show up, you could feel a little crappy in the beginning, or you might feel a little crappy that day before you get on the phone call because your soul knows that you really just want to get rid of your stuff. And so your stuff will sort of bubble up, kind of like a salter, it'll just kind of bubble up so that it can clear. So we're going to clear just whatever's kind of coming up for you guys right now in the beginning, but let's connect to the light, before we go any further, clear a couple of the stuff, and then we'll start writing out your stories. Close your eyes and if you're driving, obviously keep your eyes open and just imagine that you're doing everything we're doing with your eyes open, okay? For the rest of us, close your eyes and then take your energy about 300 feet up, see sense or feel, or just imagine and know that there's like a big plug right there, like a big light source. So just imagining that you're connected to the highest source of energy, the highest consciousness, and like a big door, you might just see golden light or feel some light, or just feel a happy energy, okay? And allow that light to come into the crown of your head and imagine it just kind of like spins like a little roto rooter. Kind of filling you up a little bit, okay? So just imagine that this energy comes into your crown, kind of clears out a little around your ears and your third eye. And just imagine it's kind of like a little bit of a liquid light. All right, and let those go into your throat and open up all your creativity so that everything you say you mean, everything that you say gets manifested in the world and then let this light pour into your heart so that you can feel love and compassion and kindness for yourself, filling up with this, fill up with you first, right? Love yourself first then you can love others because you can usually only love others as much as you love yourself, right? And let this liquid light go down your hands, go down your arms, out your hands, and then let this liquid light go into the center part of your belly, where all the nerves are, pay and clear out any place you felt a little sucker punched, any place you felt a little unloved or uncared for, clearing out anywhere you're nervous, anxious, afraid, fearful, everywhere you can't digest the truth, or you can't digest the lies that you've bought and sold yourself, okay? And then let this liquid light go into the root and your power centers. So everywhere you feel afraid of your power, let that go. Anywhere, you abuse your power in the past, let that go, anywhere you've been abused by power, let that go, okay. Everywhere you're afraid to receive that kind of power, let that go, okay. And let it go into your hips, your legs, your calves, your feet. And let this light just, imagine this like a big beam of light that connects to the center of the planet. So as above and so below, there's a really happy energy field in the center of the planet. And imagine that you just connect there and imagine there's a little trampoline and this light just gets beamed right back up into your legs, into your hips, into your stomach and into your heart radiating out like a big 360 degrees sunshine all the way around. Okay, so now you're connected from above and below in the center of your heart, radiating out, okay. Now ask this ball of energy to radiate out past the building. So your big central sunshine in the middle of your heart just radiates past the building you're in, yes. Past the city you're in, yes. Past the state you're in, yes. Past the country you're in, yes. Past the planet, yes. So now you're connected to the oneness of all things. Your spirit is infinite. There are no edges to you, your spirit can connect to all things. All right, awesome. Everything that's kind of been coming up for you guys today, so anything that you've been perceiving that needs to release, we're going to uncreate, delete, and de-story the whole thing across all time, dimension, space, reality, yes. Okay, one more time. All the places you've been holding onto some old stories that are like your lifeboat and you think you need them, uncreate, delete, and de-story all those, and all objections you have to getting a new life, obviously it's probably unintentional and subconscious, so all your subconscious programmings, any genetic lineage fields that create you not wanting to get a new form of life, uncreate, delete, and de-story all that across all time, dimension, space, reality. And just know if you're feeling kind of icky that if you expand, it always helps it clear a little quicker. Okay, so I'm hearing to clear some of the contracts that you have with your old stories. So everywhere you guys have a contract with your old story that doesn't let you get a new story, uncreate, delete, and de-story the whole thing. Okay, any other contracts like, oh, spouse, commitments to yourself that are just old and not handled and kind of just sitting around taking up space in your energy field, you don't need them anymore, uncreate, delete, and de-story all those. Any old packs and vows and I will nevers, I will never do that again, okay, all those things, uncreate, delete, and de-story all those. All your contracts that say I can't, I shouldn't, I wouldn't, and I couldn't, uncreate, delete, and de-story all those. And any contracts you guys have with your family to like stay the same, uncreate, delete, and de-story all those too. All the contracts that you have with shame and guilt, anywhere, shame, guilt, fear, anger, worry are your best friends, uncreate, delete, and de-story the whole thing. Everywhere worries are normal operating point of view, uncreate, delete, and de-story all that. Usually, if you worry you're kind of a control freak, because you're trying to worry so you control your future, right? But really, really, really, if you just set your intent to how you want it, let in a lot of source, love, and light, you don't have to worry because that will guide you, okay? So everywhere you guys are like creating from the past or creating from your old stories and our control freaks trying to hold the past around you, uncreate, delete, and de-story all that. And everywhere you guys are afraid of the future. uncreate, delete, and de-story all that across all time, dimension, space, reality. All genetic codes that you guys are holding in your body that keep you, hmm, just kind of stuck, in anywhere you guys blame other people for your problems, doing a little victim, uncreate, delete, and de-story all of that too. Okay, any contract that you guys have with yourself, to let yourself love yourself enough, to let yourself have everything, uncreate, delete, and de-story all that. Everywhere you guys are afraid to love yourself that much, uncreate, delete, and de-story all that. Everywhere you guys are afraid of pulling in so much light so that you can be totally full of yourself. 'Cause anywhere you made it like that, somehow being full of yourself as wrong, uncreate, delete, and de-story all that too. 'Cause wouldn't it be great if you guys were all full of yourself. All right, so any other baggage that you guys want to get rid of right now, uncreate, delete, and de-story the whole thing. Any other thing that you guys want to get rid of, uncreate, delete, and de-story all that too. Anywhere you guys don't think something new is possible and anywhere you guys freak out with change, uncreate, delete, and de-story that across all time dimension space, reality, yes, across all karma, yes. Any of your mental facilities that are blocking you from seeing something new in your life, uncreate, delete, and de-story all that. Any of the grids around your body that want to change right now to open up to a new possibility, just ask for change. Anything that's unspoken that you need to let go of or forgive yourself for, uncreate, delete, and de-story all that too. So if any of you didn't listen to last week, you can still participate for sure, for sure, okay? All right, so the thing with these is even if you haven't participated but you signed up, your soul has been getting some clearing anyway. Okay, as long as you set your intent that you receive the healing from the group. So any of you guys that any of those testimonies that brought up anything for you guys where you don't think that you can have those kind of wins, or you want something more than all that, any weird energy with that, delete, uncreate, and de-story the whole thing. You know what the cool thing is when somebody tells me their story, I get excited because of what I see as I can see, if they can do it, I can do it too, right? That's why I love documentaries, biographies, all those kinds of stories. And I read them and I kind of go, wow, wouldn't it be cool if I did that too? What kind of energy did they use to make that happen? I'm going to use the same kind of energy, like my version of the energy, right? All right, so now you guys probably feel a little bit lighter. Some of you are probably a little bit, yawny, tired, all that kind of stuff. That's just processing consciousness. So somebody else had a question about what does intending? Intending is like, I want you guys to think of something for a minute. And I talked a little bit about this last week. Have you ever just made a freaking decision that like, no matter what, this is going to change? It's like you make this proclamation to the universe that my life will never be different. This is going to happen no matter what. Now, if for some, you, if you've never made a decision that firmly, I want you to just walk around this week pretending that you know what that would be. Like, literally if I had no option except to make this happen, what would I do? Because what I know for sure is if you make a decision from that place, it pushes the energy so intensely that anything new can't really show up in the space. This is a good day 'cause they're retaining your stories today. All right, so let's just kind of go along with it. The whole time when you're on here, just keep uncreating and deleting. If you can't stay awake, that's okay, you're still receiving it. Can you make too many intentions at one time? No. No, that's not true. You can make plenty of intentions. So let's go to the next part, okay? So we can kind of turn on more of the energy. So we're going to really work here on what your new choices are. What do you value in your future? So when I say value, here's what I mean. We talked a little bit of last week about how you could be a saver, but if you're doing the opposite, like spending all your money, that's your story, right? Like you're valuing being a saver, but what you're actually doing is spending all your cash. So let's pretend you could get your life exactly, exactly, exactly how you want it, okay? So how do you want it? And what do you value in this new part of your story? Like, you could be a saver of magnitude, right? You could value loving your life all the time and really work on changing what's not working. You know what's happened over the years with me is I can't settle anymore. If I don't like something in my life, I like have to take action and just change it. Like the more my vibrations raise, the more I just really don't like anything that makes me unhappy. So I change it really fast. I just say, what would it take for this to change? And then I make it happen, okay? So that is my wish for you. That all of you will not settle, okay? That's really what I'm saying. Another thing you can value, like for instance, I value in my own self that I make a demand to make my life my way. Is it always perfect because there's other people's intentions? No, but is the 80, 90% pretty perfect? Yeah, do I still want it to be 100% perfect? Yeah, but I mean, if you have family and things like that, still sometimes there's a group thing that has to happen, right? But what I'm encouraging you to value is that you demand on yourself to really get your life to look the way you want it. I also would encourage you to put part of your wishlist for rewriting your story, that you create action plan, okay? So in order to get it to be something new, you're going to have to take some actions, right? Or you could value having beautiful energy around all the time, like in your space, right? What if your space where you live vibrated the energy of beauty? So that's why, like, for instance, where I live, when I wake up in the morning, the first thing I see is this gorgeous mountain that turns like a beautiful salmon pink color in the morning. To me, that's gorgeous, right? So that's one of the things that I value. So I want you guys to type to me so we can kind of share a little bit and start writing some notes for yourself of some of the things that you value and that you want to include in the next part of your life, in your story. So here's some of them freedom to spend money freely and to have time to enjoy life for me and my family. So what he is saying is he wants to have more than enough money, right? More than enough money that he can spend and have enough time to enjoy life for him and his family. Okay, fun, loving, and rich. Residual income, friendships, supportive people around. I value feeling joy, financial freedom, excellent health. I value of the love of my girlfriend, love it. Warm, happy, loving relationships, having inner peace, abundance, an awesome, beautiful life partner, money and income, to know the truth about anything, being well connected to kids, creating your own schedule. That's actually a good one. That's one of my favorite parts about my life. I get to do whatever I want to do when I want to do it. Travel the world on somebody else's dime. That's actually good. I know of some people who do that, they've either manifested plenty of incomes, married somebody rich. I know some people who put on travel tours and the reason they wanted to do that with their life is so that they could get paid and create a business doing travel. Being myself, joyful people, financial freedom to help my mom, family, and friends, loving marriage to my soulmate. I love it. And having an abundant, healthy, happy life together, integrity in all that I do, never bored at work. Okay, so all these things. Now we're going to do something a little bit different today, okay? So we're going to fill in. So I want you to just visualize for a minute, visualize for you some of the things that you typed and just kind of see sense and feel what you would be if that was occurring in your life. So just kind of imagine, like maybe you're in your house and you see yourself spending time with a family and you're really happy. Or if doing your career path, right? Imagine that you're doing the dream job. That pays you plenty of money. Imagine you have a certain amount of money in the bank account. All right, and see yourself loving your life and just kind of go with it, make it a little more clear if you can. Like imagine there's a knob in front of you and you can turn it up and make it a little technicolor or you can, if you're not a good visualizer, maybe you can feel it a little bit more. But just see who you would be around. Are you in the same house? Are you in a different house? Are you in the same job? Are in a different job? So we're going to visualize and fill in. So I want you guys to now just energetically to stay with me, say out loud, if you can, I don't know where you guys are at, but if you can say it out loud, what would it take for all this to happen now? What would it take for the universe to guide me to this? So I have it happened easily, effortlessly, completely guided as fast as it can show up. What would it take for me to be an excellent receiver of this creation? What vibrational energy can I be to make this happen? What vibrational energy can I be to receive the gift of this? What vibrational energy can I be to deserve this? What vibrational energy can I become to have this happen now? What would it take for me to be so thrilled, joyful, and loved in this new reality? What vibration do I have to be to anchor all this in now and into my future? So just see those kind of open a door into your future so it's anchored into the now and into the future. Okay, so we're going to kind of just do it a couple of different ways, okay? And let's see what else pops up for you. In this new future, what are you saying in this new story? Like, are you saying, wow, I'm so freaking happy. I can't even believe how easy this was. This was so amazing. I'm going to share with other people how to do this. What else would you be saying? All right, so let's type some of the things that you guys would be saying. I knew I could do this. I love to get out of bed in the morning 'cause my days are so thrilling. Wow, how easy it is to manifest this. Wow, I am so blessed. Wow, I am a powerful goddess with strep my stuff, kickass, feel good, beautiful, joyful, inspiring, sparkly, energy that uplifts others. I love it. I am so blessed to live the life of my dreams. I can't wait to wake up and get out of bed. My life is wonderful. Thank you universe. This is so great I want to share it with anyone that is ready to receive it. I just see myself smiling. I love my life, my husband, my kids, and my house. I am so energized. This is exactly what I wanted to do. I have an amazing life. Woo hoo. Wow, this is really happening for me. Can't wait to have my friends over for lunch and into my new life. I feel so free. I love my job and my new life. That it wasn't so difficult. How can I serve you? This is really my life, right? You have to pinch yourself. Slam dunk. I'm finally living it. Wow, it's fantastic living from a vibration of love. Wow, thank you. I am so busy and loving this life. I'm glad I stuck to it and trusted myself. I am manifesting as I write, it is easy to make my desires active and alive. This is the power of love. It's so simple. I love my life. I am so lucky. I am so blissed out. How does it get better than this? What else is possible? Now I am doing what I always knew I could do. It was such a joy to be me. I'm living my dream. I am so beautiful. Can it really be so easy? Oh, she's saying she was feeling a little crappy today. Okay, so anybody who's not getting into this so much, any of the other stuff that's fighting you, okay, any part of you that's fighting you, uncreate, delete, and de-story the whole thing. So anybody that's feeling any resistance to any of these, uncreate, delete, and de-story it all, connect to the light allow it in, even if you've tried this in the past and it didn't work, you're new today, right? It's all a new day, it's a new energy. What would it take to make this happen for you? What would it take for your wows and ohs and your blocks that you keep putting into your future to delete? What would it take for all the negativity that's coming up that really just wants to show itself so we can leave as a gift to you? What would it take for all of that to delete? So just let so much light come in. It's like a tsunami and it just washes away all the old crap that's in the way. Okay, awesome. Okay, any other karma that you guys have with your mothers or fathers that's blocking you from getting this new life, delete all that too. Any genetic stories with your parents that won't let you have a new life delete all that. Any old lovers that won't let you have a new life, delete all those. People congratulate me 'cause I'm so happy all the time. Karen says, I love me, I am awesome, look at what I created. That's right Karen, look what you created. Trevor, lets it pass through himself and shares it. I placed my intention and it showed up. Wow, this is my life now, I am so grateful for feeling this joy. I love being me. I get to go to sleep with a smile and I wake up with a smile. I accept and embrace my power. I have so many new friends and we're always laughing together. I am filled with gratitude and appreciation. I feel great. I am wealthy beyond description. I can make others happy too. My business is running smoothly and I love it. So let's do a couple more of those. Okay, so what would it take for all the things that you listed to show up in your life and everything in the way, we're going to just delete it all, but what would it take? What energy do you need to be? What vibrational energy do you need to be in order to make this happen? What kind of gratitude and bliss do you have to allow into your life in order to make this your new future valued things show up in your life? What would it take for this to happen so easily that you laugh about it every day? And everything in the way of any of these things happening, we're going to delete, uncreate, and de-story them. You still want to clear some blocks. If there's any part of your body that feels a little heavy, go into that heavy part and just say, hey, what would it take for you to leave right now? I'm going to change my story. Any of you that have tried visualization in the past and it didn't work, it was those subconscious blocks. So all the subconscious blocks that are coming up, kind of fighting you, uncreate, delete all those. What would it take for all these things that you're saying to yourself to show up so magnanimously that you laugh about it? What would it take for them to show up this week? What would it take for you to like go to bed smiling and wake up smiling, right? What would it take for you guys to have like so many clients and business that you love it, can't believe it happened? Whoo, you know? What would it take for all of that to happen? What would it take for the universe to be so generous and you to be such an excellent receiver that all of it shows up now? What would it take for all the delays that you guys have put in your future to be deleted, uncreated, de-storied across all time, dimension, space, and reality? Yeah, all the delays that you guys put into your future, uncreate, delete, and de-story all of them. All the heaviness in your heart from the past, delete, uncreate, and de-story all that. What would it take for your heart to be so happy? You just open it and receive it. You just go for it. You make a few phone calls and you make it happen. You take guided action. All right, let's do another layer of the next one. In this new choice, the new choices, the new things that you value, the new story, what are you doing? What are you doing? What actions are you taking that are different than what you're doing now? I like this one. People tell me I was born under a lucky star, I love it. Yes, Grace was asking, can raising my vibrations help everybody around me? Yes Grace, you become like a magnet, right? And just kind of, your vibration rubs off on people basically. In the David Hawkins book, "Power Versus Force," he talks about one person vibrating at love can positively impact 750,000 other people operating guilt, shame, fear. So what are you guys doing? You're being a magnet attracting the best life. Your heart is so full you can't help but radiate sunshine. I acquire the skills necessary to choose a wonderful life mate. I love myself. Emotionally healthy, spiritually healthy. Emily is saying, I can tell something starts right now. Creating ways to have fun, get paid to have fun and play every day, getting out there inspiring others, move forward and stop the procrastinating, getting more rest so I'm not so tired and cranky no matter what. That's a really good thing, Janie, self-care, right? Taking care of yourself. How could I be like you feel? Work is fun and lucrative. I'm focused and consistent in my plans and intentions. I think wisely before spending. Grace is saying, can you delete blocks in others? You can, for sure. So you can, it's not really polite. You can do it, but it's not polite to put your will on other people. So I would always ask if they really want it before I just freely just blow up their stuff. 'Cause usually what happens if you blow up somebody's stuff and they don't like it, then they get a little mad at you. 'Cause they can somehow tell that you did something to their energy. But yeah with kids that they're having a little fit and you don't want them to have a little fit, first off I would ask, is this my energy that my kid is acting out? Number one, 'cause usually it's the adults energy first or is it somebody else around there? And then you can blow that energy up. I think wisely before spending. So Karen's new thing that she values, is she thinks wisely before she spends. Rebecca is going to include family and friends in her opportunities and create a manifesting journal so she has concrete evidence. Opening my heart and blessing and sending light everywhere I go. Noni, that's like a really fun thing to do. It's really fun actually, 'cause number one, you get filled up while you do it. And number two, people will turn around and look at you 'cause they felt that you did something that was blissful. All right, relaxed and happy. Take care of myself, do my homework for abundance and making plans for my future. All right, I'm going to give you a big hand for that Mary, 'cause what I really want from you guys more than anything is that you have a plan and you do it. Changing and attracting good things. Jenny says where she's from Katelyn, you say that you're lucky when you were born with a flower in your bum. Okay, let's see, living a life free of worry and anxiety, connecting to my true self, remaining present, hosting more parties and going out with friends, listening to inner guidance and taking action, make decisions and don't look back. I think that any decision is better than no decision because at least you'll get further down the track and then you'll at least figure out if it worked or didn't work. And if it didn't work, don't beat yourself up. Just change to a new decision, right? It's no big deal. So that's why I'm never really afraid to make mistakes 'cause whatever, you know what I mean? There's always a new day and I'll just try it different the next day. Writing more blog posts, practicing and working with energy every day instead of reading how to do it. All right, I'm going to give you a hand on that, Kelly. I love it. The only way to really get it, it's actually do it. That's it. How do you learn anything? You have to embody it. And the only way to embody it is you actually have to take action and try it out until somewhere it clicks. Totally believing that this will happen no matter what, making a difference in other's lives. Saying no with an open heart. Yeah, that's really great, Elizabeth. Sometimes you just have to say no. Meredith is saying, what new actions that she's doing in the future, she's acting weird. Which as we know for those of you are new, you probably don't know what that means, but if you look up the definition of the word weird, you will see that it means supernatural. One of the definitions of the word weird is supernatural. So what if you're actually being more like your soul, which is supernatural when you're acting weird. Okay, eat properly so I can keep my intuition high, love it. Keep my commitments to myself, love it. Asks for help when I need it, love it. All I see as opportunity, I love that too. That means your perspective has changed so much that you see the opportunity in all things. When I look around the world, I see a zillion things I could make better, create better, solve problems. Now I have to choose what I'm going to spend my time on. But I always see opportunity. Christine is action is stop hoping that things will start to happen once the unlimited finishes. Whoa, Christina, everywhere you don't think that you can have it all now, uncreate, delete, and de-story it, and everywhere you're a little depressed about your future, uncreate, delete, and de-story it. Any of you listening who have some depression about your future 'cause you don't think it'll be different, uncreate, delete, and de-story it. And any person on the planet who has ever taken any of your hopes away, one of the worst things we can ever do is take somebody whose hope away. So anywhere you guys are hopeless, yeah, uncreate, delete, and de-story all that. Any other karmic imprint or genetic imprint, mom and dad, that made you feel that you can't, shouldn't, wouldn't, I mean, one of the things parents are usually really good at is telling us no, right? 'Cause they're like, no, don't do that. Don't touch the hot stove. Okay, anywhere you guys do no instead of yes, uncreate, delete, and de-story all that across all time, dimension, space and realities. Whoo, I like this, looking for my own office. Exercise for the joy of it, tie it to myself, love it. Take massive actions, create a life plan, fill up with unconditional love and have fun every day. All right, I love this. So you guys are doing great. Okay, so all these things, what would it take for all these things that you just listed to show up in your life magnanimously and now? What would it take for your energy to positively magnetize all these things in your life now and everything in the way of that, just delete it all. What would it take for a string of happy incidences to show up in your life and fulfill all your wishes, dreams, and desires? Just kind of visualize some of the things you guys were saying, just visualize that happening. Okay, see it happening in your normal life. What are you wearing? What color? Where's your surroundings? Turn the color up. Turn the feeling up. See what you would be doing. If you're exercising joyfully, see yourself doing it. If you're blessing, people, see yourself doing it. If you're creating a fun work environment, see yourself doing it. If you're having patients with your family, see yourself doing that, if you're loving yourself and taking care of your house, see yourself going to bed early, drinking water, doing all the things that we know we should do. Okay, cool. Visualizing and feeling well connected to the light 300 feet above your head, is the quickest way to make it happen. Why is that? Because you have a lot more power in your body. You have a lot more spaciousness. The more spacious you are, the easier it is to create things. Generate it through a greater scope. So now, we're kind of doing that a little bit right now, but in your new life, the new things you value, what do you see? So just start visualizing right now some of the things that you see in your new life. Okay, so visualize some of the things you're seeing, who's with you? What are you doing? Visualize your heart full of love while you're doing it. So you're so excited. You're so excited about this new life. You get to share with those around you and they get excited for you too. You might have some new people in your life and they're excited for you too.

What would it take for you guys to be excellent givers and receivers of whatever energy is needed to manifest this? And what would it take for all the change to occur now? And anything that you guys are stopping, blocking, or stopping yourself from doing or starting, delete, uncreate, and de-story it all. And any excuse that you guys are going to make at the end of the day, you're going to have to take action. So anywhere you guys are making excuses where you won't do the homework and you won't visualize it and you won't put the energy forward, delete all that too. All right, so we did a lot of feelings. Clear your stories this week. By the way, good job. I didn't properly acknowledge you guys. You did a great job.

Email me your inspiring stories for Wednesday. I really want to see, I can tell, by the way, I can really feel the energy in the whole group, okay?

All right, many, many blessings, so much love to you. I am so proud of you guys. All right, take care.

LESSON 11: Getting Clear on Your Values (Clearing Session Only)

So set your intent tonight of what you hope to achieve. If there's a specific thing that you really want to have happen in your life, just set your intent so that that energy comes in for you. Let's connect to the light. Before we go any further, clear a couple of the stuff and then we'll start writing out your stories. Close your eyes and if you're driving, obviously keep your eyes open and just imagine that you're doing everything we're doing with your eyes open. Okay, for the rest of us, close your eyes. And then take your energy about 300 feet up. See, sense, or feel, or just imagine and know that there's like a big plug right there, like a big light source. So just imagine that you're connected to the highest source of energy, the highest consciousness. And like a big door, you might just see golden light or feel some light or just feel a happy energy. Okay, and allow that light to come into the crown of your head. And imagine it just kind of like spins like a little roto -rooter. Kind of filling you up a little bit. Okay, so just imagine that this energy comes into your crown. It kind of clears out a little around your ears and your third eye. And just imagine it's kind of like a little bit of a liquid light. All right, and let this go into your throat and open up all your creativity so that everything you say you mean, you know, everything that you say gets manifested in the world. Okay, and then let this light pour into your heart so that you can feel love and compassion and kindness for yourself. Filling up with this, you know, fill up with you first, right? Love yourself first, then you can love others. Because you can usually only love others as much as you love yourself, right? And let this liquid light go down your hands, go down your arms, out your hands. Then let this liquid light go into the center part of your belly where all the nerves are. Okay, and clear out any place you feel a little sucker punched, any place you felt a little unloved or uncared for. Clearing out anywhere you're nervous, anxious, afraid, fearful. Everywhere you can't digest the truth or you can't digest the lies that you've bought and sold yourself. Okay, and then let this liquid light go into the root in your power center. So everywhere you feel afraid of your power, let that go. Anywhere you abused your power in the past, let that go. Anywhere you've been abused by power, let that go. Okay, everywhere you're afraid to receive that kind of power, let that go. okay and let it go into your hips your legs your calves your feet let this light just imagine it's like a big beam of light and it connects to the center of the planet so as above and so below there's a really happy energy field in the center of the planet and imagine that you just connect there and imagine there's a little trampoline and this light just gets beamed right back up into your legs into your hips into your stomach and into your heart, radiating out like a big 360 degree sunshine all the way around. Okay, so now you're connected from above and below in the center of your heart, radiating out. Okay, now ask this ball of energy to radiate out past the building. So your big central sunshine in the middle of your heart just radiates past the building you're in. Yes, past the city you're in. Yes. Past the state you're in. Yes. Past the country you're in. Yes. Past the planet. Yes. So now you're connected to the oneness of all things. Your spirit is infinite. There are no edges to you. Your spirit can connect to all things. All right. Awesome. Everything that's kind of been coming up for you guys today. So anything that you've been perceiving that needs to release, we're going to uncreate, delete, and de -story the whole thing. Cross all time, dimensions, space, reality. Yes. Okay, one more time. All the places you've been holding on to some old stories that are like your lifeboat and you think you need them, uncreate, delete, and de -story all those. And all objections you have to getting a new life. You know, obviously it's probably unintentional and subconscious, so all your subconscious programmings, any genetic lineage fields that create you not wanting to get a new form of life, uncreate, delete, destroy all that across all time dimensions, space, reality. And just know if you're feeling kind of icky that if you expand, it always helps it clear a little quicker. Okay, so I'm hearing to clear some of the contracts that you have with your old stories. So everywhere you guys have a contract with your old story that doesn't let you get a new story, uncreate, delete, and destroy the whole thing. Okay, any other contracts like oath, spouse, commitments to yourself that are just old and not handled and kind of just sitting around taking up space in your energy field, I think you don't need them anymore, uncreate, delete, and destroy all those. Any old packs and vows and, you know, I will never, I will never do that again. Okay, all those things, uncreate, delete, and destroy all those. All your contracts that say I can't, I shouldn't, I wouldn't, and I couldn't, uncreate, delete, and destroy all those. And any contracts you guys have with your family to, like, stay the same. Uncreate, delete, and destroy all those two. All the contracts that you have with shame and guilt. Anywhere shame, guilt, fear, anger, worry are your best friends. Uncreate, delete, and destory the whole thing. Everywhere worries your normal operating point of view. Uncreate, delete, and destory all that. Usually if you worry, you're kind of a control freak. Because you're trying to worry, so you control your future, right? But really, really, really, if you just set your intent to how you want it. Let in a lot of source love and light. You don't have to worry because that will guide you. Okay, so everywhere you guys are like creating from the past or creating from your old stories and are control freaks trying to hold the past around you, uncreate, delete, and destroy all that. And everywhere you guys are afraid of the future, uncreate, delete, and destroy all that across all time, dimension, space, reality, all genetic codes that you guys are holding in your body that keep you Hmm. Just kind of stuck. And anywhere you guys blame other people for your problems. Doing a little victim. Uncreate, delete, and destroy all of that too. Okay, any contract that you guys have with yourself to not let yourself love yourself enough to let yourself have everything, uncreate, delete, and destroy all that. Everywhere you guys are afraid to love yourself that much, uncreate, delete, and destroy all that. Everywhere you guys are afraid of pulling in so much light so that you can be totally full of yourself. Because anywhere you made it like that somehow being full of yourself was wrong. Uncreate, delete, end your story. all that too because wouldn't it be great if you guys were all full of yourself all right so any other baggage that you guys want to get rid of right now uncreate delete and destroy the whole thing any other thing that you guys want to get rid of uncreate delete and destroy all that too anywhere you guys don't think something new is possible And anywhere you guys freak out with change, uncreate, delete, and destory that across all time dimensions, space, reality. Yes. Across all karma. Yes. Any of your mental facilities that are blocking you from seeing something new in your life, uncreate, delete, and destory all that. Any of the grids around your body that want to change right now to open up to a new possibility, just ask for change. Anything that's unspoken that you need to let go of or forgive yourself for. uncreate, delete, and destroy all that too. So any of you guys that any of those testimonies that brought up anything for you guys where you don't think that you can have that those kind of wins or you want something more than all that any weird energy with that delete, uncreate, and destroy the whole thing. Okay, so all these things now we're going to do something a little bit different today. Okay, so we're going to fill in. So I want you to just visualize for a minute. Visualize for you some of the things that you typed. And just kind of see, sense, and feel what you would be if that was occurring in your life. So just kind of imagine, like maybe you're in your house and you see yourself spending time with the family and you're really happy. Or if you're doing your career path, right? Imagine that you're doing the life, the dream job that pays you plenty of money. Imagine you have a certain amount of money in the bank account. All right, and see yourself loving your life and just kind of go with it. Make it a little more clear if you can. Like imagine there's a knob in front of you and you can turn it up and make it a little technicolor. Or you can, if you're not a good visualizer, maybe you can feel it a little bit more. But just see who you would be around. Are you in the same house or are you in a different house? Are you in the same job or are you in a different job? So we're going to visualize and fill in. So I want you guys to now just energetically to stay with me. Say it out loud if you can. I don't know where you guys are at, but if you can say it out loud, what would it take for all this to happen now? What would it take for the universe to guide me to this so I have it happen easily, effortlessly, completely guided as fast as it can show up? What would it take for me to be an excellent receiver of this creation? What vibrational energy can I be to make this happen? What vibrational energy can I be to receive the gift of this? What vibrational energy can I be to deserve this? What vibrational energy can I become to have this happen now? What would it take for me to be so thrilled, joyful, and loved in this new reality? What vibration do I have to be to anchor all this in now and into my future? So just see this kind of open a door into your future. So it's anchored into the now and into the future. Okay, so we're going to kind of just do it a couple different ways. Okay, and let's see what else pops up for you. In this new future, what are you saying in this new story? Like, are you saying, wow, I'm so freaking happy. I can't even believe how easy this was. This is so amazing. I'm going to share with other people how to do this. What else would you be saying? All right, so let's type some of the things that you guys would be saying. I knew I could do this. I love to get out of bed in the morning because my days are so thrilling. Wow, how easy it is to manifest this. Wow, I am so blessed. Wow, I am a powerful goddess with strut my stuff, kick ass, feel good, beautiful, joyful, inspiring, sparkly energy that uplifts others. I can't wait to have my friends over for lunch and into my new life. I feel so free. I love my job and my new life. Can it really be so easy? Oh, she's saying she's feeling a little crappy today. Okay, so anybody who's not getting into this so much, any of the other stuff that's fighting you, okay, any part of you that's fighting you, uncreate, delete, and destroy the whole thing. So anybody that's feeling any resistance to any of this, uncreate, delete, and destroy it all. Connect to the light, allow it in. Even if you've tried this in the past and it didn't work, you're new today, right? It's all a new day. It's a new energy. What would it take to make this happen for you? What would it take for your bows and oaths and blocks that you keep putting into your future to delete? What would it take for all the negativity that's coming up that really just wants to show itself so it can leave as a gift to you? What would it take for all of that to delete? So just let so much light come in. It's like a tsunami and it just washes away all the old crap that's in the way. Okay, awesome. Okay, any other karma that you guys have with your mothers or fathers that's blocking you from getting this new life, delete all that too. Any genetic stories with your parents that won't let you have a new life, delete all that. Any old lovers that won't let you have a new life, delete all those. Okay, so what would it take for all the things that you listed to show up in your life and everything in the way? We're going to just delete it all. But what would it take? What energy do you need to be? What vibrational energy do you need to be in order to make this happen? What kind of gratitude and bliss do you have to allow into your life in order to make this your new future valued things show up in your life? What would it take for this to happen so easily that you laugh about it every day? Okay, and everything in the way of any of these things happening, we're going to delete, uncreate, and gestorium. You still want to clear some blocks? If there's any part of your body that feels a little heavy, go into that heavy part and just say, hey, what would it take for you to leave right now? I'm going to change my story. Any of you that have tried visualization in the past and it didn't work, it was those subconscious blocks. So all the subconscious blocks that are coming up, kind of fighting you, uncreate, delete all those. What would it take for all these things that you're saying to yourself to show up so magnanimously that you laugh about it? What would it take for them to show up this week? What would it take for you to like go to bed smiling and wake up smiling, right? What would it take for you guys to have like so many clients in business that you love it? Can't believe it happened. Woohoo, you know? What would it take for all of that to happen? What would it take for the universe to be so generous and you to be such an excellent receiver that all of it shows up now? What would it take for all the delays that you guys have put in your future to be deleted, uncreated, destoried, across all time, dimensions, space, and reality? Yeah, all the delays that you guys put into your future, uncreate, delete, and destory all of them. All the heaviness in your heart from the past, delete, uncreate, and destroy all that. What would it take for your heart to be so happy? You just open it and receive it. You take guided action. Everywhere you don't think that you can have it all now, Uncreate, delete, and just story it. And everywhere you're a little depressed about your future, Uncreate, delete. delete, and destroy it. Any of you listening who have some depression about your future because you don't think it'll be different, uncreate, delete, and destroy it. And any person on the planet who has ever taken any of your hopes away, one of the worst things we can ever do is take somebody's hope away. So anywhere you guys are hopeless, yeah, uncreate, delete, and destroy all that. Okay, anywhere you guys do no instead of yes, uncreate, delete, and destroy all that across all time, dimensions, space, and realities. Ooh, I like this. Looking for my own office. Exercise for the joy of it. Tithe to myself. Love it. Take massive actions. Create a life plan. Fill up with unconditional love and have fun every day. All right. I love this. So you guys are doing great. Okay, so all these things. What would it take for all these things that you just listed to show up in your life magnanimously and now? What would it take for your energy to positively magnetize all these things in your life now and everything in the way of that? Just delete it all. What would it take for a string of happy incidences to show up in your life and fulfill all your wishes, dreams, and desires? Just kind of visualize some of the things you guys were saying. Just visualize that happening. Okay, see it happening in your normal life. What are you wearing? What color, where's your surroundings? Turn the color up. Turn the feeling up. See what you would be doing. If you're exercising joyfully, see yourself doing it. If you're blessing people, see yourself doing it. If you're creating a fun work environment, see yourself doing it. If you're having patience with your family, see yourself doing that. If you're loving yourself and taking care of your house, see yourself going to bed early, drinking water, doing all the things that we know we should do. What would it take for the vibration of all these things to occur in two seconds? What would it take for you guys to be excellent givers and receivers of whatever energy is needed to manifest this? And what would it take for all the change to occur now? And anything that you guys are stopping, blocking, or stopping yourself from doing or starting, delete, uncreate, and destroy it all. And any excuse that you guys are going to make at the end of the day, you're going to have to take action. So anywhere you guys are making an excuse where you won't do the homework and you won't visualize it and you won't put the energy forward, delete all that too. All right. Many, many blessings. So much love to you. I'm so proud of you guys. All right. Take care. 

====================

LESSON 12: Knowing Where You Want to Be In Your Future

- Hey, this is Christie Marie Sheldon, and you're listening to a recording I did of a series of 24 live group sessions on clearing abundance blocks. And here's what we're going to cover today in session number 12. We're going to continue our vibrational work with a focus on creating amazing alignment that will ease you into a successful, unlimited abundance journey. And to do that, I'm going to teach you the power of getting over things. Doesn't that sound great? You're going to learn to get over things instead of always standing in the shadow of life's problems. Second, you're going to learn the power of perceiving your future. I'm going to teach you the tools to do that as well as how to access your own psychic talents. In fact, what you'll discover is that it's actually harder to not know. And we'll start clearing the blocks you have in this area so that you can let yourself go for it instead of creating blocks before you even get going. Wouldn't it be great to perceive your future? So let's get going. Hi there, Christie, how are you? I am so happy that you guys are here tonight, woo hoo! Today's a fun night because we're going to look into being able to perceive the opportunities in everything. So if you need a piece of paper to jot some notes down, grab that, be open to some fun, some change, something new, and let's take a moment and set our intent on what you all hope to achieve today. So whatever energy that you want to release, bring that forward and let's journey together tonight and generate for you guys some really astonishing miracles and abundance. That would be fun, right? Okay, so Vivienne is feeling very centered and at peace. Now the cool thing about this is I get a lot of little comments from, in my emails about people saying, "You know what? "I feel better about my life." And sometimes that's the first thing that has to show up, maybe before the cash or before the opportunity, maybe at some level you have to feel the energy of the peace. Remember on that scale of consciousness, zero to 1,000, 1,000 being enlightened, 500 is the energy of love, 540 is the energy of peace, and 600 is the energy of joy. So sometimes you have to feel that feeling, different than of course, fear, anger, worry and guilt. So when she starts by saying that she's feeling centered and at peace, I know for sure that that's the foundation has shifted enough that more good things are going to show up in her life. So she says she's recognizing her blocks daily and getting them cleared. A few nights ago she asked the universe for an outward sign that she is making progress. She then felt drawn to do her meditation outside. And when she finished, she opened her eyes and immediately saw a shooting star go straight across the sky. She's like, "Wow!" But that's not at all. The next morning she got a call from the construction company that had recently done some repairs on her triplex saying they had overcharged her $700 and would have a check ready the next day. Now I don't know about you guys, but I've had to, I've remodeled like three or four homes. Actually four, yeah. I've never had a construction company call me and say they overcharged me. So that's really good. Today is really interesting because when I look at the world, so you have to understand by doing so many readings on people, I get to see all types of businesses, right? And all types of structures on all the ways that people do live. And what I'm often called to do is I have to look at their businesses to help them figure out how to make more money. And, my ability is that I can look through things and see where the opportunities are. So when somebody talks about something, you know, it's like my energy just lights up and I see all the possibilities of what could happen or where it could go or where the money really is, and all sorts of things. Like if I'm reading the paper, like gold just hit a new high, right? Or if I read the paper about a certain company, I kind of tune in and go, "Wow, is that stock going to go up?" So wouldn't it be great if we could open up your awareness? So we're going to do some clearing today on you being able to see the opportunities that are right in front of you. And often what happens is we can't perceive the opportunities, because we've already made some judgments or conclusions that stop us from seeing what's directly right in front of us. So if you grew up and your parents were, you know, like, let's just say, middle income, work hard for your money. Like that was like kind of the flow. And they were afraid of opening or venturing into a new business for themselves, you might have some ingrained beliefs that starting a new business, you'll go bankrupt, you'll ruin your life, you'll ruin your credit. Don't ever do that ever again. And then as soon as somebody comes to you with a new opportunity, you'll just immediately shut it down. The same thing with multi-level marketing. When I was young, I did it and I didn't make a lot of money. And so when somebody came to me later on and presented an opportunity, my immediate like thing was to shut it down. And then that person went on to make millions of dollars in it. Now, later on, I jumped on the bandwagon, but you know, the point is, my preconceived notion of what that was blocked me from seeing what that person was capable of doing and what I could learn from that person, right? So my perception was totally closed, because I'd already made judgments and conclusions about what was being presented to me. So as you can guess, I'm sure lots of you, if you, by me stirring the pot up a little bit right now, you're probably all going, "Holy crap. "I have a lot of judgments and what it would be like "to have my own thing going on." Right? So we're going to really work on clearing those things. So it's going to be really, really fun. All right, so we're going to first off connect to the light. Okay. So we're going to fill up and then we're going to just start clearing. Okay, and I actually, I also want to just congratulate you guys for showing up. I mean, it's like the halfway mark and you guys are still here. I can see your names and I can see that a lot of people just over and over again, showing up, and I know that things are going to change for you. Connect up about 300 feet above your head. See, sense or feel the light, pure consciousness itself. Okay, open your crown and receive it. You are all excellent, excellent receivers of this pure consciousness. Okay, and allow it to come into your crown and open up all your awareness, all your knowing. Okay. And we're going to open up your third eye so you can see the opportunities. We're going to ask this pure consciousness to come into your hearing so that you can hear the opportunities. We're going to ask it to come into your throat. To open up the creative aspect of the new opportunities. Allow it to come into your heart so that your heart can feel the new opportunities. Allow the light to come out your arms, kind of embrace you. Allow the light to come into your torso and melt away any fears, any nervousness, any anxiety. Allow the light to come into your hips so that you can be rooted in this new consciousness, this new awareness. Okay, allow the light to come through your legs, your knees, your feet, into the center of the planet and connect there where it feels really, really, really happy. As above, so below. Consciousness in the center of the planet, ask that to be like a trampoline and bounce right back up into your legs, into your torso, into your heart, and radiate out 360 degrees all the way around. Okay, so allow this light to radiate 10 feet all the way around you. So you have light coming from above and light coming from below, and in the middle of your heart is a great central sun radiating out 10 feet all the way around you. Okay, take this light and expand it past the building you're in. Take this light, expand it past the house you're in. Okay, take this light and expand it past the county you're in. Take this light and expand it past the state you're in. Okay, take this light and radiate it out past the country you're in. Okay, and take this light and radiate it out past the planet. So you're connected to all things, asking all of the universe to support you. So let's just send, imagine sending a blessing to Carolyn Connor's son so that whatever his body needs, as far as pure love and light, he receives it. Okay, let's send a blessing to, I have a comment here about some people not being able to receive what they need in a timely manner. So we're going to ask that any of you that hold the energy, "I can't receive what I need in the exact time I need it." Delete, un-create and de-story all of that. Okay? Every one of you that are blocking your ability to receive things in a timely manner exactly when you need it, more than you need, delete all that, un-create all that and de-story all that. Anywhere you guys feel that you're not making any progress, delete, un-create and de-story all that. Any other part of your life that might be accidentally blocking your abundance. So any confusion you have, any mom and dad issue you have, any old love relationship issue you have that might be blocking your progress, un-create, delete and de-story all that. So your soul knows what's really blocking you. So just allow a picture, a thought or idea to pop in your head of what's really blocking you. Okay, and anything that came up for you guys, un-create, delete and de-story all that. Anywhere you guys don't think that miracles can happen in two seconds, un-create, delete and de-story all that. Everywhere you need life to be a challenge, because then you're really living, right? If you struggle, you're really alive. Okay, everywhere you guys are doing that, un-create, delete and de-story all that. Okay, anywhere you guys are pretending to be the human beings that struggle, un-create, delete and de-story that. Okay, anything that is oppressing you, blocking you or sabotaging you, un-create, delete and de-story it all. Any contracts or oaths or vows, delete all those. All right. So any other negative things that you think that you can't block? I mean, the real truth is, negative energy is going to happen towards you, but all you have to do is get bigger than it and it can't really affect you. Like literally, that's why I have you guys connect out, because then the energy that we clear, it's really easy to clear because you're bigger than it. Instead of trying to quote, quote, understand it and stand under the energy, I need you to get over it. See the difference? Yes. And if you're trying to understand it, that means you're trying to recreate it over and over and over again so that you can understand it, instead of just saying, "Oh, I learned the lesson, "now I'm over it." All right. So anywhere you guys are still trying to stand under it and keep the problem around, un-create, delete and de-story all that too. Any other person or family member, you guys, that wants a blessing, just hold their intent, okay. And we'll just send a blessing to all the other people that need a little blessing. All right, great. That whatever light they need, whatever conscious they need, whatever solution they need, whatever's to their benefit, we just ask that they receive that. All right, awesome. Okay, you guys, so let's just start right now with the perceiving the opportunities. So I'm going to clear some things right now in perceiving. Perceiving is just using all your senses. And really at the end of the day, sometimes I don't hear things exactly. I just follow the energy. Remember when we did your vision board and we did your stories and you kind of created the energy of what you wanted in the future, and you had a certain tone in your body and your being? The reason that is there is because that gets projected out into the future. And then when you go do life, if an opportunity comes along and it feels exactly like that energy, even if it isn't rational to you why that's the door opener, you got to follow that energy. That's the whole key. So sometimes it doesn't come in as like a total awareness. It's just a feeling that you have to follow. It just kind of feels similar to what you felt when you were doing your vision board. And maybe it's just one person who introduces you to one person who introduces you to one person. It might be three people down the road, you don't know. So if you feel the same feeling that you felt when you did your story, your vision board, you got to follow that lead, okay? So anywhere you guys are judging that you can't perceive what it is that you need to perceive in order to go forward, will you please un-create, delete and de-story the whole thing. So all the excuses that you guys have implanted in your being that you're not an infinite being and that you can't perceive things or know things, un-create, delete and de-story all that. Okay, I'm going to say something that's kind of coming up in my head. Now, I don't think you guys are stupid, but somewhere you guys think you're stupid. So everywhere you guys think you're stupid and you can't perceive things, un-create, delete and de-story it all, okay? So anybody who told you that, or anywhere you think that, or anywhere you numbed and dumbed yourself or turned yourself down at any level so that you can't perceive what you need to do in the world, un-create, delete and de-story all that. Yes. Okay, I'm going to say something else. You guys kind of pretending to be like all the other miserable humans on the planet. Now I don't mean this badly, but if you really look around, you'll see that there's not, the majority of people are more unhappy than happy. And I'm saying that from a perception place, it's not me just randomly judging people, because I actually really like people and I want people to be happy. So what if you were around people that weren't very happy? What you would do is then kind of block your perceiving and pretend that you're like them so that they give you love. So then you basically kind of tone yourself down so that you're not too much for them to handle. And if you could perceive and be totally psychic and know way too much, your parents might not like that. Right? So anywhere you guys did any of that, where you're pretending to be like all the other miserable people or the people who struggle, un-create, delete and de-story all that too. And anywhere you guys brainwashed yourself that you're incapable of perceiving things or knowing things with all your senses, including your psychic senses, will you please un-create, delete and de-story all that. A good mantra for you guys would be to walk around saying, "What vibrational energy or what would it take "for me to be completely and totally psychic? "And everything in the way of that, I delete it all." Or you can say perceiving, if you don't like that word psychic. Okay, kind of a lot of energy here, because some of you, I'm stirring up the pot on some of you guys, I can feel it. Okay, 'cause perceiving honestly, this is the root of who you are. So we're two things. We make choices. We're spiritual beings in a body who make choices and are aware. So if you're aware, that means you're perceiving everything through all your senses, not just physical senses. So imagine you're growing up and you say, "Hey, mommy, are you happy?" And mommy goes, "Yes, honey, I'm happy. "I'm so happy, I love my life." And secretly, she hates her life, okay? She's like, "I'm miserable, I'm mad at your dad. "And I can't make XYZ happen in my life." Right? But at the same time, she's saying to you, "Oh honey, I'm so happy." Can you see that would create some confusion in a kid? Because the part of you that's totally aware would be able to know she's not happy, but then all of a sudden you start judging yourself because, "Oh, well she says she's happy, so I must be wrong." Right? So everywhere you guys are perceiving and judging that you're wrong, delete all that. Okay, cool. Thank you, you guys just shifted a lot of it right there. Thank you, thank you. So now, how many of you are open to new ideas? So every one of you that is not open to something new or seeing something in a new way or you like it the old way, because then you can understand it. Okay, so everything that is, un-create, delete and de-story all that. Okay, how many other parts of you are stuck in the old ways? Everything that is, un-create, delete and de-story. Okay, all the other old ways that you guys are stuck upon, un-create, delete and de-story. Okay, anywhere you're not open to just a complete stranger coming up and talking to you about a new idea, everywhere you would just shut that person down and think it's ridiculous. Everything that is, un-create, delete and de-story. Everywhere your perception is altered given your parents, the emotional turmoil they had about perceiving. So any of you who duplicated your parents' reality about perceiving, and you do it just like they do, un-create, delete and de-story all that. All right, so how are you guys doing? Someone is asking, "If I opened my eyes "after I connect to the light, "will I have to reconnect again?" No, Lisa, once you've made your energy big, you've made your energy big. "So how do I know the energy clearing works?" When you feel a little lighter. Okay, and if you don't feel light yet, if you're still in a middle of irritation, frustration or resentment, then you haven't cleared it all. We've just turned it on, okay? So all of the stuff that you guys still have kind of that we just got it stirred up. Okay, everything that's sitting under the surface and you're kind of irritated that you've shut down in your awareness, un-create, delete and de-story it all. Everywhere you're resentful at all the missed opportunities and the unknown things that you could have done that you blocked, un-create, delete and de-story all that. Any part of your soul that doesn't want to be healed or let you know things, un-create, delete and de-story all that. Okay, cool. All right. What about opening to things you don't know about? So let's just say, you don't know how to do something. Like let's just say you don't know how to make a webpage. Let's just say you don't know how to close a deal. Let's just say you don't know how to negotiate very well. Let's just say you don't know how to do a real estate deal or meet new people. Okay? So any of those things that you guys say that you don't know about, it's totally fine that you don't know, but anywhere you're blocked in even figuring it out. So you don't even want to go figure it out, everything that is, un-create, delete and de-story it all. Okay, so let's make this a little more real. What are some of the things that you guys think you don't know that you really know you need to know in order to get to the next level? Okay, so how to be in the stock market. Okay, so everywhere you guys don't think you know how to be in the stock market and just be totally psychic and pick the right stock, everything that is, un-create, delete and de-story it all. And I know, I know, I know, people would say, "Oh, you're not supposed to do that. "You're supposed to keep "your rational mind in the stock market." But you know, there's a famous, in the book, Blink, Malcolm Gladwell talks about interviewing somebody who worked for George Soros, who was an amazing money manager. I think it was his son, so I can't remember the exact story. But anyway, he said, "You know, at the end of the day, "what happens is, if some part of George's body hurts." I think it was the shoulder or the knee or something. "If some part of his body hurts, "that's when he knows how to get out of a trade." Okay? So yes, do the due diligence, do the numbers, be totally rational, follow the trend. And at the end of the day, be completely and totally aware. Okay? So let's sign you all up for that program, okay? So everything in the way of that, un-create, delete and de-story all of that. Yes. Okay. Anything else at the end of the day where you guys don't want to totally be aware, un-create, deletes and de-story it all. Everywhere you don't know how to present yourself or market yourself or how to invest money. Yes, all of that, un-create, delete, de-story the whole thing. So what would it take for you guys to know how to market yourself, invest in yourself, invest in the stock market, learn how to present yourself, learn how to dress, learn how to talk, learn how to be, whatever you need in order to convince whatever you need to show up in your life, right? Because at the end of the day, life is pretty much a dress rehearsal. You got to show up however you need to in order to close the deal, whatever the deal is for you. Maybe the deal is you want to be happy. So you got to show up in whatever form and fit needed in order to be happy, right? So Gail's saying she spent half the day in a funk. Now you guys remember that the stuff will probably start turning on earlier today, or maybe even the night before. If you feel like crap, you basically should make sure you show up, because it's probably the stuff turning on. "How to open my business, get clients, teach classes?" Okay, so what would it take for you to be able to know how to market yourself, get clients and teach classes? And everything in the way of that, un-create, delete and de-story the whole thing. What would it take to learn how to communicate well? Un-create, delete and de-story everything in the way of that. What would it take for you to know how to pay off your debt? Un-create, delete and de-story all of that. So Shandra, I would just start with the smallest debt. Okay, whatever it is. And I would just keep asking the universe, "What would it take to get whatever, $500, "so I can pay out this debt?" And start with that one thing. Okay, all right. So everything in the way of that, un-create, delete and de-story that. "Okay, how to market my business, "how to work with technology at a more advanced level?" Everything that is, un-create, delete and de-story everything in the way of that. What would it take for that to happen and be easy? What would it take to know how to make a business plan? And everything in the way of that, un-create and delete it all. But I'm going to say, what would it take to make a profitable business plan, right? And everything in the way of that, un-create, delete and de-story it all. Okay, so I need you guys to get a little bit bigger. So get above the planet, get really big, radiate a lot of light, okay? 'Cause this is some heavy stuff, this is all your confusion. So everywhere you guys are confused what to do, don't know what to do, un-create, delete and de-story all of it. Okay, what would it take? So I want you guys to think for a minute and say out loud, if you can, "What would it take for me to know how to?" And then fill in the blank with your thing. "What would it take for me to know how to?" Yes, "What would it take for me to know how to "invest in stocks?" "What would it take for me to "know how to do a business plan?" "What would it take for me to know how to market myself?" Yes, and everything in the way of that, un-create, delete and de-story the whole thing. Okay. "How to network, connect to people, "do webpages, negotiating, managing and investing taxes?" "What to do with my PhD?" "How to add credit card payments to a website?" You could probably Google that, Tara. That's not that hard actually. So everything in the way of that, un-create, delete and de-story all that. Okay, what would it take for you guys to actually Google everything that you just typed to me today? And ask for the one link that's going to solve all your riddles. Ask that one link to kind of light up. Okay, so everything in the way of that, un-create, delete and de-story it all. What would it take for somebody or a newspaper article or a radio ad or something to answer any of these questions that you guys have? Everything in the way of that, un-create, delete and de-story it all. What would it take for you to call somebody who knows the exact answer and they give it to you for free? Everything in the way of that, un-create, delete and de-story all of that. So if you guys have taxes and legal questions, I'm going to push you to just go find somebody and talk to them. You don't have to hire them in two seconds. You can ask a bunch of people for free advice and interview them, right? So you're in charge. All right, so one more time, all these things that are confusing to you guys, un-create, delete and de-story all the confusion. What would it take for you to go forward making one really crazy decision, you know? Basically take some action to go forward and get that question answered. And everything in the way of that, un-create, delete and de-story the whole thing. Okay, so one more time, you guys have a lot of energy on this. So everywhere you guys think that you can't just call somebody up, Google something or ask the universe to bring you the person who knows. You wouldn't believe how many times I've done this. And it usually shows up within a week. I'm trying to think of the last time I did it. Oh, I wanted to meet a certain person, because I knew this person knew how to do something that I wanted to know how to do. It's kind of a famous person, so I'm not going to mention that person's name. But I thought I really want to figure out how to meet that person and get my answer to this question. So basically within two weeks, I managed to have somebody invite me to a party and told me that that person was going to be there. So I have no problem asking the universe to do that. Then I asked somebody to teach me how to trade stocks one time. And I manifested this gazillionaire who taught me some things. So that took about three weeks actually. So everywhere you guys are afraid to just ask, okay, everything that is, un-create, delete and de-story the whole thing. Okay. And if you have financial debts, we're going to go through some of that in this course to clear some of that, okay? So you guys promise me, you're going to Google it, ask the universe to bring somebody to you or do something of the sort, okay? I don't want to see you guys stuck anymore. All right. So everything in the way of you guys just taking that massive action step, un-create, delete and de-story it all. So looking at the bright side of things, because if you look at, if you come to the conclusion that there's a gift in everything, if you come to the conclusion, I'm laughing because somebody called me ma'am, Alison, thank you. Everywhere you guys are afraid to look at the bright side, which is really just the light side of things, right? And you kind of stay stuck in the squabble of things, like the confusion, the wobbly, the, "I don't know." The, "I can't." Okay, everywhere you guys kind of betray yourself and do that. Okay, un-create, delete and de-story the whole thing. Okay. Three other places where you guys don't want to let go of the part of you that feels like you have to do victim and look at the crappy side of things. Everything that is, un-create, delete and de-story the whole thing. Okay, everywhere you guys want to manipulate yourself and believe the victim part of you, instead of kind of the warrior part of you that'll just go out and do it. I mean that in a good way, the loving warrior, right? Like the kind of peaceful warrior who just does what they have to do and gets it done. So everywhere you guys can't do that, un-create, delete and de-story it all. Everywhere you guys are ashamed that you've done victim or guilted into victim or fearful into victim or angry that you're a victim or made fun of because you're a victim. Any of those things, un-create, delete and de-story it all. Okay, everywhere the victim part of you is afraid to take action, un-create, delete and de-story all those. Any part of you that's wounded in the past where you felt like you had to do victim as a survival mechanism, un-create, delete and de-story it all. Anywhere somebody was mean to you, like parents, lovers, anybody, family, teachers, authority figures, they were mean to you, and you felt like doing victim was the easiest way to do life. Everything that is, un-create, delete and de-story all that. Any parts of you that are hurt and wounded and thought victim was the easier way. So you're looking at the crappy side of life, un-create, delete and de-story it all. Okay, so there's two parts of the plan at the positive polarity and the negative polarity. So any of you guys, your first nature is to look at the wrongness and the negative polarity first. And check that out first, before you go to the bright side, un-create, delete, de-story the whole thing across all time, dimension, space, reality. And I'm going to mention one thing I didn't earlier. In one of the other days I talked to, I talked to you guys about finding mentors. I know this insurance lady, what she did is she just called around in other states some, you know, insurance brokers that were making a lot of money and she asked one of them to mentor her. She found one that agreed that really didn't care, you know? Who thought, you know, their ego was kind of stroked that somebody would be nice enough to ask them. So any of you wanting to start businesses, why couldn't you do the same? Find somebody that's doing what you want to do and ask them if they would be a mentor. But just make sure that you, you know, don't lean on them too much, are completely professional and make sure you do whatever they guide you to do. Okay, so all the parts of you that want to look on the bright side, the glorious part of you, the loving part of you that knows all the answers knows exactly what to do, will always tell you the truth. Okay, so everything in the way of you connecting to this, un-create, delete and de-story the whole thing. Okay, I'm going to challenge you guys to see the opportunity in all things and everything in the way of that, un-create, delete and de-story all that. Which is kind of the same as seeing the brightness in everything, right? Everywhere you're afraid to see the opportunity, the profit, the money, the cash, the abundance in all things. I mean, what would it be like if you guys walked around saying, "What would it take for everything in my life to profit me? "What would it take for every exchange in my life "to profit me?" Yes. What would it take for you guys to follow the energy of your story and your vision board? And everything in the way of that, un-create, delete and de-story it all. What would it take for you guys to look at all things before you judge it? Everything that is. Yes, everything that you guys want to judge things first and then go there, un-create, delete and de-story all that. All the judgements that you guys put into your future that blocks your knowing. Un-create, delete and de-story all that. Times, yeah, across all time, dimension, space, reality. What would it take for you guys to create like a little timeline, you know? Just create like a little plan. "Within two weeks I'm going to find out the answer "to these five questions "and then I'm going to know what to do." So everything in the way of that happening, un-create, delete and de-story all that too. Okay. How many things do you guys aspire to do that you are not taking action on? So I want you to take a minute and think of the things that you have on your vision board and the things that you wrote in your story about how you want your life to look. And I'm sure that there's things on that list that you need to take action on, right? So if some of you, I know some of you are coaches and you want to help people in the world. So what would it be like for you to actually just start taking action, helping people where you can? Okay, so everything that just came up for you guys that says, "Well, I can't take action, I don't know enough." Again, I will remind you. You're an infinite being in a body. A loving, kind, gorgeous, glorious, beautiful soul who can happily help anyone, right? And get paid for it. And everything in the way of that, un-create, delete and de-story the whole thing. Okay. Everything in the way of you guys feeling good about your body and taking action in it, un-create, delete and de-story all that. Okay there, there's a lot of energy on that one. Okay. What opportunities are on your list that you need to take action on? Can you guys type some of them? Tara, if you're yawning, that means that you have some unconsciousness attached to this and so you need to reboot a lot. Okay? Somebody is asking if anger can be a motivating factor. For some people it is. It makes you dig down a little bit. It's taking you from the lower energies of shame, guilt, fear, and moving you up to a next level. I just wouldn't stay in it too long, okay? But if it moves you to a new place, go for it and look at it not like anger, but look at it like potency unleashed, okay? Okay, finding a new house, writing a book, creating a website, moving out, creating a business plan. Okay, losing weight, inviting women to participate in your project. Okay, so all those things, anything preventing you, un-create, delete and de-story it all. Okay, so I want you guys all on your piece of paper right now, write down two things that you need to do first. So if you have to find a new house, maybe you have to find a realtor, right? Writing a book. You might need to just write down your outline. And it won't be perfect, it never is perfect. It's always a process. So just write it down, just start there. And then you can rearrange later. Creating a website. So just write down what you think you want it to be, just look around and see if you can find a really inexpensive way, like 20 bucks, 50 bucks, a person who can do it for free and put it up. Creating a business plan, losing weight. Okay, so all those things that you guys are doing to stop yourself, un-create, delete and de-story it all. Dating again. Okay, so Deborah, your first step is telling two of your friends that you want to date, and maybe they know somebody. Or maybe you put yourself online or maybe you go get your hair done. Just something so you feel pretty. So, Basel, whatever your next step would be. If that's just paper trading for another week or whatever, whatever that is for you, just put that on your list. So if you have to do a video, then maybe make the outline. "Preparing talks for my work and clearing some clutter." Okay, so I'd start with the clutter thing first. And then I'd do the ebook, because that could maybe make you money. So Ivan, if you're going to pay off the mortgage, what actions do you need to take in order to do that? Just break it down into the two next steps, okay? How do you eat an elephant? One bite at a time, right? So all these things, there's so many, you guys. So all these things that you don't know how to take the next two steps, un-create, delete and de-story all that. Okay, so then after you do the two steps and you just do two more steps. Can you guys promise to do just two steps on that within a week? Okay, so that gives you plenty of time. And any of you that just wrote, "I give up." Okay, any of you guys who give up, un-create, delete and de-story all that. Anywhere you're doing victim, giving up on yourself, un-create, delete and de-story it all. Anywhere it's an old story, un-create, delete and de-story it all. Okay, anywhere that's maybe not even your program. Maybe you bought it from somebody else, un-create, delete and de-story it all. And any of you guys who say a week is not enough time to do two baby steps on your life. It's your life, right? Okay, everything that is, un-create, delete and de-story it all. Everywhere you're putting your life on hold, un-create, delete and de-story it all. All right. So I can see you guys are kind of brewing a minute here. So maybe you were getting a little restless, because we're getting to the part where you have to take action, right? And this is kind of the same thing a little bit, but what are the closest opportunities you can take right now? Which is basically your two baby steps. Okay, so just think of right now, what are the two steps that you can take within a week? It might be making two phone calls, right? Or it might be Googling some research things. Everything in the way of that, un-create and delete and de-story the whole thing. Everywhere your finances, your abundance isn't important enough for you to take the action, un-create, delete and de-story it all. Okay, I want you to guys to type me and tell me what you think your blocks are, why it's hard to do the two steps. Okay, fear of rejection. Okay, so any fear of rejection, un-create, delete and de-story it all. Anywhere you guys think you're wrong if you take the two steps, because staying the same is easier, un-create, delete and de-story it all. What if the reason is hard to take the two steps is because your current reality, the reality where you're at, doesn't actually match the reality where you're going, and there's a part of you resistant to change, and it's sort of just kind of testing you to see how much you really want it? Because sometimes you have to take an exaggerated kind of step, okay? Like an exaggerated kind of awareness to pull you to the next rung of the ladder, right? So any of you that don't think you can put a little awareness, a little oomph, a little pushing you to the next step so you can get over the hump. Okay, everything that is, un-create, delete and de-story it all. Now I want you guys to try on for a minute. What would it take for you guys to feel what it would feel like to be motivated into the next step? So what's going to drive you? Because you're going to have to get your own internal, like little language system going on, right? Okay, so all the spells that you guys are under. The complacency, the old programming, and that's more powerful than you, which is kind of bull crap, it's not really true, but somewhere you believe it, un-create, delete and de-story it all. So what's going to drive you? Grace is saying, "In case of my boyfriend, "I'm not sure if he's receptive to what I have to say." But Grace, if you don't figure it out, you could be stuck in something that you don't know if it's the right thing or not. So are you important enough to take the next step for you? Do you see? Okay, so all this hopelessness and everywhere you guys are kind of discounting yourself and giving up on yourself, un-create, delete and de-story all that. All the places where you guys are afraid or ashamed to move forward because you might make a mistake, un-create, delete and de-story them. Again, I've like reprogrammed myself that I don't look at anything I do as a mistake. Everything I do is a learning. It might not be perfect, but at least I'll learn something from it. Okay, so everywhere you guys are hard on yourself if you make an error, un-create, delete and de-story it all. Okay, all these other distractions that are coming up, anything that you can't do it yourself, un-create, delete and de-story it all. So how many of you guys are being like little girls and little boys and you're waiting for mommy and daddy to tell you what to do? Okay, anywhere you guys are doing that stuff, un-create, delete and de-story it all. Because the only way to get the truth of something is to match the energy, right? So you're going to have to say, "What would it take if I call this person "and this person totally receives me?" Get a clear intent, right? "What would it take for the perfect person "to be my business partner?" "What would it take for me to work with the perfect people "who help me make a lot of money?" Whatever those things are. And everything in the way of it, un-create, delete and de-story it all. Okay, so you don't have to do cookie cutter. You don't have to be like everybody else. It's always going to be your own version. Okay, everywhere you guys are stuck in the mud and you don't want to try something new. So how many of you guys don't want to try something new? You like the old reality more. Everything that is, un-create, delete and de-story it all. How many of you don't want to meet new people, even if new people are the door opener to a lot of new opportunities? Everything that is, un-create, delete and de-story all that. Everywhere you guys are afraid of change, un-create, delete, and de-story it all. Okay, so I'm hearing some of you guys don't like money. All right, so everywhere you guys don't like money enough to just really go for it, un-create, delete and de-story it all. Everywhere you're afraid that if you have too much money, you'll be like everybody who has a lot of money that you don't like, un-create, delete and de-story all that. And everywhere your particle flow is that, "I have to be slow, this reality is slow. "I have to slow myself down." Okay, everything that is. Do you know what I do? I ask my energy to be really fast so I can perceive everything really quickly and then just get over it. I'd rather know everything in two seconds, instead of having to figure it out for a half hour, right? And for some of you guys, you haven't even figured it out and it's been months, right? So everywhere you guys are slowing your energy down so that you can't even perceive what's up so you know the right reality to choose, everything that is, un-create, delete and de-story it all. Everywhere you've slowed yourself down to be like normal humans like everybody else, un-create, delete and de-story it all. What would it take for you guys to be super humans who perceive and know everything and can make really quick decisions? Okay, cool, you guys actually finally let go of a lot of things right there. Okay, so as to speed up your energy so that your energy is really, really, really quick, because that'll actually just get you out of a lot of this heaviness. Okay, there. Okay, everywhere you guys are letting people control you and stop you, un-create, delete and de-story it all. So I want you to ask a question and just trust whatever pops in your head, okay? So let's just imagine that you guys are connected to light, you're totally aware beings. And I want to just ask, what's the real reason, the real, real, real, real reason why you just won't go take two baby steps? All right, so whatever those reasons were, okay, even if you didn't consciously grab them, okay. Some of you might not have grabbed them, but it's okay, your soul knows. So just connect to the light and just say, "I'm really over this reason." So say it out loud with me, I am really over this reason. I am really done procrastinating. I am really done stopping myself. I am really done over this victim, sad story. I am willing and able to choose to be an infinite being in a body and love myself. I am really willing to step into my power. I am really willing to take some massive action and make my life be different. And I am willing to hold myself accountable, starting now. And I'm willing to be addicted to success instead of addicted to failure. I am completely and totally willing to be addicted to my success no matter what. All right. Okay, cool. All right, now can you guys feel that that lifted a little bit? Now sometimes things aren't a clearing thing. Sometimes things are a choice. Sometimes you guys actually have to make a choice in order for something to change. So now I want you to just tune in and I want you to really, really, really commit to this, okay? So think of the next two things that you need to do, even if they're not perfect, okay? Screw perfect for right now. Just take two steps, whatever they are, that will somehow bring profit or bring two of the things on your vision boards, okay? So it could be a website, it could be calling a person, it could be finding a mentor. It could be talking to two people, asking them if they, if you can coach them and get some money for it. It could be any of those things. It could be clearing out some clutter. It could be writing an ebook. It could be putting up a webpage. It could be writing a blog post. Okay. I'm going to change you guys's homework, okay? 'Cause there was a lot more heaviness on this than I thought, but I want you to answer these questions for yourself right now. So what's going to drive you to do these two steps? And just trust whatever comes into your mind. What's going to drive you to do these two things? And maybe it's just simple, you have to make a choice, okay? So maybe the drive is, you just make a choice and you're going to hold yourself accountable and that's it. What's going to help you make this choice to do it? And maybe you have an accountability partner, right? So maybe what's going to help you is, you're going to call your friend up and you're going to say, "Hey, will you make sure I do these this week?" Or maybe you're going to call somebody up and delegate it. But at least it's getting it done, right? Okay. What makes you happy enough to take action? So what can we do? Can you change how you look at it? Can you look at it like, "Wow, at least I'm moving some energy." Can you look at it like, "What if I didn't fail? "What would happen?" Can you look at it like, "In two months from now "I'll be so happy I took these steps." What other choice could you make that makes you happy enough to do it? What creation can you make to inspire you to make a difference? Like for instance, what I'm saying by creation, like I have this one little mantra that if I trigger this mantra in me, like believe me, get out of my way. And my mantra is, I am unstoppable, I will do whatever it takes. And that little mantra for me is my trigger for, literally, I am unstoppable and I will do whatever it takes. So what is your mantra that you can come up with that will just click in all the good stuff for you to move forward? And then I'm going to ask you guys for a minute to think of, this might take a little bit more, you know, you could do a What Would It Take statement. But what standard are you going to set for yourself to keep you on your toes? Are you going to settle and have your standard be mediocre? Because again, this part is not a block thing. This part is a making a choice, like making a stand in your life. Are you willing to be excellent for yourself? Are you willing to be excellent for your kids? Are you willing to be excellent? And excellent just means taking two steps, and don't worry about the perfectionism of it, okay? Just take two steps. Whatever two steps are that you chose. What standard are you going to set for yourself? I'm liking some of these. "I am invincible as I meet my goals." "All things take us to heaven." Love it, "I make a difference in this world." "I am excellent." I like yours, Liliah. She's saying, "F what those people say, "I am doing this for me. "Whatever it takes, I'm willing to be active. "Completion, world-class standard, just do it." So everywhere you guys are doing all or nothing instead of something, everything that is, un-create and delete it all. "I am worth it." "Ooh, watch me." "God does not make mistakes." "I am confident." "I can do it, I can have it." "Abundance is my natural state." "I am ready to win." "I am on the move." "I deserve it." All right, so all of you guys, anyone else who's still feeling kind of heavy. So all your resistance reaction, all your cords to you or anyone else, anywhere you guys are caught in a dilemma. If you move forward, you have to leave the old you. And some part of you is afraid of that. Everything that is, un-create, delete and de-story the whole thing. Every part of you that wants to hold you back, for whatever reason, all the skeletons in your closet that want to hold you back, un-create, delete and de-story them all across all time, dimension, space, reality. Anywhere you guys are afraid to move forward and still want to be a victim, un-create, delete and de-story it all. Anywhere you guys are tired and going a little unconscious, un-create, delete and de-story it all. So any of you guys who are tired or a little achy, I want you to take all your light and put it in that place. So where does it feel the heaviest? In your head, in your heart, in your body, where does it feel the heaviest? And imagine that a light beam comes down from pure source energy and like a little light bomb it fireworks, you know, firecracker, it just kind of blows up that denseness. 'Cause that's where all your resistance is. And everywhere that came from, un-create, delete and de-story all that. Okay, I felt that one. "Everywhere I go, I attract success "and anything I do attracts success." I love it. All right, "I was falling asleep, but now I'm dancing around the room." "I'm an abundance magnet." All right, you guys, you guys did a great job. Thank you for moving through this, because you know what? You guys let me call up all your really heavy stuff. Now if some of you still have a little bit of heavy stuff. I'm going to ask you to just keep taking pure source energy, pull it into your body, wherever it feels the densest and just imagine like little firecrackers kind of going off, blowing all that stuff up, okay? And then pure source consciousness is just love, right? So it's just a lot of love that you're pulling into your body. And you're just asking it to delete all the negative fear-based imprints. Okay. So you guys have your two steps, take your two steps, the closest opportunities. Here's your little mantra. What would it take for me to have more choice than I could ever expect? What would it, 'cause you need to make a choice, right? What would it take for you to see the opportunities and move forward? What would it take, universe, to deliver me all the opportunities that pay you money? All right, and here's your home play, 30 to 40 times a day, can be all at one time. Like if you want to just do it in the morning, then do it in the morning. If you want to do it before you go to bed, do it then. What vibrational energy can you be to align with the opportunities that move you forward and open doors for, and then pick one of your things in your dream or your story, right? Okay, so that something new shows up in your life. So it could be, somebody earlier said they wanted to move into a new home. So she could say, "What vibrational energy can I become "to align with the opportunity "that puts me in my new house?" And everything in the way of that, un-create, delete and de-story it all. So you can download the audio and the PDF slides for this session. I love you guys too. Okay, so I'm going to do one more little clearing. So any of you guys that, too many choices are overwhelming, un-create, delete and de-story all of them. Dirk is saying, "Thanks once again, a very psychic session. "My questions were answered before I could write them down." I love it. All right, I love you guys. Okay, so let me know if you're taking your two steps. I want to hear that in your inspiring stories. All right, many, many blessings. Bye.

LESSON 12: Getting Clear on the Future (Clearing Session Only)

Connect up about 300 feet above your head. See, sense, or feel the light, pure consciousness itself. Okay, open your crown and receive it. You are all excellent, excellent receivers of this pure consciousness. Okay, and allow it to come into your crown and open up all your awareness, all your knowing. Okay, and we're going to open up your third eye so you can see the opportunities. We're going to ask this pure consciousness to come into your hearing so that you can hear the opportunities. We're going to ask it to come into your throat to open up the creative aspect of the new opportunities. Allow it to come into your heart so that your heart can feel the new opportunities. Allow the light to come out your arms, kind of embrace you. Allow the light to come into your torso and melt any fears, any nervousness, any anxiety. Allow the light to come into your hips so that you can be rooted in this new consciousness, this new awareness. Okay, allow the light to come through your legs, your knees, your feet into the center of the planet and connect there where it feels really, really, really happy as above, so below. consciousness in the center of the planet. Ask that to be like a trampoline and bounce right back up into your legs, into your torso, into your heart, and radiate out 360 degrees all the way around. Okay, so allow this light to radiate 10 feet all the way around you. So you have light coming from above and light coming from below, and in the middle of your heart is a great central sun radiating out 10 feet all the way around you. Okay, take this light and expand it past the building you're in. Take this light, expand it past the house you're in. Okay, take this light and expand it past the county you're in. Take this light and expand it past the state you're in. Okay, take this light and radiate it out past the country you're in. Okay, and take this light and radiate it out past the planet. So you're connected to all things. asking all of the universe to support you. Okay, let's send a blessing to, I have a comment here about some people not being able to receive what they need in a timely manner. So we're going to ask that any of you that hold the energy, I can't receive what I need in the exact time I need it, delete, uncreate, and de -story all of that. Okay, every one of you that are blocking your ability to receive things in a timely manner exactly when you need it, more than you need, delete all that, uncreate all that, and destory all that. Anywhere you guys feel that you're not making any progress, delete, uncreate, and destory all that. Any other part of your life that might be accidentally blocking your abundance? So any confusion you have, any mom and dad issue you have, any old love relationship issue you have that might be blocking your progress, uncreate, delete, and destroy all that. So your soul knows what's really blocking you. So just allow a picture, thought, or idea to pop in your head of what's really blocking you. Okay, and anything that came up for you guys, uncreate, delete, and destroy all that. Anywhere you guys don't think that miracles can happen in two seconds, uncreate, delete, and destroy all that. Everywhere you need life to be a challenge, because then you're really living, right? If you struggle, you're really alive. Okay, everywhere you guys are doing that, uncreate, delete, and destroy all that. Okay, anywhere you guys are pretending to be the human beings that struggle, uncreate, delete, and destroy that. Okay, anything that is oppressing you? Blocking you or sabotaging you? Uncreate, delete, and destroy it all. Any contracts or oaths or vows? Delete all those. All right, so anywhere you guys are still trying to stand under it and keep the problem around, uncreate, delete, and destroy all that too. Any other person or family member of you guys that wants a blessing, just hold their intent. Okay, and we'll just send a blessing to all the other people that need a little blessing. All right, great. That whatever light they need, whatever conscious they need, whatever solution they need, whatever is to their benefit, we just ask that they receive that. So anywhere you guys are judging that you can't perceive what it is that you need to perceive in order to go forward, will you please uncreate, delete, and destroy the whole thing? So all the excuses that you guys have implanted in your being, that you're not an infinite being and that you can't perceive things or know things, Uncreate, delete, and destroy all that. Okay, I'm going to say something that's kind of coming up in my head. Now, I don't think you guys are stupid, but somewhere you guys think you're stupid. So everywhere you guys think you're stupid and you can't perceive things, uncreate, delete, and destroy it all, okay? So anybody who told you that or anywhere you think that that or anywhere you numbed and dumbed yourself or turned yourself down at any level so that you can't perceive what you need to do in the world. uncreate, delete, and destroy all that. So anywhere you guys did any of that, where you're pretending to be like all the other miserable people or the people who struggle, uncreate, delete, and destroy all that too. And anywhere you guys brainwashed yourself that you're incapable of perceiving things or knowing things with all your senses, including your psychic senses, will you please uncreate, delete, and destroy all that? A good mantra for you guys would be to walk around saying, what vibrational energy or what would it take for me to be completely and totally psychic? And everything in the way of that, I delete it all. Or you could say perceiving if you don't like that word psychic. So everywhere you guys are perceiving and judging that you're wrong, delete all that. Okay, cool. Thank you. You guys just shifted a lot of it right there. Thank you, thank you. So now. How many of you are open to new ideas? So every one of you that is not open to something new or seeing something in a new way or you like it the old way because then you can understand it.

Everything that is, uncreate, delete, and destory. Everywhere your perception is altered given your parents the emotional turmoil they had about perceiving. So any of you who duplicated your parents' reality about perceiving, and you do it just like they do. Uncreate, delete, and destory all that. All right, so how are you guys doing? Someone is asking, if I open my eyes after I connect to the light, will I have to reconnect again? No, Lisa. Once you've made your energy... you've made your energy big. So how do I know that energy clearing worked? When you feel a little lighter, okay? And if you don't feel light yet, if you're still in the middle of irritation, frustration, or resentment, then you haven't cleared it all. We've just turned it on, okay? So all the stuff that you guys still have kind of that we just kind of stirred up. Okay, everything that's sitting under the surface and you're kind of irritated that you've shut down your awareness, uncreate, delete, and de -story it all.

So, Chandra, I would just start with the smallest debt, okay, whatever it is, and I would just keep asking the universe, what would it take to get whatever, $500 so I can pay off this debt, and start with that one thing, okay? All right, so everything in the way of that, uncreate, delete, and destroy that. Okay, how to market. My business, how to work with technology at a more advanced level.

Alright, so everything in the way of you guys just taking that massive action step, uncreate, delete, and destroy it all. Everywhere you guys are afraid to look at the bright side, which is really just the light side of things, right? And you kind of stay stuck in the squabble of things, like the confusion, the wobbly, the I don't know, the I can't. Okay, everywhere you guys kind of betray yourself and do that. Okay, uncreate, delete, and destroy the whole thing. Okay, three other places where you guys don't want to let go of the part of you that feels like you have to do victim and look at the crappy side of things. Everything that is, uncreate, delete, and destory the whole thing. Okay, everywhere you guys want to manipulate yourself and believe the victim part of you instead of kind of the warrior part of you that'll just go out and do it. I mean that in a good way, the loving warrior, right? Like the kind of peaceful warrior who just does what they have to do and gets it done. So everywhere you guys can't do that, uncreate, delete, and destroy it all.

Uncreate, delete, and destroy it all. Okay, so there's two parts of the planet. The positive polarity and the negative polarity. So any of you guys, your first nature is to look at the wrongness and the negative polarity first. And check that out first before you go to the bright side. Uncreate, delete, destroy the whole thing. Cross all time, dimension, space, reality. Okay, so all the parts of you that want to look on the bright side, the glorious part of you, the loving part of you that knows all the answers, knows exactly what to do, will always tell you the truth. Okay, so everything in the way. of you connecting to this uncreate delete and destroy the whole thing okay i'm going to challenge you guys to see the opportunity in all things and everything in the way of that uncreate delete and destroy all that which is kind of the same as seeing the brightness and everything right everywhere you're afraid to see the opportunity the profit the money the cash the abundance and all things i mean what would it be like if you guys walked around saying what would it take for everything in my life to profit me What would it take for every exchange in my life to profit me? Yes. What would it take for you guys to follow the energy of your story and your vision board and everything in the way of that? Uncreate, delete, and destory it all? What would it take for you guys to look at all things before you judge it? Everything that is? Yes. Everything that you guys want to judge things first and then go there? Uncreate, delete, and destory all that? All the judgments that you guys put into your future that blocks your knowing? Uncreate, delete, and destroy all that times, yeah, across all time, dimension, space, reality. What would it take for you guys to create like a little timeline, you know?

So everything in the way of that happening, uncreate, delete, and destroy all that too. Okay. How many things do you guys aspire to do that you are not taking action on? What would it be like for you to actually just start taking action, helping people where you can? Okay, so everything that just came up for you guys that says, well, I can't take action. I don't know enough. Again, I will remind you, you're an infinite being in a body. A loving, kind, gorgeous, glorious, beautiful soul who can happily help anyone, right? And get paid for it. And everything in the way of that, uncreate, delete, and destory the whole thing. Everything in the way of you guys feeling good about your body and taking action in it, uncreate, delete, and destory all that. Okay, there. There's a lot of energy on that one. Okay, so all those things that you guys are doing to stop yourself, uncreate, delete, and destory it all. So all these things that you don't know how to take the next two steps, uncreate, delete, and destory all that time. And any of you that just wrote, I give up. Okay, any of you guys who give up, uncreate, delete, and destroy all that. Anywhere you're doing victim, giving up on yourself, uncreate, delete, and destroy it all. Anywhere it's an old story, uncreate, delete, and destroy it all. Okay, anywhere that's maybe not even your program, maybe you bought it from somebody else, uncreate, delete, and destroy it all.

Everywhere you're putting your life on hold, uncreate, delete, and destroy it all. Okay, so just think right now, what are the two steps that you can take within a week? It might be making two phone calls, right? Or it might be Googling some research things. Everything in the way of that, uncreate, delete, and destroy the whole thing. Everywhere your finances, your abundance isn't important enough for you to take the action, uncreate, delete, and destroy it all. Okay, so any fear of rejection, uncreate, delete, and destroy it all. Anywhere you guys think you're wrong if you take the two steps because staying the same is easier, uncreate, delete, and destroy it all. So any of you that don't think you can put a little awareness, a little oomph, a little pushing you to the next step so you can get over the hump, Okay, everything that is, uncreate, delete, and destroy it all. Now I want you guys to try on for a minute. What would it take for you guys to feel what it would feel like to be motivated into the next step? So what's going to drive you? Because you're going to have to get your own internal, like, little language system going on, right? Okay, so... the spells that you guys are under, the complacency, the old programming, and that's more powerful than you, which is kind of bullcrap. It's not really true, but somewhere you believe it, uncreate, delete, and de -story it all. So what's going to drive you? Okay, so all this hopelessness and everywhere you guys are kind of discounting yourself and giving up on yourself, uncreate, delete, and de -story all that. All the places where you guys are afraid or ashamed and move forward. because you might make a mistake, uncreate, delete, and destroy it all. Okay, so everywhere you guys are hard on yourself if you make an error, uncreate, delete, and destroy it all. Okay, all these other distractions that are coming up and you think that you can't do it yourself, uncreate, delete, and destroy it all. So how many of you guys are being like little girls and little boys and you're waiting for mommy and daddy to tell you what to do? Okay, anywhere you guys are doing that stuff, uncreate, delete, and destroy it all. Get a clear intent, right? What would it take for the perfect person to be my business partner? What would it take for me to work with the perfect people who helped me make a lot of money? Whatever those things are. And everything in the way of it, uncreate, delete, and destroy it all. Okay, everywhere you guys are stuck in the mud and you don't want to try something new, you like the old reality more. Everything that is, uncreate, delete, and destroy it all.

Everywhere you guys are afraid of change, uncreate, delete, and destroy it all. Okay, so I'm hearing somewhere you guys don't like money. All right, so everywhere you guys don't like money enough to just really go for it, uncreate, delete, and destroy it all. Everywhere you're afraid that if you have too much money, you'll be like everybody who has a lot of money that you don't like, uncreate, delete, and destroy all that. And everywhere your particle flow is that I have to be slow. This reality is slow. I have to slow myself down. So everywhere you guys are slowing your energy down so that you can't even perceive what's up, so you know the right reality to choose, everything that is, uncreate, delete, and destroy it all. Everywhere you've slowed yourself down to be like normal humans, like everybody else, uncreate, delete, and destroy it all. What would it take for you guys to be super humans who perceive and know everything, and can make really quick decisions. Okay, cool. You guys actually finally let go of a lot of things right there. Okay, so ask to speed up your energy so that your energy is really, really, really quick because that'll actually just get you out of a lot of this heaviness. Okay, there. Okay, everywhere you guys are letting people control you and stop you, uncreate, delete, and destroy it all. So just connect to the light and just say, I'm really over this reason. So say out loud with me, I am really over this reason. I am really done procrastinating. I am really done stopping myself. I am really done over this victim sad story. I am willing and able to choose to be an infinite being in a body and love myself. I am really willing to step into my power. I am really willing to take some massive action and make my life be different. And I am willing to hold myself accountable, starting now. I am completely and totally willing to be addicted to my success, no matter what. So all your resistance reaction, all your cords to you or anyone else, anywhere you guys are caught in a dilemma, if you move forward, you have to leave the old you. Some part of you is afraid of that. Everything that is, uncreate, delete, and destroy the whole thing. Every part of you that wants to hold you back for whatever reason, all the skeletons in your closets that want to hold you back, uncreate, delete, and destroy them all across all time, dimensions, space, reality. Anywhere you guys are afraid to move forward and still want to be a victim, uncreate, delete, and destroy it all. Anywhere you guys are tired and going a little unconscious, uncreate, delete, and destroy it all. So any of you guys who are tired or a little achy, I want you to take all your light and put it in that place. So where does it feel the heaviest? In your head, in your heart, in your body? Where does it feel the heaviest? And imagine that a light beam comes down from pure source energy. And like a little light bomb, fireworks, you know, firecracker, it just kind of blows up that denseness. Because that's where all your resistance is. And everywhere that came from, uncreate, delete, and destroy all that. Okay, I felt that one. Now, if some of you still have a little bit of heavy stuff, I'm going to ask you to just keep taking pure source energy, pull it into your body wherever it feels the densest, and just imagine like little firecrackers kind of going off, blowing all that stuff up, okay? And that pure source consciousness is just love, right? So it's just a lot of love that you're pulling into your body, and you're just asking it to delete all the negative fear -based imprints. All right, and here's your home play. 30 to 40 times a day can be all at one time. Like if you want to just do it in the morning, then do it in the morning. If you want to do it before you go to bed, do it then. What vibrational energy can you be to align with the opportunities that move you forward and open doors for and then pick one of your things in your dream or your story, right? Okay, so that something new shows up in your life. So it could be somebody earlier said they wanted to move into a new home. So she could say, what vibrational energy can I become to align with the opportunity that puts me in my new house? And everything in the way of that, uncreate, delete, and destroy it all. So any of you guys that too many choices are overwhelming, uncreate, delete, and destroy all of them. All right, many, many blessings. Bye. 

====================

LESSON 13: Decluttering Your Life

- Hey, this is Christie Marie Sheldon and you're listening to a recording I did of a series of 24 live group sessions on clearing abundance blocks. Here is what we are covering today, session 13. Today, we take on clutter. Your life is cluttered with hundreds of options, but as you're cluttered life, messy finances, full email box and your emotional clutter holding you hostage, do you own your stuff or does your stuff own you? We'll talk about how clutter impedes your progress and muddles your manifestations and second, I'm going to teach you some techniques for clearing out the clutter. It actually can be as simple as if you love it, keep it, if not, dot, dot, dot. We'll talk about surrounding yourself with beautiful things that add to your life and releasing, clear the bindings that clutter your finances, your emotions and your life. Let's begin. Hey, it's Christie. How are you guys? It's awesome to be here. Today is day 13 and we're going to talk about clearing the clutter. Just grab a journal or a piece of paper to grab and write down any notes that you might have. Be open to something new, some love and some fun. Set your intent on what you hope to achieve. So let's just take a moment right now and there's a particular something that you want to achieve, set that intent. Take a moment and set some intent for what you hope to achieve the whole last half of the Unlimited Abundance journey. Okay, so whatever energy you want to release, bring that forward and we're going to journey together. It's going to be exciting. I can feel some heavy energy, so that's perfect. Remember, if your stuff gets stirred up in the day and you don't want to join the session, that's probably a good session for you to join because that means that there's something that's come up for you. Here are some inspiring stories. So again, I got a lot of testimonials. So keep 'em coming in. Sometimes in the middle of like these longer kind of journeys, peoples tend to like fall away a little bit and we don't want that to happen. Kay increased her income by 16,000 a year, so she just made $16,000. Kay has been working, creating a catalog magazine for her industry and the company she works for just bought the current catalog and asked her if she'd like to run it for them. She'll make a minimum, so this is a minimum by the way of 16,000, a minimum of four grand per issue with the four issues a year, she's increased her income by 16,000. All right, so good job Kay. Excellent manifesting. What would it take for everybody listening to increase their income by 16,000? Here's another one. Natalie manifested some miracles and $9,000. So in Australia, of the last few years have been hard for Natalie, she said she was living in stress and fear about how to pay the bills, cover her debts, feed her family. Since starting the Unlimited Abundance journey, things have begun to change and now she's literally counting the miracles. Now, you have to understand if somebody is living in stress, trying to figure out how to feed her family, I mean, that's not really a fun way to live necessarily. So miracle number one, she said, was her mother gave her $2,000 despite their strange relationship. Miracle number two, Natalie and her husband used part of that money from the two grand to fund a music workshop for kids that ended up bringing in another $2,000 in income. Number three, a friend hired Natalie to build her website and agreed to pay her a $1,000. In the past, Natalie always agreed to help her friends for free, that's total of $5,000 now. Natalie's aunt gave her $4,000 to cover some bills, attend a seminar that she wanted to attend, but didn't have the extra money to pay for, so that means she manifested a total of $9,000 and it didn't stop there. She said she didn't have clothes to wear to the seminar 'cause she wanted to look sharp, but she went shopping and found some things that she really, really liked, 80% off. Also looked to start a new business and has had her eye on an office space that just came up for sale, so she kept doing the, what would it take? The what would it take was able to manifest leasing the space and so she just talked to the real estate agent and found out they'd be willing to lease it for a year with an option to buy. So she's really, really excited about this whole other part of her life opening up. So that's a really, really good job Natalie. So today is a really fun day and you know what? This topic usually holds a lot of energy for people. We're going to talk about clutter and cluttering your energy. Now, I'm going to start in an interesting place because I was being guided, I was going to start in a different place, but I heard that if I throw you in the middle of clutter, it'll confuse you, but if I throw you into clarity first and then we go into clutter, we'll be able to actually clear a little bit more energy. Okay, Chris said he made some big profits at work too. Okay, what are those profits Chris? Okay, so what creates cluttered energy? Just think about for a minute, all the places in your life where you might be a little cluttered, could be your finances, it could be bills on top of your desk, it could be a closet, it could be clothes in your closet that had tags on that you bought for no reason, it could be time clutter. Email me some things right now and the little, oh, Chris study made 20 grand profit. All right Chris, awesome. So you send me an email, I want to know how you did it. Yeah, so send me some notes here, some little love notes and tell me all the things that are kind of cluttered in your life. My desk at work, work clutter. Yeah, thank you for saying that 'cause I didn't mention work clutter. Basement, mail, basement garage, files, unopened mail, unsorted paperwork, paperwork, the home, my garage, books and papers, office clutter, basement clutter. Jenny says, "My mind is definitely cluttered". Clothes that do not fit anymore, too small, my home office, my mail, nine in 10 taxes. I find that often Christine, a lot of people don't really do their taxes until later. Lucy is saying my parents' stuff when they died. She's got to deal with that stuff which probably isn't very fun, has some old energy attached to it. My bedroom, the to-do list, clothes, files, desk, garage, papers to be shredded, extra emails. Yeah, what about that cluttered email inbox? Two-car garage, can only park one car. Okay, so yeah, this is debts and money, lots of paper stuff. Yeah, paper's usually the thing that's mostly in the way of all of us. My boyfriend's patio. I'm overwhelmed by sorting out, uncreating the mess that is my entire life. All right, Sarah. Well, we're going to help you get a little clear on that. Hmm, okay, Shaley actually said she uncluttered her closet from last weekend as part of the goals, so there's a lot of clutter going on. We're going to sort it out with one thing. We're going to sort this out for a minute because clutter as you know is really just a symptom. All of those things are symptomology of something else. The reason you have clutter or too much paperwork or business clutter or garage clutter or clothes in the closet or whatever, is because some part of you doesn't have a clear enough picture in your head or thought or feeling of how you want your life to be. If that picture was more empowering, then that energy would enable you to happily and easily start clearing things. So if you remember, we got some emails towards the beginning and the testimonies about people who all of a sudden were procrastinating and automatically when they started clearing their own energy field, they happily went and started clearing their closets and clearing some things. It's like the inner game that's more important, that creates doubt or what happens in your life. So I want you to think for a minute about all the things that you just mentioned, okay? Like the closets, the clothes and I want you to just trust whatever pops in your head first, what attitude created some of that clutter? Was it that you didn't think you could handle it? Was it, oh, I don't have time for it? Was it, oh, that's too paralyzing? I don't want to do it, I hate it. Okay, overwhelmed, too much of a workload, avoidance. Okay, avoidance is a big deal 'cause as human beings, infinite beings, we're really good at avoidance and denial. Now, let's think of avoidance and denial for a minute. Avoidance and denial kind of creates these walls that actually interfere with what we're able to see as possible in the world. So avoidance and denial are the systems that we have in place that are really just blocking you from everything because an infinite being would see that everything is possible and would kind of just do, what would it take for me to just clear out my house? Or what would it take for me to have somebody help me? Or what would it take for things to kind of straighten up? Have free help, have my kids help me, have my maid help me. Some people are saying, I don't care, exhaustion, indecision, laziness. What if you don't have physical clutter, but mental clutter? Clutter still clutter Terry, so you might not have physical clutter, but mental clutter still blocks your life. Keeping stuff in case I need it in the future which is really about what? A fear. There's a fear based agenda under that, negligence, like not self-love, not good enough, takes too long, overwhelmed, I can't, lack of a motivation, okay, all this stuff. If I keep it around me, I'll feel safer. Okay, so let's just start clearing some of the stuff that's coming up and you'll kind of see where I'm going. Okay, so let's just connect to light for a minute. So close your eyes and if you're driving, don't close your eyes, just keep your eyes wide awake. So connect to the light, take your energy 300 feet up and it's safe, right and good to connect to the light. Safe, right and good to let the light and source energy serve you. It's safe, right and good for the energy field to come in and support you. It's safe, right and good for this light to come into your head and open all your knowing up. Safe, right and good for the energy to come into your third eye and open up your third eye, so you can see the truth about your life. Safe, right and good for this energy to come into your ears and open those, so you can hear divine guidance and the truth about everything. It's safe, right and good for this light to come into your throat and open it up, so you can create your new future. The throat is the energy of creation, you project out and speak what your truth is, therefore manifesting it, right? What are you guys doing with the what would it take? You're sending energy out your heart and out your throat into the universe. Yes, asking it to manifest. I see those light come into your heart, opening it so that you can feel compassion and kindness and allow yourself to have all the good life, allow this light to come into your torso, opening up all the nerve centers, clearing anywhere you felt sucker punched, fearful, angry, anguished, any of those things. Ask the light to come into your root, your hips, clearing any blocks that are created around your whole reality, like what you're rooted in. Ask the light to go down your feet into the center of the planet, connecting to center of the planet, so that you can be connected from above and below, supported by the planet as well as pure source energy and then allow that happy kind of light that's in the middle of the planet to kind of boomerang or trampoline right back up into your heart, so you are now connected from both places above and below and then ask this light to radiate like a great central sunshine out of your heart, 10 feet around you, 20 feet around you, bigger than your building, bigger than your city. Yeah, bigger than your state, bigger than the planet. Okay and so some of the things that we've already been talking about, all this chaos and clutter, let's just delete all the stuff that already came up for you all. So anywhere you guys have a backlog of clutter, a backlog of chaos that you can't even see something new and potentially worthwhile. Okay, everything that is, delete it all. Okay, any other place or thing in the way of you guys getting your future set up, delete all that. Okay, everything that created, all the mental, physical and emotional habits and attitudes, that created the chaos in your basement, that created the chaos in your paperwork, that created the chaos in your mind, created the chaos in your closets, created the chaos in your finances, that created the chaos in your life, that created the chaos in your inbox. Okay, delete, uncreate and destroy all of these things. Time's a gazillion. Okay, any other chaos that's infiltrated into your life and all the reasons why, uncreate, delete and destroy all these too. All those attitudes that we were earlier talking about that created the chaos in your life, like the boredom, the procrastination, the laziness, everything that is, uncreate, delete and destroy the whole thing. Everything creating the lack of motivation, the despair and the overwhelm, uncreate, delete and destroy all that. Everything creating the denial systems and the I can't deal with this finances, I can't deal with my paperwork, I don't want to, I don't like to, I can't, all that stuff, delete, uncreate and destroy all that. Everything creating the not good enough, uncreate, delete and destroy all that. Okay, that's some heavy energy right there that we've just kind of hit upon, so everybody kind of expand your energy and imagine the tons of lights coming in is going to really dismantle all your denial and I can'ts. Somewhere you guys have put a lot of judgements and a lot of decisions against all this chaos, so basically you create it all and then you hold it in place by all these justifications of why you can't deal with it and all of this is going to be really heavy energy. Okay, so everything that is, uncreate, delete and destroy it all. Okay, uncreate, delete and destroy it all. Okay, lots of denial systems you guys have going on. Okay, so all the denial systems, all the traps, all the hiding places where you guys just hide yourself, so you don't have to do life, fully aware, uncreate, delete and destroy all that. It's because they don't like being in happiness with their finances, so everywhere you guys don't like being happy with your finances, uncreate, delete and destroy it all. Everywhere you guys are demoralized by all your clutter, uncreate, delete and destroy it all. Everywhere you guys can't create any more news about your clutter, you just got to keep it in place and not deal with it, uncreate, delete and destroy all that. All your mom and dad's energy where you guys don't want to deal with or you want to deal with life the same way they dealt with life, everything that is in denial, uncreate, delete and destroy all that. That's a lot of energy right there. Okay, everywhere it's your family's lineage to be in denial, uncreate, delete and destroy all that. Everywhere, it's your family's lineage to deal with denial, upset and intrigue. And drama, uncreate, delete and destroy all that. That's a lot of energy. Okay, good job you guys. Everywhere you guys don't want to be bothered and you're a perfectionist, so you're too overwhelmed and too lazy to do it all, what's the point? Maybe another day, I'm too tired, it's not fun. Everything that is, uncreate, delete and destroy it all. Everywhere it's paralyzing, uncreate, delete and destroy all that. Everywhere you think is a joke that you have to take care of your life that much, uncreate, delete and destroy all that. Everywhere because it's fun, you don't want to do it, uncreate, delete and destroy all that. Fear of retribution of having what I want, everything that is, uncreate, delete and destroy all that. Everywhere you guys are afraid that you'll actually get what you want, uncreate, delete and destroy all that. Okay and everywhere you guys are afraid to, everywhere your clutter has historical energy, everything that is, uncreate, delete and destroy it all, like the person who has to go through their mom and dad's stuff or you moved into a smaller house and so you have all your stuff in the garage, uncreate, delete and destroy it all. All your attachments to this stuff because when you have clutter, clutter can own you instead of you owning clutter. If there's clutter in the garage, you might not think that it takes up any of your energy, but your energy supports that clutter, the clutter owns you and if you bought the clutter and you paid for it in credit cards, okay? It's still owns you because you're still having to pay it off in the future, okay? So anywhere that your clutter still owns you and you guys think that you own your clutter, can you see that there is a lie there, you have basically your clutter owns you. Okay, everything that is, uncreate, delete and destroy the whole thing. A lot of the tiredness is basically the clutter owning you. Can you guys really acknowledge that for a minute? Okay, so all the shame, guilt, fear, worry, everywhere you don't fit in the clothes and you think you will someday, all that stuff, uncreate, delete and destroy it all. Okay, all the shame, guilt, fear, worry, intrigue and tiredness, that's because you can't acknowledge that it owns you instead of you owning it, uncreate, delete and destroy it all. Now, everywhere you guys gave your power over to the clutter and now the reason why the clutter only owns you is because you gave it power to. So everywhere you gave power to the clutter and you gave more power to the clutter, than you gave your own self, uncreate, delete and destroy all that. Everywhere you gave way more power to the clutter, okay, delete all that. Okay, that's a lot of energy. Okay, all the memories that you guys are hanging on to with all your old stuff, uncreate, delete and destroy it all 'cause then you're creating from the past instead of creating from the moment, okay? So I like to create from the moment instead of my past because think of it, if you create from the moment, then it means that you're creating from all possibilities versus from historically what's really true or not true. So one is being present, being in your full creational self, where you believe anything is possible and the other one is basically on historical evidence saying, "Well, I did it like this last time, therefore, I guess that's what I can do". So what if in the old part of you, you created like chaos, desperation, fear, no money, credit card debt, can you see that if you're creating from the past is kind of going to get in the way of you creating your future from that anything's possible, what would it take kind of place. Okay, so everything in the way of you holding onto the memories which in a way are just kind of disabling you, uncreate, delete and destroy all that 'cause the real truth is you can only feel good in this moment and when you look at a thing, it'll evoke a memory of a time when you felt good, but there's no reason why you can't think of that time in your own mind, feel good and then you already have that memory, right? So it's really the present time feeling that you're after. So everything in the way of that, uncreate, delete and destroy it all. I've had the luxury of living in multiple homes. I have literally started with nothing 'cause when you move into a new home, you have nothing. You already have your other home somewhere else, so then you have another home. I remember feeling the feeling of how nice it was to not really have anything in there and then I could start again. So if I could be in that present moment and you can totally start again, what do you want your surroundings to look like instead of like bringing the past with you? It's kind of freeing, so I've done that like three times in my life and it's really, really refreshing 'cause I'm not really bringing anything with me. Okay, so everywhere you guys are bringing all this stuff with you, uncreate, delete and destroy all that too. So those are some of your attitudes. If you're not clear about what you stand for, you then create chaos in place of it, but if you're really, really clear about how you want your to look and when I say life mission, I mean really the totality of what you guys want which is what we were doing with the vision board. If you're clear about what you want, then it'll help you not be overwhelmed because then you will know what doesn't fit in its place, okay? So for instance, on your vision board or the story you wrote, you have, I want to be an excellent saver of cash, let's just say or I want my home to look like this, peaceful, happy, alive, well, whatever, right? Then everything that you have right now that doesn't fit that mold, you should probably consider eliminating it. Now, then the question becomes, why don't you want to? Well, it's just because you just have a lot of history kind of stuck to you. So all the history that's stuck to you uncreate, delete and destroy all that, okay? So now think about your life, is desires that are either fulfilled or unmet, but either thing that happens in your life is your choice, so you have a choice over this and choice, remember, an aware being, an infinite being, a love filled, soulful being has only two things, awareness and choice. So you can make a choice to be aware or you can make a choice to be in denial, either way you get what you ask for. So let's go to the next part and this is in regards to your clutter, okay? So I want you to just think about your clutter for a minute, whatever thing evoked the greatest amount of energy for you. I want you to think of something you stand for, like for instance, do you stand for a clutter-free environment? Or do you stand for, it could even be your big mission, like my big mission is I want to help 10 million people create a life they love, so that's my big mission and the second part of this is to make known to you, why you desire this, for instance, I desire this because it feels more delicious to me than anything else I can think of doing 'cause it's really true, that feels way more fun than a lot of, I can't think of anything more fun to me, truthfully and if I could, I'd let you know, but right now in this moment, it's feels way more fun to me. You're inspiring stories just make my day, pretty much. So one of the things I would have to do for that is generate, starting now, like a goal, would be 500 new clients a day in some capacity who desire help and I can provide them tools. So that's an action plan. Chaos, I would have to have an organized life in order to do that, right? If I don't have an organized life, I can't do that. Now, I could have broke this down and made it a smaller goal. It could be the smaller goal could be picking one thing I stand for, to be completely and totally chaos free in my financial area of my life, right? That could be one little goal and what that would mean is why do I desire this? Why I desire this clutter-free on chaos financial goal because then I will always know how much money I have in the bank, right? Like if you always have a profit loss statement for every month and know what's up in the world for you, can you see how that could be kind of fun because you're operating from a very clear objective, then you could create a plan of action to make this real. So if you want to chaos-free financially or of your life, then that means like make a little goal within the next two weeks or within the next month. I'm going to have a profit loss statement regarding my own life, so that could be one goal. So I'm giving you kind of the why, but I want you to pick one of those things that you had chaos about. Think of one thing you guys stand for in the form of like that chaotic thing that you listed. Can you say, I stand for a clean closet, I stand for a clean dealing with my paperwork? Are you going to make a stand towards cleaning out that one closet that always annoys me? I'm going to make a stand towards getting rid of those clothes that never fit me. Can you make a stand on something? Okay, Chris is making a stand for only doing two things at once. Actually, that's good, that's clarity. Wanting to make some stand for a clean home and business office. Trevor makes a stand to influence more than 10 million people through his book series. Jocelyn is going to make a stand for decluttering her two clothes closets. Karen's going to make us stand for a place for everything and everything in its place, I love that, then you know where it's at. Let's see, Jesse is making a stand for a wealthy and abundant life. Get a significant career she is proud of. Laura is going to make a stand to clean out the files. Galina also going to make us stand to get her PhD project going. "Making a stand towards getting control of my finances and my debt". Okay, so Adriana, that would probably just be like getting clear on your numbers and then getting clear on what you could do to increase the profit. Getting a stand for a clear mind, okay? Dealing with a stack of papers in the kitchen. Improving all aspects of abundance and helping family and friends. Clearing the closet. I hope I'm just saying your name right? Abotia. If you're going to stake a stand to improve your life in all aspects, like make some very specific goals for that. What would that literally look like in the next two weeks? Susan's going to make us stand for no piles of paperwork around the house, clean up my desk. I know this multimillionaire and one of the stands that he always makes in his whole office is everybody has to have a clean desk at the end of the day. Nobody is allowed to walk in the next day to a desk filled with chaos. So it's just kind of a thing and everybody gets used to it and so they don't leave work on their desk. Joanne is going to make a stand to keep her body healthy, happy with good food, limiting alcohol. Maureen's saying she's putting off making a stand for something, so I'm not sure why you're putting off making a stand, Maureen. So I stand for an organized financial life, decluttering my house room by room. The whole thing is, I've done this also is one of the techniques that I've done through my own home. I go into each room and I look at every object that I have in the room, so I just start with one corner and I look at the object and I say, do I love it? And if the answer is no, if I don't really, really, really, really, really love it, then it goes. So basically that's my rule, that's how I do my home. Do I love it? And if I don't love it, it's got to go. So it's an excellent technique 'cause it makes it really clear, crystal clear. Susie, getting my emails read. A quarter of my garage this week. Now, what I love about Lydia, she is very clear, a quarter of her garage this week, throwing out the old bank statements, shredding old tax papers, clear crawl space. I'm going to stop right here for a minute. So all the things that are in the way of you guys getting this clear stand. Okay, everything that is, uncreate, delete and destroy the whole thing. All the other clear stands that you're not able to make and all the reasons why you can't make them, uncreate, delete and destroy the whole thing. Okay, now, do you guys have a good reason why? So send me some of your reasons why that you're going to take the stand. Sarah, this is a good one. She's going to take on the financial identity of a disorganized and make that financial identity to be gone, so that she can get on with her creative identity and her social life identity, I love it. So Jean's saying, what do I do when I share a home with the other person may love it, but you don't? Well, that's called compromise. I've heard of some clients really going through this with their spouses, but make a rule, like you can keep five things, maybe your mate gets to keep five things or 10 things that you don't really like, but they get to keep it and you get to keep five things that they might not love and you get to keep it. So there's got to be like a certain little number or there might be some little rule, like if you absolutely hate it on a scale of one to 10, a 10, then maybe it's got to go, but you have to really feel it out. You know what I mean? In two months, if that person's still going to be resentful about it, it might not be a wise choice getting rid of it. If they're going to be on a scale of one to 10, resentful, only like a few little points, then you can probably get rid of it, but you're going to have to check inside. You're going to have to compromise a little bit, but just start doing what you love, like you could go around the room with your spouse and you could go, hey honey, what do you love in this room? And then you could go, well, what do I love? And then just kind of go through some things. Maybe there's four things that you guys really love and then you start fresh and new, just basically generate some other things that you love. The reason why you guys want to do this is because it will bring you peace, clarity and freedom. It will move you forward and have substantial income, peace of mind, clarity in all that I'm doing. Family matters more, clutter weighs me down. I want to feel lighter. I'm ashamed and irritated every time I think about it cause I can kind of feel this in some of you guys, so all the shame and guilt that you guys have about the clutter, everything that is, uncreate, delete and destroy the whole thing. Any other shame, guilt you have about clutter, uncreate, delete and destroy the whole thing. 14 other places you feel shame and guilt about your clutter, uncreate, delete and destroy all that. The 23 other places where you guys feel shame and guilt about clutter, uncreate and delete and destroy the whole thing. Wow, that's a lot of energy. So there's tons of places. All the other places where you guys are recommending to yourself to not deal with this and justifying it all along the way, uncreate, delete and destroy it all. Sometimes you have to do some stuff that you don't really love to do for a little while until you get everything cleaned up. You could say, what would it take and get somebody else to do it, but for the control freaks, you won't have fun doing that because somebody else is doing it. So the control freaks might have to do something they don't want to do for a little bit just to get organized. Okay, so everything in the way of that, where you guys can't let somebody come in and help you, uncreate, delete and destroy it all. Everywhere you guys are giving mixed messages to the universe, you are saying, you want to deal with it and then the other part of you is saying, no, I don't want to deal with it, uncreate, delete and destroy it all. Why? Getting my book written as the first major step in creating my true abundance. Cleaning my desk will clear my mind. Yes, it's true. Looking at new bank statements will bring more money 'cause it will free up energy which is really very true. That's the whole point of this. Just think for a minute of what it would be like if these tasks that were in the way, just think of them being totally done. Think of how much energy you're putting against not getting it done and how many months or years that you've been doing it 'cause what happens is we take all this energy towards not doing the thing that we don't want to do for years and years and years and months and if we would just actually just go deal with it, in the end, it'd probably only take a couple of weeks or a week or a day. Okay, so everywhere you guys are procrastinating doing all that, uncreate, delete and destroy it all and all the reasons why. How many years and months of backlogged energy do you guys have sitting in your house, in your financial life, any of that? Uncreate, delete and destroy all that. So how many years and months of backlogged energy do you guys have holding all this stuff in place? Uncreate, delete and destroy it all. All the stress that you guys have held in place regarding your homes, uncreate, delete and destroy it all. Everywhere you can't believe you have that much stuff, uncreate, delete and destroy it all and think of the word stuff, right? Everywhere you guys are stuffed with stuff, uncreate, delete and destroy all that. That's a lot of heavy energy there. All the other backlog stuff that you guys have going on, uncreate, delete and destroy it all. So Margaret answered me. I asked her why she was making a stand towards not doing it? She is saying, "Because I haven't done it so far. I expected to have my office cleaned two weeks ago and it's still the same and now I expect to have my office cleaned and my closet cleaned before the trip in August". So all you guys are in the same place, you're kind of saying, okay, I'm going to make a goal, but you're really not. Everything that's creating that. Okay, everywhere you guys love the messes or don't want to deal with the messes, uncreate, delete and destroy 'em all. Everywhere you guys are tired of dealing with all your messes and just want to get over it, uncreate, delete and destroy all the messes, so you can just get over it. Okay, one more time. All the places and all the reasons why and all the agendas why you guys have been stuck in this place for years and months, uncreate, delete and destroy all of it. Okay, one more time. All the years and months of backlogged data, of why your home and your space and your finances and your work and your life is chaotic, uncreate, delete and destroy all that. So one of Joan's motivations is when I'm eating right and exercising regularly, I feel alive and in the moment. When I eat funny food and drink, I'm numb and dumb. I take a stand for organizing my finances by hiring a professional advisor to decrease my stress and help me create a path for the future. I've done that before. I've hired obviously financial advisors, but I've also actually hired a woman who is a great organizer to come over to my home and do it for me. Why did I do that? Because I really don't like doing it and you know what? It was great and you know what? I had to pay her 30 bucks an hour, but truthfully at the end of it, I really didn't care 'cause it was done. Everywhere you guys are waiting for the proper spot and the proper technique of where to put it, uncreate, delete and destroy it all. Everywhere you guys don't know how to create spots and organize, uncreate, delete and destroy it all. Maybe there's somebody you know who's an amazing organizer and maybe you can ask them to come over and trade. You help them with something and they help you with something. So everything in the way of that, uncreate, delete and destroy it all. Okay, every other place where you're avoiding paying an organizer or asking somebody to help you, uncreate, delete and destroy it all. Everywhere you're avoiding doing it 'cause you don't want to fight with your spouse, uncreate, delete and destroy it all. Everywhere you're living with a pack rack and it's driving you crazy, uncreate, delete and destroy it all. I would do a few what would it take, so that my spouse would get in the same game with me and help me organize. What would it take for me to love what's in my home as much as my spouse does, right? Uncreate, delete and destroy it all. What would it take for my spouse and my mate to happily and easily cohabitate with me in a place that we love, right? You do a couple of things like that, uncreate delete and destroy at all. Cherry thinks she feels like none of this relates to you, are you totally organized? 'Cause 99.9% of the population is usually not, but I want to just kind of apply this to you mentally. Are you mentally always focused on what you want or do you allow little thoughts in your field of what you don't want in your life? Do you focus on what you like 99.9% of the time or do you still have anger worry, stress, kind of come up in your thoughts during the day? Because you could look at it like what kind of cluttered or chaotic thoughts do I have that come up into my mind everyday, right? So any of the cluttered, chaotic thoughts that create the messes in your life, uncreate, delete and destroy all of them. Trevor has offered. He says, "If the space is full of dead things, how do you expect new things to turn up?" That is true. My sister has offered to come and help me. Yes and everywhere again, you guys are keeping the messes 'cause you're worried about the money, then you're going to have to like look at it like, oh, I wasted this much money, you know what? Think of how much money is cutting off from you because basically you're keeping that stuff in your space. So everything creating that, uncreate, delete and destroy the whole thing. Pick one more area of your life that might be cluttered, could be credit cards, taxes. Now, we're going to just clear at a deeper level here. Are you guys really clear why you have this issue in your life? You might say, oh, I'm tired about it, but what really is it? What really, really is it that's going on that created this issue in your life? Was it a part of you that did denial in some other part of your life? What habits and attitudes created the thing that you're going to take a stand on? So type me some of these. Moo Bosch here was saying, "Maybe a survival strategy, avoidance, boring, time consuming, confusing, embarrassment at my inability to manage my finances, credit cards. Don't like messes, avoidance. My father told me, girls did not know about these things". Okay, so all these things that you guys just mentioned right now, uncreate, delete and destroy the whole story about them. Insecurity, everything that is, uncreate, delete and destroy the whole thing. Fear, everything that is, uncreate, delete and destroy all that. Detail slow you down, so the operational costs is clutter equals time saved or better used. Now, that's true Chris, in some cases, if you can go take your energy and go make profit somewhere else, yeah, go for it. So how can you create a system where somebody else takes care of the other stuff that would be like maybe a great question to ask. Everything in the way of somebody else handling all the stuff you guys don't want to handle, uncreate, delete and destroy the whole thing. Now, I hear, investigate further, why else is it that you guys keep the clutter around, even if you know it's probably a good idea to get rid of it? Unconsciousness, like sleepwalking, unawareness, uncreate everywhere you guys are unconscious and unaware, numb and dumb, uncreate, delete and destroy all that. Fear of finding out I'm not good enough, uncreate, delete and destroy all that. Lack of self-discipline, uncreate, delete and destroy all that. Don't think I've ever had clarity to build on, lazy foundations, not know how to deal with money, everything that is, uncreate, delete and destroy all that. Depression, uncreate, delete and destroy all that. Might not be able to afford to replace it, uncreate, delete and destroy all that. Negative lashing from our mate seems to overpower the good feeling that I have, so anywhere you live with a mate that puts a negative energy on your positive feeling good moods, uncreate, delete and destroy it all. If any of you have mates, just ask that their energy get cleared along with yours while you're doing the Unlimited Abundance journey 'cause that would really help them. Papers, IRS, all that stuff, uncreate, delete and destroy it all. When I was married, my husband did all the organizing. When I divorced, I lost my organizer. So everywhere you don't think you're a good organizer, uncreate, delete and destroy that story. Everywhere you guys just don't want to do it 'cause there really is an energy of that, right? So anywhere you guys just don't want to do it 'cause your heart's not into it and you don't love it, uncreate, delete and destroy all that. I think that's really what your issue is, Ivan, you just don't want to do it. The cast diffuses the moving forward energy, anxiety makes me unaware and copeless. Okay, so everything that is, uncreate, delete and destroy all that. Okay, everywhere you were really poor for years and so you hold on to everything, uncreate, delete and destroy it all. Everywhere it's a struggle to get your life the way you want it, so therefore clearing the chaos is a struggle, uncreate, delete and destroy all that. Okay, everywhere your ashamed 'cause you have no income to declare, so therefore you put it off, uncreate, delete and destroy it all. Depression, laziness, never truly understood why to do it. Everywhere you guys don't feel like an alien, you don't understand why we do all this Earth stuff called paperwork, uncreate, delete and destroy all of that. Something to beat myself up about, uncreate, delete and destroy it all. Embarrassed at how far it's become, uncreate, delete and destroy it all. Everywhere your parents embedded the word no in you, so you just don't do it for yourself, uncreate, delete and destroy it all. Perceived inability to manage my world, everything that is, uncreate, delete and destroy it all. Everywhere you live day to day and lack and then binge on spending, uncreate, delete and destroy it all. Everywhere you learned as a child to throw things in a closet and so you learn to procrastinate, uncreate, delete and destroy it all. How could anyone else clear my clutter? When I had the organizer come over, I thought, why do I need a babysitter to help me organize? But truthfully, she just was my little clarity thing. She put all my files together, she did kind of everything for me and I kind of had to just sort of direct and the things and she did most of it and then everything I didn't know, she didn't know what to do, she just kept in a pile and it took me about an hour and a half and I went over through her with those things and told her what I needed to do with them and that's what happened. So it's really actually pretty easy if you just go to do, I love it and if you don't love it, get rid of it and if you want to get rid of it, it's either sell or donate. Those are your two choices, sell, donate or giveaway, right? And if you're going to sell it, you're going to do a garage sale, you going to do Craigslist, you're going to do eBay, that's pretty much it, those are your options. Take the weight off and donate it, give it to a friend or sell it. Okay, everywhere your father told you that you can't hold on to money, delete all that. Might need it later, unclear life goals. Okay, so Ana, I'm going to ask you to please do your vision board even if you don't know a 1000% what you want, just start with something. Okay, so everything in the way of you guys being clear about how you want your life to look like financially, uncreate, delete and destroy all of it. All right, everywhere you guys are being a victim, uncreate, delete and destroy it all. Okay, so I want you to think of the one thing that was annoying you, all this clutter and I want you to feel what it would feel like when you have it all straightened up. Pick the thing that you picked, like your closet's clean out, you have all your money in your bills in order, now, think of what that would be like and feel what it would feel like when it's all done. I want you to check inside, to kind of tune in, does it feel 50% lighter? Like, let's just say you did that one thing, in that area of your life, do you feel lighter? And if so, a 100% lighter, 50% lighter, like where are you going to be at on that? Exciting, peace, harmony, beauty, clarity, pride, love it a 100%. Monkey off my back, clean, calm, 50% better. Okay, so Arthur, so then there might be a couple more things that you got to do to get to a 100%, right? But I bet you, I have a feeling Arthur, you do it, actually after you guys get it done, it feels like it increases a little bit more than 50%. I think it's 'cause you haven't done it yet, but you can check inside and let me know. Beth, what if heaven was here on Earth and it's just the choices we make, so everywhere you don't think you can have heaven on Earth, uncreate, delete and destroy all that. Everywhere it's hard to be on Earth, uncreate, delete and destroy all that. Everywhere it's not easy to be on Earth, uncreate, delete and destroy all that. So I got a lot of good ones, easy and in the flow, proud of myself, weight off my shoulders, not embarrassed, I can have people over to my house, yeah, like all those really cool things. Woo, all right, give yourself a hand. That's your homework, just do what you can within the shortest amount of time cause just think about it, that feeling that you just had right now, that feeling is what you get to feel after it's all done. That's good. Okay, good job you guys. This week, what would it take to see the clarity and the chaos? What would it take for you guys to take some action on your chaos? What would it take for all the clarity and none of the chaos to be in your life? 30 to 40 times a day can be all at one time. What vibrational energy can I become to align with clearing the clutter in my life? Clearing the clutter in my life, right? So that you guys, this energy is aligned with the clearing of the clutter. So you know the drill, here's where you can write in some things about what you journaled today, the other recording in the PDF, so if you want to listen again and could do some deeper clearing on your chaos, you can Facebook some cool things that have happened for you, so I would love it 'cause I want to hear what's really happened for you guys, the magnificent things. So love you all, take care.

====================

LESSON 13: Clearing Clutter (Clearing Session Only)

Okay, so let's just connect to the light for a minute. So close your eyes. And if you're driving, don't close your eyes. Just keep your eyes wide awake. So connect to the light. Take your energy 300 feet up. And it's safe, right, and good to connect to the light. Safe, right, and good to let the light and source energy serve you. It's safe, right, and good for the energy field to come in and support you. It's safe, right, and good for this light to come into your head and open all your knowing up. Safe, right, and good for the energy to come into your third eye and open up your third eye so you can see the truth about your life. Safe, right, and good for this energy to come into your ears and open those so you can hear divine guidance and the truth about everything. Safe, right, and good for this light to come into your throat and open it up so you can create your new future. The throat is the energy of creation. You project out and speak what your truth is, therefore manifesting it, right? What are you guys doing with the what would it take? You're sending energy out your heart and out your throat into the universe. Yes, asking it to manifest. See this light come into your heart, opening it so that you can feel compassion and kindness and allow yourself to have all the good life. Allow this light to come into your torso, opening up all the nerve centers, clearing anywhere you felt sucker punched, fearful. angry, anguished, any of those things. Ask the light to come into your root, your hips, clearing any blocks that are created around your whole reality, like what you're rooted in. Ask the light to go down your feet into the center of the planet, connecting to the center of the planet so that you can be connected from above and below, supported by the planet, as well as pure source energy. And then allow the happy kind of light that's in the middle of the planet. to kind of boomerang or trampoline right back up into your heart so you are now connected from both places above and below. And then ask this light to radiate like a great central sunshine out of your heart, 10 feet around you, 20 feet around you, bigger than your building, bigger than your city, yeah, bigger than your state, bigger than the planet. Okay, and so some of the things that we've already been talking about, all this chaos and clutter, let's just delete all the stuff that already came up for you all. So anywhere you guys have a backlog of clutter, a backlog of chaos that you can't even see something new and potentially worthwhile, okay, everything that is, delete it all. Okay, any other place or thing in the way of you guys getting your future set up, delete all that. Okay, everything that created all the mental, physical, and emotional habits and attitudes that created the chaos in your basement, that created the chaos in your paperwork, that created the chaos in your mind, created the chaos in your closets, created the chaos in your finances, that created the chaos in your life, that created the chaos in your inbox. Okay, delete, uncreate, and destroy all of these things times a gazillion. Okay, any other chaos that's infiltrated into your life and all the reasons why, uncreate, delete, and destroy all these two. All those attitudes that we were earlier talking about that created the chaos in your life, like the boredom, the procrastination, the laziness, everything that is, uncreate, delete, and destroy the whole thing. Everything creating the lack of motivation, the despair, and the overwhelm. Uncreate, delete, and destroy all that. Everything creating the denial systems and the I can't deal with those finances. I can't deal with my paperwork. I don't want to. I don't like to. I can't. All that stuff. Delete, uncreate, and destroy all that. Everything creating the not good enough. Uncreate, delete, and destroy all that. Okay, that's some heavy energy right there. that we've just kind of hit upon. So everybody kind of expand your energy and imagine that tons of lights coming in is going to really dismantle all your denial and I can't. Somewhere you guys have put a lot of judgments and a lot of decisions against all this chaos. So basically you create it all and then you hold it in place by all these justifications of why you can't deal with it and all this is going to be really heavy energy. Okay, so everything that is, uncreate, delete, and destroy it all. Okay, uncreate, delete, and destroy it all. Okay, lots of denial systems you guys have going on. Okay, so all the denial systems, all the traps, all the hiding places where you guys just hide yourself so you don't have to do life fully aware. Uncreate, delete, and destroy all that. It's because they don't like being in happiness with their finances. So everywhere you guys don't like being happy with your finances, uncreate, delete, and destroy it all. Everywhere you guys are demoralized by all your clutter. Uncreate, delete, and destroy it all. Everywhere you guys can't create any more news about your clutter, you just got to keep it in place and not deal with it. Uncreate, delete, and destroy all that. All your mom and dad's energy where you guys don't want to deal with, or you want to deal with life the same way they dealt with life. Everything that is in denial. Uncreate, delete, and destroy all that. That's a lot of energy right there. Okay, everywhere it's your family's lineage to be in denial. Uncreate, delete, and destroy all that. Everywhere it's your family's lineage to deal with denial, upset, and intrigue. Drama. Uncreate, delete, and destory all that. That's a lot of energy. Okay, good job you guys. Everywhere you guys don't want to be bothered and you're a perfectionist so you're too overwhelmed and too lazy to do it all. What's the point? Maybe another day? I'm too tired? It's not fun? Everything that is, uncreate, delete, and destroy it all. Everywhere it's paralyzing, uncreate, delete, and destroy all that. Everywhere you think it's a joke that you have to take care of your life that much, uncreate, delete, and destroy all that. Everywhere because it's fun you don't want to do it, uncreate, delete, and destroy all that. Fear of retribution, of having what I want, everything that is, uncreate, delete, and destroy all that. Everywhere you guys are afraid that you'll actually get what you want, uncreate, delete, and destroy all that. Okay, and everywhere you guys are afraid to, everywhere clutter has historical energy. Everything that is, uncreate, delete, and destroy it all. Like the person who has to go through their mom and dad stuff, or you moved into a smaller house, and so you have all your stuff in the garage, uncreate, delete, and destroy it all. All your attachments to the stuff, you know, because when you have clutter, clutter can own you instead of you owning clutter. If there's clutter in the garage, You might not think that it takes up any of your energy, but your energy supports that clutter. The clutter owns you. And if you bought the clutter and you paid for it on credit cards, okay, it still owns you because you're still having to pay it off in the future. Okay, so anywhere that your clutter still owns you and you guys think that you own your clutter, can you see that there's a lie there? Basically, your clutter owns you. Okay, everything that is, uncreate, delete, and destory, the whole thing. A lot of the tiredness is basically the clutter owning you. Can you guys really acknowledge that for a minute? Okay, so all the shame, guilt, fear, worry, everywhere you don't fit in the clothes and you think you will someday, all that stuff, uncreate, delete, and de -story it all. Okay, all the shame, guilt, fear, worry, intrigue, and tiredness, that's because you can't acknowledge that it owns you instead of you owning it. Uncreate, delete, and de -story it all. Now everywhere you guys gave your power over to the clutter. Now the reason why the clutter only owns you is because you gave it power too. So everywhere you gave power to the clutter. and you gave more power to the clutter than you gave your own self uncreate delete and destroy all that everywhere you gave way more power to the clutter okay delete all that okay that's a lot of energy okay all the memories that you guys are hanging on to with all your old stuff uncreate delete and destroy it all okay so everything in the way of you uh holding on to the memories which in a way are just kind of disabling you uncreate delete and destroy all that Because the real truth is you can only feel good in this moment. And when you look at a thing, it'll evoke a memory of a time when you felt good. But there's no reason why you can't think of that time in your own mind, feel good, and then you already have that memory, right? So it's really the present time feeling that you're after. So everything in the way of that, uncreate, delete, and destroy it all. Okay, so everywhere you guys are bringing all the stuff with you, uncreate, delete, and destroy all that too. So those are some of your attitudes. If you're not clear about what you stand for, you then create chaos in place of it. But if you're really, really clear about how you want your life to look, and when I say life mission, I mean really the totality of what you guys want, which is what we were doing with the vision board. If you're clear about what you want, then it'll help you not be overwhelmed because then you will know what doesn't fit in its place. Okay, so for instance, on your vision board, or the story you wrote, you have, I want to be an excellent saver of cash, let's just say, or I want my home to look like this, peaceful, happy, alive, well, whatever, right? Then everything that you have right now that doesn't fit that mold, you should probably consider eliminating it. Now, then the question becomes, why don't you want to? Well, it's just because you just have a lot of history kind of stuck to you. So all the history that's stuck to you, uncreate, delete, and destory, all that. The whole thing is, I've done this also, is one of the techniques that I've done through my own home. I go into each room and I look at every object that I have in the room. So I just start with one corner and I look at the object and I say, do I love it? And if the answer is no, if I don't really, really, really, really love it, then it goes. So basically that's my rule. That's how I do my home. Do I love it? And if I don't love it, it's got to go. So it's an excellent technique because it makes it really clear, crystal clear. I'm going to stop right here for a minute. So all the things that are in the way of you guys getting this clear stand, okay, everything that is, uncreate, delete, and destroy the whole thing. All the other clear stands that you're not able to make and all the reasons why you can't make them, uncreate, delete, and destroy the whole thing. Clutter weighs me down. I want to feel lighter. I'm ashamed and irritated every time I think about it. I can kind of feel this in some of you guys. So all the shame and guilt that you guys have about the clutter, everything that is, uncreate, delete, and destroy the whole thing. Any other shame, guilt you have about clutter, uncreate, delete, and destroy the whole thing. 14 other places you feel shame and guilt about your clutter, uncreate, delete, and destroy all that. The 23 other places where you guys feel shame and guilt about clutter, uncreate, and delete, and destroy the whole thing. Wow, that's a lot of energy. There's tons of places. All the other places where you guys are recommending to yourself to not deal with this and justifying it all along the way. Uncreate, delete, and destory it all. Sometimes you have to do some stuff that you don't really love to do for a little while until you get everything cleaned up. You could say what would it take and get somebody else to do it, but for the control freaks, you won't have fun doing that because somebody else is doing it. So the control freaks might have to do something they don't want to do for a little bit just to get organized. Okay, so everything in the way of that where you guys can't let somebody come in and help you, uncreate, delete, and destroy it all. Everywhere you guys are giving mixed messages to the universe, you're saying you want to deal with it, and then the other part of you is saying, no, I don't want to deal with it. Uncreate, delete, and destroy it all. Okay, so everywhere you guys are procrastinating doing all that, uncreate, delete, and destroy it all and all the reasons why. How many years and months of backlogged energy do you guys have sitting in your house, in your financial life, any of that? Uncreate, delete, and destroy all that? So how many years and months of backlogged energy do you guys have holding all this stuff in place? Uncreate, delete, and destroy it all? All the stress that you guys have held in place regarding your homes? Uncreate, delete, and destroy it all. Everywhere you can't believe you have... much stuff, uncreate, delete, and destroy it all. And think of the word stuff, right? Everywhere you guys are stuffed with stuff. Uncreate, delete, and destroy all that. That's a lot of heavy energy there. All the other backlog stuff that you guys have going on. Uncreate, delete, and destroy it all. So Margaret answered me. I asked her why she was making a stand towards not doing it. She's saying because I haven't done it so far. I expected to have my office cleaned two weeks ago and it's still the same. And now I expect to have my office cleaned and my closet cleaned before the trip in August. So all you guys who are in the same place, you're kind of saying, okay, I'm going to make a goal, but you're really not. Everything that's creating that, okay, everywhere you guys love the messes or don't want to deal with the messes, uncreate, delete, and de -story amount. Everywhere you guys are tired of dealing with all your messes and just want to get over it. Uncreate, delete, and de -story all the messes so you can just get over it. Okay, one more time. All the places and all the reasons why and all the agendas why you guys have been stuck in this place for years and months. Uncreate, delete, and de -story all of it. Okay, one more time. All the years and months of backlogged data of why your home and your space and your finances and your work and your life is chaotic. Uncreate, delete, and de -story all that. Everywhere you guys don't know how to create spots and organize, uncreate, delete, and destroy it all. Maybe there's somebody you know who's an amazing organizer, and maybe you can ask them to come over and trade. You help them with something, and they help you with something. So everything in the way of that, uncreate, delete, and destroy it all. Okay, every other place where you're avoiding paying an organizer or... somebody to help you, uncreate, delete, and destroy it all. Everywhere you're avoiding doing it because you don't want to fight with your spouse, uncreate, delete, and destroy it all. Everywhere you're living with a pack rat and it's driving you crazy, uncreate, delete, and destroy it all. I would do a few what would it take that my spouse would get in the same game with me and help me organize. What would it take for me to love what's in my home as much as my spouse does, right? Uncreate, delete, and destroy it all. What would it take for my spouse? and my mate to happily and easily cohabitate with me in a place that we love, right? You could do a couple of things like that, uncreate, delete, and de -story it all. So any of the cluttered, chaotic thoughts that create the messes in your life, uncreate, delete, and de -story all of them. Trevor has offered, he said, if the space is full of dead things, how do you expect new things to turn up? That is true. My sister has offered to come and help me. Yes, and everywhere, again, you guys are keeping the messes because you're worried about the money. Then you're going to have to look at it like, oh, I wasted this much money. You know what? Think of how much money is cutting off from you because basically you're keeping that stuff in your space. So everything creating that, uncreate, delete, and destroy the whole thing. So type me some of these. Boring, time -consuming, confusing, embarrassment, my inability to manage my finances, credit cards, don't like messes, Avoidance. My father told me girls did not know about these things. Okay, so all these things that you guys just mentioned right now, uncreate, delete, and de -story the whole story about them. Insecurity. Everything that is, uncreate, delete, and de -story the whole thing. Fear. Everything that is, uncreate, delete, and de -story all that. Everything in the way of somebody else handling all the stuff you guys don't want to handle, uncreate, delete, and de -story the whole thing. Now I hear, investigate further. Why else is it that you guys keep the clutter around, even if you know it's probably a good idea to get rid of it? Unconsciousness, like sleepwalking, unawareness, uncreate everywhere you guys are unconscious and unaware, numb and dumb, uncreate, delete, and de -story all that. Fear of finding out I'm not good enough. Uncreate, delete, and destroy all that. Lack of self -discipline. Uncreate, delete, and destroy all that. Don't think I've ever had clarity to build on. Lazy foundations. Not know how to deal with money. Everything that is. Uncreate, delete, and destroy all that. Depression. Uncreate, delete, and destroy all that. Might not be able to afford to replace it. Uncreate, delete, and destroy all that. Negative lashing from our mate seems to overpower the good feeling that I have. So anywhere you live with a mate that puts their negative energy on your positive feeling good moods and create, delete, and destroy it all. If any of you have mates, just ask that their energy get cleared along with yours while you're doing the unlimited abundance journey because that would really help them. papers, IRS, all that stuff, uncreate, delete, and destory it all. When I was married, my husband did all the organizing. When I divorced, I lost my organizer. So everywhere, don't think you're a good organizer, uncreate, delete, and destory that story. Everywhere you guys just don't want to do it because there really is an energy of that, right? So anywhere you guys just don't want to do it because your heart's not into it and you don't love it, uncreate, delete, and destory all that. I think that's really what your issue is, Ivan. You just don't want to do it. The chaos diffuses the moving forward energy. Anxiety makes me unaware and copeless. Okay, so everything that is, uncreate, delete, and destroy all that. Okay, everywhere you were really poor for years and so you hold on to everything, uncreate, delete, and destroy it all. Everywhere it's a struggle to get your life the way you want it, so therefore clearing the chaos is a struggle. Uncreate, delete, and destroy all that. Okay, everywhere you're ashamed because you have no income to declare. So, therefore, you put it off. Uncreate, delete, and de -story it all. Depression, laziness, never truly understood why to do it. Everywhere you guys don't feel like an alien and you don't understand why we do all this earth stuff called paperwork. Uncreate, delete, and de -story all of that. Something to beat myself up about. Uncreate, delete, and de -story it all. Embarrassed at how far it's become. Uncreate, delete, and de -story it all. Everywhere your parents embedded the word no in you so you just don't do it for yourself. Uncreate, delete, and de -story it all. Perceived inability to manage my world. Everything that is, uncreate, delete, and destroy it all. Everywhere you live day to day and lack, and then binge on spending, uncreate, delete, and destroy it all. Everywhere you learned as a child to throw things in a closet, and so you learned to procrastinate, uncreate, delete, and destroy it all. How could anyone else clear my clutter? So it's really actually pretty easy. If you just go to Do I Love It? And if you don't love it, get rid of it. And if you want to get rid of it, it's either sell or donate. And if you're going to sell it, you're going to do a garage sale, you're going to do Craigslist, you're going to do eBay. That's pretty much it. Those are your options. Okay, everywhere your father told you that you can't hold on to money, delete all that. Okay, so everything in the way of you guys being clear about how you want your life to look like financially, uncreate, delete, and de -story all of it. All right, everywhere you guys are being a victim, uncreate, delete, and de -story it all. Beth, what if heaven was here on Earth? And it's just the choices we make. So everywhere you don't think you can have heaven on Earth, uncreate, delete, and destroy all that. Everywhere it's hard to be on Earth, uncreate, delete, and destroy all that. Everywhere it's not easy to be on Earth, uncreate, delete, and destroy all that. Okay, good job, you guys. This week, what would it take to... See the clarity and the chaos. What would it take for you guys to take some action on your chaos? What would it take for all the clarity and none of the chaos to be in your life? 30 to 40 times a day can be all at one time. What vibrational energy can I become to align with clearing the clutter in my life? Clearing the clutter in my life, right? So that you guys' energy is aligned with the clearing of the clutter. You can Facebook some cool things that have happened for you. Because I want to hear what's really happened for you guys, the magnificent things. So I love you all. Take care. 

====================

LESSON 14: Clearing Family Blocks

- Hey, this is Christie Marie Sheldon, and you're listening to a recording I did of a series of 24 live group sessions on clearing abundance blocks. And here's what we're covering today, session number 14. Today, we focus on your future, the happiest future possible for you. Dream big here. The sky's the limit. To get you out there, we will talk about the most common blocks. And family patterns are one of the main blocks. Another is the waiting game. Are you waiting to be happy or are you going for it no matter what? And I hope you're uncomfortable here because waiting for your happiness is a block. And second, we'll work with your body's energy system, 'cause if your particle flow is slow, we're going to clear that. And we'll also take on the energy called being normal. Let's get to the truth behind your weirdness. And at the end of this, you'll be saying, "Why be normal?" So let's be good. Hey, welcome, welcome. It is the day 14 on the "Unlimited Abundance" journey. All right, I am super excited. My favorite thing to do is take action. Love action. It's what proves to the universe that you're serious in a way. And so we're going to talk today about taking massive action. So grab a journal or a piece of paper so that anything that comes up for you, you can jot down. Later on, put up on the, you know, the backend of the website in your workbook and work on clearing some more things a little deeper. Be open to some more love and fun. And let's take a moment and set your intent and what you hope to achieve tonight. And what that means, I've had people say, "What does that mean set an intent?" You know, it's kind of like a what would it take. So what would it take for you to be able to take massive action on a certain project that maybe you've been procrastinating on. Now, set a little intent for the rest of the journey. Like what do you hope to achieve in the last part of the journey? Like set your intent on that. Whatever that is. Bring any junk that you want to clear later on to the forefront. And let's journey together. This is so exciting. We are going to celebrate any breakthroughs, some breakthroughs and inspiring stories that we've had. We've had some good wins this week. Elizabeth manifested more than $6,000. So debt has been dogging Elizabeth for quite a while, particularly credit card debt. Some of you might be familiar with that. After the clearings, she is taking action. Here's what she accomplished. First, she opened and paid all the bills that she'd have been avoiding. So that's really, really good. So she's decided to be totally aware. Then, she checked her investment accounts, realized she had money to help pay down the credit card bills. She just hadn't been willing to really look at the situation because of her fear of the future. So she cleared the fear and the universe delivered. She checked an investment she'd made some time ago in gold and found it had grown by $2,000. So that's a chiching. Then she decided to pull another two grand out of her retirement account her father had left her. So that's chiching. Closed an old IRA account gaining another $650 or finding it. She had found an old unpaid invoice and finally got the payment from the invoice from some other people for $750. Chiching. And she listed a small apartment in her home with a vacation rental company and got her first reservation one week for $1,000. So that's like chiching. And in the future, that'll be chiching, chiching, chiching, chiching. So there's, you know, 52 weeks in a year. So the potential for that is quite a lot. Really, really good job, Elizabeth, for taking action. That was $6,400 in total. She's putting it toward her credit card bills. "Still have some debt," she said. But it like changed her life to just really start focusing on the things that she was avoiding. Estella manifested $58,000 worth of stuff. Here's what happened. Her manifestation story started as soon as she made the decision to join the "Unlimited Abundance" journey. The day after signing up, she received a $1,600 tax refund, a little bit more than she expected. That's great. Three months ago, Estella's husband, unfortunately, almost died and spent five days in the hospital. The bill was more than $58,000, and that didn't include the $3,000 for the ambulance and the $3,000 for the doctors. So that's $64,000. And they didn't have medical insurance. So every day, she ask the universe, "What would it take to get these bills paid?" And she said the abundance started flowing. They talked to the ambulance company and found out two weeks after they started "Unlimited Abundance" journey that the bill would be knocked down $650. So instead of three grand, it was only 650. They also arranged to make the payments on the doctor bills. They applied for a program called sponsor care with the hospital and they just received a letter this week saying $58,000 bill was being waived. The medical bills can wipe out people. So, I mean, this is an astonishing miracle for Estella and her husband. So, of course, it's unfortunate her husband had to, you know, go to the hospital, but look at what happened. I mean the universe completely and totally supported them. So that has to be a life-changer. I mean, really think about that. $58,000 that they would've had to pay down. That's great. "Stuck doing some actions." Okay, that's what this today is about. Okay, so today is about, we're going to clear some major stuckness. All right, love it. So let's close your eyes for a minute. So that the next section, when we bring some stuff up, we're going to start clearing it. Close your eyes, connect to the light. You guys are so awesome. You're like professionals. You're letting the energy in in two seconds. I love it. Okay, connect up 300 feet. See a sense or allow the energy to come into your crown. Clearing all the blocks you have to knowing, all the blocks you have to feeling, and knowing the truth about what you know and feel. Allow the light to come into your third eye, your ear, so you can see, hear, and know the truth. Allow the light to come through your throat, unclogging anywhere you block your communication or asking for what you truly want and desire in the world. Allow the light to come into your heart so you have total and complete compassion for yourself and a love for yourself so deep you're willing to take any action that's needed. Asking the light to come in, clearing your solar plexus of any fear of moving forward, any fear of doing your taxes, doing your paperwork, doing your accounting, knowing your numbers. Asking the light to come through into your stomach area, clearing any place you rooted in some old energies, some old antagonism, some old fear, some old frustration, some old vibrations keeping you blocked, stopped, and avoiding things. Asking the light to come through your legs, your feet into the center of the planet, connecting to the place in the center of the planet where it's purely conscious. Asking this pure conscious energy to bounce back up into your body, into the center of your heart so you're connected from above and below vibrating out like a big central sunshine, 360 degrees all the way around. Asking the light to expand around your body, allowing pure consciousness to fill your whole energy field. Asking this light of pure consciousness to fill the whole building you're in. Asking this light of pure consciousness to expand out past the city you're in. Asking this light of pure consciousness to expand out past the county you're in. Asking this light of pure consciousness to expand out past the state you're in. Asking this pure light of consciousness to include your family members that you want to bless today and include them in the energy. Okay, ask this light to expand out past the country you're in. And ask this light to expand out past the earth. Okay, now, you're connected to the higher part of you. The larger part of you that's connected to oneness, that knows how to clear everything and make everything right in your life in a miraculous, quick, easy, a fun, joyful, amazing way. Everything in the way of you allowing a miracle to occur in your life, uncreate, delete, and destroy. So we're going to work some more on any place that you guys got blocked on taking action. So I want you to just think for a minute and we're going to clear everything that comes up along the way. What emotional decisions are trapping you in creating lack of massive action? So what choices and decisions have you made that are trapping you and keeping you stuck creating massive actions? Katia said she asks for new clients, "As we got a family with three hours a week of sessions at full price doubled what I was asking, doubled my income on my practice." I love it. So what emotional issues have kept you stuck and out of taking massive action? "I'm scared I'm doing it wrong." "Fear." "Stuck in rebellion." "If I don't do anything, then people can't say anything negative about me." Okay, so all those things and everything they're connected to, please uncreate, delete, destroy them all across all time, dimension, space, reality, across all soul choices. Oh, awesome. Okay, "Fear of the unknown, safety in the known." Okay, so everywhere you're more comfortable in the known than unknown uncreate, delete, and destroy it. Even though the unknown could have more potential, right? Everywhere you're afraid of the more potential solution, uncreate, delete, and destroy across all time, dimension, space, reality. Everywhere you have a fear of not being able to deliver, uncreate, delete, and destroy. And everywhere you're afraid the universe won't deliver it for you, everything that is, uncreate, delete, and destroy across all time, dimension, space, reality. Yes, you guys are doing it fast. You're like really clearing fast tonight. That's great. It's ready to go. Fear of not having enough time. Not my department. Like I guess that the emotional decision is it's not your thing. Whatever that is, uncreate, delete, and destroy it across all time, dimension, space, reality, across all inner choices that you've made that keep any of this locked in place. Everywhere you don't know what to do, feeling the fear, choosing not to be sure of exactly what to do. So everywhere you're fearing what to do, everything that is, uncreate, delete, and destroy. "I don't even know. I just feel confusion." Okay, so everywhere you're alone in this world and you have nothing to anchor into that feels real to you, everything that is, uncreate, delete, and destroy everywhere you're just feeling confused. So anywhere you guys feel violated by the universe, you know, that the universe doesn't support you, won't take care of you, and you just feel a general fear and panic that the universe won't take care of you. Okay, everything that is, uncreate, delete, and destroy it all. Everywhere you're just tired of this planet and everything on it and all the people and the things you have to deal with, uncreate, delete, and destroy. Everywhere you're afraid of choosing the wrong path, everywhere you make indecision, the choice, uncreate, delete, and destroy across all time, dimension, space, reality. Okay, so what would it take for you guys to trust your inner guidance? Ask what would be one really cool step that would make me a lot of money and just take it. So everywhere you're blocked in taking one really massive step, everything that is, uncreate, delete, and destroy it. Okay, everywhere you have no idea what your finances are or how to pay them, uncreate, delete, and destroy it all. Everywhere you're afraid, so you don't want to look or be aware. I think that's some of your stuff, Sarah. You don't want to look at things. Everything that is, uncreate, delete, and destroy. Everywhere it feels uncomfortable moving into a new part of your life, uncreate, delete, and destroy. Okay, despair. Everywhere you guys are doing victim, you know, where you're just stuck and you don't think you have a choice, that you can't create a miracle, uncreate, delete, and destroy all of that. What would it take for you guys to create a miracle? What would it take for something really cool to show up? That's the perfect answer, the perfect next step for you. And everything in the way of that, uncreate, delete it. Everywhere you feel trapped, like now that you're totally aware that you're trapped, and now, you still don't know what to do, uncreate, delete, and destroy it. Everywhere you're unwilling to have an action plan of how to get out of your trap, uncreate, delete, and destroy it all. 'Cause the way out of a trap is just take the first step you can. Then maybe the first step is asking somebody for help, right? Or maybe the second step is getting a new job, whatever that is, so you can bring in more income and then you can start solidifying your new path for yourself. So everywhere you're stuck in what the next step of, uncreate, delete, and destroy it all. And everywhere you don't like it, uncreate, delete, and destroy it all. Okay, cool. Everywhere you feel inferior to other people, okay, delete all that. This is a kind of an interesting one, Natalie, that you brought up. Seeking distinction between creating and fantasies. Well, the truth is, Natalie, the real, real honest truth is you create your reality bubble by what you think and feel, and you attract things to you from what you think and feel. We're going to go into that in the next slide a little bit more. What you think and feel creates your reality. So for a little while, you feel kind of delusional because you're just making it up, but you have to kind of make it up long enough until something pops in. Okay, so everywhere you guys are afraid to make something up until it pops in, and then everywhere you guys are saying, "Oh, it doesn't work," which stops the flow, everything that is, uncreate, delete, and destroy it all. Okay, so everywhere you're skeptical that you will not get what you want, everything that is, uncreate, delete, and destroy it all 'cause skepticism kind of slows down the energy of your manifestation. And I'm going to ask you this, Sheila. Who told you you need to be skeptical? 'Cause I think you're actually an amazing creator, imaginer, decision-maker, making decisions. So I think that skepticism came from somebody else, and I don't think it's really yours that you bought it from. So mom, dad, somebody else? Okay, everything that is, uncreate, delete, and destroy it all. Okay, that I wouldn't be loved no matter what, would be hated, rejected and not able to survive if you excel. So it means that actions and sparkle create people being jealous and mean to you. Okay, so everything that is, uncreate, delete, and destroy. Everywhere if you shine, the people won't pay attention, and they'll try to take you down, uncreate, delete, and destroy. "If I make money and I'm financially independent, I won't continue to live my life purpose." So everywhere you can have it all, Suzan, uncreate, delete, and destroy. Everywhere you guys can't have it all. You know, and the real truth is, you can live your life purpose, have cash, have fun, everything. Everywhere it's not spiritual to have money, uncreate, delete, and destroy all that. Everywhere you're tired of being human, fear of too much expansion, everything that is, uncreate, delete, and destroy. Everywhere you're tired of being human, uncreate, delete, and destroy. You guys have a lot of that. Okay, everywhere you else, you guys are tired of being a human being and being here, everything that is, uncreate, delete, destroy across all time, dimension, space, reality. Everywhere you guys are basically soaking up the energy of everybody around you instead of just living your own truth, everywhere you think that that's normal, uncreate, delete, and destroy across all time, dimension, space, and reality. Everywhere anybody wanted you dead, out of the way, everywhere you weren't important or loved or cared for, uncreate, delete, and destroy. Everywhere it's safer to be ineffective in your life than it is to take action, okay, everything that is, uncreate, delete, and destroy. Everywhere taking action would create some sort of trajectory that you wouldn't like, uncreate, delete, and destroy across all time, dimension, space, and realities. Okay, a lot of energy in families. Everywhere your family's holding you back and you still give them power, even if it was 10 years ago, 20 years ago, three years ago, and you're still giving your parents and your family power over your life, everything that is, uncreate, delete, and destroy across all time, dimension, space, reality. All core decisions where you can't believe that you let yourself give up your power, uncreate, delete, and destroy. Everywhere you're too prideful to let go of all the wrong decisions that you're making, uncreate, delete, and destroy across all time, dimension, space, and reality. Everywhere you guys keep making the same wrong decisions, thinking it'll be different, but you don't want to be wrong so you don't want to let them go, uncreate, delete, and destroy across all time, dimension, space, reality. Okay, so everywhere you feel like you can do it on your own, which is really an interesting thing because you can never really do it on your own 'cause you always are connected. My sister had this belief a lot, that she had to do everything on around. So one day I looked at her energy and I said, "Hey, what if you asked the universe to support you?" And it completely opened up all her manifesting. Okay, so everywhere you guys are blocking yourself from manifesting everything because you want to do it alone, uncreate, delete, and destroy all that. That's the big deal right there. Everywhere you feel like disconnected from source, uncreate, delete, and destroy. So let's go to another level. I want you to just tune in to some of the things that you guys typed to me. What age did you start making some of these emotional decisions that trap you? What age pops in your head? Even if you don't really remember what you did or what it was, what age pops into your head that answer that question? What emotional decisions and choices that are trapping you? Seven, three, three, four, five, three, five, five, 36, 12, eight, one month old, 13, 11, five, two years old. Just trust whatever comes up 'cause it might not even be conscious to you. The problem is you're around human beings who might have a lot of energy when you're small and you bought their reality. All these ages that came up for you and any age they're attached to, please uncreate, delete, and destroy. Everything attached to this, all the choices, decisions, everywhere you shut yourself down, everywhere you stopped yourself, everywhere where you bought somebody else's world and made it more real than your world, everything that is, uncreate, delete, and destroy across all time, dimension, space, reality. Everywhere you don't feel good about your life uncreate, delete, and destroy. Everywhere you think your life stopped at those ages, uncreate, delete, and destroy. Everywhere you're afraid to pick up the pen and recreate your future based on these false history, energies that are stuck there. The real truth is it's history. It's not even really happening to you anymore, right? So everywhere you guys are stuck in the past, living in the past drama and trauma instead of being present to what's really around you, uncreate, delete, and destroy across all time, dimension, space, reality, across all soul choices. Anywhere you made a sole choice to not let yourself have the good life, uncreate, delete, and destroy. What would it take for you guys to have an amazing life filled with, you know, whatever your vision board is, whatever your story is, about what you want your future to look like, everywhere you can't have that, can't create that, and stop that, uncreate, delete, and destroy across all time, dimension, space, and reality. It's a big one. So here's what happens. So you make some decisions at these certain ages and then what happens is you have evidence that it's true, right? All the evidence that you have that makes not taking action, the easiest solution in your life, all that evidence that you have piled underneath, all those debris and old junk, everything that is, uncreate, delete, and destroy across all time, dimension, space, and reality. Everywhere that's makes these real in your world, everything that's true about this, uncreate, delete, destroy across all time, dimension, space, and reality. Everywhere you feel like you're torn in both worlds, like you're stuck in the past, but you really want to create the future and you don't know which way to go, the old way or the new way, everything that is, uncreate, delete, and destroy across all time, dimension, space, reality across all poor soul choices. That's good energy. Okay, any parental stuff, does crying help clear the junk? Yeah, you know what happens is really honestly, you guys are like pulling off layers and layers of barriers that you have that you kind of think protect you, but really stop you. All the barriers that you have to the world are kind of falling down and sometimes your body just wants to cry. You know, it's like a biological releasing. So it's okay to cry, yawn, scream, whatever. Whatever has to happen to let it go. Everything in the way of any of the biology of this that's stuck in your body tissues that wants to go to, anywhere you have some biological energy in stuck in your body regarding all these things about stopping yourself and not taking action, everything that is, uncreate, delete it all. Anywhere you have the energy of dying, quitting, stopping in your energy field or your body, uncreate, delete, and destroy all that, too. How many places do you have, like stopping, dying, bound to destroy yourself and your cells. So anywhere you have the binding of destroying yourself, killing yourself, stopping yourself in your cellular tissue in your body, delete and uncreate all of that. Hey, asking the body to run a new energy called living. So ask "Body, body, body, what would it take for you to run the energy of living? Body, body, body, what would it take for you to run the energy of youthful, alive, happy, well, childlike energy?" That changed a lot. Well, Margaret says she's felt funky in the last few days. So much of these layers are unconscious. Well, that's the whole point. You have to look at it like you've lived, whether you believe it or not, okay? So I want you guys to feel the truth of this, okay? If you're an infinite being, how many years have you really lived? So feel the truth. Okay, so truth, truth, truth, have you lived more than a hundred years? Okay, yes, that feels light. Have you lived more than a thousand years? Okay, yes, that feels light. Have you lived more than a million years? Okay, that feels light. Some of you guys might try to hide the truth from yourself, but a million should read pretty true. So if you've live millions of years, you could have layers. So everywhere you're stopping yourself from dissolving your layers and thinking it's hard and heavy, 'cause it's really not. You just kind of get above it and you just blow them up, right? So everywhere you're stuck in the layers instead of letting them go, uncreate, delete all that. Anywhere you think it's troubling or trying or hard, uncreate, delete all that. Anywhere you're unconsciously programmed to never let go of them, uncreate and delete all that. Everywhere you're stuck between layers, uncreate and delete all that. Anywhere you think you're not powerful enough to blow them all up in two seconds, uncreate and delete all that. Anywhere you think that it's childish to get rid of them because then you'll be not normal, and you want to be really normal so people like you, all that. Sarah, you have so many layers 'cause you're resisting it. Everywhere you guys decided to kill yourself, everything that is, uncreate and delete it all. Everything that is, uncreate and delete it all. So Margaret now laughed when I told her she was like millions of years old. Everywhere you guys have bought into the truth that you're just a human being instead of an infinite being because that lie will make you think that you have to kill yourself, which is impossible because you are infinite. You're an infinite being who has a body. Okay, so everywhere you're in the way of that, uncreate and delete all that. Your body might die, but you'll live. The problem is you might as well just live because even if you kill yourself, you still have to live somewhere else. So you're still always living. So you can never really get out of living. So everywhere you guys are trying to get out of living by killing your body instead of like being alive and well, uncreate and delete all that. That cleared a lot of energy there. All the energy that you guys are resisting, everything that is, all the unconscious agreements where you can't really be alive in here, uncreate, delete, and destroy all of those. Okay, awesome. So I want to show you guys this. Here's how reality works. You make a choice. You make a decision in a truth about the choice. Either you like the choice or you're not. So if you say, "Wow, I'm going to go to the movies." And then you say, "I like to go to the movies." Then what most people do, what most humans do is they say, "I want to go to the movies and I want to go to the Jennifer Aniston movie because," and then they have like a whole list of the becauses, right? Well, the more becauses you have, the tighter the energy gets wound around you. See, when I make a choice, I just choose to do it 'cause it feels light and I want to do it. You know, my justification is because it feels right, okay? Or it feels light or it feels fun. But I don't make a whole story about all the 20 reasons why I need to do that because when I do that, then I lock my energy with density. Okay? So, conclusions. Too many conclusions are what these layers are really made of. Okay? Okay. But how do you unstick your reality? You make a choice. You make no judgment about the choice. You just say, "Hey, I want to go see the movie." And that's it, you don't have to make 20. Now, watch this, a lot of parents do this, by the way. They'll say, "Why did you hit your brother?" Okay, now honestly, the real truth is, is probably because it seemed kind of fun. But then you have to go through this whole litany of reasons why you hit your brother and you have to find the really good excuse so that your mom will let you off the hook and not punish you, right? Well, so that's how we learned to start justifying, because we get asked all these stupid questions by adults. "Why did you try to jump off the roof?" "Why? Because it seemed kind of fun." You know what I mean? "It seems like a good idea." And then we have to justify why we are stupid, okay? 'Cause they look at us like we're stupid when we really just think it's fun as a kid. So do you kind of see how we learn how to justify? We learn how to justify from this. You know, we're making choices that seemed kind of fun and natural and woo-hoo and whatever. And then we got in trouble. So then we learned how to justify. So that's really the story of why we justify. Okay, let's clear it from a different angle. So all these things that were coming up for you, Sarah, with that things that you're resisting, 'cause really the only thing you're really resisting is just being you, okay? And the only reason you're resisting being you is because you think it's not fair or safe to be you. So somehow you talked to yourself out of liking you. And that probably feels a lot tied to mom and stuff like that. So anywhere you're talking yourself out of liking you, everywhere you're guilting and shaming anybody listening, anywhere you're trying to not like you and then punish yourself for your life, okay, everything that is, uncreate and delete it all. Everywhere you made somebody else's wishes and desires more important than yours and stopped yourself, okay, everything that is, uncreate, delete. Yeah, that's a big deal. So everywhere, Sarah, you're making somebody else's decisions more important than yours, uncreate and delete all that. And who told you that you are not good? Whoever that is, uncreate, delete, and destroy that whole thing. All right, I call these the core contagious waiting syndrome. 'Cause once you start waiting, it's easier to wait than take action, right? Okay. So tell me some of the things that you guys are waiting for. Like what are you waiting for that's stopping you from taking action? What are you waiting for? Why are you waiting? So Esther's wondering what choice or conclusions can a five-year-old draw being witness to her father's death? Well, you can draw a lot of conclusions, that life is unfair, that it's, you know, if you didn't have money because your father's dead, that you know, you don't have money, that women are always depressed, bad things happen to women, you know, lots of things, right? So what else you guys waiting for? All those things that I just mentioned for Esther, uncreate, delete and destroy across all time, dimension, space, and reality. Okay, everywhere you gave people power 'cause that was in the past, so anywhere you guys are waiting to feel powerful before you take action, uncreate, delete, and destroy. Okay, all the karma and mom and dad's stuff, you guys, and family stuff where your family has tortured you for some reason, uncreate, delete, and destroy. Everywhere you're codependent and think you need people, uncreate, delete, and destroy. Everywhere you're still giving your power up to your mom and dad, uncreate, delete, destroy across all time, dimension, space, and reality. Okay, so Natalie is saying, "I easily take a leap of faith when it only impacts me, but when it impacts the family, I don't do it." So everything that is, uncreate, delete it all. Okay, what are you guys waiting for? Enough time, enough money, the investments to come in, to be stronger, confidence. Okay, so everywhere you guys feel like you don't have any of these things, uncreate, delete it all across all time, dimension, space, reality, across all history, genetic. Oh, yeah. Okay, a bunch of stuff right there. Okay, what would it take for the money to show up? Because you take massive action, what would it take for the confidence to show up? As you take massive action, what would it take for the confidence and the money to show up now? And what would it take for you to take massive action in spite of what occurs in your life? Everything in the way of that, uncreate and delete all that. What would it take for enough energy to show up in your life for you to take action, and everything in the way of that, uncreate it all. What would it take for you to feel safe, right, and good taking action, and everything in the way of that, uncreate, delete, and dissolve it all. What would it take for you to believe that you are the miracle generator by taking action, and everything in the way of that, uncreate and delete it all? What would it take for someone to help you and the someone to be you, and everything in the way of that, uncreate and delete it all. What would it take for the universe to deliver you 30, 40, 50, 20, 10, 8, and 99 people to help you, and everything in the way of that happening, uncreate and delete it all. What would it take for you to take action, and by taking action, you figure out your divine purpose? Everything that is, uncreate and delete it all. Maybe you have to go try for things. And once you try for things, you know what your action is or you know what your purpose is. But you have to go try things first. Remember the Life commercial in Mikey? "Try it, you'll like it." So everywhere you guys can't be like Mikey and just try it at first and then decide if you want it or not, everything that is, uncreate, delete, and destroy it all. What if you guys went and made a gazillion dollars and then decided afterwards if you liked it or not, okay, everything that is, uncreate and delete it all. All right. Everywhere you guys are waiting for happiness first before you take action instead of seeing that the action is the happiness generator. See, when you're over been waiting and you're just taking action, that's the happiness generator. Okay, everything that is, uncreate and delete it all. Everywhere you're waiting for more training instead of knowing that you have it all within you, everything that is, uncreate and delete it all. Everywhere you guys are waiting for some magic like thing after your name in order to think you know it all, like a PhD, right? So everywhere you guys are waiting until you have that certain degree and then you can officially be a know-it-all, uncreate and delete all that. Everywhere you're waiting to have the perfect plan and once you have the perfect plan in place, only then can you take action. Instead of seeing that life is never perfect, you just take action and everything unfolds from there. Okay, so everything is unlimited possibility. Just take one action that feels kind of light and follow that through. And everything in the way of that, uncreate and delete it all. Remember, you can try on your future, right? You go into the future. "If I do this action, does it feel light?" And if it feels light, then do it. You know, and just try it on first before you do it. So everywhere you guys are afraid to try in the future and said want to pretend that you don't know and or put barriers against it, everything that is, delete all that. Okay, so what else are you guys procrastinating on? So anywhere else you guys are waiting to be the magic, okay, so everywhere you're waiting for magic instead of just being the magic, uncreate all that. All the barriers you guys have against you being the magical self that can change everything in an instant, everywhere you slowed yourself down to mimic time, everywhere you guys slowed yourself down to mimic time 'cause time has kind of slow, so everywhere you sold yourself down to mimic it, uncreate, delete across all time, dimension, space, and reality. Everywhere you guys are stuck in time waiting, uncreate and delete all that. Everywhere you guys don't have a future because you're in the past waiting for something, uncreate and delete all the things you're waiting for. Anywhere you put waiting into your future, uncreate and delete all that. "To sit around and wonder why I'm waiting, and I can't get out of it." Okay, so if you wonder why you're waiting, then you're always going to stay in waiting. What if instead, Monica, you sat around wondering what action you should take, because I bet you'd start focusing on the action and then you'd get out of it. Okay, so everywhere you're stuck in waiting instead of focused on action, everything that is, uncreate it all. Everywhere you feel like you have to punish yourself and stay in something you don't like, like it could be a marriage, it could be a partnership, it could be a business, it could be a job. Everywhere you guys have to wait and punish yourself instead of like saying, "Screw this. I'm going to get over it and figure out how to change my life." So everywhere you're punishing yourself staying there, uncreate and delete it all. Everywhere you think you deserve it, delete it all. Everything you can't find a new job, a new life, a new marriage, a new mate, like whatever the new thing is that you want, I'm only saying that 'cause Sarah's wanting something new, okay, so everywhere you guys won't let yourself have the new thing that you truly, truly, truly, truly want, everything that is, uncreate, delete, and destroy across all time, dimension, space, and reality, across all the core decisions where you made it. Okay, everywhere you're going to block yourself no matter what we do, uncreate and delete all that. Everywhere you're waiting for the right choice to appear instead of going with your gut, everywhere you guys are trying to be logical and normal and human, everything that is, uncreate, delete it all. Everywhere you guys are trying to be normal and human instead of infinite and try it on and be magical, okay, everything that is, uncreate and delete it all. Everywhere you guys are trying to be stupid humans and slow yourself down and have despair, if it's of drama and pain and shame, okay, everywhere that's your model of human, uncreate and delete it all. Everywhere you're afraid of your infinite capacity to love yourself, take action and move forward, everywhere you're afraid you're not going to get love if you move forward, delete, uncreate, and destroy all that. Everywhere you're afraid your money isn't going to show up if you move forward, uncreate, delete, and destroy all that. Everywhere you're cutting yourself off from the flow of self love, everywhere you don't love yourself, uncreate and delete all that. Everywhere you don't mind yourself but you don't love yourself, uncreate and delete all that. Okay, meaning everywhere you're waiting to feel better and truly inspired instead of just taking action and then the action's going to unwind everything, right? See, if I'm everywhere stuck, what I just do is I just take some action because taking the action kind of unwinds me. So everywhere you're waiting for a certain feeling to happen instead of just taking action anyway, uncreate and delete all that across all time, dimension, space, reality. Everywhere you're feelings are hurt in the past and you can't get over it, uncreate and delete all that. And everywhere you feel still like a victim, uncreate and delete all that across all time, dimension, space, reality. Why is this easier for you guys to wait? So why is it easier for you guys to wait? You're waiting for it to happen because it will only happen if it's out of your hands. Okay, so everywhere you're waiting for it to happen 'cause it's only will happen if you don't control it, delete all that. Everywhere you're waiting where you think it's all too late, uncreate, delete, destroy all that across all time, dimension, space, reality. Everywhere you're always unguard, uncreate, delete, and destroy across all time, dimension, space, reality. Everywhere it seems difficult to feel into the future, everywhere you don't want to know the future, everywhere you have barriers against knowing the future 'cause you might have to take action, everything that is, uncreate all that across all time, dimension, space, reality. Everywhere it's easier to not be loved versus being loved, okay, everywhere it's easier to not be loved because for some of you it's easier to not be loved, uncreate, delete, and destroy the whole thing. Okay, everywhere you feel like you're holding your breath, anxious to see what happens next, everything that is, uncreate and delete all that. Everywhere you're afraid of failure and taking action would equal, "I'm going to fail immediately," so everywhere action equals failure, so you're a loser right off the gate, uncreate, delete across all time, dimension, space, reality. Everywhere you're told that you have to wait or your parents said, "No, you can't." "No, you shouldn't." "No, you couldn't." "No, no, no, no, no, no." "Just wait, just wait." "You're too much." "You're too this, you're too that." "You're too wrong, you're too right." "You're too tall, you're too short." "You're too this, please wait." Everything that is, uncreate it all. Everywhere you were told to keep your hands to yourself, uncreate and delete all that. Everywhere you're told that you're no good, delete all that. Everywhere if you were told that you're fearful or anxious, that you're bad or wrong, everywhere being creative equals being mischievous, and therefore you're bad, everywhere you were told to sit still, uncreate all that. Everywhere you're paralyzed and stopped and can't, everywhere you're stuck in I can't, I shouldn't, I wouldn't, I couldn't, everywhere your parents told you you couldn't, everywhere life told you you couldn't, teachers told you you couldn't or you believed you couldn't, everywhere you took action it harmed people, everything that is, uncreate all that. Okay, everywhere you think you'll be brutalized for taking action, uncreate all that. Okay, everywhere you think life is brutal, uncreate all that. Everywhere you think you'll be decimated if you take action, delete all that. Everywhere you have no idea how to take action, everywhere it feels safer to not take action, delete all that. Everywhere the actions you take just put you deeper in a hole, everything that is, uncreate all that. All the brainwashing your parents gave you about taking actions, everything that is, uncreate it all. Everywhere if you're a male, you can't take action, and if you're a female, you can't take action. If you're a female, you're weak. You know, whatever the stereotypes of women are, right? Okay, so all those things, uncreate, delete it all. All the stereotypes of men, that men don't ask for directions, men have no clue, any of those stereotypes you guys are playing out, uncreate and delete it all. Any of the family's stereotypes you're playing out, uncreate and delete it all. Any of the family group agreements that you're bound to, like all of the contracts, oaths that you have with your families, uncreate and delete all those across all time, dimension, space, reality. Everywhere you feel like you're stuck and bound to your family and their ways instead of your own ways, everything that is, delete all that. Okay, when did you give up hope that something could be different? When did you guys give up hope? Okay, so everything that is, yes, everything that is, uncreate and delete it all across all time, dimension, space, reality. Anywhere you guys gave up hope. You know, I was told that one of the worst things I could ever do to a client, which of course I never do, but I've seen other psychics do this, is take away their hope. Because you take away somebody's hope, they have nothing else to go for, right? So that's why I really truly believe that we're infinite beings who can create our future. And you know, your future is not set in stone. You change it. So everywhere you guys gave up hope or let somebody take away your hope or talk to yourself out of hope or clearly don't believe that there is any hope, uncreate and delete all of that across all time, dimension, space, reality. Anywhere you guys are hopeless, uncreate and delete all that. Anywhere you think that if you have hope, it'll steer you wrong, uncreate and delete all that. Everywhere you guys are depressed and stop yourself because you think that you have to stop yourself if you feel a feeling that feels a little negative, which is not true, by the way. You can take action even if you feel negative. So everything that is, uncreate and delete it all. Everywhere you have to feel a hundred percent good before you take action, delete all that. Okay, that feels better you guys. Okay, that you're quibbly if that I don't have any action. So everywhere you don't have action within your energy field, uncreate all that. So what would it take for you guys to take massive action? What would it take for you guys to take action in spite of what's going on in your life? Yes, what would it take for you guys to take action even if you're hurt and traumatized anyway, right? What would it take for you to take action knowing that there's something better at the other side of the road? So everything the way of you taking action no matter how you're feeling, everything that is, uncreate and delete it all. So everywhere you guys didn't feel safe, right or good or loved, uncreate and delete it all. Everywhere you have poison in you because you somehow believe that you're not lovable, delete all that across all time, dimension, space, reality. Everywhere you hate being lovable 'cause it's not normal, everything that is, uncreate and delete it all. Everywhere you don't want to be loved, cared for, nurtured, kind to yourself, or take action, even if it makes you the most amazing being on the planet and you won't do it because you don't think that somebody would approve, so everything that is, uncreate, delete it all across all time, dimension, space, reality. How many of you are waiting for somebody's approval? Somebody's go ahead. Somebody's thumbs up before you take action. Everyone that's doing that, uncreate, delete it all across all time, dimension, space, reality. Everywhere you get exhausted, "If I take action, it will impact others." Yeah, carry it for sure will. But what if everybody around you is waiting for you to get so deliciously happy so that you become the invitation that allows their doors to open and they become happy, right? What if everybody around you is waiting for you to be brave enough to take a stand and to take some sort of really cool action and get a happy life so that they can be happy with you. Okay, so everywhere you're stopping yourself 'cause you're waiting for approval at first instead of just going and getting massively happy, taking massive action and straightening out your whole life, so everything in the way of that, uncreate all that. Okay, everywhere you are not a well-woman and everywhere you're waiting for acceptance from your family, your spouse, your career, you know, people that you work with, everything that is, uncreate and delete it all. You know what, Sarah? You're saying, "I never fit in." Do you want to know the real truth? The real truth is most lightworkers never feel like they fit in because the real truth is of lightworkers are here to kind of break up all the barriers and all the dysfunction on the planet. So you can't really fit in and you'll never fit in because your job is actually just to blow it up. Okay? What if everybody on this call, what if your main job in the world, the main purpose of your whole life is to really just to clear all the dysfunction, be an example, light up your world, get totally and completely happy, and raise the vibration of everybody around you. And in order to do that, if you really think about it, you can't really fit in. You have to be above the crowd, better than the crowd, and not sink to the crowd, right? So everywhere you guys are trying to be normal instead of just being yourself. Right? Okay, all right. So everything that is, everywhere you can't just be the lightworker being that you really are, and you're stopping yourself and fighting it and pretending that you're not it and you're lying to yourself by the way, and everybody around you, uncreate and delete it all. Everywhere you're pretending to be normal when you're truly authentically, if you ever really step into your power, you probably pissed off a lot of people. Like you will basically destroy their myths about you, right? You're going to hurt whatever myths they have about you. You're going to ruin it all if you go get happy. So everywhere you are afraid to blow up everybody's story about you and just go to get deliciously happy, wealthy, abundant, alive, and well, everything that is, uncreate it all. Everywhere you're creating dysfunction so you can fit in, uncreate and delete all that. All right, I mean, seriously, I mean, you guys really get that you're totally weird and never fit in, right? If you guys don't really get that, if you get anything out of this phone call, you know, yep, okay. So everywhere you guys are still trying to fit in, uncreate all of that. 'Cause the only one who has more answers than you is nobody, okay? You're the only person in your whole world that can see all of you, okay? And you know what? So nobody else's opinion really matters, right? You connect to the light that's more powerful than any other person, place or thing in your whole world. So what else is stopping you? Anything else? Okay, any other deep loneliness, or you, anywhere you're stopping yourself in any silly reason why you're doing that, uncreate and delete it all. Anywhere you like stopping yourself 'cause it's kind of fun like a little kid, like, "Whoo, look, I stopped myself." Okay, so everything that is, uncreate and delete it all. Everywhere you're punishing yourself by making yourself so wrong and so pathetic so you can fit in like everybody else, okay, everything that is, uncreate it all across all time, dimension, space, reality. Everywhere you're still grinding things, everywhere you're taking away other people's negativity, everywhere you're waiting for people to give you the permission to like "Go, be fabulous," everything that is, uncreate and delete it all. So if you guys are waiting for permission to be fabulous, I hereby give you permission. Everything in the way of you just start going and doing it, uncreate, delete it all. All right, everywhere you want to be normal. "I'm sorry, can't be normal." Okay, you can't be normal and really be happy. I'm telling you the truth. You really won't. You'll just make yourself miserable. So again, everywhere you want to be normal, uncreate and delete all that. What if your real job on the planet is to make everybody else miserable by being so happy? What if that's your job? Your job is to raise your vibration so much that you make everybody around you so fricking miserable 'cause you're willing to change and they stay stuck. Okay, so everything that is, uncreate it all. Okay, so now of course, as you know, I don't want you to make everybody else miserable. But I just want you guys to just get that sometimes you're going to have to go make some people miserable in order to go get happy. And what if your life is more important than their opinion? Yes. And what if you go get happy and then they say, "Oh, I was wrong. I want to do her flavor. I don't want to do my flavor." Okay, so maybe you getting happy creates the permission slip for them, to open the door for them to go get happy. So everywhere you're not willing to be like that much of a catalyzer, okay, delete all that across all time, dimension, space, and reality. You guys are great. Any other thing that you guys are stuck in that you want to let go of now. Imagine bringing in a whole bomb of light that just kind of come straight from the light. It's a big sparkler, just comes in and blows up everything in your reality, holding you back. Ask the sparkle of light to go straight in front of you into the future in all directions and time, blowing up anything that you put in your future that stops you. Okay, asking for pure consciousness to put all the light and love inside you, inside the future, inside every part of your life, inside your money, inside your bank accounts, inside your family, inside your work, inside your home. Yes. Filling everything up with total consciousness. Asking everything in your life to shift up to the energy field of miracle. Asking everything in your life to upgrade into the energy of taking action to make yourself happy. Asking all the energy in your life to upgrade to, "I love myself enough to take massive action, get really happy, thrilled with my life, powerful on purpose." And everything the way of that, delete it all. Okay. You guys let go lots of really deep stuff today. Okay, so do you guys mind doing one more poll? We're going to do a poll. Okay, so I want to know, have you guys taken some form of massive action on this journey? All right, so most of you, okay, so the 24% of you that did not take massive action, I'm just going to ask you to please, please, please, check inside and just find the one little thing that you can do that will just rock your world. You know, maybe it's just like really finding out what your numbers are. Maybe it's having a plan for paying off credit card debt. Maybe it's manifesting a really cool job that you love that makes you a lot of money, right? Whatever that is, okay, just decide for yourself, "I'm going to take some massive action." Now, this is in the past 'cause we blew it up. But I am curious if you guys find yourself procrastinating. Okay, a lot of you. Okay, what if you're procrastinating 'cause you're bored. And what if you went and took massive action, got really happy and unbored yourself. So everywhere you guys are bored and stopping yourself, everything that is, uncreate and delete it all. In a scale of one to five, five meaning, "I love to take action," where are you at? Okay, this is good. Kind of all around the bored. But you guys are getting better. I love it. So anyone of you that's lower than you wanted, all the energy where you guys are lower than what you truly, truly, truly, truly wanted, everything that is, uncreate and delete it all. Everywhere you're afraid to take massive action because you actually might stand out and be fun, have a life, everything that is, delete it all. Okay, so everywhere you guys are avoiding taking financial responsibility, everything that is, uncreate, delete, and destroy all of it. Okay, are you ready to take massive action in your finances, and everything in the way of that, uncreate, delete, destroy it all across all time, across all dimensions, across all space, across all reality. Anybody listening who's kind of checked out and still doesn't want to take action and is pretending they do but they don't, uncreate, delete, and destroy all of it. Anyone else that's holding onto things that they regret so they won't let themselves off the hook and move forward, uncreate and delete it all. And everyone who just doesn't believe they can take action, everything that is, uncreate it all. Everywhere you don't have enough time, delete it all. Remember, we went through this whole two steps. Just take two massive steps. Whatever that is for you. This week, what would it take to take massive action and upgrade my finances permanently? What would it take for me to do what's needed to take action? What would it take universe to deliver to me the no excuses and making things happen? Program, right? What vibrational energy can bring me more than enough take action and energy? Okay, so home play. 30 to 40 times a day. Can be all at one time. Say, "What vibrational energy can I become to align with taking massive action steps creating my future abundance." What would it take for you guys to take massive action steps creating your financial abundance? Okay, you can fill in your journal right here. It'd be really cool if you guys post some things on Facebook. Let everybody know how happy you are and your life's changing. You know, when Jane was asking you a question, does it count to take massive action for something that would just be fun? Yes. Because sometimes you need your energy to be fun. It doesn't just have to be money or business-related, right? Like I am planning a vacation. Why am I planning a vacation? Because I need it. I need to be filled with joy. So, yeah. So for sure, Jane, massive action, yeah. Okay, I want to clear something. Katia said, "I'm never bored. Usually, I have more than having too many things to do." 'Cause I want to clear something. Everywhere you guys create problems because you're bored, because sometimes we create problems as distraction so we don't ever get bored or empty. So everything that is, uncreate it all. And everywhere you guys are still stuck in time, like making time slow down so you don't have enough of it. So every one of you guys who said, "I don't have enough time," we're going to change that right now. So everywhere you don't have enough time, uncreate and delete it all. And we're going to put the energy of, "Time works for me," and "Everything works for me regarding time." "I have more than enough time," would be the new statement. So I have more than enough time to take all the actions in the world. And everything in the way of it, delete it all. I have more than enough time to take actions. Whoo, okay, this is exciting. You guys did a lot of deep work here. All right, you guys are awesome. I love you so much for showing up and taking care of yourself here. Okay, love you much, bye.

Asking the light to come in, clearing your solar plexus of any fear of moving forward. Any fear of doing your taxes, doing your paperwork, doing your accounting, knowing your numbers, asking the light to come through into your stomach area, clearing any place you're rooted in some old energy, some old antagonism, some old fear, some old frustration, some old vibrations, keeping you blocked, stopped, and avoiding things. Asking the light to come through your legs, your feet into the center of the planet, connecting to the place in the center of the planet where it's purely conscious. Asking this pure conscious energy to bounce back up into your body, into the center of your heart so you're connected from above and below, vibrating out like a big central sunshine, 360 degrees all the way around. Asking the light to expand around your body, allowing pure consciousness to fill your whole energy field. Asking this light of pure consciousness to fill the whole building you're in. Asking this light of pure consciousness to expand out past the city you're in. Asking this light of pure consciousness to expand out past the county you're in. Asking this light of pure consciousness to expand out past the state you're in. Asking this pure light of consciousness to include your family members that you want to bless today and include them in the energy. Okay, ask this light to expand out past the country you're in. And ask this light to expand out past the earth. Okay, now you're connected to the higher part of you, the larger part of you that's connected to oneness, that knows how to clear everything and make everything right in your life in a miraculous, quick, easy, fun, joyful, amazing way. Everything in the way of you allowing a miracle to occur in your life? Uncreate, delete, endy story. I'm scared I'm doing it wrong. Fear. stuck in rebellion. If I don't do anything, then people can't say anything negative about me. Okay, so all those things and everything they're connected to, please uncreate, delete, destroy them all across all time, dimension, space, reality, across all soul choices. Oh, awesome. Okay, fear of the unknown, safety in the known. Okay, so everywhere you're more comfortable in the known, unknown, uncreate, delete, and destroy it, even though the unknown could have more potential, right? Everywhere you're afraid of the more potential solution, uncreate, delete, and destroy across all time, dimensions, space, reality. Everywhere you have a fear of not being able to deliver, uncreate, delete, and destroy. And everywhere you're afraid the universe won't deliver it for you. Everything that is, uncreate, delete, and destroy across all time, dimensions, space, reality. Yes, you guys are doing that. You're like really clearing fast tonight. That's great. It's ready to go. Fear of not having enough time, not my department. Like I guess that the emotional decision is it's not your thing. Whatever that is, uncreate, delete, and destroy it across all time dimensions, space reality, across all inner choices that you've made that keep any of this locked in place. Everywhere you don't know what to do, feeling the fear, choosing not to be sure of exactly what to do. So everywhere you're fearing what to do, everything that is, uncreate, delete, and destroy. I don't even know. I just feel confusion. Okay, so everywhere you're alone in this world and you have nothing to anchor into that feels real to you. Everything that is, uncreate, delete, and destroy. Everywhere you're just feeling confused. So anywhere you guys feel violated by the universe, you know that the universe doesn't support you, won't take care of you, and you just feel a general fear and panic that the universe won't take care of you. Okay, everything that is, uncreate, delete, and destroy it all. Everywhere you're just tired of this planet and everything on it and all the people and the things you have to deal with, uncreate, delete, and destroy. Everywhere you're afraid of choosing the wrong path, everywhere you make indecision the choice, uncreate, delete, and destroy across all time, dimensions, space, reality.

So everywhere you're blocked and taking one really massive step, everything that is, uncreate, delete, and destroy it. Okay, everywhere you have no idea what your finances are or how to pay them, uncreate, delete, and do story at all. Everywhere you're afraid so you don't want to look or be aware.

And everything in the way of that, uncreate, delete it. Everywhere you feel trapped, like now that you're totally aware that you're trapped and now you still don't know what to do. Uncreate, delete, and destroy it. Everywhere you're unwilling to have an action plan of how to get out of your trap, uncreate, delete, and destroy it all. Because the way out of a trap is just take the first step you can. And maybe the first step is asking somebody for help, right? Or maybe the second step is getting a new job, whatever that is, so you can bring in more income and then you can start solidifying your new path for yourself. So everywhere you're stuck in what the next step is, uncreate, delete, and destroy it all. And everywhere you don't like it, uncreate, delete, and destroy it all. Okay, cool.

LESSON 15: Clearing Blame to Take Back Your Power

- Hey, this is Christie Marie Sheldon, and you're listening to a recording I did of a series of twenty-four live group sessions on clearing abundance blocks, and here's what we're covering today in Session Number fifteen. First up, The Blame Game. If you're placing blame, you're giving away your power. So inside yourself, is it the government's fault, your parents' fault, your mate's fault, your fault? Whose fault is it anyway? So today we're going to talk about why you do that, how you do that, and why you shouldn't blame anymore. Let's clear it out. Also, responsibility, shamonsability. How does it bend your reality? We'll also talk about shame and why it's a little weed that can grow and fester. And we're also covering some of the best selling inner sabotage programs that you've bought and sold to yourself. And we're going to cover the secret energy of money. So let's begin. Today's exciting. Hey, Christie here. How are you? Today is so exciting. Today is day 15, and we are going to talk about the blame game. A lot of energy that's going to move today, so if you have a piece of paper or a journal, it'd be great, 'cause you can write some notes down and clear some of the things that come up on your own as well as in the class, Let's open up to something new and exciting showing up in your life, and let's in set the intent on what you hope to achieve today. So whatever that is, whatever you would like to shift in your life regarding your abundance, what would it take for the group energy to facilitate you into something new and different and better than you've ever expected, exceeds all your expectations, and makes you super duper proud of yourself? And let's bring to the forefront anything you want to release, and let's journey together. Okay, inspiring stories. Let me read a couple of these for you today. They're really exciting, some profound shifts for people. Katia, she started her journey. Now, I love Katia's story because a lot of people are kind of in the same situation where she was, overwhelmed and not sure what to do. Katia started her journey. She was dealing with a huge financial mess, a backlog of taxes, too expensive mortgage, no help, a stagnant private practice, and a cluttered and unorganized home. Her journey has brought her long needed change and unexpected abundance. First, she asked, what would it take to get some help? Within days she received an email from a woman she met last year seeking part-time work while she attended college. So Katia hired her after the phone call, and in the first week they revamped her resume, filled out and filed paperwork for a mortgage modification. She said it was hundreds of pages of stuff she had to do. So this will save her $70,000. Okay, $70,000 on a mortgage remodification. The next week, she asked to get her back taxes handled. Two days later, her accountant, who had been avoiding the work for more than a year, called her and told her that he was able in the last few days to get her 2008, 2009 and 2010 taxes done, and she was to receive a $5,000 return. So, because she put awareness on unlimited abundance and finances, and what would it take to get these things handled, the universe responded. Her accountant basically picked up the energetic, etheric telephone and got on the download and handled her stuff without her having to call him. Then she asked, what would it take to get the house cleaned and organized? Within days an old friend, she said, who's a little obsessive compulsive, so OCD, came to visit. She helped Katia work for two days straight, leaving her with a clean, organized home, all the paperwork filed, no cost, $0. Then Katia wanted to get rid of some of her furniture, so she got rid of it, her and her friend used Craigslist and found her a $2,000 sofa. She researched how much it would cost new. She said it was $2,000. She got it for 50 bucks. And she got a really great, almost brand new chair for free. And then she asked, what would it take to get a new client? The very next week she got a referral from a work colleague, signed a new client for an additional $600 a month. So again that $7,700 over the year. So I don't know if you add all that up, that's priceless pretty much, but it's about $82,000 plus a worth of stuff that happened for her since starting the unlimited abundance journey. So good job. Herb wrote telling me that he is at a crucial point in his life, thrilled about the spiritual growth. For some people, when they signed up for unlimited abundance journey, they didn't want like their whole life to change. They just wanted, you know, one thing, something spiritual part of their life, whatever it is, peace of mind, learning tools and spirituality, things like that. But as soon as he signed up for unlimited abundance journey, he said, within a few weeks he manifested an extra $40,000. He says the clearing exercises have concretely changed the way his memories affect him. So if he hears an old song from the past or a phrase or something in the past, he would think, oh, that reminds me of blah, blah, blah. And it could have been a negative event. And he said, now it seems like all those things have fallen away. And now he just thinks, wow, that's cool in a fond way. He says, he's not so emotionally attached to the darkness of it all, you know? He says, even though the times were difficult, he now can see them and look at them as a privilege to have the experience and learn from it. So for him, that's huge. It's a whole framework change. He said, he's had more suppliers calling him at work, offering him sales opportunities. He knows how to identify heavy energy and avoid its affects. He no longer feels buffered by anger, fear and depression. He says, it's tested every day, but it bounces off and he's really clarified for himself what the higher vibrations and focused intentions can do in his world. So congratulations Herb. Today, we are going to work on the energy of blame. And blame and shame are sometimes tied together. I want you to think for a minute, remember the scale of consciousness, zero to a thousand, a thousand being enlightened and the lowest energy was shame, right? Shame was 20. Guilt was 30. Fear was a hundred, anger one fifty, love 500, joy 540 and peace 600. Okay? So all these energies of blame and shame are linked together. Now, let's look at your life for a minute and looking at the patterns that attracted the undesired elements into your life. If you blame something like an outside influence for what's creating the issue, then you are not looking at the pattern that created the problem in the first place, right? So if we say, oh, this didn't happen because of my spouse, or this didn't happen because of my parents, or this didn't happen because X, Y, Z, whatever that is, right? or I can't, whatever the blame is. Then you're taking your awareness and placing it onto something else. And then this energy becomes a lie because at the end of the day, whatever energy you're holding is what created whatever showed up in your life. So if you hold the energy towards another, then you're misidentifying the real cause. The real cause is that you and your pattern created it. So unless you take charge of exactly what created your problem, so you can't place it on something outside yourself as the problem, right? Then you can never solve it. So the lie holds the energy in place. So we're going to look at all the places where you think that it's like something else creating the problem, or we're going to look at all the places where you're really, really hard on yourself. Because we have to really get that the patterns are really the problem and your choices that allowed you to allow the pattern into your life is the problem. So total awareness, when we take our energy and we shifted into being willing to be aware of everything, can change any situation. So we're going to uncreate the exact cause of all the situations, which is a pattern you allowed into your life somewhere by your choice. We're going to work on these, that we're going to bring them all up. And then we're going to clear them along the way. And we're even going to clear everywhere you're just really hard on yourself, as well. If someone does something awful, which also affects me, does that mean my energy is responsible for creating it? Well, your energy is somehow responsible for allowing it into your life. Yes. Honestly, if I'm driving and somebody flips me off, let's just say, there's some part of my energy that somehow allowed that negativity into our life. And it could be, well, maybe I have an expectation belief or pattern that people will be mean to me. Or I have an expectation or pattern maybe for my child. Like if somebody was abused as a childhood and then really mean things happen to them later in life, they could have a pattern that exposed them to abuse and then abuse became normal in their field. So yeah. So somewhere, if you felt like abused or taken for granted or some part of that, or if you have a negative part where you self abuse, you abuse yourself. You're mean to yourself. Like that pattern will create other people being mean to you to basically answer your prayer of you being mean to you. Does that make sense? So if you're mean to you, then you have a pattern of, oh, I get to beat myself up and then it will create other people or things or events being mean to you. Ultimately you're responsible for the pattern. Now watch this. So let's just say, you're a kid. You're five years old. You watch, let's just say one of your parents blaming the other parent for all their problems. So later on you attract a spouse who does the same thing. So you would be saying, well, I'm not responsible for them, like, blaming me, but you kind of are because you have the pattern still in you. Do you understand? So that's what total self responsibility means, where you're just willing to be aware of all your patterns and then clear them. So that's really what self responsibility means. Jean's going, maybe you cut them off. Do you kind of see the, what the deal is? Your patterns? Now look, some people would say, well, I was a kid. I didn't know what I was doing. Well, that's true. You didn't know what you were doing. Or you might not have had tools to change the pattern, but that doesn't matter because you can't blame that, you still have to take responsibility for the pattern. Otherwise you'll never get free because you're always putting it off on something else. And you're not looking at what the real problem is, which is yourself and your pattern. We're going to just call up the energy. And we're going to just see what comes up for you guys. And we're going to clear it. Now this, this topic is kind of interesting because there's a lot of lies around this because sometimes people think, well, I'm not responsible for everything that happened to me. But unfortunately, because you're the creator of your world. I think I had it on the last slide. I should have let that show up here. Look at those. Are you the creator of only something? Or are you the creator of everything in your reality field, your bubble, all your thoughts, feelings, beliefs, choices, ideas, create your world. So you could be four years old, imprinting your mom and dad, but you still chose to take their energy in. Do you understand? Like nobody can really make you take their energy in. You somehow chose it or bought and sold it to yourself. So you're unfortunately still the creator of thing. I mean, otherwise, how would that work? If you're really the creator of only parts of your world? You have to create your whole world, right? Whatever you align with and attract and decide and choose to align with, that is what creates your world. So we're going to connect to the light. We're going to start clearing some of those, the debauchery that you guys had done to yourself, close your eyes, allow the light to come in, connect up 300 feet above your head, connecting to the pure source energy, which is really you. Do you understand? Pure source energy, pure light energy, 300 feet above you is still you connecting to the bigger part of you. And we're going to allow this light to come into your total awareness into your crown, into your head, opening up all your intuitive centers, all your awareness centers for full knowing. We're going to ask this light to come into your third eye, opening up so that you can see, sense and know everything about your life and these patterns. We're going to ask this light to come into your ears, opening up for true divine guidance. We're going to ask this light to come in, opening up your throat so that you can communicate whatever it is you need from the universe. So if you said, what would it take universe? The universe would open and hear your response. Okay. What would it take for this light to come into your heart, opening up the kindness and compassion in you? Yes. What would it take for the universe to open up the kindness and compassion in you? Okay, what would it take for this light to come into your solar plexus, where the nervous system is and just asking any place that you feel nervous, anxious, avoiding, fearful, not trusting to be uncreated, asking the light to come into your power center, opening up everywhere you don't trust your power authentically aligned with your true power. True power is just you feeling full of light, connected to your heart, being kind to you, allowing you to have anything you want. Okay? Or your life to look, how ever you need it. Asking the light to come into your roots so that you're grounded in a new reality of total responsibility. Clearing your patterns, opening up for new arrangements in your life. Asking the light to come into the center of the planet so that you're connected from above and below. Awesome. There's a really great place in the center of the planet. That's connected to pure source energy as well. So as above so below completely and totally connected to loving kindness. Compassion, joy, peace of mind. Yes. Ask this light from the center of the planet to bounce back up, up straight into your heart so that you have a big glow ball of energy, 360 degrees all the way around, coming geeming out of your heart. Filling your whole field with the energy of pure love. Asking this pure love energy to expand outside you. Asking this pure love energy, this pure light energy to expand bigger than your house. Asking this pure light energy to expand bigger than your city. Asking those pure light energy to expand bigger than your state. Asking this pure light energy to expand bigger than your country, asking this pure light energy to expand bigger than the planet. Asking you to just be connected to the oneness of it all. The bigger part of you, willing and able to release all the things that are a problem in your life. Great. So I pushed some buttons when I said you guys were totally responsible for yourself. Do you guys feel that? Some of you got pissed. So everywhere you guys got mad about the whole thing, everything that is uncreate, delete and de-story it. Everywhere you guys are afraid to recognize that you somehow, accidentally, you might not have meant to all the way. Okay? But somewhere you still accidentally aligned with some patterns that you didn't really want to choose. Everything creating that uncreate, delete it all. Everywhere else you guys are mad that you created any of this stuff in your life. Everything that is uncreate, delete and de-story it all. Can blame and victim be dissimilar? Yes, Jean, for sure. And that is asking as higher beings, would we deliberately create troubling situations for ourselves as a lesson? Yes. Actually in that, that's actually true. If I could debunk the whole myth on the planet that we have to come down here and learn, that would be awesome. You know why? I want you to set this up for yourself, okay? So anywhere are you guys are board creators and that you want to create confusion, trauma, drama, forget that you know things, disable yourself and create a lot of problems so that you can learn new things, everything that is, will you uncreate, delete and de-story it all across all time, dimension, space, reality. What if you changed your mockup, you know, your reality field, to read, I just came here to have a lot of love and fun instead of a how to learn lessons. Because learning lessons uncreates more problems. So that's a really good awareness of that. So everything in the way of you guys just getting to the joy, fun part of your life, uncreate, delete, and de-story it all. When I visioned things, I have become aware that I visioned my abundance in the future and not in the now. And I feel like I need to clear that. Okay, so everywhere you guys are putting yourself into the future and not the now, uncreate, delete it all. Everywhere you think that you have to follow time in order to create something, that's the old way. Like the old way of creating things is work hard, go through time, work your tush off, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. Instead of just bopping in the manifestation that you really want into your reality field and watching it just show up in a couple within the next couple of months. Okay? So everywhere you guys are like putting it out in the future instead of now, everywhere, you don't feel like you're worthy of having it now, everywhere you're not worthy of a miracle, uncreate, delete and de-story it all across all time, dimension space and reality. Everywhere you're heavy in your chest and don't want to let yourself off the hooks, uncreate, delete and de-story. Any other karma and genetic stuff that you're holding in your bodies that's lowering your value in the world, uncreate, delete and de-story. Are you blaming someone or something for any credit card debt you guys might have? Now, if you don't have credit card debt, are you blaming anybody else for any debt you have or feel? it could be any debt, Okay? So we're just going to work on debt for a minute. Cause debt usually has a lot of guilt-shame attached to it. So are you blaming someone or something for your credit card debt, the government, your spouse, your parents, your job, your boss, anything? So everything creating a credit card debt or debt that's kind of heavy in your field, will you please uncreate, delete and de-story the whole thing across all time, Dimension space, reality. Anywhere else you guys are blaming or shaming yourself for having debt or credit card debt or being indebted to someone or something, will you please uncreate, delete and de-story it all across all time, dimension space, reality. Anywhere you guys have a huge shame over not being able to have a regular job like normal people are doing it the regular way, like, quote quote, normal people or being a starving artist or a spiritual person who can have no money.

Everywhere you have health problems creating your credit card, debt, uncreate, delete and de-story. Now, if you have health problems, I'm just going to ask you, I don't know everybody's situation, but I'm going to ask you what led up to the health problems? Like, stress, over work, some feelings about life that never got handled? So any of those things that are creating that created health issues, maybe the emotional causes of any health issues, will you please uncreate, delete, and de-story all those across all time, dimension, space, reality. Any of you that are stuck, like you can't have the kind of work or job that you want, or the money coming in that you want uncreate, delete, and de-story across all time, dimension, space, reality.

I remember asking if I could go get a job because I wanted my own money. That was about 10, 11 years old. I remember playing with the money as soon as I got was given the money, I started playing with it. I smelled it. I loved it. And I couldn't wait to accumulate more of it.

Everything that is, uncreate, delete and de-story. Everywhere you guys are mad at yourself about money uncreate, delete, de-story across all time, dimension, space and reality. Let's make your energy a little bit bigger. You guys, okay? So we can really get through some of this. Yes. Thank you. Everywhere, you guys are mad at yourself for your lack of clarity and everywhere you guys are desperate for money and you don't know how to find it uncreate, delete, and de-story it all. Everywhere you guys are in the energy of finding it instead of having it; okay, I want you to think for a moment, what would it take for you guys to have money instead of find money? Can you see the energetic difference of that? Okay, so everything that is uncreate, delete and de-story it all. Everywhere your body is, won't let you shift into a new reality.

Okay, everywhere you're blaming parents, but you have to get that maybe they didn't have the tools as well, right? So how can you really blame people if they don't have tools and how can you really blame yourself if you don't have tools? What you just have to go is find somebody who has the tools or the techniques or the knowledge, and then duplicate it, right? So anywhere you guys are afraid of asking for financial abundance, financial attraction, maybe a guidance counselor, like a guy or a girl who will just sit down and really go over the numbers with you. Everywhere you guys are afraid to just ask for that kind of help. Will you please uncreate, delete and de-story it all? Anywhere you're afraid to just ask for somebody who's smarter than you, about money to help you. Maybe you have a friend who's really smart with money? Okay, everywhere you won't let them help you, uncreate, delete and de-story it all. Remember the story earlier today that she manifested her friend with OCD to help her clean up her place for free? So maybe there's somebody that could help you for free. Just get a handle on your money. Everything that is, uncreate, delete it all across all time, dimension, space and reality. Everywhere you have a partner who literally attacks and destroys you, everything that is, uncreate, delete and de-story it all. Anywhere, you keep aligning with their point of view instead of your own, because anywhere you are, you're aligning with what they think instead of what you think, uncreate, delete and de-story it all. Everywhere you never win anything, uncreate, delete and de-story it all. Everywhere you're a loser with money, uncreate, delete and de-story across all time, dimension, space, reality. Everywhere you can never be a winner 'cause you're a loser, uncreate, delete and de-story it all. Everywhere you're second best, third best, fourth best, fifth best, 10th best, loser, everything that is, uncreate, delete and de-story across all time, dimension, space, reality. Margaret, what would it take for you to be a winner? Everybody listening? What would it take for you guys to be a winner? What would it take for you to be number one? What would it would take for you to be the best money manager that ever existed? What would it take for you to like be a miracle worker and manifest money out of nowhere? What would it take for the best and brilliant idea to show up in your world to make you a hundred thousand 200,000, 500,000, 20,000, 40,000, a million? What would it take for some idea to just show up randomly and help you and catalyze you into the future? What would it take for all of your life to open up and exceed all your expectations? What would it take for the next part of your life to be so financially abundant that all your excuses just melt away. Let's see, everywhere you're resentful of whatever your spouse's doing with money, Everywhere you don't agree or align with your spouse's choices about money, uncreate, delete, and de-story it all. What would it take for you to go make so much money that it doesn't really matter what your spouse does or doesn't do. Everything in the way of that, uncreate, delete and de-story it all. What would it take for you guys to be so responsible for money and just make it on your own that it doesn't really matter what your parents or your spouse, your kids, anybody says or does, everything that is, uncreate, delete and de-story. Everywhere you don't think you can do that, uncreate, delete and de-story. Everywhere you're stuck in the mud about making a choice to take forward action about your money. Okay, when I make money, I'm taking money from others. I blame myself. Everything that is, uncreate, delete and de-story it all. Here's what finding money and having money is, okay? Now, you have to kind of do both, but let's just say this. Think about having money. Okay, so remember in the world of manifesting, whatever you think is true is true, like becomes true. So if you just walked around thinking, what would it take for me to have a hundred thousand dollars in the bank account? What would it take for me to have an extra 250,000 in the bank account? What would it take for me to have an extra 20 bucks show up in my life? What would it take to have, you know, X, Y, Z? Then you're in the energy of having, which is present time. Okay, now look at the energy of finding. What would it take for me to find now is kind of pushing it a little bit out in the future. I don't think it's totally wrong or totally bad. I think finding money is actually okay. But if you're only doing finding, instead of having, you always have to go find it instead of living in the energy of having it. So it goes back to this. So Oprah is willing to have money, but think of some other celebrities that are always having to find money, so they blow the money. So they have to go find some more. Whereas Oprah is willing to have money Like Donald Trump. He's great at finding money. You know what I mean, from other people. He's better in the later years about having money, but in the beginning, he doesn't always keep money. He goes bankrupt and stuff, right? Okay. So that's the difference. All right. So everywhere you guys are embarrassed about money, everything that is, uncreate and delete it all. Beth is saying, I'm seeing green, Aqua green, jewels and lights while you're doing all this clearing. What are you seeing? You're seeing your energy change and you're seeing some guides helping you, Beth. So you have some guides and a higher light beings, kind of helping you all. Everywhere you have to grovel for money, uncreate, delete all that. Are you in the red or the black? So if you're in the in the black, have you did a profit loss statement? Great. If you're on the red, what would it take for you to change that in everything in the way of that uncreate and delete it all? Do you have any future goals you think you can't reach and who are you blaming those on? uncreate, delete and de-story all the future goals that you don't think you can achieve, and everybody you're blaming that on, including divorce, the spouse, kids, government, taxes, boss, work. Okay, parents, any of those things, uncreate, delete and de-story it all. Anywhere you guys are shamed or afraid because you don't have the tools to move forward, uncreate, delete it all. So we talked in the last section about, you know, let's just say you want a better paying job. You know, what would it take for you to just play a game with yourself and say, Hey, I'm going to send out 30 resumes in the next six weeks and see if I can get a better paying job. That's the only five a week, right? Or maybe you can elicit the help of a friend. So what would it take for you guys to just send out 30 resumes and see if you can get a raise or a better paying job, or if you want to work less and make more, is there some sort of form of coaching that you can do for somebody else. Okay? But I want you to think for a moment about what it would be like for you guys to maybe coach somebody like, maybe you're a single mom and maybe you coach other single moms on like how to keep it all together, but you get paid for teaching them or coaching them. Or what if you're really good at weight loss? Like maybe you could teach people that, or maybe you're good at organizing. Maybe could coach people at that. Maybe there's like some other thing that you're really good at that you coach people at and get paid more money in less amount of time. Okay, so anywhere you guys are blocking yourself from receiving the benefits of what you know, and all the things that you could share with the world, everything that is, uncreate, delete and de-story it all. What would it take for the next five people that you talk to, like, maybe like, you're just talking to somebody random, a new person and you just say to yourself, what would it take for this person to pay me money and I help them do something? Okay? What would it take for this person to pay me money and I help them do something? What would it take for this person to pay me money and I help them do something? Okay, so there could be exchange of energy. All right, so who knows what could come from that? Everywhere manifesting cash, the money of energy and manifesting cash is not fun to you anymore. Everything you're blocking the fun of that, Will you please uncreate, delete and de-story it all. Everywhere you can't let yourself go learn something new and you know, make some cash and go coach somebody or go help somebody and be paid randomly off the side, different than your job. Everything that is, will you uncreate, delete and de-story all that. Okay, Sabrina is bringing up something really cool. She says, she's retired. Do you know how many retired people come to me? I have to fix their energy on that word. Because if you say retired, you're tiring yourself over and over again. You're "re" getting tired. So I would say Sabrina, I'm on a happy new adventure. Okay? So the whole next part of your life is a happy new adventure. All right? So everywhere you guys are quote quote, retiring yourself or retired, uncreate, delete and de-story it all. What would it take for you guys to be on a happy new adventure with money? Everything that is that doesn't allow that, will you uncreate, delete and de-story it all.

Everywhere you keep falling back into the old work and you don't have passion around it, everything that is, Jane, will you uncreate, delete and de-story it all? I hear because you don't think you can do something new and it could make you as much money. So everywhere you don't think you could have something new show up in your world that could make you as much money uncreate, delete at all. And everywhere your identity is tied up in the old way of making money on create deleted all. Everywhere you're programmed to see only one way to make money uncreate, delete and de-story it all. You know, I have more than one business. I actually don't just have one business. So everywhere you guys think you can only have one business at one time, uncreate, delete and de-story it all.

Everything that is, uncreate, religion, everything that is, uncreate, delete And de-story it all now. Everywhere God's to blame, uncreate, delete and de-story it all now. Everywhere you over-complicate things, instead of just focusing on one thing, that'll make you cash. So Ghana, I'm going to ask you to focus. Remember we did the one session on profit and only focusing on things that are profitable. So your homework is what would it take for me to be profitable in my life? What would it take for me to focus on something profitable? So profitable means it adds light and it adds money, you know? So you can have profitable exchanges with people, profitable money ventures, profit, profit, profit. Okay. So what would it take for you guys life to be profitable?

What would it take for the group energy to facilitate you into something new and different and better than you've ever expected exceeds all your expectations and makes you super duper proud of yourself. And let's bring to the forefront anything you want to release and let's journey together. So we're going to connect to the light. We're going to start clearing some of the debauchery that you guys have done to yourself. Close your eyes. Allow the light to come in. Connect up 300 feet above your head, connecting to the pure source energy, which is really you. Do you understand? Pure source energy, pure light energy, 300 feet above you is still you connecting to the bigger part of you. And we're going to allow this light to come into your total awareness, into your crown, into your head, opening up all your intuitive centers, all your awareness centers for full knowing. We're going to ask this light to come into your third eye, opening up so that you can see, sense, and know everything about your life in these patterns. We're going to ask this light to come into your ears, opening up for true divine guidance. We're going to ask this light to come in opening up your throat so that you can communicate whatever it is you need from the universe. So if you said, what would it take, universe? The universe would open and hear your response. Okay, what would it take for this light to come into your heart, opening up the kindness and compassion in you? Yes, what would it take for the universe to open up the kindness and compassion in you? Okay, what would it take for this light to come into your solar plexus where the nervous system is and just asking any place that you feel nervous, anxious, avoiding? fearful, not trusting to be uncreated, asking the light to come into your power center, opening up everywhere you don't trust your power, authentically aligned with your true power. True power is just you feeling full of light, connected to your heart, being kind to you, allowing you to have anything you want, okay? Or your life to look however you need it. Asking the light to come into your roots so that you're grounded in a new reality of total responsibility, clearing your patterns, opening up for new arrangements in your life. Asking the light to come into the center of the planet so that you're connected from above and below. Awesome. There's a really great place in the center of the planet that's connected to pure source energy as well. So as above, so below, completely and totally connected to loving kindness. compassion joy peace of mind yes ask this light from the center of the planet to bounce back up straight into your heart so that you have a big glow ball of energy 360 degrees all the way around coming beaming out of your heart filling your whole field with the energy of pure love asking this pure love energy to expand outside you Asking this pure love energy, this pure light energy to expand bigger than your house. Asking this pure light energy to expand bigger than your city. Asking this pure light energy to expand bigger than your state. Asking this pure light energy to expand bigger than your country. Asking this pure light energy to expand bigger than the planet. asking you to just be connected to the oneness of it all, the bigger part of you, willing and able to release all the things that are a problem in your life. Great. So I pushed some buttons when I said you guys were totally responsible for yourself. Do you guys feel that? Some of you got pissed. So everywhere you guys got mad about the whole thing, everything that is, uncreate, delete, and destroy it. Everywhere you guys are afraid to recognize that you somehow accidentally, you might not have meant to all the way, okay, but somewhere you still accidentally aligned with some patterns that you didn't really want to choose. Everything creating that, uncreate, delete it all. Everywhere else, you guys are mad that you created any of this stuff in your life. Everything that is, uncreate, delete, and destroy it all. So anywhere you guys are bored creators and that you want to create confusion, trauma, drama, forget that you know things, disable yourself and create a lot of problems so that you can learn new things, everything that is will you uncreate, delete, and destroy it all across all time, dimensions, space, reality. So everything in the way of you guys just getting to the joy, fun part of your life, uncreate, delete, and destroy it all. When I vision things, I have become aware that I vision my abundance in the future and not in the now. And I feel like I need to clear that. Okay, so everywhere you guys are putting your stuff into the future and not the now, uncreate, delete it all. Everywhere you think that you have to follow time in order to create something, that's the old way. Like the old way of creating things is work hard, go through time, work your tush off. Okay, so everywhere you guys are like putting it out in the future instead of now, everywhere you don't feel like you're worthy of having it now, everywhere you're not worthy of a miracle, uncreate, delete, and destroy it all across all time, dimension, space, and reality. Everywhere you're heavy in your chest and don't want to let yourself off the hooks, uncreate, delete, and destroy. Any other karma and genetic stuff that you're holding in your body that's lowering your value in the world, uncreate, delete, and destroy.

It could be any debt, okay? So we're just going to work on debt for a minute because debt usually has a lot of guilt shame attached to it. So are you blaming someone or something for your credit card debt? The government, your spouse, your parents, your job, your boss, anything? So everything creating credit card debt or debt.

====================

LESSON 16: Discover the Ultimate You

- Hey, this is Christie Marie Sheldon, and you're listening to a recording I did of a series of 24 live group sessions on clearing your abundance blocks. And here's what we're covering today in Session 16. First, I'm going to introduce you to you, the real you, your energetic model self. This is the person who can tell you and show you how to create the happy future you want. You'll discover the characteristics of your true self and unlock all the skills he or she has. We're basically creating the luckiest version of yourself. I'm also going to teach you how to access and open your heart to the new life forming inside you, which will allow you to ask your new energetic model self anything you want and get the answer. So, let's begin. Hey, this is Christie. How are you today? Wow, it is an exciting day today. We are going to talk about inventing yourself and what that would be like for you if you could invent yourself into the happy, prosperous life that you're choosing in the future. Grab a journal, piece of paper, so that anything that comes up for you that you notice that you have a little resistance reaction to, you can also work on a little extra for yourself. Let's be open to some love, fun, and change. Let's take a moment and let's set an intent for what you hope to have happen today. Any of you that really want to go to the next level or you feel like you have some patterns that still are a little annoying to you, whatever those are, let's set an intent that those change today no matter what. Whatever awareness you need, whatever information you need, whatever shazam you need to make it go away, ask that to show up. All right. Whatever energy that you want to release, bring that up, too, and let's journey together. My favorite part of the day, let's celebrate your inspirational story. And for those of you listening, I'm going to ask you to just say along with me here, what would it take for your inspirational story to show up exceeding all your expectations better than you could ever hope to achieve? Okay, and everything in the way of that, will you uncreate, delete, and de-story the whole thing? Okay, inspirational story number one. Amy had a few really cool things happen for her. She manifested about $11,000, and here's how. Now, this is cool. If you guys remember Sunday, we did all about blaming. This is why this is one of my favorite stories. Amy was going through a difficult divorce and financial situation, and after Sunday's session, she was determined to do two things. She said, what would it take to stop blaming her ex-husband for the handling of the money and what would it take for them to find more harmony as they go through the process? She's trying to take self-responsibility and quit all the blaming, right? And from the beginning of the Unlimited Abundance Journey, she's been asking, what would it take to get $10,000? She met with her husband the next day after Sunday, so that'd be Monday. They had a good meeting with no fighting and he brought great news. The CPA had just finished their taxes for 2010, and instead of owing $30,000 like they'd both feared, they're getting a $4,000 tax return from the IRS, 2000 from the state, and they got a refund of more than $4,000 from workman's comp insurance. That's more than $10,000, the exact amount she'd been asking for. All right, I love it! And she said, "Wow, yippee, and yahoo!" at the end. "Thank you to everyone who, on the call," all of you, she was thanking all of you guys for supporting her. Manifesting for Julia G. She just wrote to tell me that she's been asking, what would it take to earn extra income in July, and her income increased by $2,000. Now, think of how cool that is. I mean, you're just doing a simple phrase with intention, right? And it just magically shows up. She says she felt like she worked less, even, but the manifesting didn't stop there. She was looking for some gifts and was able to buy four Armani watches valued at $700 each for 30 bucks each. And so, she said that was a savings of $2,680. She looks at it like she manifested more than $4,500. So, good job, Julia. All right, this is awesome. Again, what would it take for everybody listening to manifest that kind of bright light into your life as well? Okay, Chris is saying: All I can say is I'm living a new story. When I go out and feeling as if all the energy is against me and I don't fit in, I send people sensing my energy high vibes instead of the dark vibes I was stuck in. Money is definitely freeing up. I have some more belief patterns to delete and replace, but it feels like it's on the way. Awesome. We are going to work on the invention of you. I've used this term, it's called identity structures. It's just what my guides have showed me that we all identify with things. Like, if we're a mom, we have these identity structures called mom. If we're a husband, we have these identity structures called husband. And with these identity structures cause all these definitions and thoughtforms of what that makes you. It's like these rules that all of a sudden you're bound to because you call yourself a son, a father, a husband, a wife, a girlfriend, a mate, a mom, all those things. And what happens is when you're doing some of the delete, uncreate, de-story, what you might notice for some of you is that these things start falling away. Now, for some people, it feels a little weird, 'cause it's like they feel like they're losing their quote-unquote identity, right? And in a way, that's good, because it means that you're allowing for something new to show up. I really, I've pretty much lost every way in which I identify myself in the world. But the thing is, is what's so cool about it is it allows me to reinvent myself and show up however I really need to show up for everybody, or myself, right? So, when I walk into a room, I just literally ask my energy to be that which I need in order to make my life really great. And then I just be that energy. It sounds weird, but then I don't have all these rule sets of how I'm supposed to act or what I'm supposed to be or what I'm supposed to bring to the table. All those things aren't in the way of me just showing up how I need to, which therefore allows my life to perfectly unfold in really miraculous, abundant, lovely ways. We're going to fill you in a little bit. We're going to basically clear some of the things that you identify yourself as and move you into the invention of yourself in the new life, 'cause of what some of your blocks are is you guys are identified with the past part of you and how everybody else sees you in the world, and we have to move you into the new part of you. Because basically, if you're being the new you, which is really the authentic happiest version of yourself, obviously you might have to lose something in order to gain that. And that's a good thing. So, I'm going to just ask this question and we're going to tune into the light for a minute first before we go, here. All right, so close your eyes. If you're driving, obviously keep your eyes open and just follow along and pretend you can do it with your eyes opened, 'cause you all can. Okay, so close your eyes. Take your energy 300 feet up. See, sense, or feel the light. Allow the light to come into your crown. Opening up all intuitive awareness, all guidance, all knowing of who you are and what you came here to do and be. And at the root of that is happy, right? So, the very main thing that you intended to do when you came here was to be happy, and everything else is icing on the cake. Allow this light to come in and clean up all the places where you don't recognize who you are. Everywhere you're being an old version of you, ask that to be deleted. Allow the light to come in so that you can know who the true, authentic part of you is. Ask it to come through your throat, opening up all communication as this new, authentic part of you. Ask it to come into your heart so you can be kind and love yourself enough to let this new authentic part of you grow in you, become you, shift you, invite you to change, and open the doors to unlimited abundance, unlimited opportunities, unlimited prosperity, unlimited love. Ask the light to go into your solar plexus, nervous system, releasing any anxiety, fear, consternation, indecision, problems that you're just sitting on. Ask the light to come into your root, opening up all places where you feel blocked, stopped, and unhandled. Ask the light to come through your thighs, your knees, your feet, opening up so you can walk strong in the reality of who you are, the new dream version of yourself, the ideal version of you. Ask the light to come into the center of the planet, connecting to the place in the center of the planet where it feels happy, buoyant, loved. Imagine a trampoline of energy that just happens and it bounces right back up so you're connected from above and below, straight up into your heart, radiating out 360 degrees, like a great central sun. Ask this light from your heart to radiate out in a bubble around you, filling you with all the love, knowing, authenticity, kindness to yourself. Ask this light to fill you with all the gifts that you deserve. Ask this light to fill you in with your ideal life. Ask this light to fill you in with your psychic, intuitive vision of yourself when you're living your dream life. Okay, ask this light to expand past the building you're in. Ask this light to expand past the city you're in. Ask this light to expand past the state you're in. Ask this light to expand past the country you're in. Ask this light to expand past the Earth, knowing that you are the commander and the creator of your reality. You're connected to oneness, and from this place of oneness, you can command, connect, decide, choose, and allow you to fully show up, creating any part of your life that you want to. Okay, so we're going to ask that any blocks where you won't love yourself enough to let yourself have your ideal dream life, all those weird little thoughts that you might have in the back of your head saying, "I can't, I shouldn't, I wouldn't, "I couldn't change that quick." Asking all of those to delete, uncreate, and de-story. Everywhere you can't choose to allow that much love in to shift and change and upgrade your life, will you please uncreate, delete, and de-story? Will you please allow all the places where you disagree with the part of you that wants to stay stuck in the past, we're going to ask that part of you that wants to stay stuck in the past, will you please uncreate, delete, and de-story? Everything new happens now. I want you to imagine for a minute your dream life, the one that you created when did your vision board or when you wrote your story. Take a gander. Who's around you? What are you doing? How do you feel in this dream life? We're going to take a look at what kind of person that you've become in this dream life and we're going to see what kind of decisions you've made. If you were being you, this new version of you like an actor playing the role of you in this dream life, just take a gander. What personality traits did you do or have in order to get this kind of life? Were you bold, were you decisive? Okay, what personality traits in this picture do you, have you recognized now that you have to let go of for this kind of life to show up for you? If you guys can, let's just type some things and we're going to start clearing those identity structures that you guys have to let go of. And I noticed a couple of the questions you guys were having for me. Everywhere you guys have the qualities of being a poor student, an unloved girl, a mistress, all of those things, uncreate, delete, and de-story. Anywhere you guys have low self-esteem, unworth, and can't make decisions for yourself, will you uncreate, delete, and de-story? Anywhere you guys don't love yourself enough to let yourself have this life and don't feel like you deserve it, so what would it take for you guys to deserve this dream life and everything in the way of that, will you uncreate, delete it all? Anything else in the way of you guys deserving this dream life, uncreate, delete it all. Everywhere you guys have a fear of failure or just some, any nondescript fear that you don't even know what it's a fear of. Anywhere you guys had fear show up, uncreate, delete, and de-story. All other fears that are being brought up right now and contempt for yourself and feeling unfair, unjust, unloved, will you uncreate, delete, and de-story? Across all time, dimension, space, reality, across all core wounds in you that have created these places where you don't let yourself have it, anywhere you feel like you let yourself down, uncreate, delete, and de-story. Anywhere you think your past dictates your future, uncreate, delete, and de-story. Everywhere you feel like you have to control or you are controlled in the past so you can't move forward, uncreate, delete, de-story. The controlling thing is usually patterns, so all those patterns that you feel controlled by, uncreate, delete, and de-story. Everywhere you guys are not brave enough to just move into this new character, 'cause it's just a character. It's just playful, it's fun, it's loving, it's kind, it's easy. Everywhere you guys won't just move into that, uncreate, delete, de-story. Everywhere you're afraid of inventing yourself, delete all that. Uncreate, delete, de-story across all time, dimension, space, reality. How many lies are you buying from yourself about why you can't move into this new character? Uncreate, delete, de-story. All right, I'm going to ask you guys to do something right now. I want you to give this character a new name. This character that is truly you, the one that's powerful, living in your ideal life. I want you to give him or her a different name than you so that you can, it's kind of like just taking it a little bit out of you for a minute and letting you play with it a little bit. Whatever name evokes, powerful, loving, kind, easy to love, all those things that you're going to be in the new part of your life. All the anger, guilt, judgment, everything negative, uncreate, delete it all. Everywhere that you have already determined that you were so unlovable and so pathetic and so blah, blah, blah, whatever the fill in the blank is, that you can't get your new life, uncreate and delete it all. Everywhere you guys have marred yourself or distorted yourself or told yourself you're a second or third-class citizen, you don't deserve it, any of those things, uncreate, delete it all. Anywhere you guys are apathetic to make a move or make a bold choice or ask for a new job or ask for a raise, any of those things, uncreate, delete it all. Everywhere you guys don't think you can change careers, uncreate, delete it all. Everywhere you guys are controlled by the economy, uncreate, delete all that. Everywhere you don't think you can upgrade your skills and just make new choices, uncreate, delete all that, too. Everywhere you feel isolated, uncreate, delete, de-story across all time, dimension, space, and reality. Everywhere you're worried about doing it perfectly, there is no perfect and there is no right. It's just, you're just going to do it one day at a time, do the best you can with whatever energy you can bring that day, right? Okay, so everything in the way, delete all that. Everywhere you're second-guessing and just stopping yourself for no real reason, uncreate and delete it all. Any pattern that's creating all your second-guessing, doubt, and fear, uncreate, delete, and de-story across all time, dimension, space, reality. Let's see. Anywhere you guys have some negative energy that just doesn't seem to leave, whatever this is, uncreate, delete it all. Anywhere you guys have cords of fear attached to anybody else, uncreate, delete it all. Anywhere you have dimensional doorways open to anything dark, will you please shut them now and erase all those doors? Any doors that you have open to anything dark and dimensional, uncreate, delete it all. Any chapter that you have open that are dark and not very fun, uncreate, delete all those. Any genetic energy or being from your parents that keeps you attached to the dark, uncreate, delete all that. Anywhere you guys have to do polarity, you think, 'cause you're on Earth, so you're doing good and bad instead of just good, everywhere you think you're waiting for somebody's approval, like your parents, uncreate and delete all that. Everywhere you just won't delegate and try it out even if you are not perfect, just everywhere you just won't try something new, uncreate and delete all that. Anywhere you guys have clingy attachments to things, uncreate, delete it all. Everywhere you use the addiction to taking care of other people first as your excuse so you can be a good girl, good boy, take care of everybody else first, me last, do the martyr-victim and then you never get a life, everything that is, uncreate and delete all that. Everywhere you guys want to play it safe, be like everybody else, stay stuck, uncreate, delete it all. Everywhere you're in the drama of sameness. I did not say sane, S-A-N-E. I said S-A-M-E, the drama of sameness, uncreate and delete all that across all time, dimension, space, reality. Everywhere you guys would rather watch TV or play on a computer instead of actually doing something that gets you a raise or more money, uncreate and delete all that. Everywhere you are arrogantly stuck in the same rut over and over again, uncreate, delete it all. Everything you like about your uncomfortableness, delete all that. Everything you like about your discomfort, delete all that. Everywhere you like being the same person over and over and over again every day, uncreate, delete, and de-story all that. Everywhere you don't want men in your life. Everything that is, uncreate and delete it all. Everywhere you don't want yourself in your life, uncreate and delete it all. Could you guys feel that one? That one has some energy on it. I remember you guys don't really want to even be yourself. Uncreate, delete all that. Wow, that's a lot of energy. All right, defeated, humiliated, small. Anywhere you guys just go be your human self after the phone calls and you'd just be small instead of big, uncreate and delete all that. Everywhere abundance is for everyone else, uncreate, delete all that. Everywhere you're afraid of being the character that we're going to move you into, uncreate and delete all that. Everywhere you're afraid of people, uncreate and delete all that. Everywhere you've tried already and so you think, therefore, you tried one time before you had some tools or you tried a few times in the beginning, anywhere you think you've tried, tried, tried, but you have no success, we're going to delete all that, because that was you in a different energy so it doesn't really matter right now. Okay, so there. Everywhere you're a dreamer, but you take no action. Victim, guilt, doubt, one-hit wonder, uncreate, delete it all. Everywhere you're afraid to be loving, powerful, kind, confident, determined, and consistent, uncreate and delete all that. Anywhere you have past life vows or you can't be a spiritual and make a lot of money, delete all those. Everywhere you're a starving artist, delete all those. Okay, there. Everywhere you have to get money from a man or a woman or your mom or your dad, uncreate and delete all that. Everywhere you're waiting for somebody else to tell you okay, waiting to see proof, waiting for anything, uncreate, delete all that. Let's see, how many other lies did you buy from people? Uncreate all those. Okay, that's funny. Jenna says her new name is Christie. Okay. So, let's go into this new person for a minute. All right, so everywhere if you guys are, so I'm going to just cuss, okay? Everywhere you guys are, if you guys are so kickass, powerful, confident, loving, kind, can make stuff happen, move forward in the world, and everywhere that feels so fun and so loving and so kind, but you're still afraid that other people might not appreciate it, therefore, you won't do it because you still give a shit what other people think, will you uncreate, delete, and de-story all that across all time, dimension, space, and reality. Okay, this new character that is you that you're moving into, what skills does this actor have? I'm just going to say actor, but I mean actor and actress, okay? So, what skills does this character have for this new lifestyle? What skills does your new character bring to the table in this new life? One of the skills is you're totally psychic, yay! It's one of the most fun skills you could ever have. You can manifest whatever you want. Emily, in your picture of manifesting whatever you want, and everybody listening, get a picture in your head. If you're in this new lifestyle, what would that be doing? Role-play in action. So, if you're going to manifest something, think of saying, "Hey, I want this," and it just happens. And then if you want to be psychic, see yourself just reading somebody and knowing exactly what's up, no big deal. And in this new lifestyle, if you're an excellent money manager, just see yourself looking at, you're sitting at your desk playing with your bank account, laughing at how much you have in it and thinking, wow, I am so good with finding investments and taking money and making more money from my money. I am so lucky. I'm such an excellent money manager. And see yourself like, Alison, I'm going to ask you to see yourself on stage, talking to people, talking about what a crazy life you've had, talking about how brave you were and you moved forward. You wrote your book, you got your life. Yes, and you're speaking from your heart all the time. And Terry, you can talk to everything in the nonphysical. Dead people, loved ones, angels, guides, everything. Okay, so Chris, you see yourself as winning. Lucy, I want you to open all your cabinets and see that they're all organized and open up your computer and see it all organized and open up your, like a QuickBooks or your financial plan and see it all organized, consistently making money. Amber, whatever that means for you. Powerful attractor-manifestor. See yourself as just on top of the world surrounded by all your little babies, like you're manifesting babies, whatever your little creations are that you've created. Okay, cool. Galena, see yourself exchanging energy with somebody. Generous, kindhearted, lighthearted, caring, and see them respond and compliment you back, saying, "Wow, you're the nicest rich person I ever met." Janet, see yourself as an excellent manifestor with all your little creations sitting around you. Okay, Runa, see yourself as a little mover and shaker making everything happen, like your magic wand goes out in the universe and just makes everything happen, sends it back easily. Elizabeth, see yourself creating whatever that is. Infinitely creative. Terry, see yourself working on 30 people at a time in a room, and it's really fun, happy, alive, well, and abundant. Grace, see yourself as confident, talking to people, talking them into themselves, right? What if you could sell people to themselves and talk them into being the full them? Magic. Every part of your life, Michelle, is just magical. Everything gets upgraded easier than you ever expect, better than it could ever be. That, or you just do your little prayers and blessings and then it just shows up. That's what you're going to see in this new creation of you. Jacqueline, you're going to see yourself just doing all the things that you want to do with no hesitation. Gail, you're going to see yourself with intuition, confidence, and massive action, just creating your life. Frank, you're going to see yourself taking guided risks, right? It's not really a risk. It's taking guided action that would seem bold to others, but to you is common sense and everyday thinking. Sheila, everywhere you think it's cheating if you use your psychic intuition and know everything about everyone, everything that is, uncreate and delete it all. Any of you listening thinking that is cheating if you actually know too much, I used to have that belief. I thought, oh, I can't pick stocks using my intuition 'cause then I'm cheating. Everything that is, uncreate all that. Wanda, she can leap a tall building in a single bound. She is unstoppable. Unbounded confidence, so, Aliyah, see yourself with a group of people mingling and just, you radiate and you rule the room. I like that, Margaret. Margaret's name is Genie. Sandra, you're probably just feeling the vibration of when you connect to the light. All right, so Jenny, see yourself walking in the room, emanating joy to everybody, and everybody looks at you 'cause they can't believe how happy you are. Win-win-win situation. All right, Grace, see yourself doing the married with kids, happy family, Rockefeller picture, or Norman Rockwell. I'm sorry, yes. Olivia, see yourself receiving blessings and giving them out. Susan, see yourself an entrepreneur creating a lot of money, helping people, philanthropic as well. Marilyn, see yourself solving problems and getting paid for it generously. Marsha, see your balances as zero, and all your credit cards and debt. I like that, push-button results. Ivan, see yourself making decisions every day in a way that adds lots of profits to your life, emotional profit, financial profit, all those things, loving profit. Rosalind, can enroll people? Yes, hopefully into consciousness, Rosalind. Clarity on all things. I'm the master of my life, seeking new experiences and adventures. Yes, Alison, I was talking to you. Successful and busy psychotherapist, inspiring, uplifting. Fun and abundant magnet. So, see yourself as lucky, okay, in this new thing. See yourself as lucky. Okay, so all these things, just imagine these as part of your new, I like this, Sheriff Fierce. She's bold, brave and powerful. Well-groomed, highly professional, very wealthy. She's totally intuitive, reads her client's needs with precision. She's a speaker and presenter in demand. She holds an energy that allows other to achieve their dream. I love it, Sharon, that's awesome. Okay, you guys are doing great. We're going to do a couple clearings, so anything in the way of you guys being that. Let's see. Anything in the way of you guys being that, uncreate, delete, and de-story. Why don't you see your character for a minute? We're going to play with this a little bit. Why don't you see your character that you just created, see her just like, I dunno. Let's just say there's an old version of you standing in front of her and ask her to take that old version of you and just start pulling out all the energy that's in the way of you being the new you, okay? Just imagine her working on you right now, basically the old version of you, clearing and pulling out all the details, all the objections, all those silly thoughts that are in the way. Galena, if you want to see yourself winning the lottery, see yourself in the new picture winning the lottery. Gabriela, maybe, she's saying her lower belly is expanding. That's probably your power expanding, all right? You're a songwriter, lost 30 K, or kilograms. All right. "She told me to let go of the sack of rocks "I've been dragging around. "Time to let go of the self-punishment." All right, what else are you guys letting go of? I'm curious. Aliyah, the new her broke off the head off the old her. It's probably 'cause you think too much in not very good ways. Not that I'm judging it, just probably not in productive ways. I'll say productive ways, how about that? "I don't need to be perfect, "just playfully get it done." You know what, Margaret? I get more done when I play and I make it all light instead of serious. "Old, stubborn, angry, overstressed-out self." Okay, so Grace, are you getting rid of that? "Negative people, she broke a ceramic shell "all around my body." "She told me to not be afraid, have confidence. "It's all going to work out." "Letting go of fretting and weariness." Excavating the body and gave you a new one. "Just found out there's an uncondensed version of me." I love it. Galena, ask the new version of yourself to heal, to send you an energy, or do whatever you need to the current and/or old version of yourself. Just ask her to do what's ever needed to heal the overeating. She's pulling the martyrdom and pain from her heart and solar plexus. "She told me to let go of unnecessary beliefs." Heather, ask her what some of those beliefs are so that you can know what they are and then let go of them. Okay, Amber, "It's hard to pull things out of the old me." So, anywhere you're resisting letting go of things, let it go. Any of you guys that are resisting playing along and letting go of the old, delete all that. Carla says, "It's safe to be kickass "in every area of my life "and be kind, fun, and sexy." Gail says she's letting go of the weight that's holding her back, that's keeping everybody at bay. Good job. "Drop the loser self in the video return box." I love it. That's awesome. "Seeing myself married to my soulmate, Chris, "and we're blissfully happy and abundant. "Even seeing Chris as more open, "supportive, encouraging, and loving." I love it 'cause he's going to bump up into his gorgeous self. "I got a big new heart." "Let go of doubt and procrastination." "She poured a bucket of water over me, "washed all my stuff away." "She took me to the hairdresser." So, Sharon, do you need to go the hairdresser? Maybe she wants you to have a new 'do. "She winked at me." "Seeing her dissolve and only the new me there." I love that. "Gave me a watch that makes things happen for me on time." Ooh, I love that. Hey, this is a good trick. I once did this for awhile, it was really hilarious. What happened, I said, "What would it take for everything to show up "before I even know I need it?" And then literally what would happen is everything would show up before I knew I needed it, and then later on, I would know I needed it. It was really completely funny. Yeah. All right, "She opened my spiritual side of my throat "so I can speak and create my future." I love it. So, read your story and speak your story. "Put money in my hand, boost my confident, "wiped away my negative energy." Yes, you can clear blocks in other people. It's usually kind to ask, ask their soul if you can do it. "Kept pulling out sticky tabs marked 'stuck' in my brain." Ooh, I love that, Lydia. That's awesome. "Positive attraction and abundance." "She took away my dumpy, frumpy, "not-good-enough outer shell "and revealed a thin, new, happy me. "I don't need to camouflage myself anymore." Awesome. "Future successful self jumped into me "a la Neo in The Matrix, "blowing out anything that didn't match "and filling me with a future successful happy energy." "Washed away my fears and yo-yo attitude." "Finally became successful as an author, photographer, "and pet loss grief counselor. "No more disappointments." "Fatty layers peeled away. "I blended with her and all the yuck fell away." All right, Olivia, so just ask the highest sexy version, powerful, confident, gorgeous you to just show up more fully and just ask, like, come in and wash away anything in the way of that. So many of you guys are stuck with this way of visualizing. Just picture the perfect you. Ask her to come into your body, and everything else, let go of. "I let go of armor around my heart." "Dressed up like Grace Kelly." "Vacuumed all the old, stagnant corners of my mind "and opened the windows." All right, I love this. You guys are great. You can clear blocks on animals. Animals are just sentient beings who think and feel as well. "My new name is Crystal, the first name my mother gave me. "I see her cutting the cords that bind me "and keep me from myself, "opening doors that were always there "that I just needed to accept all of my heart's desire. "I am new, the old me is now gone." Congratulations, Wanda. I love it. Elizabeth, letting go of the crankiness, which is usually just some pent-up anxiety and fear about moving forward. Okay. "Unlocked a big cellar I was in "and asked me to follow her so we could have some fun "and leave my agony behind." "Letting go of the heaviness." "No more fretting about anything, including my itchy skin." Good job, Margaret. "She gave me wings." "She threw away a part of my brain." "She's pulled out the stuck energy in my spine "and off my limbs like removing gloves and stockings." "Came out of the closet." Okay, so this is really good. "New me facing old me and pulling strings out." Lucy, those are probably just attachments, okay? You can ask her to pull it out in a much more dramatic way if you would like. You can ask her to do it more dramatic so you can understand what it means more. "I am life itself." Okay, so Chris says, "I don't know what's going on." All right. I mean, are you seeing anything, Chris? I don't know how to answer you, Chris Russell. Let the new you just kind of embody in you. If you're a little stuck with anything, just let the new you just fill you up. Okay, so, the new you. What attitude, what do you wake up with? I want to know what kind of attitude you guys wake up with. Okay, "My left neck is brand new, smiling. "Happy, joyous, and giggly." "Gratitude and excitement." "What's in store with me today?" "Go get 'er." Okay. Now move your actor, move you into your new dream life. We're going to just ask a few questions, see if you can get some more clarity, okay? Ask him or her for advice. Ask, how do I get this new life to show up right now? All right, so take me some of the things that you guys are getting. If you get no answer, you might just be taking in the download. Sometimes that happens. You don't get a clear answer 'cause you're just rebooting, you're taking the download in. But just ask her, is there any words of advice she or he could give you? Okay, so, Michelle, "Keep raising my energy." "Get out of my own way." Amber, that just means go forward boldly. You know what really get out of your own way means is quit being stuck, just go forward. Just take action. Just sort of not care and play with it. Play like as if you don't care. Surrender. Ask the light to remove the barriers. "Having trouble getting any clear." You could be just rebooting, so that's okay. Enjoy. Ask him or her and just trust that it's either getting downloaded in you as a direct download, okay, or you might hear or sense an answer. But just ask her to be a little bold and maybe give you a direct answer. What new ideas can be implemented now to get your life moving in that direction? What new ideas can be implemented now? Play, have more fun, be patient, lighten up? Chris, ask him to come into your body and just become the new you that's bold, takes action. And anywhere you're blocking your divine guidance in any level, uncreate and delete all that. Anywhere you don't think you can hear, uncreate and delete all that. Anywhere you don't want to know the answers, uncreate and delete all that. Anywhere you think you know it all so you can't have anything new show up, uncreate and delete it all. You don't think you can have answers given to you directly, uncreate and delete all that. Keep clearing the clutter. Keep listening to the calls and visualize new you. "I'm confused if I'm listening to my conscience "or my new advice." Gabriela, it feels like both. I hear the answer is 'cause sometimes the new advice is just common sense, okay? Let's see. "Sing karaoke." "Be the coach. "Don't think about how you will become it. "Just take the first steps in contacting the people you need "in order to get that speaking opportunity. "Know that you can do it." "Open a new business." "Listen to your intuition." "Stick with a radical accountability program "of goal setting." "Get back to where the real people are." "I deserve it." Yeah, sometimes you guys need an outer overhaul to allow the fun, pride, and sexy me to show up so I can find myself in the world. Sharon, you know what? If you need some new clothes, a new wardrobe, a new 'do, a little makeup lesson, whatever you need, just go do that and just have some fun with it. 'Cause sometimes the outer you has to show up so you're not looking at the same thing in the mirror all the time. We could all learn a few little makeup skills every now and then. Let's see. I like that, "Trust the process. "Don't sweat whether it's working or not, "just know that you're clearing many things "from your energy field forever and it's working." Now ask your actor, basically super-powered person, what qualities that you need to embody to get to the next level. Is there any other quality that you might need that you didn't get in the first part of you? "Direction." Any other qualities? "Do the Snoopy dance." "Relax, practice." Yes, I love that, Emily. Practice, practice, practice. 'Cause if you guys are worried about it being perfect, you'll just go play with it in practice. "Love myself." "Use my talents in tandem, not just parts of me." Yes, blind faith. You know what? Sometimes you just have to jump. At the end of the day, the only person who can jump is you. "Manage my money." Amber, I'm wondering if you have a plan in place. Maybe if you just had a little plan in place about budget and what you should do with your money and then how you're going to bring in an extra whatever, thousand, couple thousand dollars a month or something like that, whatever that takes for you. That would be a good way to go. "More assertive, more light and fun, confident." Okay, so ask this new part of you, this actor/actress part of you what vibrational life energy they need to bring, what kind of energy do you need to bring into your life? "More fun, more gratitude." "Don't take yourself so seriously." "Don't care what other people think." "Adventure." So, Silvana what if you decided to take a trip or some sort of adventure, whatever that is for you? "Success." "Some Altantean energy healing, some joy." Okay, cool. What options can you choose? Basically, if you had to take some bold action, ask them what bold action you could take to move you forward. "The vibration of fun on my scale is about 600 is joy." 540 is joy, I'm sorry, 540. Yes. Okay, so Dirk, all those other distracting things that are coming in today, uncreate and delete them all. All those patterns that might be in the way, uncreate and delete them all. Every part of your day that you haven't let go of, uncreate and delete them all today. Any other pattern that's trying to take you out or distract you, uncreate and delete it all. Anywhere you're not really into this, uncreate and delete it all. And everywhere you're scared to move forward, uncreate and delete it all. "Enthusiasm." Okay, so Deanne, sometimes when you do the second part, you get more of a download than specific awareness, okay? It feels like you're just getting a direct download, so it's just getting downloaded into you and you'll just feel better, but it's like you already have the information coming into you. "Jump when opportunity knocks." "Glitteracy, total sparkle at all times." "Step forward, volunteer." You know, that's a great phrase. What would it take to reach enlightenment, Jennifer? When I did that, my life was like, really, it was a cool experience. I got to experience what pure consciousness was in a human body over and over and over again. It was very interesting and my energy became very magical. Okay, so Chris, don't worry about it. It feels like you're, I can see the light coming into you, so you're just getting a direct download is what it seems like. Maybe listen to it again this week and see if you get anything else. Cool, all right. So, is there some decision that you guys have to make? I'm curious. Is there some decision in your life that you're blocking or stopping yourself? So, any decision that you guys make, ask your higher part of you, okay? Ask him or her, what choice can you make? Lisa, it feels like you're getting a direct download and you have some, okay, so all the implanted places where you don't think you can actually play. Lisa, anywhere you shut off your ability to play and imagine, delete all that. Anywhere you shut off your ability to be ridiculous and play and have fun, any of those things, yes, uncreate all that. Anywhere you're being serious, uncreate and delete all that. Everywhere it's not normal for an adult to play, uncreate and delete all that. Okay, so Sharon? Yeah, choosing a new career that's abundant and happy. Decide to be you. All right, so all you guys are stuck in this part. It's really interesting where all the energy started coming from. Okay, so all this unconsciousness that wants to block you and betray you and stop you guys from getting answers on specific choices you can make and anywhere you're blocking it because you really want to do one thing but the highest version of yourself wants to do another thing. I want you guys to just play for a minute and just imagine that the highest part of you, this, I don't know, for lack of a better way to call it, this character that's the most empowered version of you. Just ask him or her, just trust whatever comes into your mind. If you make this bold choice to move forward, will it work out for you? And ask this inner character to shift whatever it is that's blocking you from getting any awareness right now. Ask him or her, the future part of you, this future self, ask him or her to clear whatever's blocking you from actually getting any awareness right now. Ask the light to come into your head, your heart, your throat, opening up any place where you feel misguided and you can't get an answer. Asking any part of you that goes into unawareness to be deleted. Yes, Margaret, you can now ask your genie. Grace, you're saying, what if only part of the decision is yours? Well, what if you just decided for everybody? What if you take over the whole energy of everything and choose it? Oh, okay. Yeah, but if that's really your choice and you really like that person, just put the energy there as an invitation for that person to choose it as well. Yeah, Chris, sometimes I don't see things. Sometimes I just actually have to know things. So, just allow that to happen. Okay, so one more time, just allow this new part of you. I'm going to ask you all to invite this new part of you to override your life for now, okay? Ask this new part of you, this funky, confident, gorgeous part of you. If you get stuck in making a decision or stuck in some part of your life, ask them to clear what's in the way of it, number one, and ask what would they do. And then just start asking and acting from that character that is you. Ask them to speed up your life. Rosalind, you can actually create time, believe it or not. Ask everywhere you guys are stuck in time. Ask that you find the time somehow, Rosalind, that you can do everything that you need to do in a shorter amount of time and have all the time you need to get the information that you need, okay? Ask the information that you need to come to you in the form of a shortcut, a mentor, a guru, something. Ask that you can find time at work to do it or something like that. Dirk, is there no other action you can take to make the success come? Yes, for sure, ask to speed up paying off your credit card debt, for sure. Ask for time for fun. Dirk, I would say, "What would it take for everything in my life "to come into my now moment and create now?" I would just ask, instead of everything being in the future, Dirk, I'd ask it to show up now and just see if that speeds it up a little bit. Okay, cool. All right. One more time. Anything in the way of you guys allowing this character that's truly you, 'cause by the way, this character is truly you, right? Okay, it's this character that's truly you. What would it take for you guys to just allow this character to act fully through you each and every day 24/7, and everything in the way of that, uncreate it all. What would it take for this character to have your back, show up all the time for you, and you just naturally, easily, and effortlessly move into it? Your homework is to play with this character for a little bit and just really feel. Let's all move there for a minute. Move back into your character. See yourself in your future life. See yourself doing some of the things that you want to do in this future life. Driving the cars you want to drive, talking to the people that you want to talk to, hanging out with the friends you want to be with, being with the kind of mate you want to be with. Doing your life's work, having plenty of extra dough, so much extra that you could do philanthropy, whatever you want. Ask this character to create a lot of light in your life currently. Ask this actor to embody all the way in you, moving away anything in the way that's the old you and fully becoming the character that this new energy brings you. 'Cause really, what he or she represents to you is new energy, right? The new energy of your future life, because if you've moved into this to be the future you, this brings all the gifts along with it. Anything in the way of this manifesting or this happening or you go letting go of the old version of you, uncreate, delete, and de-story across all time, dimension, space, reality. Anywhere you're afraid that if you move into this new version, you're going to have to lose something, you're not really going to lose anything. You're just going to win. You're going to gain things. So, anywhere afraid you're going to lose something, delete all that. Anywhere you're afraid you're going to lose luggage too quickly, delete all that. Everywhere you are going to lose unawareness and that's frightening, delete all that. Any fear, anger, or twistedness that's keeping any of this locked in place where you can't be the new version, uncreate and delete all that. Anywhere you guys are still tired or heavy, uncreate and delete it all. Think of being 300 feet tall and just allowing any of this energy that wants to move out. Just ask this new character that is you to really just pull out of you anything in the way of you being this character. So, how are you guys doing right now? Okay, "Better." "Tired, lighter." "Stretching," okay, cool. "Distracted." Any parts of you guys that are just leaving and it's creating a distraction, we'll just blow them up. Cool, all right. You're doing great, though, okay? You guys are just in the middle of shifting into this new character. What would it take for you guys to move into the traits of your actor?

What would it take universe to deliver for you the new lifestyle now? What vibrational energy can bring you guys more action in your life? Okay, 30 to 40 times a day. What vibrational energy can you become to align with your ideal self and take bold action? Somebody is asking, any other tips like the one I said about asking for things to show up before I need it. Let me see if anything pops in my head. What I would do is right now, right now, 'cause you guys are in this energy, just ask, what would it take for me to always be the version of me that manifests my future now? What would it take for me to always be in my empowered self, or whatever name you gave your character, right? What would it take for you guys to be the kickass version of you? And all of us have he or she have your back, guide you, tell you everything, be totally truthful, open you up to new experiences, and guide you into the future lifestyle now. What would it take for him or her to always have your back? What would it take for him or her to actually, kick you guys in the tush a little bit and bump you up and push you forward? That's what the highest version of me does. She bosses me around a little bit. She's a little bossy and I actually love it because she just tells me what to do, so I get it done. It takes a lot less effort to just get things done instead of worrying about it. You can combine a couple things, Tatiana, for sure. All right, I really enjoy you guys. You guys are amazing, amazing. Thanks for bringing your energy on the call. And I know it's late and you guys had a long day, so I really enjoy the fact that you guys care enough about yourself to really show up. I love you guys so much. Ciao for now. Sending you love, and keep your heart opened for this new embodied higher self showing up in your world. All right, ciao for now.

====================

LESSON 17: Creating a Powerful & Confident Future

- Hey, this is Christie Marie Sheldon, and you're listening to a recording I did of a series of 24 live group sessions on clearing abundance blocks. And here's what we're covering today in session 17. I'm going to guide you through a process of using your image machine to help your future self see what awesome things are in store for you. You get to look at what your etiologies, your thoughts, and your ideas are betraying your manifesting power. Also, we're going to ask your future self what options you have to open the doorways to new opportunities. Tune in and make excellent future options show up for you. So let's get your future self on board. And let's begin. Hey, welcome, welcome. How are you guys? It is really lovely to be here. Let's see, session 17. And so we're going to connect some more to your future self and ask your future self to bring you some gifts, some insight, and some tips and tools on manifesting. So today's going to be really exciting. If you guys have a piece of paper, so in case you jot some notes down of some things that you want to clear later on as well, or some new awarenesses, be open for some change. So what would it take for everybody today to invite in change? Positive change, uplifting change, more abundance than you've ever had before. Okay, so let's take a moment and set your intent on what you hope to achieve today. For some of you, it might be clearing just this block that you just keep hitting, right? For others of you, it might be that, ooh, I already achieved what I hoped to manifest. Now I'm going to manifest something else. Today, inspiring stories, and these are really cool today. Can I just say I am so proud of you guys just for being here, number one, for choosing more for yourself and for really taking some action and caring enough about yourself to want something different, to show up all the time, to do the work. It's not every day that people will love themselves enough to really just take some positive action and say, hey, whatever it's going to take for me to get over this and move to the next level, I'm going to do it. I'm really, really, really proud of you guys. So George had a really cool story. He said his manifestations all of a sudden exploded this week. So remember how I said at the beginning, like some people will have things happen in two seconds right away, and some of you, you know, it's okay where you're at though, okay? So don't make yourself wrong about it. But some of you maybe had a little bit more of a foundation that was a little more entrenched, I guess we should say. And then you had to do a little bit more work, and then all the sudden, kind of like the overnight success, it would just go kaboom, and then all of a sudden all your new manifestations would show up in your world. Well, this is what happened for George. He wrote to tell me that he's had tenants who have not been able to pay their rent for a while. But last week they were finally able to give him $800 in cash, so that was different. Okay, something new showed up in his world. Then he heard from a lawyer who told him that he's going to get 7,500 grand from an insurance settlement. And this is after being told that he wouldn't get much, maybe even nothing, manifesting $8,300 in total. Good job, George. Arista, she and her husband were going on a Mediterranean cruise, had some trouble with their flight. The night before they were leaving, they got an email saying the flight was canceled, the night before, but they had been rescheduled in the afternoon. That flight was delayed due to thunderstorms, so they missed the connecting flight. They rebooked on a later flight, but ended up getting upgraded to first class. She said they were wined and dined all the way to their destination. But now to top it all off, you know, some people would say, oh, that's horrible, they got bumped and canceled and blah, blah, blah. So upgraded to first class, but later on, they found out the flight they'd missed had to turn around after being in the air for an hour because of engine trouble. The universe conspired to completely and totally help them, even if it wasn't logical to them in the first place. Kimberly had been having trouble manifesting and got a little resentful. And then she got behind listening to the sessions. The funny thing is now she's trying to get caught up, and she's finding that what we're covering was exactly what she needed, clearing up past resentments and clutter. So she did those, is getting caught up, took some action. And she said she runs several home businesses. She felt she was really blocked because she had two broken couches, felt uncomfortable having people over. So it was cutting down on her flow of love from other people. She and her husband decided to buy some nice leather couches, went on Craigslist, found them for 1/3 the price, and the seller threw in a few freebies. Manifest the family's first vacation in four years. So Kimberly, with a little block, a little behind, but she found once she cleared her resentment, the very thing that was blocking her in the first place from taking action and doing the course, she cleared that, and then all of a sudden, everything just kind of opened up for her. So good job, Kimberly. I want to comment on that, because a lot of times, the reason we don't want to do something is because of the exact block blocking us, and we don't even know that. So sometimes you really do just have to take massive action, even though you don't feel like it, because it could be your block that's making you not feel like it. So today is going to be an interesting day 'cause we're going to talk to your future self. But I wanted to like lay this out a little bit more clearly of what the rules are really for generating your future. And before we get into those, let's connect to the light a little bit so that we're all just sort of connected. So close your eyes. Take your energy out 300 feet. See, sense, or feel the light. See, sense, or feel consciousness itself. Okay, allow the source conscious energy to come into your crown, opening up all of your intuitive awareness, all your knowing. Releasing out anywhere you prejudge the future. And lock it away like as if it could never happen. So anywhere you prejudge the future, delete all that. Okay, allow this light to come into your third eye so you can see your future. Allow the light to come into your ears so you can hear about your future in a divinely guided way. Okay, ask the light to come into your throat so you can communicate and talk positively as if the future's already manifested now. Oftentimes I will just talk as if I'm living my future self. Allow the light to come into your heart, creating a gateway for new abundance showing up in your life this week, now. Allow this light to come into your solar plexus. Okay, allow the light to come into your yes, your route, clearing out your abdomen area, clearing out anywhere you're blocked on your power, anywhere you're blocked on your route. Okay, allow the light to come into the ground, into the center of the planet, a beam of light connecting to the part of the planet that's totally conscious right in the center. Okay, allow this light to reflect back straight up into the middle of your heart. Radiating out 360 degrees all the way around like a great central sun. Moving you into a bubble of light. Ask this light to get bigger than your body. Ask this light to get bigger than the building you're in. Ask this light to get bigger than the city you're in. See this light around you expand past the city, expand past the state, expand past the country, expand past the Earth. You are now connected to the oneness of it all, bigger than the problems, able to correct them. Yes, and bring in your new future. All right, and I had a couple questions here, so I'll just answer them. Am I right to realize that I have hurt others and become toxic because I have overextended myself? Yes, when you're moving through things, you'll naturally see things that you might not like, but you have to just see them, and don't judge yourself, love yourself, and just move to the next story. All right, so you guys set the intent that everything that's blocking you is going to get cleared today, okay? Let's go through this and we'll see what comes up. All right, so I'm just going to do this. So everything you guys are asking about or think that you're blocked with, okay, connected to the light, what would it take for you to delete it all right now? What would it take for all of it to leave? Everywhere you feel you can't be the future self and you're stuck in the story, uncreate, delete all stories across all time, dimension, space, reality, core soul history, and genetic. What would it take for all of your stories to be dismantled right now? Everywhere you can't, shouldn't, wouldn't, couldn't. Anywhere in your genetic lineage, you can't, shouldn't, wouldn't, couldn't. Uncreate, delete, de-story across all time, dimension, space, and reality. Everywhere you feel frightened about moving forward, uncreate and delete it all. Everywhere you're having a hard time being of a positive vibration, uncreate, delete it all. Everywhere you think you can't manifest things, uncreate and delete it all. Everywhere you guys are, whatever got stirred up, whatever that is for you guys, uncreate, delete it all. Okay, so have you guys noticed that we're doing the Unlimited Abundance journey, but it's affecting other parts of your life? So somebody is asking me, can I do the relationship course while I'm doing Unlimited Abundance, and the answer's yes. Like they all overlap other parts of your life. So me personally, I work on all parts of my life all the time. I don't really segment myself. So the answer would be, if you guys want to take other courses at the same time, the answer is yes, you can do that. Okay, so I'm just going to go through this, and then we're going to connect to your future self, which is going to have a lot of clearing and answers. So remember, the rules to generating your conscious future. And consciousness is defined by me as if you're making a conscious future or contribution to your life, you're making choices from awareness of who you are as an infinite being with infinite potentials versus choices from past programs and etiologies, ideas, thoughts, feelings, right? So one of the rules of creating your conscious future is to be in the positive field of energy. So love the vibrations, which are joy, peace, love, gratitude, and source energy. Okay, which is what you guys are doing when you connect to the light and do your what would it takes, as long as you're connected and feel full of love and joy doing it, those will have a higher vibrational field versus doing what would it takes feeling a little bit lower. Okay, remember, be bigger than your future. So when you're connected to the light, you're connected to the oneness of it all. You're bigger than your future, and you can create your future from a much easier place there. Now, we're going to play out the rules of how it can be in your, I call it your imagination, but it's like your image machine. It's where you make images, right? So we're going to connect right now to your future self, okay? So let's just stay connected. Everybody close your eyes. If you're driving, obviously do not close your eyes, keep them wide awake and open. So I want you guys to get a picture, and I'm going to just go one year from now, okay? So get a picture one year from now. And I want you to imagine yourself in some part of your everyday life in that year. I want to tie it to your normal way of living. I want you to just think for a minute, like if you were living your ideal self from your vision board, what kind of house would you be living in? Okay? So just go for it a minute. And I want you to just start filling in the details, even if you think you're making it up. Now, let's just say you get an image of your house and it's your current house, but you don't really want that. Or you get an image of a house and it's a little smaller than you want. I'm going to ask you to work with your future self right now and start creating a picture or a feeling or something that you just kind of sense, one story or two story? Is it a ranch? Or is it a mansion? Is it a condo in a high rise in New York City? So whatever it is for you, just get a picture of what that would be. And upgrade it to what you really, truly desire is what I'm asking you to do. Okay, now I'm going to ask you to walk into the kitchen. And I'm going to ask you to open up your computer. So find where your computer is. This is one year from now. Okay, and I want you to open up the calendar on your computer, the calendar/contact area of your computer. I'm going to ask you to look at your week and what kind of activities are you going to be doing this week, one year from now? What kind of people are you around? And what are you actually doing? Because if you've manifested a more abundant future, you might be doing something different than what you currently are. So just go through your calendar and notice what you're doing different. And if you don't know for sure, just pretend you do know and just kind of make it up. Just allow the flow of the made up story to sort of show up. What you're doing is you're shifting into that world. And by shifting into that world, you're actually creating it. Now, imagine in this day in your home, in your kitchen, imagine it's a day when you have your family around. Or if you're in the middle of manifesting a mate, get a picture of your future mate, and then picture everybody just really, really happy. And some of you might notice there's new people in your life around you. And some people might notice there's some people not there. And some of you might just notice that everybody's around you happy. Now, let's go back to your computer for a minute, and imagine you're going on and you're doing some online banking. So go on your online banking, and pull up the balance of your checking account. And if you don't like the number, I'm going to ask you to change it. Now, that's just your bank account. So let's just say you have a profit/loss statement, and let's just say on that you have a list of maybe some investments that you did. So I want you to take the profit part of it, the investments, profit coming in every month, just notice how much profit is coming in every month. And if you don't like the number, change it. And if you're having any thoughts that are coming in trying to distract you right now, I want you to uncreate and delete them all right now. This is just some blocks, so uncreate and delete anything that tells you, you can't be this powerful and change it, delete all that. Now, fill it in, if some of you are like really big into stock investing or things like that, portfolios and all that, I want you to just see your portfolio very big. Some of you might not be into that right now, but just for imagination's sake, just add that you're doing that. And it's profitable. You have investments that are earning you money. So open your heart a little bit more into that, that you can really, really feel what it would be like to be in this house, have everything in your life working, have plenty of money in the bank, have your family around that loves and cares for you. I'm going to take you now to a different moment. It's about one year from now. And I'm going to ask if you were working, like right now, if you're doing the thing that brings in the profit, what are you doing? Just allow that to pop into your mind. Are you working with new clients? Are you creating a bigger job? Are you retired? Think of what you really want to be doing one year from now. If you don't know, just kind of fill it in, but see yourself happy, maybe connecting to people or going online and seeing that money's just rolling in from maybe some internet programs you're doing. Just kind of fill it in with something that could be possible for you. If you want to be a speaker, see yourself speaking. Okay, once you got a clear picture in your head, now, make it more clear if you can. A little more Technicolor, a little brighter, a little larger. See yourself calling on the phone. If that's how you make money, or people calling you and your phone's ringing off the hook and they want to give you money. Okay, so now I want you to think to yourself, if you're your future self that's one year from now, I want you to ask, what month did this finally like really, really, really kick in for you? Was it 3 months earlier, 6 months earlier, 12 months earlier? Where did it really kick in for you? Now, your future self already knows what's happened a year earlier, right, to get this picture. So your future self already knows the timeline. Ask your future self, if you could give yourself advice right now today, what would be one of the massive action steps that you would take? It could be more training. It could be cleaning out the closet. What would another action step be that your future self would tell you to do currently? She or he might even be saying, wow, I'm so grateful that that happened a year ago. Or wow, I'm so grateful I met somebody three months ago. So what are you grateful for, this future self of yours, what is she grateful for that happened in the last year? Or he. And what other piece of advice does your future self that's already made the money, what does he or she want to tell you that you could do right now? So take this future self and go back, so this future self that we're connected to is 12 months from now. So let's go back 9 months from now. 9 months from now. Do you still see yourself in the same house, or are you in a different house? What action steps are you taking nine months from now that create the shift in your life? Now, some of you are having a hard time. Just imagine it, because when you imagine it, you're putting it in place. Even if you sort of don't know, just think of, well, what would I do and not be doing in nine months that would get me all the money, get me all the abundance, get me the happy lifestyle, get me my dream home? All right, so let's go to six months from now. What kind of house are you in? Take a look, open up your computer, and look at your calendar. What actions are you taking on a daily basis in your six-month version of yourself? Okay, if you could picture it more vibrantly, and if you don't like the picture, change it, okay? So make him or her, the six-month self, really, really abundant, happy, wealthy, wise, prosperous, on track. Maybe look at your investments and profit-loss statement and see it like a really high profit. See your bank book full of money. Ask the six-month version of him or herself what they would like to change in your life that could make everything happen sooner. Okay, so we're going to clear any blocks that are coming up. But some of you are just downloading, but just kind of make it up, even if you don't see it or sense it, just kind of sense, wow, okay, maybe I'm in a two story. Maybe it's like really big. Maybe I got my book written. Now, let's go into your three-month version of yourself. Okay, and I want you to see your family members all supporting you in all this picture. Even if they're currently not, just see them supporting you anyway. So three months in the future. See he or she like so happy that you took the unlimited abundance journey, 'cause your life is really on track now. And if you want to picture the house that you saw one year from now in the three-month time period, it's really okay, it's okay to push it a little bit and see what happens. See your family supporting you, thinking, wow, it is so great that you're working on yourself. Even if that's not their normal thing that they're doing now, I want you to visualize that anyway. If you want to invite in some new people, some new friends who are like your soul group, your soul friends, the friends who really care and honor you, invite in some new friends. And see yourself with a full social calendar, getting love from lots of people. Plenty of time to do the social thing, get some love. Okay, and then open up your computer, look at your calendar. And just see what action steps you're taking to generate this. For some of you, you might be starting to see some increase in your investments. So look at your profit/loss statement. See how much profit's coming in per month. Okay. Now, I would make it a little more real. If you guys have like a client-based business, see yourself having lots of people pay you a lot of money, like to see client, client, client paying me money. If you guys have an online business, see yourself getting paid a lot of money. If you have a normal job, see yourself getting a huge bonus or a huge raise or working at a different company, getting a lot more money. Now, I'm throwing you guys in. Imagining things is kind of a muscle, so if you haven't worked on the muscle, this is why I'm really having you guys do this today, so that you can really, really, really start working with this. If you haven't used the muscle, you might have to play with it a little bit. Okay, and the intent is more important than the imagining, believe it or not. If you keep intending that this is going to happen, no matter what, and you can kind of feel it, that's way more powerful intention. Now, we're going to take yourself, and we're going to go five years into the future. Okay, so let's go five years in the future. That'll be five years from now. Okay, again, I want you to get a picture of your family around you happy. I want you to ask how many new people are in your life that are really close friends. Okay, and whatever the number is, you can increase it. All right, picture whatever kind of house you're in, and you're standing in the kitchen again, looking at your computer. And look down at yourself and see yourself as healthy and happy and nicely dressed, kind of thin, you know, whatever that is for you, that you associate healthy, whatever healthy and young looking is. Open up your profit/loss for the month. Okay, see a huge amount of profit coming in. And I'm going to ask you to notice any other detail about what you're doing. Like if you open up your calendar, what are you doing to make the money? And notice how happy you are, thrilled that in the last five years of your life, you changed it, upgraded it, you're different. You're alive. You're well. Family is alive and well. Everything's great. Better than you could ever expect. It's okay for your business to be whatever you want your business to be. But even if it's a not-for-profit, I had to help a friend, she labeled her business a not-for-profit and she started losing money, as funny as that sounds. So I said, "Why don't you just call it your happy new adventure, where you generate a lot of money through it and you're able to give it all away." You know, because when she started calling it a not-for-profit, it started affecting the other part of her business. Even if it's a not-for-profit, label it inside yourself a for-profit. Okay, see yourself profitable, happy, alive, well. Now, go 10 years into the future. See yourself looking happy, alive, well. Surrounded by family and friends who love and adore you. See yourself in the house that you really want to live in. See that all your plans have gone the way you wanted them to. See loving, caring, friends and mates, you feeling happy. See your profit and loss statement generating profit every month. No matter what you're doing, your investments have paid off. So now, ask that future self if he or she would tell you something, like if they could give you some advice right now, what would the advice be? How could you generate more profit? And when you're ready, just open your eyes, knowing all as well, that it's easy to create this. I want you guys to tell me kind of what happened for you. Could you get connected? Okay, and I'm going to do a couple clearing statements. So for anybody who couldn't vision very well or think they have blocks on their intuition visioning their life, we're going to ask that anywhere you shut down your awareness or your creation, or, you know, you had parents or teachers say, oh, I can't imagine things, uncreate, delete at all. Anywhere imagination's not good for you, uncreate and delete it all. Everywhere you're too tired to make things happen, uncreate, delete it all. Anywhere, you blocked your knowing, your seeing, your visualizing, everywhere you don't think you're a visual person, uncreate, delete it all. Okay, so for some of you, you might not have gotten practical stuff, and it might just be symbolic energy. But later on you go live your life, and like, shazam, it'll just kind of show up. So I'm going to do this, everywhere you guys are blocking everything that we just got a vision of from showing up in the next 3 months instead of 10 years, so anywhere you don't think you can show it up in 3 months, uncreate and delete it all. Everywhere you don't think you're ready to take some massive action and change your life, uncreate, delete all that. Anywhere you're not willing to live in the truth of your future high, happy version of yourself, uncreate, delete all that. Anywhere you're not willing to generate massive amounts of income in the next one year, uncreate, delete all that. Any of you who had your mom and dad who didn't want you to look into the future, uncreate, delete all that. Anywhere looking into the future is not right or witchy or evil or any of that kind of stuff, uncreate, delete all that, too. If you guys are willing to ask your future self what you need to do today, that might make it really clear. So I would always ask my future self, what action can I take today that will get me to this, you know, this thing that I'm imagining? And then see if you get a download of what to do that day. I'm going to tell you guys a story. I don't know if I told it on the Unlimited Abundance journey, but I learned how to visualize things, and I'm standing on the L tracks, I'm freezing my tush off, I'm in Chicago. It is like so cold, and I said, "I need to get out of here." So I just visioned myself in a warm place. It felt like Florida, and I visioned myself with a condo in Florida, a red Mercedes convertible, and a guy who totally adored and loved me. And I visualized myself rich. So I saw myself well-dressed, red Mercedes convertible, condo in Florida. I actually didn't know that condos could be cheap. I actually thought from my 20-year-old version of myself, because my neighbors had a condo in Florida and a home in Illinois, so I thought they were rich because they had two houses, right? So I thought a condo was rich. Anyway, I just visualized it. And shortly thereafter, I pretty much had that life. And the way it worked out, I didn't picture that. I didn't know that in the moment when I'm doing the vision. Do you understand? So I didn't know that. But I literally have a picture with me and my red Mercedes convertible, I'm living in Florida. I totally forgot I'd asked about it. I wrote it in a diary, and I later on found my diary that I totally visualized it and asked for it. So just because you're not getting specific how-tos in this two seconds does not mean that you're doing anything wrong. In my case, it happened within a year. And I probably would've never been able to picture how it happened, it was just really serendipitous. But I just had a knowing that it would happen. Everywhere you're avoiding the future 'cause you don't like it, uncreate and delete it all. Everywhere you think the future is going to have more worries in it, uncreate, delete it all. Everywhere you think the future is, I can't live now, so why would the future be possible, uncreate, delete all that. Everywhere you think your whole life is blocked, uncreate and delete all that. Everywhere you have no idea how to believe in yourself, uncreate and delete all that. Okay, any of you who have a hard time going into the future, uncreate, delete all that. Anywhere your mothers and fathers didn't want you to see the future, delete all that. So everywhere you guys are trying so hard instead of just being relaxed and allowing yourself to be in the flow, uncreate and delete all that. Everywhere you think everything in your life is hard work, including visualization, uncreate and delete all that. Okay, everywhere it's not safe, right, or good to go to school, delete all that. Everywhere you hate school, delete all that. Everywhere you guys hate learning something new, delete all that. Everywhere learning is hard, uncreate, delete all that. Any teacher or authority figure who told you you were stupid, uncreate, delete all that. Anywhere you think you're stupid, uncreate and delete all that. So basically you're making a new history. And you know, at the end of the day, it really is small steps. It really is. Now, you guys brought in a big download of your future self, so it might not have all processed for some of you. That's okay, so if you're having any little processing glitches, anywhere it's hard for you to see your future, know your future, or trust your future, uncreate and delete all that. Okay, anywhere you guys have blocks on being spiritual and making money, uncreate and delete all that. Anywhere else you guys feel blocked from getting any awareness or answers directly from your future self, uncreate and delete all that. Your body is basically, you know, the structure through which energy flows. And if you drink lots of water, eat lighter foods, don't fill yourself up with so much stuff, it allows the energy to move more easily. Okay, everywhere tests are hard, delete all that. Everywhere you guys can't be happy, healthy, alive, and well, uncreate and delete all that. Anywhere your soul was showing you some of the negative energy that you have in you, uncreate and delete all that. Everywhere you don't think this can be in your future, uncreate and delete all that. One step at a time, so I would make it practical. Ask your future self, what is one step I can take today? What is one step I can take today to manifest my abundant future? Anywhere it's hard for you to go back and make it real, uncreate and delete all that. Anywhere you're unclear about your future, uncreate, delete all that. Anywhere you get scared about your future, uncreate, delete all that. Anywhere you got stuck in I don't know, uncreate and delete all that. Anywhere you make it harder than it is for yourself in your life, uncreate and delete all that. Anywhere you kind of overthink things and talk yourself out of it and prejudge things, uncreate, delete all that. Okay, so what would it take for you to just take some action and care less about mistakes? Okay, uncreate and delete all that. Yeah, so everywhere you guys are avoiding miracles, uncreate and delete all that. Basically when you're thinking about it, you're creating it. Like if somebody's manifesting something now, what are they doing different? Well, the real truth is, they're connected to the light so deeply, and they allow it to come in, and then they have no fear about change, okay? Like see, here's the deal. I am so willing for my life to be totally different tomorrow, like I don't really care if I blow up my whole entire life and it looks totally different tomorrow. And because I have no fear of it being completely and totally different, I really don't, I have no, if you guys can feel the energy when I'm talking about it, like I have no fear of it being different tomorrow. I will happily delete the whole thing and show up tomorrow different. And because I'm willing to do that, things show up pretty quickly, okay? So that's the difference, the difference is, is I don't really care if everything leaves my life and a whole new life replaces it. That's just me. But I would picture what you really want. So if you want some of the old loves in your life, keep them there. But if you want like a higher upgraded life, really just don't care what you're going to have to do. And the other thing is I don't really care what I have to do. If you told me I had to like call a hundred cold calls tomorrow and conjure up business and get people to pay me money for being me, I could do that, no problem. Do you understand? You could drop me off, I don't know, in Antarctica, and I'd figure it out. Hopefully I'd have a jacket, but you know, besides that. That's like the difference, are you guys willing to do whatever it takes to make cash? Making cash is not that hard. Are you willing to talk to enough people and talk them into giving you money and you giving something in exchange? That's really the game, that's it. So you provide a service, offer to do something, somebody gives you money. And if you talk to enough people, you know, are you guys willing to talk to a hundred people and have 50 of them say yeah, or 20 of them say yeah, or 10 of them say yeah? Okay, that's basically all manifesting is. Any past life that you are stuck in, anybody listening here, any past life that you guys are stuck in, uncreate, delete, de-story the whole thing. All agendas that keep you guys stuck, uncreate and delete all that. All decisions that you guys have to keep you stuck forever, uncreate and delete all that. Anywhere you guys did something bad in some past life and you won't let yourself off the hook forever and ever and ever, for all eternity, and you're going to punish yourself till death do you part, uncreate and delete all that. Any other past life or this life where you're so deeply ashamed and guilty that you won't let yourself off the hook and you have to keep ruining your life forever and ever, uncreate and delete all that. So anywhere you guys got damaged yourself so much that you will never let yourself off the hook, uncreate, delete all that. Okay, anywhere you're still trying to make your mom and dad happy by playing small, so any of you guys that are playing small, being like little kids, let your mommy and daddy be better than you, uncreate and delete all that. Anywhere you're doing that for your mate or your partner, you're playing small and staying the same so they still love you, and you are not willing to change 'cause you're afraid that you might lose love, uncreate and delete all that. Anywhere else you guys don't want to change 'cause you're afraid you might lose some loved ones. It's kind of emotionally blackmailing if you think about it. 'Cause if it's true love, they'll just love you anyway, right? Like why do they really, you know what I mean? If you're better and you're happy, they'll love you anyway. And if they don't, it's really their problem. So don't let somebody emotionally blackmail you into staying the same. So anywhere you guys are unconsciously letting people control your future so you get love, uncreate and delete all that. What about your husband and kids? Just visualize them happy coming along with you. So anywhere you guys are fearful, uncreate and delete it all. Anywhere you guys are afraid of change, uncreate, delete it all. Everywhere it's safer to not change than to change, uncreate and delete all that. Any anger that you're still holding onto, resentment, even if it's unconscious to you, uncreate and delete all that. If anybody's tried to ever shut you down, uncreate, delete it all. Across all time, dimension, space, reality, across all genetic, family. Anybody listening who feels shut down by people, places, and things, uncreate and delete it all. So we're going to go back to this list for one minute. So grateful, just work on being grateful for everything that shows up in your life. Joyful and peaceful, all right? And you can do that. So just think of something you're grateful for. Like grateful that you're on the call, grateful that you connected to your future self, grateful that something's new in your life, grateful that you can breathe. Be bigger than your future, that means you're connected to the light, so your energy is more expanded. You're going to play out the roles of how you want it to be, and then be bolder than you're being. Remember how I said I'm willing to let my life be totally different tomorrow? I don't have to be stuck in the same program, the same pattern, I'm willing to just blow it all up. So what if you guys were willing to just be completely different tomorrow? And start acting, you know, like an actor, right? We did the actor thing the last time. What if you're willing to just act out as if you're healthy, vibrant, manifesting god and goddess kind of self, just making everything work in your world, right? So just pretend for a little bit being that version of yourself. What can you invite into your life that is that version? Now, we're going to talk about staying safe. If you play small, 'cause somewhere subconsciously or unconsciously you think that's safer, or if you're doing some of these things, like are you saying, "This isn't working. Why is this not working?" So all of you guys who say that, uncreate and delete all that. Anywhere you put into your past and your future that this isn't working, so it keeps not working, uncreate and delete all that. Anywhere else you're going, "Oh, I'm still blocked," uncreate and delete all that. Anywhere you're saying, "Oh, I'm still blocked, and I'm always blocked," uncreate and delete all that. Instead of saying I'm always blocked or this isn't working, which stops the energy of all the good work that you've been doing, I would just say, what would it take for everything to speed up and all my blocks to reveal themselves now? What would it take for any block I have to be deleted, uncreated, and de-storied, across all time, dimension, space, reality, across all genetic fields, all holographic fields, all morphic fields. What would it take for any block that you think you have to be instantly and easily removed? What would it take for you guys to quit being your mother and father's version of life and love? Uncreate and delete all that. All right, so massive action. Always asking for help from your future self. I want you guys to just be completely rational for one minute. If I just be logical, okay, if you wanted to go make a ton of money, what would you go do? If you just wanted to have tons of abundance, what would you go do? So what if you could just go do that thing? So whatever popped in your mind when I asked that question, what would it take for you to be the qualities of your future self? What would it take for you guys to be abundant now? What would it take for you to move forward intentionally? What would it take for you to deliver the new lifestyle now? And 30 to 40 times a day, can be all at one time. What vibrational energy can I become to allow my future self to bring abundance into my life now? I'm going to just really acknowledge this, because I can see you guys before and after. You guys really did kind of bring in a lot more energy today than you might have fully acknowledged or processed, okay? So even though it seemed kind of simple 'cause you were imagining things, you were imagining things connected to the light, which means you have the power. Okay, so love you bunches.

LESSON 17: Generate Your Future Self (Clearing Session Only)

Let's connect to the light a little bit so that we're all just sort of connecting. So close your eyes. Take your energy at 300 feet. See, sense, or feel the light. See, sense, or feel consciousness itself. Okay, allow the source conscious energy to come into your crown, opening up all of your intuitive awareness, all your knowing, releasing anywhere you prejudge the future. And lock it away like as if it could never happen. So anywhere you prejudge the future, delete all that. Okay, allow this light to come into your third eye so you can see your future. Allow the light to come into your ears so you can hear about your future in a divinely guided way. Okay, ask the light to come into your throat so you can communicate and talk positively as if the future is already manifested now. Oftentimes, I will just talk as if I'm living my future self. Allow the light to come into your heart, creating a gateway for new abundance, showing up in your life this week. Now, allow this light to come into your solar plexus. Okay, allow the light to come into your, yes, your root, clearing out your abdomen area, clearing out anywhere you're blocked on your power, anywhere you're blocked on your root. Okay, allow the light to come into the ground. into the center of the planet, a beam of light connecting to the part of the planet that's totally conscious right in the center. Okay, allow this light to reflect back straight up into the middle of your heart, radiating out 360 degrees all the way around like a great central sun, moving you into a bubble of light. Ask this light to get bigger than your body. Ask this light to get bigger than the building you're in. Ask this light to get bigger than the city you're in. See this light around you. Expand past the city. Expand past the state. Expand past the country. Expand past the earth. You are now connected to the oneness of it all. Bigger than the problems. Able to correct them. Yes, and bring in your new future. Alright, so you guys set the intent that everything that's blocking you is going to get cleared today, okay? Let's go through this and let's see what comes up. All right, so I'm just going to do this. So everything that you guys are asking about or think that you're blocked with, okay, connected to the light, what would it take for you to delete it all right now? What would it take for all of it to leave? Everywhere you feel you can't be the future self and you're stuck in the story, uncreate, delete all stories across all time dimensions, space, reality, core soul history, and genetic. What would it take for all of your stories to be dismantled right now? Everywhere you can't, shouldn't, wouldn't, couldn't. Anywhere in your genetic lineage, you can't, shouldn't, wouldn't, couldn't. Uncreate, delete, destroy across all time, dimension, space, and reality. Everywhere you feel frightened about moving forward, uncreate and delete it all. Everywhere you're having a hard time being of a positive vibration, uncreate, delete it all. Everywhere you think you can't manifest things. Uncreate and delete it all. Everywhere you guys are, whatever got stirred up, whatever that is for you guys, uncreate, delete it all. So we're going to connect right now to your future self. So I'm going to do this. Everywhere you guys are like blocking everything that we just got a vision of from showing up in the next three months instead of 10 years. So anywhere you don't think you can show it up in three months, uncreate and delete it all. Everywhere you don't think you're ready to take some massive action and change your life, uncreate, delete all that. Anywhere you're not willing to live in the truth of your future high, happy version of yourself, uncreate, delete all that. Anywhere you're not willing to generate massive amounts of income in the next one year, uncreate, delete all that. Any of you who had your mom and dad who didn't want you to look into the future, uncreate, delete all that. Anywhere looking into the future is not right or witchy or evil or any of that kind of stuff on create, delete all that too. If you guys are willing to ask your future self what you need to do today, that might make it really clear. So I would always ask my future self, what action can I take today that will get me to this, you know, this thing that I'm imagining. And then see if you get a download of what to do that day. Everywhere you're avoiding the future because you don't like it. Uncreate and delete it all. Everywhere you think the future is going to have more worries in it. Uncreate, delete it all. Everywhere you think the future's, I can't live now, so why would the future be possible? Uncreate, delete all that. Everywhere you think your whole life is blocked, uncreate and delete all that. Everywhere you have no idea how to believe in yourself, uncreate and delete all that. Okay, any of you who have a hard time going into the future, uncreate, delete all that. Anywhere your mothers and fathers didn't want you to see the future. Delete all that.

Okay, anywhere you guys have blocks on being spiritual and making money, uncreate and delete all that. Anywhere else you guys feel blocked from getting any awareness or answers directly from your future self, uncreate and delete all that. Okay, everywhere tests are hard, delete all that. Everywhere you guys can't be happy, healthy, alive, and well, uncreate and delete all that.

Anywhere you will make it harder than it is for yourself in your life, uncreate, delete all that. Anywhere you kind of overthink things and talk yourself out of it and prejudge things, uncreate, delete all that. Okay, so what would it take for you to just take some action and care less about mistakes? Okay, uncreate, delete all that. Yeah, so everywhere you guys are avoiding miracles, uncreate and delete all that. Basically, when you're thinking about it, you're creating it. Any past life that you are stuck in, anybody listening here, any past life that you guys are stuck in, uncreate, delete, destroy the whole thing. All agendas that keep you guys stuck, uncreate and delete all that. All decisions that you guys have to keep you stuck forever, uncreate and delete all that. anywhere you guys like did something bad in some past life and you won't let yourself off the hook forever and ever and ever for all eternity and you're going to punish yourself till death do you part uncreate and delete all that Any other past life or this life where you're so deeply ashamed and guilty that you won't let yourself off the hook and you have to keep ruining your life forever and ever, uncreate and delete all that. So anywhere you guys goddamned yourself so much that you will never let yourself off the hook, uncreate, delete all that. Okay, anywhere you're still trying to make your mom and dad happy by playing small. So any of you guys that are playing small, being like little kids, let your mommy and daddy be better than you, uncreate, delete all that. Anywhere you're doing that for your mate or your partner, you're playing small and staying the same so they still love you and you are not willing to change because you're afraid that you might lose love. Uncreate and delete all that. So anywhere you guys are unconsciously letting people control your future so you get love, uncreate and delete all that. What about your husband and kids? Just visualize them happy coming along with you. So anywhere you guys are fearful, uncreate and delete it all. Anywhere you guys are afraid of change, uncreate, delete it all. Everywhere it's safer to not change than to change, uncreate and delete all that. Any anger that you're still holding on to, resentment, even if it's unconscious to you, uncreate and delete all that.

Anybody listening who feels shut down by people, places, and things? Uncreate and delete it all? Now, we're going to talk about staying safe. If you play small, because somewhere subconsciously or unconsciously you think that's safer, or if you're doing some of these things, like are you saying, this isn't working? Why is this not working? So all of you guys who say that, uncreate and delete all that. Anywhere you put into your past and your future that this isn't working, so it keeps not working. Uncreate and delete all that. Anywhere else you're going, oh, I'm still blocked, uncreate and delete all that. Anywhere you're saying, oh, I'm still blocked and I'm always blocked, uncreate and delete all that. Instead of saying I'm always blocked or this isn't working, which stops the energy of all the good work that you've been doing, I would just say, what would it take for everything to speed up and all my blocks to reveal themselves now? What would it take for any block I have to be deleted, uncreated, and de -storied? Across all time, dimension, space, reality? Across all genetic fields, all holographic fields, all morphic fields? What would it take for any block that you think you have to be instantly and easily removed? What would it take for you guys to quit being your mother and father's version of life and love? Uncrate and delete all that. What would it take for you to be the qualities of your future self? What would it take for you guys to be abundant now? What would it take for you to move forward intentionally? What would it take for you to deliver the new lifestyle now? And 30 to 40 times a day can be all at one time. What vibrational energy can I become to allow my future self to bring abundance into my life now? You guys really did kind of bring in a lot more energy today than you might have fully acknowledged or processed, okay? So even though it seemed kind of simple because you're imagining things, you're imagining things connected to the light, which means you have the power. Okay, so love you bunches.

LESSON 18: Transforming Abundance Blocks into Profits

- Hey, this is Christie Marie Sheldon, and you're listening to a recording I did of a series of 24 live group sessions on clearing your abundance blocks. And here's what we're covering today in session number 18. First up today, your personal profit and loss statement. We're going to figure out if you're making a profit in your personal business, the business of you. This is an amazing tool to figure out where you're excelling and what areas need some work. Then I'm going to teach you to know your numbers, because if you do, they can provide a map to your financial blocks. And once we know those, we can blast them right out of your energy field. And we're also going to find out what kind of millionaire are you? Are you the kind with lots of stuff to take care of, or are you the kind with lots of money in the bank? So let's begin. Hey, welcome, welcome. How are you guys today? It is a gorgeous day today, and we are on "Unlimited Abundance Journey", session 18. I am so happy to be here today with you guys. So as you guys know, grab a piece of paper so you can jot down some notes, anything that you learned new, or you want to clear later, it'll always be good to like, write those things down, be open to change. You can take that two ways, right? Changing your life and/or bringing in more cash in the form of change. Set your intent. Let's set your intent a little bit on what you hope to achieve tonight. So just take a moment. What do you hope to achieve tonight? All right, and what do you hope to achieve in the next couple of weeks? Okay. Let's journey together. Favorite part of the night, inspiring stories. So let's see what we have here today. Galena said she is experiencing lots of lightness in her life. Something clicked in week nine and the other day, she woke up feeling light as a feather. She says she doesn't know what makes this feel better, but she just woke up feeling different. Because sometimes what happens is just, you never know when that week will show up, it could be week five, two, three, 10. Whatever week it is for you, where all of a sudden this new reality kind of pops over your whole world. Amber wanted to improve her ability to manifest, and to receive and totally upgrade her life. But she noticed that she gets down on herself. That's like one of her little patterns. During one of the sessions when we were talking about, oh yeah, yeah. When I did one of the things I said in the session, I said, you know, if you're getting down on yourself, then you're probably stopping the energy of all the good work, right? So basically, if you say, "Oh, this isn't working, this isn't working for me," that kind of slows the energy down. Because the universe loves you enough to do what you ask it to do. So she started clearing all of those things that made her think that it wasn't working and things aren't going to work. Now she a great new car. Her partner bought her a used BMW convertible. Awesome. Then she got herself monthly parking at work, so she didn't have to rush around each morning, searching for street parking. She says she is now completing her billing in a timely matter, rather than waiting for everything to pile up. So she's not stressed about bills. So she's changing her whole outlook about money and paying things. Started saving 10% of whatever she makes, and not touching it. But she now has a goal to pay off all her credit cards in a year. She's been attracting new networking contacts. She says she feels shy in large groups, but now all of a sudden, people are randomly inviting her out for coffee. She trusts her intuition more and it's working. She couldn't find an old vehicle title the other day, and she kept doing what would it take for me to find it? What would it take for me to find it? Then she walked out to the storage shed and there was clearly the visible in one of her storage bins. She's not procrastinating anymore. She's more productive. She's more relaxed. People keep commenting on how relaxed she is. So that's really great. Awesome. So today, we are going to work on, what is your worth? Are you getting paid what you are worth? Okay. So it's a lot about net worth today. So hopefully, you guys have pieces of paper. Or hopefully, if you don't have pieces of paper, you're really good at doing math in your head. I'm going to ask you to take a total of what your income was for the last five years. And here's how I want you to do it. So like, for instance, we already know it's August. So if you generally know that you make about 10,000 a month in the month of 2011, then you know that your take home at the end of the year will probably be 120. So I want you to fill these all in, and I'll give you a little minute, and divide everything by five. Amber, so basically, how much income did you generate before taxes or any of those things? Because that's how much you're willing to kind of receive. Susan's saying she was a stay at home mom, and she didn't generate money itself. So let me ask how to do this for you. If you had to pay somebody to do what you were doing at home, however much that was, but like, let's just say you were with your husband, and you could say, well, I did $200,000 worth of work, but your husband only brought in 30,000 a year. Let's just say, you know what I mean? So you're going to have to like, really kind of look at it from the point of view in your household. How much could you have afforded to pay somebody to do what you did? We're talking about income in the past five years. We're going to do income, not like profit/loss yet, or assets for a minute. Just do your income. So let's just say in the year 2010, you brought in $98,000. In the year 2009, you brought in 72,000. In the year 2008, you, yourself brought in 88,000. If you didn't work, and you were a stay at home mom, like if you would have had to go to work and pay somebody to do what you were doing, how much would that be? And then after you have that number, and just do the best you can, okay? So you'll kind of see where I'm going with this a minute. Okay. So Gabriela, then I would put zero. Okay? We'll just work from there. Don't get too judgmental about the number yet. 'Cause it's true. 'Cause sometimes you have to invest in yourself, but Gabriela, you've been going to school for two years. So what did you make in the last three years prior to then? And whatever that number is. And then divide whatever the, so we're writing down five years and there's a total that happens. So add up your 2011, 2010, 2009, 2008, 2007. Divide that by five, whatever that number is. Get as close as you can to the average income that you energetically allow to come into your life. So now, we're going to do some clearings on that number. Okay? Because the reason I took an average over five years is because you're right. Some people went to school, some people did some things. Oscar is saying the last five to eight years have been bad. Can I go to 10 to 12 years? The answer is no. And here's why. We're going to clear whatever's coming up for you now that only allowed you to bring in X amount of money in the last few years. Okay? 'Cause your energy must be different than 10, 12 years ago. We're going to clear whatever is blocking you right now that energetically keeps you only allowing that much to show up in your world. So Irene's saying as she has somebody who hasn't been paid for two years 'cause he was in an accident. So just calculate that in as if he received nothing. So I get that it's because of an accident, but he must be blocked if the insurance companies and things like that aren't paying as well. So we're going to kind of include that in the number. I know it's kind of hard because isn't it interesting, all the confusion or justifications that come up a little bit. Okay. So let's just do one random clearing right now. Everywhere, you guys are stopping the flow of income into your life, in the form of cash, money, benefits, all those things, everything that is, will you uncreate. Oh, I forgot to connect to light, but uncreate, delete, and de-story it all. Okay. So close your eyes. Hookup. Hookup and look up. See, sense or feel the light that is pure source energy. That is what you're made of. That is the most loving, supportive, kind, caring, happy, gorgeous thing. Okay. Ask the light to come through your head. Come through your throat, opening up in your crown. All your knowing, opening up in your crown, the ability to do receive true, divine knowledge. Opening up in your throat the ability to receive any information you need to unblock your communication. Okay, ask the light to come through into your heart so that you can have true guidance, true commitment to yourself, true kindness to yourself in increasing your self worth and your worth. Asking the light to come into your solar plexus, opening up all nerve energy, nervous energy, feeling sucker punch. We're going to ask that to clear. Ask the light to come into your root so that you're grounded and fully happy in the energy of the power that you are, feeling supported, feeling grounded, feeling rooted, feeling supported always. Allow the light to come into the center of the planet. See, sense, or feel the connection in the center of the planet. Allow this connection to rebound and basically come straight back up into your legs, your hips, your stomach, your heart, radiating out, 360 degrees, like a great central sun. Asking this light to expand past your body. Asking this light to expand past the building you're in. Asking this light to expand past your town. Asking this light to form a big bubble and expand past the state you're in, past the country you're in, and past planet Earth. Everywhere you guys have limited your income for any reason. So all the justifications, all the reasons, all the energy that created something to happen in your life that blocked it, all those somethings will you please uncreate, delete, and de-story it all. Okay, everywhere 'cause income energy has to be asked for and received, right? So everywhere you're unwilling to ask for the energy to show up, will you uncreate and delete it? All everywhere you're unwilling to receive the energy of new income, new sources of income, new insights, new ideas, new follow-through, uncreate and delete it all. If somebody currently owes you money, anywhere you're not allowing that money to show up for yourself, including insurance companies, settlements, exes, parents, any legal ramifications that are holding money up for you, uncreate and delete it all. Okay, anywhere you have the point of view that you don't have time to create extra income, uncreate and delete all that. So you don't have time to call people or ask for help or start a business or anywhere you guys have time constraints that are blocking you from creating extra income. Will you uncreate and delete it all? What I would do is I would ask if you want to increase your income, and you want to do that through the form of a business, a new job, et cetera, et cetera, I would focus on what would it take for me to manifest that and have it show up really, really easy. I think there was a testimony earlier in the part of the Unlimited Abundance Story where somebody got somebody else to write her resume for her. So any of you guys that are blocking the income from showing up somehow, uncreate, delete, and de-story. Any of you guys who are out of work, so you have this energy of can't work, which then generates more can't work, or it might generate your body not working. So any of those things that are generated where you can't work, uncreate, delete, and de-story it across all time, dimension, space, and reality. I had a guy who came to me and his body wouldn't heal. And I said, well that's because it felt like about 15 years ago. He hated his boss and he wanted to get out of quote-unquote working. So what happened is it manifested as his body being, having a degenerative disease happening that created where he didn't have to work. So his body interpreted that I don't work. Okay, so any of you guys who don't think you have what it takes to make your life work or make profit work or increase your income and make that work, will you uncreate, delete, and de-story it all. Everywhere you hate work, uncreate, delete, and de-story it across all time, dimension, space, reality, across all soul decisions to never work. Uncreate, delete all that across all time, dimension, space, reality. Uncreate and delete all the core places where you feel ashamed of your inability to manifest the income you desire. Everything that is, uncreate, delete, and de-story across all time, dimension, space and reality. Anywhere you have a problem following through with that which you know will increase your income. So it might be making a phone call, getting a product out, sending resumes out, whatever that is for you, uncreate, delete, and de-story across all time, dimension, space, and reality. Everywhere you guys believe that the world can interfere with you instead of you taking control of the energy field and fixing it, uncreate, delete, and de-story. Anywhere your income has hampered by your inability to process the truth that you are the creator of your world and that you have the choice to go forward creating it. Everywhere you give away power and don't have the power to do that, uncreate, delete, and de-story across all time, dimension, space, and reality. Some heavy stuff right there. All right, so I want you to think of the amount of money that, it's going to sound funny, what am I going to do. But I went through and I cleared all the various limits that I ever put on every amount of money that I could ever bring in. So I want you guys to think of like however much was the lowest amount you made in the last five years. Okay, so everything that you did to limit it to that amount of money, will you uncreate, delete, and de-story across all time, dimension, space, and reality. Whatever you were thinking, doing, and being that generated only that much money, uncreate, delete, and de-story it all. Okay, anywhere you don't feel like you fit in, and so therefore, you won't make life work for you. You instead basically try to fit you into the world instead of you making the world fit into you. Yes, uncreate, delete, and de-story across all time, dimension, space, and reality. That's a big one. So how many of you guys are like basically being contortionists, contorting yourself into the world, instead of just choosing how you want the world and having it contort into you? So everything that is uncreate, delete, and de-story. All the justifications, excuses, bypass systems where you keep thinking over and over and over again "I can't make my life work. I can't get work. I can't get more money. I can't, I can't, I can't," uncreate, delete, and de-story across all time, dimension, space, reality. Everywhere you think somebody screwed you over money, and that's holding you up, uncreate, delete all that. Anywhere you haven't forgiven yourself over money. Uncreate, delete all that. Okay, so I'm going to just clear this. Everywhere you guys think lottery is the only way, like that you can't generate an income on your own, uncreate, delete all that. Now again, you can go ahead and win the lottery, but wouldn't it be cool to know that you could generate money in 10 different ways and have it be no big deal? So everywhere you're limiting that, uncreate, delete all that. Everywhere, it takes money to make money. So therefore, you need money before you can get money, uncreate, delete all that. Okay, everywhere you're afraid to step out and be different than who you're currently being, uncreate, delete all that. All the limits that you currently put on the second greatest number. So think of like the last five years, whatever that number is, the fourth, in order, second lowest, uncreate, delete everything that created that limit in your life. All right, everywhere you're afraid to ask people for money or sell product, even if you're the product. So everything that is, uncreate and delete at all times, yeah, times a gazillion. Everywhere you're afraid to ask people for money, influence people to give you money, influence the world to give you money, influence people into buying products, which give you money. Everything that is, uncreate and delete it all, across all time, dimension, space, and reality. All right, so everywhere you still have pain in your body regarding work, anywhere you have emotional resistance to work, uncreate, delete all that across all time, dimension, space, reality. Everywhere your heart is not happy. Uncreate, delete it all. Everywhere your heart can't get happy enough for you to go generate extra income, uncreate, delete it all. Everywhere you're down on yourself, ashamed of yourself, stopped yourself, blocked yourself, uncreate, delete all that too. Everywhere your heart is weary of who you are being and you won't let yourself off the hook and move into the higher generating income earner, everything that is uncreate, delete all that. Okay, everywhere When you generate opportunities, you think it's too good to be true, so therefore, it doesn't work out, and it falls through, everything that is, uncreate and delete it all. Everywhere you're so used to failing that when it shows up, you can't believe it, therefore, you can't believe it out of your reality. So anytime you guys say, I can't believe it, you hide things from yourself. So if something shows up in your world, you really have to say, how do I get more than this? How do I get it to follow through? What will it take for this to follow through easy? How do we get more of these kinds of deals? And everything in the way of that, uncreate and delete it all. All right. Ooh, that's a lot of energy right there. Okay, how many of you are programmed for despair regarding money? So any of your parents' genetic energies, anywhere you can't make more than your parents made. There, or more than your last mate made, or more than your current mate makes. Uncreate, delete all that. Okay, take the third amount of money in order. Okay so everything creating that limit, uncreate and delete all that. How many other contradictions in your world do you have limiting the amount of money you can bring in? Everything that is, uncreate and delete it all. Everywhere it has to be hard to make money, uncreate and delete at all. Everywhere you're scared to make more money because you might have to change, uncreate, delete all that. Anywhere you're blocking yourself from taking whatever the right divine action is to get more money, uncreate and delete all that. Okay, what would it take for your heart to love you enough to let you off the hook and just go forward? Everything in the way that, uncreate and delete it at all. So take the fourth amount of money, everything creating that limit in your life, uncreate and delete all that. Everywhere that there's a limit to how much money you could have earned that year and you limited it, uncreate and delete all that. All the reasons why you limited it, you didn't have enough time, it wasn't working. Even if you say, "It was the best year I ever had," that can be a limit because then it will never be a better year than the best year. Do you understand? So anywhere you guys have already had the best year you ever had, therefore, you can't have anything better, uncreate and delete it all. Okay, everywhere you're afraid and tired. And so therefore, nothing works in your world, uncreate and delete it all. Everywhere you have no idea why your life doesn't work. So you're stuck in this whole identity of, I have no idea. Uncreate and delete all that. Everywhere you're unwilling to support yourself, uncreate and delete all that. Everywhere you're waiting for somebody else to support you, uncreate and delete all that. Think of your income being quadrupled, okay? Everything in the way of that occurring in your life, uncreate and delete it all. Everything, think of it being a multiplied times 10. Okay, anything in a way of creating that in your life, uncreate and delete all that. Everywhere you can't accept the flow of particles called money, uncreate and delete all that. How many of you have been watching the news in the last like few days, and you believed it? Okay, so anywhere you guys believed everything that's been in the news about the S&P, and about America's credit rating and any of you guys who aligned and agreed with it and took it in and made it real and judged it and kept it close to you. Anything that is, uncreate and delete at all. All the judgements that you guys had, which side of the world's going to doo-doo, everything that is, uncreate and delete at all. Let's just say you are a business because the truth is you are a business, okay? So Jacqueline, everywhere you're holding anger in your throat 'cause you don't want to say what you really think, uncreate and delete it all. Everywhere you guys don't want to be responsible for making more money, or responsible for more people. So you don't want to get a raise 'cause you don't want to like have to be in charge of 30 people or 40 people instead of two people. So anywhere you guys don't want to be responsible, uncreate and delete it all. Anywhere you guys can't be responsible for huge amounts of energy because really what it is at the end of the day, the more energy you're willing to hold, the more income you can bring in. So higher income earners are willing to hold a lot of energy. Okay, uncreate and delete all that. Okay, if you're paid more, you're ripping people off. So therefore, you're a thief and a loser and negative and bad and evil, everything that is uncreate and delete it all. Okay, everywhere, Jack, you're in the ebb and the flow of life, instead of just being the creator of your world. Everything that is, uncreate and delete it all. Everywhere you hold yourself back, right when you're about to make it big, uncreate and delete it all. Everywhere your whole belief is that you'll never make it big, uncreate and delete it all. Everywhere you guys think it's wrong, if you're a spiritual in nature, to make it big or a big time, uncreate and delete all that too. Everywhere you have no idea why you're here on the planet, so why bother with income? Uncreate and delete all that. Okay, everywhere you're afraid to handle a lot of money because you don't know what you're going to do with it, uncreate and delete it all. So anybody who has that objection, what I'm going to ask you to do is find a financial planner that you can talk to, and get some information, like how much money do you need to generate and how does it have to be in order for you to retire pretty comfortably, have like a good life? So Maureen, your homework is find a financial planner and talk to them a little bit. So you can get through all your fears and lack of knowledge. Okay, so Beth, everywhere, you're heavy with your life, uncreate and delete it all. Okay. So Kathleen, everywhere you guys decided in some, you know, it doesn't matter, the '80s, the '90s, the '70s, the 2000s, anywhere you decided that that's enough money. So somewhere, you guys decided, "Oh, that's enough money. I don't need anymore." Everything that is, uncreate and delete it all. Everywhere you're oh, that's enough money. I don't really need more. I just, and everywhere you thought like, oh, if I make this much money, I made it. And then once you made that much money, you've never gotten above it, uncreate and delete at all. Every one of you who thinks I'm not allowed to have more money than God, uncreate and delete all that. Okay, there. I had to clear that for a few spiritual people. Okay, everywhere you're afraid you're going to do the same thing over and over and over again, uncreate and delete all that. Okay, so everywhere when you make a lot of money, you don't pull in the right people to help and support you. 'Cause you have to basically, in any business that you have, have people who can also hold the energy of bringing in money. Otherwise, your staff will cause you problems because they'll basically bankrupt you, cause things to break, spend your money. So you have to have staff that are willing to think consciously about how do we focus on profit for the company. Everything in the way of that, uncreate and delete it all. Okay, that's a lot of money right there. Okay, everywhere you guys are stuck going forward, which is the right side of your body, or stuck in receiving more money, the left side of your body. Everything that is, uncreate and delete it all. Okay, any of your heart that's blocking your future, uncreate and delete all that too. Anywhere you guys are staying in jobs that are abusive and accepting less than what you were worth, uncreate and delete it all. Everywhere you guys are working for people who don't have like, basically, if you're working for a company that doesn't like money, or is cheap or not abundant or any of those things, that's not going to fit for you so much. Okay, so everything that is, uncreate, delete it all. So everywhere you guys don't like money, Chris, everywhere you don't really like money, and don't understand it and don't understand why you need it. Everywhere you guys are in limbo, uncreate and delete all that. Everywhere you can't visualize the big money. Whoever said that, I think it was Lucy. Lucy, I'm going to ask you to really, really, really work on that this week, where you visualize your future self, having a lot of money. Okay, everywhere you guys don't want money because it's going to be a problem or a hassle, uncreate and delete all that. Everywhere you don't want money 'cause you don't want to pay the government taxes. What if your belief was I make so much money and I give half of it away, but I still have way more than I could ever need anyway. Okay, everything in the way of that, uncreate and delete all that. Everywhere you can't make the big money, uncreate and delete all that. Okay, everywhere you guys are not willing to see what your blocks are in this whole thing, uncreate and delete all that. All right, so I want you guys, what I really would really love if you did this a little bit on your own, 'cause we obviously can't do it here, but if you really wrote up a profit/loss for your life. Like in the last year, like really know in the last five years, what your profit and loss was. Now, why would you do that? Not to torture yourself, but just do awareness and then clear everything. Okay, so everywhere you guys lost confidence, declared bankruptcy, feel bankrupt, been working hard and never, ever, ever make it, uncreate and delete at all times a gazillion. Okay. All the energy. So I want you guys to get bigger. If any of you guys are having weird body stuff show up with this, okay. I'm going to ask you to make your energy a lot bigger. Think of expanding it, and think everything in the way of me making like a whole bunch of money in the next 12 months, uncreate and delete it all. All my excuses, all my stops, all my stories, all my problems, uncreate and delete it all across all time, dimension, space, and reality. Okay, you guys let go of a lot of stuff. Dirk, do we do the statements for everything that pops up in our mind and repeat it 30 times or do we only do one of the most important ones and repeat it over and over? I would clear the ones that pop in my mind 'cause they're probably attached to the big ones. So you're probably doing the big one, and then the other ones will show up. So like, let's just say you have a belief. I can't get money. Then you'll have all these other weird, little thoughts will pop up. I would do those like maybe 5, 10, 12 times until it feels like it's gone. And then go back to the main one that you were doing. Okay? So those were probably just little ancillary beliefs attached to the main one, like little pathways. So I would clear all of them. That's how I do it. Okay. So Nanette, what I'm saying is you have a business. 'Cause at the end of the day, you yourself are a business. So I want to all of you guys to think for a moment, okay? You go to work, you bring in income. So what do businesses do? Businesses bring in income, and then you have expenses and then you pay out expenses. And when you pay out expenses and at the end of the year, you have a profit/loss. Like you either made more than you spent, or you spent more than you made. What I'm asking you guys to do is to like really, really look at your life a little bit and kind of push yourself 'cause I know it's not fun, what I'm asking you to do. It could be fun if you could like look at the clearing part of it as fun, but awareness can change a lot of stuff. Okay, so everywhere you guys don't see your own life as that you are a business, and that everything in the world should profit for you. So I go about my life and everything profits me. I get profit in the form of cash. I get profit in the form of love. I get profit in the form of I help people, but I also feel good about it. So that's an emotional profit. So like everything in my life profits me. Okay. So that's how I do my world. Okay. I want you to just take a moment. We're going to work on a profit for a minute. What was your profit after expenses, to the best of your knowledge, for the past five years? And just kind of throw out the numbers to the best of your knowledge. If you knew like two years ago, you put lots of things on credit card, the profit might be zero. Or maybe four years ago, you saved a lot of money. Okay, so do the best you can here 'cause I know you guys might not know all of the numbers, but let's just do the best that you can so that we can work on the clearing profit. Jenny, when you make your energy bigger, kind of focus a little more, well for you, I would focus more in your heart and to see it expanding out, the energy radiating out your heart, bigger than the planet. So Gabriela, there's ebbs and flows. Sometimes, we have to love ourselves enough to get education so we can make more money later on. Okay. So here's what we're going to do for a minute. Let's just say like, I'm getting a few typings here where some of you guys had no profit. Okay, so everywhere you guys don't allow yourself to keep anything at the end of the year and profit from something, go ahead uncreate and delete it all. Everywhere you guys won't let yourself get ahead, uncreate and delete all that time, dimension, space, reality. Everywhere you're not allowed to have profit because if you keep it, you might have to pay taxes on it, uncreate and delete all that. Everywhere you guys feel like you have no time to create profit, okay, uncreate and delete all that times a gazillion. Wow, you guys have a lot of energy here on profit. Okay. Okay. So Christy says she profited over $500,000. I love it. Yes. There would be no profit because there was more losses. So anywhere you guys had more losses instead of profit, uncreate and delete all the stories. So somewhere along the line, I want you to think about those years, okay? So somehow you justified, you told yourself stories, you didn't pay attention to your numbers, and you justified all the reasons why you couldn't have any profit those years, or why you overspent, there's a lot of justifications and stories going on. Okay, so all the justifications and the stories, 'cause at the end of the day, it just means that you weren't willing to like balance your numbers. And it could be because you didn't have the knowledge or whatever reason, but that's still a story. So anywhere you're not willing to be aware enough in the energy of money and finances, uncreate and delete all that. Anywhere you're unwilling to take responsibility for the fact that you spent more money than you kept, uncreate and delete all that. Okay, everywhere you have no idea why you let yourself get talked out of your money, uncreate and delete all that times, yes, a gazillion. Okay, all the financial revenue that you, I hear stop yourself and screw yourself out of because you're not willing to pay attention to your guidance and how to keep it, uncreate and delete all that. Everywhere it's more fun to blow it instead of keep it, uncreate and delete it all. Okay, everywhere it's more fun to spend it on things that you think will give you temporary happiness, kind of like an addiction, uncreate and delete all that. Everywhere you have no clue what your monetary status is, uncreate and delete all that. Any of you that are listening that aren't going to go do your profit/loss statements so you can kind of have a clearer and awareness of your life, uncreate and delete all that. Okay, everywhere you have no idea if you've made profit uncreate and delete all that. Okay, anywhere you guys are a loser at the profit game, uncreate and delete all that. Everywhere you see money as something that you spend, but not something that you keep, uncreate and delete all that. Okay, Margaret never understood the reason to profit. Okay, so everywhere you don't understand the reason for profit, uncreate and delete all that. Okay, so Julia was saying, "What about my profits are better, but I'm behind in savings and buying what I need." But what, is the profit giving you some sort of security? So I don't know the answer to that. So what would it take for you to save more money than you've ever saved? Invest more money than you ever invested. So Michelle does ran a quick P&L in QuickBooks. I love it. Love it. I love it that you have it in QuickBooks. That's amazing. 2009, she profited 2,830. And 2010, she netted 78 bucks. Even if it's because of investments or stock and stocks and options, I'm going to still hold you guys accountable to profit. Okay, so anywhere you guys did investments, but you lost, uncreate and delete all that. Anywhere you guys are doing losing investments, uncreate and delete all that. Everywhere you guys are trading things, and it's a loss, uncreate and delete all the reasons why that happens. Everywhere you feel limited by living within your means, uncreate and delete all that. So Michelle, the one who just ran the QuickBooks, and everybody listening, I'm going to encourage you guys. You know, when I started saying that I create profit in my life, that was one thing. It really changed my life. And I made a little game to see if I could just live, even though my income rose, I did not increase my expenses. Okay, now I had a sort of increased some expenses 'cause I had to hire some employees and things like that. But I didn't like go out and blow a bunch of money. You know what I mean? I didn't go out and buy a bigger house. I didn't go out and buy four cars. I didn't go out and do any of those things because I'd rather have the cash at the end of the day. And me personally, I didn't want to take care of all those things. I was kind of tired of taking care of things. So if any of that fits for anybody listening, I'm going to encourage you, if you run your profit/losses, make it a game of how could I live comfortably and increase your income, but don't change your lifestyle? In "The Millionaire Next Door", it's kind of an interesting book, but that's pretty much what the millionaires next door did. They lived pretty frugally. They didn't really overspend. They kind of had nice things, but they didn't blow a lot of money when they increase their income. Okay? Okay, Galena has needles in her chest. So all the places you guys are heartbroken over this whole quandary over now, what do I do? I'm not profitable, uncreate and delete it all. 'Cause I want you to think for a moment, what would it be like for you guys to live off of half your money or a quarter of your money? And all of it just goes into savings, or some sort of investment that you can technically write off so therefore, you don't have to pay any taxes, but which saves you money, but later on, you'll make money from it. So that's called having a good accountant. Everywhere you guys are unwilling to think like that, uncreate and delete it all. So I'm going to go into the "Millionaire Next Door" a minute. There's basically two kinds of millionaires he found. There was the millionaires, like the doctors, lawyers who lived in big houses, but they blew all their money. And the reason they blew all their money is because they had to keep up with the Joneses because they were doctors and lawyers, right? They're professional people. People expected them to have big money. And at the end of the year, they blew all their money. Then there was the other millionaires who basically were working class millionaires, had their own business. They had their own business, generally speaking. And they just like live below their means, and socked all their money away. And pretty much through the energy of increasing their income, running their business and compound interest and investments, they became millionaires. Whereas like the doctors and lawyers, even though they brought in a large amount of money, at the end of it, they didn't have anything to show for it. Okay. So this is a really good book to read, by the way. And they even have one called "The Millionaire Woman Next Door" too. There is something very fascinating with the women. What happened with the women is if the women didn't date a lot of men before they got married, and then they ended up getting divorced, they'd lose their money. So we found like there was two different kinds of millionaire women. There were the ones that were happily married, who stayed married, and kept all their money, and then ones that got divorced and then lost their money. So there was also like other factors in that. Okay, so everywhere when you guys think of the subject of money, you can't see it, uncreate and delete it all. Anywhere where you guys think of the energy of numbers, doing the math, doing the numbers, uncreate and delete all that. Anywhere you don't think you could live below your means and have enough leftover, uncreate and delete all that. Everywhere you guys don't think you have the stick-to-itiveness to just follow a good, common sense about saving money, uncreate and delete all that. Anywhere you guys don't think you can get rich. If you make 120,000 a year, there's stories of people who just saved the money over 20, 30 years. I can't remember the exact statistic, but if you only live off of like half of that, you'll have plenty of money in 10, 15, 20 years through investments, interests, things like that. So anywhere you guys are unwilling to be that conservative and make a bigger choice for yourself in keeping the cash, uncreate and delete all that. Everywhere your whole game with money is about spending it versus keeping it on, uncreate and delete all that. Everywhere you don't have the confidence to keep it, or the confidence to repair your idea about it, okay, uncreate and delete all that. Any of you guys who are going into unconsciousness at this very subject, uncreate and delete all that. Yeah. Love it. So Margaret, yeah, I would do a profit and a loss just so you can like really, and then I would just sit there for a week and just really say everything that created this in my life, uncreate and delete it all. Okay? Like that's really going to be your homework, is look at some of these numbers that you've generated for yourself, and just say every story that I have that created this in my life, every point of view, every justification that created this in my life, uncreate and delete it all. Okay. Everywhere hanging onto profit makes you a miser. Like you're like some crippled, old man who just like is miserable. Uncreate and delete all that. Do I think people from certain cultures are very good at making money, negotiating, and saving? Yeah, if it's been passed in through their lineage, yes. But I've had also like Jewish people who lost a lot of things in the Holocaust, and then they have like this energy of, "Well, we're going to lose it all." You know what I mean? So, but generally speaking, if it's been passed on traditionally in the family, yeah. Okay, so any where this topic is making you guys sick or unconscious, uncreate and delete it all. Everywhere you don't want to let go of all your barriers to going forward and creating more cash, uncreate and delete all that. Well, Grace, if you're going to make investments in a business you have to ask, is it really fear, or is it awareness? Like anything you do, the ideal would be to be so aware, you know exactly who you are and you can look into the future and see if it will make you money. So everywhere you don't think you can be aware enough to see if something will pay off, uncreate and delete all that. Okay, everywhere you guys are set at this whole like despair where you're struggling to survive. You're in survival instinct instead of thrival instinct, uncreate and delete all that. Everywhere you guys are stuck in despair instead of thriving, you're crashing, uncreate and delete all that. Okay, so Chris, anywhere your family's energy is somehow tied into this whole destruction cycle that you have going on, uncreate and delete all this. Any of your families that are stuck in this hole, de-storying your life kind of energy, uncreate and delete all this. Everywhere your family wasn't a really excellent support, so they weren't your cheerleader, uncreate and delete all that. Anywhere anybody took money away from you, uncreate and delete all that. anywhere your family took away your happiness, uncreate and delete all that. Anywhere you never knew what happiness, love, and money were in the family that you grew up in, uncreate and delete all that. Anywhere you're sick and tired of being made fun of, or teased, or even if you do this to yourself about your situation. Okay. Delete all that. So remember how I told you guys about paying yourself first? Out of every check that comes to you, you should pay yourself 10%, just put it somewhere and never touch it. So any of you unwilling to do that, uncreate and delete all that. Okay, any of you who are only willing to like get paid by the hour, instead of getting paid by like sales, commissions, like something like that, that would earn you more money, uncreate and delete all that. So Amber, I would pay yourself maybe like 3%, 5%, 10%, and put a little bit, while you're paying down your debt, I'd also pay, put a little in savings so you feel like you're paying yourself something. But I would look at it like I'm getting myself out of jail, so I'm paying for my future. You know? So anywhere you guys are locked in jail, paying down debt, uncreate and delete it all. Because what you're really doing is you're paying for your future. You're creating a pathway to open up your future, so you can have a future of zero debt and no obligations to anyone. Okay, so everywhere you guys are afraid to move forward and ask questions, so somebody is asking about real estate profit. Well, what would it take for you to like literally just go find a mentor and ask a bunch of questions, so you're totally aware before you actually go do something? And everything in the way of that, uncreate and delete it all. Everywhere you guys are unwilling to ask for help, uncreate and delete all that. Anything and everything that keeps you guys stuck for manifesting great fortunes, uncreate and delete it all. Everywhere, you guys, any energy you have in divorce or getting divorced that somehow stopped your flow of money, uncreate and delete all that. Okay, everywhere money is depressing, uncreate and delete at all. So Chris, who in your life, or when did you decide that money was the root of all evil? So everywhere money is the root of all evil, uncreate and delete all that. Everywhere money is not worth it, uncreate and delete all that. Okay, so Katia, that was a strategy. So if you're trying to sell short, that was a strategy. But I hear, let's just clear anything that came up that made you, just any negative thing in the whole story about what you're doing. Uncreate and delete all that. Everywhere your father and your parents were miserable about their money, uncreate and delete all that. Everywhere money was like the only thing your parents ever fought about, uncreate and delete all that. Everywhere you have, like all these thoughts, emotions, feelings energetically tied into your body about money and manifesting, uncreate and delete all that. All right. So let's look at some of this. So let's just look at some of your expenses. Okay? So think of like, if you had a profit/loss, you guys know what you spend every month, right? Okay. So divide that by five. Okay, so everywhere you guys create a lot of expenses so that you can feel good in your life. Like if you have a lot of expenses and you spend a lot of money, you feel better than if you don't. Everything that is, uncreate and delete all that. Everywhere your expenses are killing you, uncreate and delete all that. All these body things. What if money is killing you? What if that's your problem? Money is killing you? Uncreate and delete all that. What if your whole energy is about money is killing you? Uncreate and delete all that? What if your whole problem in the world is money as killing you? Some of you, that reads really strong and really true. Everywhere, money is killing you. Uncreate and delete all that. Okay, everywhere you have no clue how to manage the thing that you touch every day, probably, money. Uncreate and delete all that. Anywhere money controls you, instead of you controlling your money, uncreate and delete all that. Everywhere you have no clue how to manage your expenses or call up the cable company and ask for a cheaper rate or call like do a little Google search on the best phone rate. So anywhere you guys won't actually research or spend the time to figure out if you're overpaying, so therefore, you're letting companies control you instead of you controlling your money. Basically, you're letting outside authorities, called companies, control you. So everything that is, uncreate and delete all that. Everywhere you guys are caught in credit card debt, uncreate all that. Okay, anywhere you guys have to put it on credit so you can pretend that you're the big spender because basically then what you're doing probably is pretending that you have a lot of money. So everywhere your whole secret desire is to have a lot of money, and at the same time, you think, oh, I can't have a lot of money, uncreate and delete all that. Anywhere your expenses exceed your profit, but you won't ever look at that. So all the reasons why you go unconscious and won't even look at it, uncreate and delete all that. Anywhere you're unwilling to be an excellent money manager, uncreate and delete all that. What would it take for you guys to be an excellent money manager? What would it take for you guys to be an excellent money manager? What would it take for you guys to be the best money manager in your whole life ever now? What would it take for you and your family to be the greatest money managers, the money creators, the money manifesters, everything in the way of that, uncreate and delete all that. Everywhere you guys are unwilling to use the power of compound interest to make yourself rich, uncreate and delete all that. Okay, anywhere else you guys are unwilling to use compound interest, uncreate and delete all that. Okay? So Sheila. It feels like you have an underlying point of view that it's not going to help. So everywhere you guys have this whole like theory, feeling, thought, like I've tried everything else in my life and nothing works, so it creates nothing working, uncreate and delete it all. Everywhere else you think nothing will work, uncreate and delete it all. Everywhere you won't work, uncreate and delete it all. All the lies that you tell yourself about why something won't work for you, or that you can't save money, or you can't, you can't, you can't, uncreate and delete all that. Everywhere energy healing doesn't work for you, uncreate and delete all that. Any of you who think that energy healing works for everybody else, but not me, uncreate and delete all that. Everywhere if you get too powerful and do this energy work, you'll stand out too much. And you don't want to stand out that much, uncreate and delete all that. So Gabriela, you can pay back your old debt. Just pay yourself a little bit, even if it's just like a couple bucks. Just do something that pays yourself a little bit, otherwise, you're saying I can't pay myself. So everywhere you basically typed in what your belief is, "I can't pay myself." Okay, so you're basically putting in energy there that you can't do it. So everywhere you can't pay yourself, uncreate and delete all that. Okay, so I would do, what would it take for me to pay off my debt and pay myself? Everywhere you guys, what would it take for you guys to pay off your debt, pay yourself, have more profit than loss, be totally in charge of your income and be the most amazing money manager ever. Okay, everywhere you guys are still blocked because you got divorced. So when you got divorced, like he kept the money. He screwed you with the money. She screwed you with the money. She took all my money. She took half of my money, and now I'm left with nothing. I have to pay for the kids, and I have nothing. Like any of those beliefs about money that came with divorce, uncreate and delete them all. Everywhere we're fighting over the money, everywhere you guys got divorced because you were fighting over the money, uncreate all that. Yeah, so how many of you guys got divorced because you were fighting over the money? Okay, everywhere you're letting yourself be controlled by the money from a spouse, like everywhere you guys aren't willing to step up to the plate and take control of your own cash, even if it's like shared. So anywhere you guys aren't willing to know the numbers, uncreate and delete all that. I would do what would it take for me and my husband, or me and my wife to be excellent money managers and work on the cash together. Yeah, so Tara, you know, there's other kinds of investments like bonds and things like that, that generally speaking right now are still paying 10, 12%. So Denny, every time you spend your commission money, I would just like put more away or something, is what I would do. I would change the energy as somehow, like change what you do somehow. Yeah, so everywhere, Katia, you can't figure out how to sell it, rent it, buy it, upgrade it, or make 80,000 somehow else, uncreate and delete all that. Anywhere you guys feel like you're limited by your real estate decisions, uncreate and delete all that. Everywhere you feel weak or controlled by money, uncreate all that. Anywhere you guys are controlled by credit cards, bankers, your employees, your employers, uncreate and delete all that. Anywhere you have no idea why you're stuck with no money, uncreate and delete all that. Anywhere you guys are stuck with no money, and you have no idea why. So all those unconscious things that you hide from yourself, uncreate and delete all that. Everywhere debt is the American way, uncreate and delete all that. All your limits on how much money you can make in one shot, uncreate and delete all that. There was an interesting article in the "USA Today" about a couple of weeks ago, it said there was five stocks. It said if you bought these stocks over the last five years, you basically, I can't even remember, but you would of 100 times your money or something. It was like a huge amount of money that you would have made. I think actually thousands of percent increase. Like, you would have made like a million bucks if you had started with 10,000 or something like that. Okay, so anything that's preventing you guys from being that psychic, that aware to just do that, uncreate and delete all that. Okay, anywhere else you guys are afraid to make that much money in a few years, uncreate and delete all that. Anywhere you guys are afraid to stick to a plan, uncreate and delete all that. So obviously, there's a lot of energy here still for some of you. Okay, so Kevita, I would work on, instead of working on degrees and courses and stuff, I would work on taking action.

All those somethings, will you please uncreate, delete, and destroy it all? Okay, everywhere, because income energy has to be asked for and received, right? So everywhere you're unwilling to ask for the energy to show up, will you uncreate and delete it all?

So you don't have time to call people or ask for help or start a business or anywhere you guys have time constraints that are blocking you from creating extra income. Will you uncreate and delete it all? So any of you guys that are blocking the income from showing up somehow, uncreate, delete, and destroy.

====================

LESSON 19: Clearing Self Sabotage

- Hey, this is Christie Marie Sheldon, and you're listening to a recording I did of a series of 24 live group sessions on clearing abundance blocks. And here's what we're covering today in session number 19, I'm going to walk you through an exercise to learn the truth and uncover the lies that you've been living. And these lies, known to you or unknown to you, have been creating untold havoc on your daily manifesting of money. And I'm also going to teach you a simple way to use your intuition to know truth, love truth, and be true. And you can even know if a future choice will make you money. This is the key, because knowing truth will let you take incredible, easy, guided actions. So let's begin. Hey there, welcome, welcome. Today is session 19 of "Unlimited Abundance", and today's one of the sessions that's near and dear to my heart. Yeah, so it's all about intuitions today. We're going to be working on all the places where you can't or won't, or shouldn't, or couldn't perceive the truth about things. So it's going to be an exciting day. Be open to some change, have a journal, a piece of paper so you can take some notes, set your intent on what you hoped to achieve. So take a moment right now and in the session, what do you hope to achieve? And what do you guys hope to achieve in the next few weeks? All right, love it, love it. All right, so let's journey together. All right, so it's an exciting day today. The first one, a really cool story from Susan C. She has been asking the universe, what would it take for more abundance than ever before to show up in her life? And what would it take to win prizes and drawings? And I love this story. It's a really cool story. This week, she received a letter from the chief financial officer from the state of Florida, informing her she has unclaimed premium refund from an insurance company amounting to $4,291. All right, Laurie shared a great story with me. She'd been practicing, what would it take asking for $1000? The other day, she was really focused, asked the universe for help with this. The next day, she got a check in the mail, basically saying the FTC had sued and won, and this was her portion against a mortgage company. It was completely unexpected. Then she checked her bank account and $231 in back child support had been deposited. And later that evening, she got a check in the mail for $100 commission she'd made. So that was $934 manifested in one day. She said, not quite 1000, but the next day, she was taking her daughter to an amusement park. She went to go purchase a ticket. A random stranger had a free ticket, gave them passes good for entry and a free meal and extras just by her showing up. What would it take for all of you guys to get paid being you? She got $1000 goal, probably over that actually. Now she's working on manifesting 5 to $10,000. So good luck, Laurie, and keep us posted. So is the truth in you or is it out there? Where is it? And I'm going to say this, everywhere you guys think that you can't have those kind of wins or miracles in a very short amount of time and create all that, and everybody listening, wouldn't it be cool if you double, triple, or quadruple your income and manifest a miracle this week in some 3D form that shows you that you're totally guided? Okay, so let's connect to the light so that when we get into this whole subject, that we can clear things along the way. So close your eyes, and of course, if you're driving, please, don't close your eyes, just pay attention and look up. See, sense, or feel the light. Take your energy 300 feet up where you can see, feel or sense the dimension where the light shows up. Ask this light to come into your heart, connecting your heart. Okay, cool. Now imagine this light comes through your crown, opening your crown to true divine knowledge, knowing the truth about everything. Asking this light to connect to your third eye opening that you can see it all. Yes, and everything in the way of that, delete all that. Ask the light to come in so you can hear it all and clear out your ears. Ask the light to come in, clear out your throat so you can speak the truth, be creative, generate your world by saying and being what you know you should be. Ask the light to come in, opening up your heart. Ask the light to come in, opening up your torso. Ask the light to come in, opening up all your power centers and the energy that you're rooted in so that you can firmly be in the truth. Ask the light to come through your legs, into the center of the planet, right in the sweet spot, in the center of the planet, where it feels really luscious and lovely. Ask that light to bounce straight back up into your heart. You are now connected above and below. Ask the light from your heart to radiate out 360 degrees all the way around you. Ask this light to expand past your body. Ask this light to expand past the building you're in. Ask this light to expand past the city you're in. Ask this light to expand past the state you're in. Ask this light to expand past the country you're in. Ask this light to expand past the planet. Okay. Now, today is a really cool day. The reason I picked the subject we're working on is in order to be abundant, wouldn't it be cool if you could know the truth about things and always take guided action? Somebody asked me this question in email, and I want to address it. Somebody was asking, do I always have to connect to the light? So the answer is eventually, you don't really have to, and you can still walk around or drive during the what would it takes and just imagine that you're connected from above and below and you'll always be connected, right? Okay, so that's one. And number two, somebody was saying, I don't have time to do 30 to 40 what-would-it-takes in a day? And the thing is, I mean, I think you guys can see that if you don't do them, don't you kind of miss them? So I catch myself in the middle of every thought. And if I don't really like what I'm thinking, I just think, oh, weird, uncreate and delete all that. You know what I mean? So it becomes like a walking prayer, and doing it 30 to 40 times isn't really a big deal because it's become such a part of your life. So I just want to clear that up. How do you make your energy bigger? Well, Maria, when you expand past the planet, you have no bounds, right? You could expand past Pluto, which is no longer a planet, which is a kind of sacrilegious to me, given that I am a Scorpio, they took away my planet. Anyway, but you can expand your energy past Pluto. You can expand your energy past the sun, right? So if you take your energy, Maria and everybody listening, and go past Pluto, take your energy, go pass the sun, you can literally kind of imagine and take your energy there, okay? So you're unlimited by truth and that's who you are, okay? The bigger you make your energy, the more you can change. Mark is a Scorpio too. I know, they took away our planet, the planet of transformation. Are you kidding me? So is it really just an intention? Yeah, it is really an intention, Maria. It's just imagining yourself there. All right. Frank is saying, can we muscle test to know whether or not our desires are ego-based or from our heart? Of course, you can. But Frank, I want to clear up the word ego for a minute, okay? Can you guys trust that the universe at some level is so abundant and it wants you to have everything? See, we as human beings, we're taught by a certain folks on the planet to judge things like money or power or all those things. But if your intention behind it all is filled with love, like truthfully, do I want to be powerful? Of course I do. Why do I want to be powerful? Because it truly proves who I am to myself. I have no need to prove it to other people, I really don't. But for myself, I want to know that all my mojo works. So is that ego-based? Do you understand? So some people might say, "Oh, it's ego-based. You want to have power." I think that certain societies want us to believe that it's our ego so that we don't have power so that we don't show up as we are, and therefore we can be controlled as a population. So I kind of bring that up so you guys really check in when you say the word ego, because, you know, make sure you don't have a spiritual belief around that. The universe doesn't judge us, totally loves us, and actually wants us to have what we really want. It wants us to be abundant. It wants us to be loved. It wants us to have our kids be happy. It wants us to have our future generations easy. It wants us to make a lot of money for whatever we need or want. So you don't have to justify it. So I see what you're saying, Frank, but I would check is just ask is the vibration of my desire, is there any energy attached that comes from fear, anger, worry, judgment, false information, 'cause it could be false information that's making you feel bad or guilty. But that's a really good question 'cause you just brought up this whole file. So I'm really glad that you asked that question, Frank, so thank you. So Ghana is saying, how do we integrate this light and love in our body? You're doing it now, the answer is being aware. How do you integrate it? You just be willing to be so much truth and love that nothing else is there. So that means you purposely manifest your life the way you really choose it all the time. Sabrina is saying, what's the story about Pluto? They declassified it as a planet, Sabrina. All right, everywhere, money and spirituality don't mix, uncreate and delete it all. Churches have a lot of money, so they've mixed it up themselves. And there's a little power in there too, Javier, money, power and spirituality all mixed in with the church. So everything that is, uncreate and delete it all. So we're going to go into the finer points of intuition. So if you're aligned with truth, it'll feel like giggly, happy or kind of spacious. If you're aligned with thinking, it's kind of feels like in between. If you're aligned with untruth or lower vibrations, density, that's heavy. So all of you guys, let's just do one rule of kind of clearing here. So everywhere you guys are unwilling to know the truth and feel the lightness of truth, uncreate and delete it all. Everywhere you guys are stuck in some past thing where you can't be truthful, uncreate and delete it all. Everywhere you guys have no idea how to be light and truthful to yourself, uncreate and delete it all. So we're going to practice for a minute. I want you to think I am female. Now, if you're a male, that will be untrue. Just think, I am female. I am female. So the females will feel truth in a certain way, and the males will feel falsehood in a certain way. So just think, I am female. And just kind of check in, where do you feel that in your body? Now I'm going to switch it. I am male. So if you say, I am male, and you're male, you'll feel truth; and if you say, I am male and you're female, you will feel false. So where do you feel that? I am male. So Amber, if you don't feel it in your body, I think you do, but you might not be aware of it. Check inside, where does it feel a little heavier somewhere? So it's weird 'cause I feel a little tired, a little heavy, a little present. I am male. Okay, I'm going to say it this way, I am a female body. I have a female body. We'll just tie it to your body. I have a female body. Okay, I have a male body. Okay, now just say your name. And when you say your name, do you feel a lightness to it or a heaviness? Your name should feel pretty light because that's what you call yourself. So I want you guys to hear in my voice so you can see that these all happened. You can even do it in your voice if you want. If I say my name is Christie, notice how my energy changed when I said Christie. It does like three times. My name is Christie. Now, I'm not purposely doing that, that's just the energy that runs through me and my name. Now, if I say my name is Ed, my name is Ed, can you notice how my voice cracks? You can sometimes hear it in your voice as well. There'll be an energy that changes. So everywhere you guys are confused about truth and falsehood, uncreate and delete it all. That's why we're doing this today, so that you guys can get really, really, really good at knowing the truth about things, okay? So everybody, don't check out, stay connected to the light, make your energy bigger. I did this with the last group, some people got it, some people didn't, it's okay, 'cause I want you guys to practice. So I'm going to think of a question, I'm going to say it out loud, and then I want you guys to feel if that feels like a true statement or a false statement. Feel the energy of this. I am in a house that has three bedrooms. I am in a house currently that has three bedrooms. In my body, where I'm visiting, I'm visiting somebody's house, I'm not in my own house, but I'm visiting a house. So the house that I'm visiting currently has three bedrooms, true or false. So most of you are getting true. Few of you got false. Okay, so the answer to that question is true. So everybody who got a false read, uncreate it all. Now I want you to notice there's a little filter when you do intuition. The first thing that pops into your head, like boom, it's a subtle awareness, truth is usually kind of subtle, unfortunately; it just feels kind of subtle and light and truthful. And if you have to think longer than a few seconds, you went to your mind probably to find the quote, unquote, "answer", instead of being disconnected to light and knowing the truth. So think of the energy of thinking and figuring it out. It's like think, think, think, think, think, think, figure, figure, figure, figure, figure, figure, versus truth, truth, truth, truth, truth. See, it's a different energy. So I'll give you one more. Here's the statement. And I want you guys to feel the truth or the falsehood of it. I am currently on the East Coast of the United States. I am currently on the East Coast of the United States. True or false. So most of you got this one, right? It's true, I am not on the East Coast. I am in the Midwest. Okay, perfect. You guys are great. All right, so now I just had you guys do that. And whenever you practice, you can take a deck of cards and you can say the next card that I turn over is red or the next card I turn over is black. And then just get really good at knowing the truth of things. And you have to be willing to know the truth no matter what. So a lot of people have blocks on no matter what. So everywhere, it's not safe, right, or good to know the truth no matter what, uncreate and delete it all. And everywhere your parents had all these secrets and lies and secret agendas and all these things that they hid from you so you can't trust your truth and your falsehood, uncreate and delete all that. Everywhere you're scared to know the truth about your abundance, uncreate and delete all that. Everywhere you're scared to know the truth about how to create your future, uncreate all that. Everywhere you're scared to know how to create your future, knowing exactly what steps to take to make a lot of money, uncreate and delete all that. So here, we're going to do a lot of clearing tonight. So you guys just tell me what's coming up for you. So Katia is saying she doubled how much she gets from her private practice, will ask for a further raise this week. So Katia, send us a story, I love it. And I've upped the rents for my renters. Send us a story so we can put you in the drawing. I'm going to just clear this one for us that's coming up. So everywhere you guys are confused, literally all confusion about knowing the truth about everything, uncreate delete it all times a gazillion. Everywhere you cannot know the truth, no matter what you think or say, uncreate and delete it all. All the places truth is totally hidden from you, uncreate and delete all these. So we're going to start with, what truth are you guys unwilling to see, hear, feel, know, and perceive? Everything that is, yes, uncreate and delete it all. All the truths that you guys are unwilling to see, hear, know, feel and perceive, uncreate and delete all that. All the other truths that you guys are unwilling to see, hear, know, and perceive, uncreate and delete all that. Any other thing that you're unwilling to perceive and know and hear and feel and see, uncreate, delete across all time dimensions, space and realities. Yeah, across all holographic fields, across all morphic fields, across all places where you hold lots of indecision, lots of places where you hold indecision is probably the place where you're unwilling to know the truth, uncreate and delete all that. How many false promises have you guys made to yourself about knowing the truth and then you really don't want the truth? So you say you want the truth, but you don't really want the truth, uncreate and delete all that. What vibration of truth are you unwilling to perceive? All the vibrations of truth that you're unwilling to perceive, uncreate and delete all those across all time, dimension, space and reality. Across the holographic field, across your morphic field, across your genetic field, across your mom and dad's energies, uncreate and delete all that. Anywhere you brought in your mom and dad's vibration of untruth and lies, uncreate and delete all that. Anywhere you're holding onto your mom and dad's stories of untruth, yes, uncreate and delete all that. Everywhere it wasn't fair or right to perceive and know the truth, uncreate and delete all that across all time, dimension, space and realities. Across all holographic fields, yes, love it. All the vibrations of truth that you're unwilling to perceive, uncreate and delete all those. All the elements of intuition that you have shut off for all eternity, will you uncreate and delete all those? Everywhere you guys are locked in a battle of knowing the truth and hiding the truth all at the same time, will you please uncreate and delete all those? Across all time dimension, space and reality. All of those elements of intuition that you shut off, uncreate and delete them all. Everything creating you, shutting off the elements of intuition, well, uncreate them across all time dimension, space, and reality, across all genetic fields, across all holographic fields and all morphic fields. Everywhere you have the elements of intuition shut off in your body, uncreate and delete all that. Everywhere you had to shut off your intuition in order to be here, uncreate and delete all that. Whatever time during the day that you shut off your intuition, will you uncreate and delete all that across all time dimensions, across all genetic fields, across all morphic fields? How many times do you guys in a day shut off your intuition, your psychicness and your super powers? Yes, your super powers to perceive everything, uncreate and delete all that across all time dimension, space, reality, yes, across all genetic, morphic, and holographic fields. All the timelines where you guys are shutting off your intuition, every trigger or button that you have that shuts off your awareness, your knowing, and your intuition, uncreate and delete all that. Everywhere you're unwilling to be totally in the truth and totally aware, uncreate and delete all that. Everywhere you look and you see something you need to know, how many places do you shut off your perception? Everything that is, uncreate and delete it all. I love it. All the other places where you guys have shut off your perception of knowing everything about everything that you see, uncreate and delete all that. All the places where you don't want to know the truth, which creates doubt, 'cause think about it, if you really knew the truth and lived in the truth, you would absolutely have no doubt and then you can make any decision and go forward, right? So everywhere you're unwilling to perceive at that depth, uncreate, delete all that. Okay, a few of you guys have this big karmic thing going on. So all the karma that's going on, making you guys stuck from knowing the truth, uncreate and delete it all. Everywhere you don't want to know the truth of who you are at some level, 'cause you have some karma going on, everything that is, yeah, uncreate and delete all that across all time dimension, space, and reality. Karma does mean some inhaled thing. It could be this life or past life that's blocking you from knowing the truth because you know, I mean, as many people as I've looked at, we've all done something that's from the shadow and we've all done things that are from the light. So anywhere you guys have some karma that came from the shadow side, will you uncreate and delete all that? Anywhere you're not wanting to be known or seen because you have some karma attached to the shadow side that you don't want to look at the truth of it, everything that is, will you uncreate and delete all that? Yeah, that's awesome. Everywhere you're not allowed to know the truth or say the truth or speak the truth in your family 'cause they want to be in denial, uncreate and delete all that across all time dimension, space and reality. All the core choices to never, ever, ever be happy, uncreate and delete it all. Everywhere you want to be miserable and unaware, uncreate all that. Everywhere you want to make stupid choices from unawareness 'cause it's easier to fit in your family, uncreate and delete all that across all time dimension, space and reality. Everywhere it's easier to be stupid and in denial and not know the truth so I can get along with everybody around me, including my mate, including yourself, uncreate and delete all that. Everywhere the family karma is based in lies and nobody wants anybody to find out the truth, uncreate and delete all that across all time dimension, space and reality. So whenever your parents had secret affairs, secret money things, secret job things, secret vices, secret addictions, and they learned how to hide the truth and now you can't trust the truth, so everything that is, yes, across all time dimension, space and reality. Any of you guys who did any of the same things, had affairs, hid the money, any hidden things, so now you're hiding things still from yourself, everything that is, will you uncreate and delete all that across all time dimension, space and reality? There, that'll be a block that gets into your future. So any other secrets that you guys are hiding that you feel bad about, will you let yourself off the hook? So the guilt fear, shame, worry, all that stuff, uncreate and delete it all across all time dimension, space and realities. Everywhere you guys are stuck in religious quandaries over should I be psychic and intuitive and know the truth or is that of the devil? So any religious quandaries that keep you from being aware, knowing everything about everything, will you uncreate and delete that all across all time dimension, space and reality? All the core beliefs that keep you stuck in boxes, living a spirituality that is based in falseness and unawareness, everything that is, uncreate and delete it all. Because if you really think about it, prayer is really just about connecting to the light, letting love in, and being aware from that place. So being intuitive, being psychic, and being religious, spiritual, really are all the same thing. So anybody who gave you a lie or an implant that said that's false or wrong, uncreate and delete all that across all time dimension, space and reality. Anywhere your mother and father don't want you knowing the truth 'cause then they will be found out, uncreate and delete all that. Anywhere you guys have tried to do things in the past and they don't work for you about knowing the truth, everything that is, will you uncreate and delete it all? If that is the case, that just means that you had some barrier to knowing the truth that was going. It wasn't that it wasn't working, it was that you had a cross-purpose. So anything that doesn't work in your life, can you guys really get that there's some cross-purpose that needs to be clear. And so all the cross-purposes, keeping your intuition blocked and stopped, uncreate and delete all that. So the cool thing is about knowing the truth is you can change any future you have. So you can go into your future and you can go, does it seem like in my future, I'm going to get married and have kids? And if the answer is no, then cool. Then what you do is you uncreate and delete all of that because that's just a belief. See the truth is the future is malleable, you can change it. So if you go into the future and you don't feel it or see it, and it's not linked up, it doesn't mean you're bad or wrong or pathetic or any of those, it just means you need to work on it by saying, what would it take for this to happen and then clear anything in the way of that, okay? So that's really what it is. So what would it take right now for everywhere you guys to be in denial of what you see, know, and here? Uncreate and delete it all. What would it take for all the choices you guys made to shut off your internal knowing? Yes, to be deleted, uncreated, yes, across all time dimension, space and reality. All the convictions that you have to make yourself not feel what you know, uncreate, delete that. What inner truths are you guys not allowing no matter what shows up for you? Uncreate and delete all that. What inner game are you using to shut off your awareness? Everything that is, will you uncreate and delete all that? What inner truth are you avoiding so you can stay normal and fit in? Yes, because normal people are unaware, are in denial, and they don't want to change. If you really, really honestly look at the truth of quote, unquote, "normal people", a lot of people don't want to change or be aware. So anywhere you're striving to be normal, so that means you have to shut off your awareness, uncreate and delete all that. All the choices that you're aligning with to shut off your awareness and the truth, uncreate and delete all that. Anywhere your subconscious keeps you from not knowing your future, will you uncreate and delete all that? Any of your subconscious beliefs, including, I can't know, shouldn't know, don't want to know, could never know, and we'll be in trouble for knowing, uncreate and delete all that across all time dimension, space and reality. All the truths that you're hiding from yourself so you can stay hidden, uncreate and delete all that. Any other truth that you're hiding from yourself to keep you safe, uncreate and delete all that across all time dimension, space and reality. Any other truth that you guys are hiding, will you uncreate and delete it all? Any other core belief that says I have to hide the truth from myself and other people so people don't look at me, uncreate and delete it all across all time dimension, space and realities. All the incidences where you shut off the truth of your true nature, will you uncreate and delete all that across all time dimension, space and reality? All the secrets that you won't allow yourself to remember, uncreate and delete it all. How many secrets are you justifying keeping when they keep you stuck? It could be secret addiction, secret money things, anything, all those things, uncreate and delete them all. All the secret guilts, uncreate and delete all those. All the secret fears, uncreate and delete all those. All the secret angers, uncreate and delete all those. All the secret shames, uncreate and delete all those. All the secret decisions that you've made to keep everything from coming to you, including love, money, miracles, abundance, uncreate and delete all that. Any other secrets that you're hiding from yourself, uncreate and delete all those. All the secrets your family hid from you, uncreate and delete all those. All the secrets that keep you tethered to the past instead of creating a future, uncreate and delete all those. Everywhere you're not allowed to know the truth, everything that is, uncreate and delete all that. Everywhere you were told that I can't have the truth and you can't handle the truth, just like Jack Nicholson, you can handle the truth, everything that is, uncreate and delete all that. Everywhere you can't handle the truth, uncreate and delete all that. Everywhere you're shy about knowing the truth 'cause then maybe people won't like you, uncreate and delete all that. So as I said in the first group, you can know the truth about things. It doesn't mean you have to tell everybody what you know. It's okay to just know things and act from awareness. What would it take for you guys to see it all, hear it all, know it all, be it all? Uncreate and delete all that. Everywhere else you don't know how to be or know it all, uncreate and delete all that. Everywhere your choices are aligned with bad choices, so therefore you don't want to know the future 'cause it's too scary to know, uncreate and delete all that. Everywhere you guys are hiding the future, uncreate and delete all that. Everywhere you guys are afraid of the future, uncreate and delete all that. Everywhere you guys are afraid to know the truth, uncreate and delete all that. Everywhere you guys are afraid to perceive the entire reality around you and in you and then make changes, because the truth is you can make changes to anything that you are being. So anywhere you're being, like, whatever, angry, fearful, unhappy, miserable, stock, anywhere you're unwilling to perceive what's needed in order to change it, uncreate and delete all that. I'm going to clear this 'cause some of you guys really don't want the truth. So everywhere you guys don't even want the truth, even if it'll set you free, uncreate and delete all of that. So Ivan is asking, how do I know if I know the truth? If it feels light and it makes you happy, that's really truth. So truth just feels light, no, I should take that back. It won't always make you happy, eventually from the soul level it'll make you happy, but truth is true. So feel this out, you're unaware of being who makes choices, that's true. You're a limited being who is human, not true. So everywhere you guys are refusing to be the unlimited being who has a body, uncreate and delete all that. If we look at it and feel ashamed of ourselves, is it permanently imprinted? No, Karen, 'cause then what you do is you just look at it, you go, okay, wow, that really might suck in that moment, and then just uncreate and delete everything you feel about it and then let it go. So you look at it, you say, "Oh, that's interesting," then you uncreate and delete everything that created it and everything that created the pattern and everything you feel about it. And eventually, you'll get to a neutral, and once it's neutral, then you're not attached or controlled by it. So unawareness doesn't let you fix things. If you're not willing to be in the truth, you could be so stuck because lies will stick you. Lies will make the energy stick. Truth will set the energy free. Having to hide to survive, everything that is, uncreate and delete it all. How many of you guys are hiding your-know-it-allness, your super powers, your extreme sense of knowing kind of like Wonder Woman, Superman, every way you can teleport or telepath or do any of those superhuman powers and you're pretending that you're limited, uncreate and delete all that. Everywhere you guys bear an uncanny resemblance to a human instead of a super human, uncreate and delete all that. There, you guys let go of a lot of energy right there. Anywhere else you're unwilling to perceive through all dimensions, uncreate and delete all that. Anywhere, if somebody is just talking to you right in front of you, you're unwilling to just know if they're telling you the truth, not their truth, but the truth. 'Cause people will have a truth which creates their reality, but everything that's true for you that's not really true, that means it's a lie, everything that is, will you uncreate and delete it all? How many places are you guys limiting yourself by living in this reality instead of choosing the reality where you can know it all and be at all? Uncreate and delete everything in the way of that. Everywhere you guys are afraid to take massive action based on truth and so would rather be in denial and then take action and then wonder why it fails, everything that is, will you uncreate and delete it all? Everywhere it's safer to be a failure 'cause then you can fit in with your family and then you can get love, so everything that is, will you uncreate, delete it all? So Karen, everything that you're ashamed of, so any of you guys, any of your secret shames, secret addictions, secret things, and all the things attached to the other person, uncreate and delete at all. Any secret shames attached to any other person, something they did to you, something you did to them, uncreate and delete all those. All the secret shames, secret angers, secrets that you wanted to kill them after they did blah, blah, blah, to you, so all those secret things where you just want to kill them and get rid of them, and then you're ashamed to admit that, uncreate and delete it all. Everywhere it's locked in your body energy or system to be ashamed, be guilty or be fearful, uncreate and delete all that. Okay, Karen, anywhere you guys are stuck to your mom and dad's heritage and that's what's making you feel guilty or ashamed, everything that is, uncreate it all. Any past lives that you guys are connected to that are stopping you from knowing your truth, uncreate and delete all that. It has something to do with your mother, Karen. So Ivan, you asked the question, like you have to pick it apart a little bit, okay? So let's just say a situation is is this person telling me the truth? You could say, what percentage is this person telling me the truth? And you could get 70%, 80%. If I do this deal, will it make me $30,000 worth of profit? Yes or no. If I do this, will it make me happy? So you have to ask little questions in the middle of all of it, Ivan, to kind of break it down. If I'm going to do something, I really want to know all the angles of it. That's how much truth I'm willing to perceive. I want to know what they need. I want to know what I need. I want to know if it fits. I want to know if they're going to judge me. I want to know if I'm going to judge them. Do you understand? I want to know all the angles. Well, if you don't want people to know the truth about you, the way you hide truth is you actually clear yourself so much that you're a see-through system. It's very hard for psychics to read me. And it's not really what I'm putting out, I'm not doing it on purpose. But it's because my energy is so expansive, most people can't read me. I've literally in the last few years of my life, I can't really find anybody who can read me. And it's because my energy is so expansive that I'm choosing the truth for myself in the moment. Clear yourself out so much that your energy is so big then nobody can read anything. So everywhere, Frank, you're unwilling to be that big and hide things and everywhere you guys are afraid that once you know the truth about things, people know who you are, or if you're afraid if they know the truth, they won't like you, uncreate and delete all that. Any other truth that you guys have going on that you don't want anybody to see or know about, uncreate and delete all that. It's attached to your mother's genetics, Karen. It's somehow your mother's genetic lineage. So it even says in the Bible, we bear the sins of our brothers seven generations back. So I've seen it up to 10. So somewhere in your mother's side of the family, it's stuck. And anywhere you don't think it'll be fixed, uncreate and delete it all. I know, some of those things are kind of sticky, but just keep saying, anywhere that's happened, anywhere in the genetic lineage and I'm carrying it in my body, uncreate and delete it all. Okay, everywhere, what would it take for you guys to be a know-it-all who does it all? Uncreate and delete all that. So everywhere, Amber, you're afraid to just tell people no, I mean, there's nice ways to tell people no. I will say to somebody if they ask me something and I don't really want to do it, I will say, I am not guided to do that. 'Cause that's the truth, I'm not guided to do that. And I've never had anybody argue with my guidance. Or you can just say that doesn't fit for me right now. Nobody usually argues with that too much either. But when you create excuses, people can kind of feel those that you feel guilty and then they can emotionally kind of blackmail you a little bit. So just say the truth: "I get that you want this, that doesn't fit me right now, I know that might hurt your feelings, but I would hope that you could honor my choice in this situation 'cause I just feel like I have to do what I have to do." So just use those kinds of words. So everywhere you guys are afraid to know the truth and tell people no, uncreate and delete all that. So Shereen, a numerologist told you you weren't ever going to get married and have kids, I believe that the future is mine to make but that he knew something I didn't know. So this is what I don't like about intuitives even though I've been in that profession. See, when people came to me, what I would say is, it seems like you're choosing this in your life, let me help you fix that if you want something different. So Shereen, everywhere you gave somebody else the power to control your future, uncreate and delete it all. So some of the psychics or numerologists what they're reading is a potential future. You do not have to agree with them, okay? So what I would do is I would say everywhere I agreed and aligned with a numerologist or the psychic, anywhere I gave away my power of choice to him or her, uncreate and delete it all, okay? Everywhere you shut off your intuition to be loved, uncreate and delete all that. Everywhere you're staying hidden so you could live, uncreate and delete all the places where you still have to hide 'cause you are now safe. So anywhere you still think you have to hide, uncreate all that. Right, so Katia, that means that you just have to change and your husband and your daughter, what you just do is you just change and get happy and you don't have to force any of your change on them, okay? You really don't. See, that's what people think. They think, oh, I'm changing, I got to change everybody around me. Just change the people that want to be changed and let everyone else be. And then just go be happy. 'Cause eventually what will happen is you'll be happy and they will come around to your happiness, okay? Everywhere you guys are in denial that your energy, just your energy, without saying anything, changes the whole family, yeah, everywhere you're in denial of that, uncreate all that. Everywhere your body is aching, it means you have stuck a lot of emotion in there about not knowing the truth, so your body is trying to tell you the truth right now, Galena. So ask, what truth is in my liver? What truth is right here in my liver? I just hear that you're mad about something. So everything you're mad about, uncreate and delete all that. And if you're mad about it, it means you're disempowered about it, which means that you were unwilling to see some truth about some situation, and that's what's wanting to come out. So what truth are you avoiding looking at in your liver that wants to get handled? So any of you with body aches right now, or in your life, what truth are you avoiding that's stuck in your body? Or what shock, what painful, like, shock in the past happened that stuck in your body that wants to come out? You have cross-purposes, JC. You want to let go of some things and there's some things that you don't want to let go of. 'Cause somewhere you like being angry at people a little bit, because it makes you feel a little more powerful, okay? So there's some things you don't want to let go of. So all the cross-purposes keeping you feeling nauseas or sick, any of that, uncreate all that. Everywhere you don't want to know the truth, uncreate and delete all that. Yes, you can ask for a clearing. So Katia, every time your husband and daughter go off on you, you could just, under your breath, you don't have to say it to them, just say, "Everything creating this negative energy towards me right now, I uncreate it all. Everything that's keeping my daughter hurting and in pain that she needs to gain 100 pounds, I uncreate and delete it all." You can do that for them. So everywhere it's useless and impossible to know it all, uncreate and delete all that. Everywhere you guys don't see the whole point, which is if you know it all, you can know how to talk to people and have them pay you, you can know how to go into a bank and, I don't know, get a deal done because you know what the other person needs to hear in order to get the deal done. You could do many myriads of things with knowing the truth, right? You can know the truth of how to orchestrate your life in order to make things happen. You can know the truth about which person is going to help you get to the next level. You can know the truth about any business deal, any investment. You can know the truth, is gold going to go up more or is it going to go down? Okay, so everywhere you guys are are afraid to know that much truth 'cause it could change your whole life, uncreate and delete it all. All right. So everywhere you guys are afraid to let go of anything. So just ask your body this right now, 'cause this is a really big subject and you guys shoved a lot of untruth into your tissues. So connect to the light, be connected, and then let's ask that the energy of truth run through your body. We're going to tell your body, "I'm willing to perceive the truth. Thank you for showing it to me in the form of aches and pains. But I'm now willing to know so much truth that you do not have to show it to me." 'Cause your body will love you enough to have an ache and pain so that you will ask the ache and pain what's wrong instead of just perceiving what's wrong before it gets into your body. So everywhere you guys are afraid to just ask your body what it needs and give it to it, uncreate all that. Everywhere you guys have tortured your body by using a lot of force against it so you can close down and not know the truth. So all the force fields that you guys are putting into your body so that you can't feel or know, uncreate all that. Everywhere you guys shut off all your perception and feeling 'cause it was too painful, uncreate and delete all that. Anywhere this reality has been too painful and you shut off all your knowing and your feeling and your believing and your truth and your heart, yes, and you went into your head, everything that is, uncreate all that. Everywhere you guys are afraid to emote and feel, uncreate all that. Amy, it's just 'cause you have some counter intentions to knowing the truth that happened somehow with your father, or somehow your father's energy made you not trust yourself. So any of you guys who don't trust yourself, uncreate it all. And your mother didn't somehow trust your father, so anywhere your mother didn't trust your father and then you mimicked her energy. All right, everybody's families who want a healing right now, so all the families and family members that want a healing, we'll send them a healing. Uncreate and delete anything in the way of the healing, uncreate and delete any miracle that anybody is willing to take right now through you or your family. All the untruth that all your family members are living in, uncreate and delete it all. All the untruth that you have to deal with in your workplace, uncreate and delete all that. All the lies that you guys are sitting in that you think you're not powerful enough to do this on your own, uncreate and delete all that. So I know what you're saying, Silvana, but here's the deal. So I'll tell you how I go about my life. I'm willing to be so aware that I know what everything, everybody's up to and I'm willing to not judge it, okay? 'Cause I see that they are a loving child of God and that they chose that path, and who am I to get in the way of that path? Do you understand? So I love people where they're at and ask for a different energy field to kind of go around them. So I'll send a blessing to people. And if they want to take the energy, they can take it. And if they don't, they don't have to. But you can perceive it all and not really care about it in the same way. Does that make sense? Because you have to understand, and I don't mean this as a judgment thing, but just as an awareness thing, there's a lot of miserable people because they don't know how to create their life. So are you going to let your energy go down to their level or are you going to be a beacon of light and raise them all up just by being you? Because if you go down to their level, you don't help you. And they're just where they're at. So it doesn't make them bad, it just makes them unknowing. Do you understand? So they just don't know any different until you radiate a lot of light and love and you just show them something different or they read a book and they see something different; or they watch TV and they see something different, right? Okay. So I'm willing to see everything, including a mass murderer. I'm still willing to love that person anyway and know every reason why they chose those choices and still not judge them and still bless them so that they make another choice. Do you understand? But I don't let that energy affect me 'cause it's their thing. But I'm still willing to perceive it all, if that makes sense, and let the energy pass through me. I don't have a need to hold on to their energy or fix them unless they ask for help. And if they ask for help, I'll happily help them. Do you understand? So what it takes, Silvana and everybody listening, if you just look at everything as it is, it's a choice they're making and you can send them a blessing and you can love them where they're at without needing to force all your agendas on them. All right. Roman, it's your father, okay? You got male issues, it's not safe, right, or good to move into your maleness, whatever that is for you. So you're going to have to work on clearing anything you have with your father, any guilt, shame about being a man and being your version of a man instead of anybody else's version of a man. So you will know that you released everything from your mother and father when you ask the question and it reads true. Everywhere you're afraid to speak the truth 'cause you'll get punished, it's true, your parents didn't want to know the truth. They wanted to be in denial. They wanted you guys to be good girls and good boys so they could look like good parents. They didn't want the truth. They didn't want you speaking up. They didn't want you telling them the truth 'cause they might have to change. So anywhere that's true but you made that wrong 'cause you're now an adult and you can tell them the truth and it doesn't really matter, right? Okay, so everywhere you just won't tell people the truth, uncreate and delete all that. So I've been, when I say I clear myself, what I'm saying is I'm doing all these things that you guys are doing right now. I just uncreate and delete everything that's false about me. And then what's happened is my vibration has gotten so high that people can't really read me. They have to have kind of a higher vibration in order to read me. So that's what I mean. So I'm just doing everything that I'm teaching you guys. When I say clear, I just uncreate and delete all my fear, worry, anger, shame, guilt, all those lower energies and I raise my vibration up. So what if it's true for someone and I don't feel it's the truth? Well, you just be aware of that. You can be like, oh, that's kind of interesting and it feels kind of true for them, but I don't feel it. So unless they ask for your advice and then you can choose to tell them the truth at that point; like, "I get what you're saying, but I don't feel it, but it doesn't mean you're wrong, it just means I don't feel it." You know what I mean? Or whatever that is for you. So just because somebody tells you something doesn't mean you have to correct them. Gabriel, you're really going to have to start working on everywhere I'm abused and victimized and uncreate and delete all that until you don't feel that anymore. So wherever you're abused, any of you guys, abused and victimized and vandalized by people you loved, uncreate and delete it all. Everywhere you're waiting for them to be different but they really don't want to and you're disappointed, uncreate and delete all that. Okay, I loved it. So Rosetta is having a realization that she's been closing something she used to be able to see, everything that is, uncreate it all. So your knee is telling you that you don't want to move forward, Roman. So somewhere you don't want to move forward. Somewhere cutting off at the knees, victim, don't want to move forward. All right, so all the stuff that you guys have in your body, uncreate and delete it all, okay? So it's basically a bunch of untruth. So Kathleen, everything you decided about saving your child that's still stuck in your energy field, uncreate it all. And I would run for you, I would run everywhere I'm still traumatized in 1986. So everywhere you're traumatized and still stuck in 1986, I would uncreate and delete the whole everything that happened before, during, and after the event over and over again until it feels like all right, you guys. So you guys are talking about body stuff. There's so much body stuff, uncreate and delete it all. You're going to have to just keep sending in light and just saying, "Body, it's really safe to release all this falsehood." So right now, you guys say body, body, body, body, body, body, it's really safe for you right now to let go of everything false, traumatic, guilty, shameful, anger, fear, worry. It's really okay for you to let go of the lies in my body. It's really okay for you to change my whole molecular structure and delete everything that is a lie that's stuck in my body, and shock, lies and shock. So all the lies and shock in your body. Roman, I keep saying it's your father. How many times? Father, father, father, father, Roman, father. So Roman, you're going to have to listen to this again because I keep telling you what I keep saying. And it's like you can't hear me. So there's an unconsciousness in you that doesn't want to hear what I'm saying. It's something about not wanting to move forward and feeling like something with your father and not feeling like a man, okay? So how you want to feel as a man in the world is not showing up for you. And so you're going to have to clear all the places where you don't feel like a man, you don't want to feel like a man, you're doing your father's version of a man, everywhere you don't like your father, everywhere you feel like your father doesn't like you, all those things, okay? Okay, now that'll happen for you guys. Sometimes you guys don't hear things because you have an energy there. All right, so all the parents and authority figures stuff, uncreate and delete it all. All the worthy of knowing it all and changing what you don't prefer, 'cause this is what it is, know it all and then change it if you don't like it, uncreate all that. It's safe to know your future, everything in the way, uncreate all that. You're worthy of the truth, everything in the way of that, uncreate all that. And be willing to know it all and see it all in the future, uncreate and delete everything in the way of that. What would it take for you guys to be the knower of everything, about everything? Everything in the way of that, uncreate all that. What would it take for you guys to know the truth now? Everything in the way of that, uncreate and delete all that. Okay, Frank wants to send blessings to political leaders. I would love that. So all the political leaders that are in dishonor on truth and the falsehood that they can't make a change, uncreate and delete all that. Everyone that is in control of the economy and making the choices that keep it stuck and going down, uncreate and delete all that. All the untruth that is stuck in the economy, making everything stuck and going down, uncreate all that. Everywhere in the economy the energy is loss, uncreate and delete all that. Everything in the economy with the political leaders, with the banking system, with the stock market, S&P rating, that's making everything stuck in the world, uncreate all that. Any country that is going bankrupt, uncreate all that. All the debts in the countries, uncreate and delete all that. Everything creating debt and debt mentality for all eternity, uncreate all that. Everywhere we as citizens go along with this instead of stopping it, uncreate and delete all that. Everywhere we're avoiding the truth and letting the political people do whatever they want and lie to us, uncreate and delete all that. Everywhere you're letting your politician lie to you and you're unwilling to perceive the truth, uncreate and delete all that. Anywhere you're letting the politicians lie to you and you're not willing to speak up and do anything about it, uncreate and delete all that. What would it take for the truth of the financial situation and how to fix it? What would it take for that to show up in the world and work and change? Everything in the way of that, uncreate all that. All the people that want to create war in the world, all the war thoughts, uncreate and delete all that. Everything in the world that creates war, uncreate and delete all that. All the power and control attached to war and warmongering, uncreate and delete all that. Everywhere the victims keep choosing to be a victim, 'cause as soon as the victims quit being victims, then all the wars would stop. Do you see? You can't take control of the population if the population does not allow it. So everywhere there are people playing victim and letting themselves be controlled, uncreate and delete all that. Anywhere they feel like they have no choice, which again is an untruth, uncreate all that. Anywhere you guys are playing victim, uncreate and delete all that. Anywhere you guys aren't willing to take a stand in the political nature and make something different happen, uncreate and delete all that. Okay, everywhere, nobody on the planet wants to deal with the finances of the world because it's a lose-lose battle, uncreate and delete all that. Everywhere the politicians have given up on fixing it because they don't even think they can, uncreate and delete all that. What would it take for the politicians to know that they can fix it and actually make choices that do that? And everything in the way of that, uncreate it all. Yes, all right, that was a good one. All right, ciao for now. Bye.

====================

LESSON 19: Clearing Self Sabotage (Clearing Session Only)

Okay, so let's connect to the light so that when we get into this whole subject that we can clear things along the way. So close your eyes. And of course, if you're driving, please don't close your eyes. Just pay attention and look up. See, sense, or feel the light. Take your energy 300 feet up where you can see, feel, or sense the dimension where the light shows up. Ask this light to come into your heart. Connecting your heart. Okay, cool. Now imagine this light comes through your crown, opening your crown to true divine knowledge, knowing the truth about everything.

Ask the light to come in, opening up your heart. Okay, ask the light to come in, opening up your torso. Ask the light to come in, opening up all your power centers and the energy that you're rooted in so that you can firmly be in the truth.

Ask that light to bounce straight back up into your heart. You are now connected above and below. Ask the light from your heart to radiate out 360 degrees all the way around you. Ask this light to expand past your body. Ask this light to expand past the building you're in. Ask this light to expand past the city you're in. Ask this light to expand past the state you're in. Ask this light to expand past the country you're in. Ask this light to expand past the planet. Okay. All right. Everywhere money and spirituality don't mix. Uncreate and delete it all. Churches have a lot of money, okay? So they've mixed it up themselves. Money, power, and spirituality all mixed in with the church. So everything that is, uncreate and delete it all. Let's just do one rule of kind of clearing here. So everywhere you guys are unwilling to know the truth and feel the lightness of truth, uncreate and delete it all. Everywhere you guys are stuck in some past thing where you can't be truthful, uncreate and delete it all. Everywhere you guys have no idea how to be light and truthful to yourself, uncreate and delete it all. You can take a deck of cards and you can say the next card that I turn over is red or the next card I turn over is black, right? And then just get really good at knowing the truth of things. Okay, and you have to be willing to know the truth no matter what. Okay, so a lot of people have blocks on no matter what. So everywhere it's not safe, right, or good to know the truth no matter what, uncreate and delete it all. And everywhere your parents had all these secrets and lies and secret agendas and all these things that they hid from you so you can't trust your truth and your falsehood, uncreate and delete all that. Everywhere you're scared to know the truth about your abundance, uncreate and delete all that. Everywhere you're scared to know the truth about how to create your future, uncreate all that. Everywhere you're scared to know how to create your future knowing exactly what steps to take to make a lot of money, uncreate and delete all that. I'm going to just clear this one for us that's coming up. So everywhere you guys are confused, like literally all confusion about knowing the truth about everything, uncreate, delete it all, times a gazillion. Everywhere you cannot know the truth no matter what you think or say, uncreate and delete all that. All the places truth is totally hidden from you, uncreate and delete all this. So we're going to start with what truth are you guys unwilling to see, hear, feel, know, and perceive? Everything that is, yes, uncreate and delete it all. All the truths that you guys are unwilling to see, hear, know, feel, and perceive, uncreate and delete all that. All the other truths that you guys are unwilling to see, hear, know, and perceive. Uncreate and delete all that. Okay, any other thing that you're unwilling to perceive and know and hear and feel and see. Uncreate, delete across all time, dimensions, space, and realities. Yes, across all holographic fields, across all morphic fields, across all places where you hold lots of indecision. Lots of places where you hold indecision is probably the place where you're unwilling to know the truth. Uncreate and delete all that. Okay, how many false promises have you guys made to yourself about knowing the truth and then you really don't want the truth? So you say you want the truth, but you don't really want the truth. Uncreate and delete all that. Okay, what vibration of truth are you unwilling to perceive? All the vibrations of truth that you are unwilling to perceive, uncreate and delete all those across all time, dimension, space, and reality. Across the holographic field, across your morphic field, across your genetic field, across your mom and dad's energies, uncreate and delete all that. Anywhere you brought in your mom and dad's vibration of untruth and lies, uncreate and delete all that. Anywhere you're holding on to your mom and dad's stories of untruth, yes, uncreate and delete all that. Everywhere it wasn't fair or right to perceive and know the truth. Uncreate and delete all that. Across all time dimensions, space, and realities. Across all holographic fields. Yes. Love it. All the vibrations of truth that you're unwilling to perceive. Uncreate and delete all those. All the elements of intuition that you have shut off for all eternity. Will you uncreate and delete all those? Everywhere you guys are locked in a battle of knowing the truth and hiding the truth all at the same time. will you please uncreate and delete all those? Across all time, dimensions, space, and reality. All of those elements of intuition that you shut off, uncreate and delete them all. Okay, everything creating, you shutting off the elements of intuition, will uncreate them across all time, dimensions, space, and reality.

Across all time dimensions, across all genetic fields, across all morphic fields. How many times do you guys in a day shut off your intuition, your psychicness, and your superpowers? Yes, your superpowers to perceive everything. Uncreate and delete all that. Across all time dimensions, space, reality. Yes. Across all genetic, morphic, and holographic fields.

Okay, all the other places where you guys have shut off your perception of knowing everything about everything that you see, uncreate and delete all that. All the places where you don't want to know the truth, which creates doubt, because, like, think about it. If you really knew the truth and lived in the truth, you would absolutely have no doubt, and then you can make any decision and go forward, right? So everywhere you're unwilling to perceive at that depth, uncreate, delete, all that. Okay, a few of you guys have this big karmic thing going on. So all the karma that's going on, making you guys... from knowing the truth. Uncreate and delete it all. Everywhere you don't want to know the truth of who you are at some level because you have some karma going on. Everything that is. Yeah. Uncreate and delete all that across all time, dimensions, space, and reality. Karma just means some unhealed thing. It could be this life or past life that's blocking you from knowing the truth because, you know, I mean, as many people as I've looked at, we've all done something that's from the shadow and we've all done things that are from the light. So anywhere you guys have some karma that came from the shadow side, will you uncreate and delete all that? Anywhere you're not wanting to be known or seen because you have some karma attached to the shadow side that you don't want to look at the truth of it. Everything that is, will you uncreate and delete all that? There. That's awesome.

Okay, so everything that is, yes. Across all time, dimensions, space, and reality. Any of you guys who did any of the same things, had affairs, hid the money. You know, any, like, hidden things. So now you're hiding things still from yourself. Everything that is, will you uncreate and delete all that? Cross all time, dimensions, space, and reality. There.

So anybody who gave you a lie or an implant that said that's false or wrong, Uncreate and delete all that across all time, dimension, space, and reality. Anywhere your mother and father don't want you knowing the truth because then they will be found out. Uncreate and delete all that. Anywhere you guys have tried to do things in the past and they don't work for you about knowing the truth. Okay, everything that is, will you uncreate and delete it all? If that is the case, it just means that you had some barrier to knowing the truth that was going. It wasn't that it wasn't working. It was that you had a cross purpose. Okay? So anything that isn't working in your life, can you guys really get that there's some cross purpose that needs to be clear? Okay, so all the cross purposes, keeping your intuition blocked and stopped, uncreate and delete all that. So what would it take right now for everywhere you guys to be in denial of what you see, know, and hear? Uncreate and delete it all.

====================

LESSON 20: Clearing Lack Of Self Worth

- [Christie] Hey, this is Christie Marie Sheldon, and you're listening to a recording I did of a series of 24 live group sessions on clearing abundance blocks. And here's what we're covering today in session number 20. To start things off, we'll take a good look at how you received the energy of love in childhood. Because as strange as it might seem to you, this influences how you handle money now. In childhood, if you internalize not enough love from either your mother or your father or the main caretakers, this can actually influence your money issues. So I'm going to teach you a tool to fill up that empty area of your soul and help you become a money magnet. Next I'll help you re-encounter the highest energy level possible that brings you into alignment with the most powerful forces to uplift your drive for manifesting loving kind things into your life. In fact, if you don't have this energy running through your body, you're operating on half empty. So let's begin. Hey. Welcome. Welcome. This is Christie. How are you? Today is so exciting. Today is session 20 and we're going to talk about my favorite subject. Love. So we're going to get some more love and higher vibrations in you so that you can really, really amp up everything that you're working at manifesting. If you guys haven't already please grab a piece of paper because any awareness that shows up today, you can work on a little bit later on for yourself as well. And again, be open to change. Any of you guys stuck in a rut, we're going to have to get you out of there, all right? So everybody take a moment and set your intent on what you hope to achieve tonight. If you could have anything shift in your life, whatever that would be, choose that. Okay. And then I want you to take a moment and we have only a certain amount of sessions. So, what do you hope to achieve before, prior to the end of the 25 days? Okay. Now I'm just going to clear this really quick. So everything that came up for you guys that says, "Oh, I can't get those completed. It's not working. Oh my God. It's almost to the end. And I still haven't done X, Y, Z." Okay. So everything that came up for you guys, we uncreate it all and delete it all. Love it. There. Okay, because remember the rockstar overnight success, they had to practice, practice, practice. You guys are basically reinventing your foundation. All right? So be gentle on yourself. And at the same time, that doesn't mean gentle on yourself means lazy. That means have some intent to push yourself. All right. So bring whatever energy you want to release up and let's go. So we had some really amazing, inspiring stories today. So Jane has made great strides since starting Unlimited Abundance journey. She says that when she began 10 weeks ago, she was financially devastated. Had spent all of her inheritance money and was moving into the equity in her home to live. So she was living off her home. In fact, she had to rent out her home and live with friends to make ends meet. But within four weeks, a miracle happened. She got a call out of the blue from a woman who wanted to work with Jane. And since then she's made $20,000. She used part of it to pay off her credit card, put the rest in her savings account, and moved back into her home. "The money kept flowing," she said, "After a former client called, I then wanted her to come to Canada to work with her. The client paid for the rental car, half the gas and $2,500. She went through customs. Realized she had an expired passport. She grabbed the wrong one. Kept saying, "what would it take to get through customs hassle free?" And that's exactly what happened. She got through. No trouble. And when returning to the U.S., they didn't even pull her over, they just let her through. So now she's asking what would it take to make money doing what she loves and what would it take to fall in love with the man of her dreams? So I love it. "I saved a hundred thousand dollars." Ivan, in Hawaii, dropped me an email to let me know that after, you remember, I had you guys a few days or a few days in the Abundance journey ago, had a look, take a look at your profit and loss statements for the last five years. Awareness can change a lot of things in your future, right? So after doing the homework, he realized he had enough to pay off the mortgage and still enough to live on. And that's what he did. And then when he calculated how much that saved him versus living in the house and paying all the interest, he saved a hundred thousand dollars and is now he can label himself debt free. That's really, really cool. And then he just wanted to have a backup plan for whatever reason, that was supposed to be security blanket. So he got approved for a $250,000 home equity loan, no expenses or fees. All right, good job, Ivan. Janet shared some of the wins she had since starting her Unlimited Abundance journey. Her husband literally found $1,500 cash tightly rolled in a spare tire of an abandoned car on its way to be crushed. He said, "It was tucked in conspicuously in the tire." Something made him take a second look and a wad of money fell out. How fun is that, right? Jane's rent increased by $400, but she manifested an additional $400 doing some work for her mother. So she got that covered. She received with no stress, okay? She also received a letter from an insurance company saying that they owed her $112 for overpayment 2007. So she manifested some money from five years ago. Her neighbor of 20 years was moving, gave her a treadmill that they didn't want anymore. She put it on Craigslist, sold it for 145 bucks. And her mom gave her a hundred dollars for no reason. So that's 200, $2257 in total. So good job, Janet. I love that. I love that. A lot of money out of a tire of a car, and he felt compelled to look at it. Okay. All right. So everybody listening everywhere you guys feel, sense or believe at any level, cellularly or anywhere else that you can have the same and/or better achievements in your own life. Everything that is, we uncreate and delete it all. What would it take for everybody listening to have a really cool, astonishing, amazing, over the top miracle happen that shows you for sure, you are an abundance, manifesting king and/or queen. And everything in the way of that? We delete all that. So we're going to connect to the light. So everybody close your eyes for a minute. Okay, and if you're driving, obviously do not close your eyes. Okay. So you sense or feel the light 300 feet above your head. Okay, open the doorway to all of source energy, all of true abundance. Okay, allow this true abundance to trickle into your head, your crown opening up all the divine knowledge, all the wherewithal, the what with all and the everything you need to do in order to grab it, find it, keep it, attract it and receive it. Okay. Asking that everywhere in your third eye, in your ears, you're connected again to true divine guidance. Asking that the universe always be abundant and work in your favor. Okay. Ask a source energy to come through your throat. Opening up your throat to communicate your true desires and have them be met. Ask this light to come into your heart. Opening up your heart to receive that you are valued and loved enough to have all of your dreams and manifestations come true. Okay. Ask this light to come into your torso. Anything that makes you nervous about moving forward. Ask that to release. Ask this light to completely support you, so you feel strong, confident, fearless, able to take massive action. Okay. Ask this light to infuse you with a sense of power and confidence, knowing that all is well. And it is only up to you to just ask and receive. Okay. Ask this light to have you grounded in the trust that you are a creator and that you, yourself, can create and manifest the life that you truly desire. Okay, ask this light to ground that energy into the ground. Find the happy place in the center of the planet. Okay. The happy place in the center of the planet. Okay, and ask this light to bounce straight back up into you, right into your heart. Radiating out all the way around your field. Okay. All right. So ask this light to radiate out in your whole field of influence, past the building you're in. Filling the building you're in with this pure source energy and your happy intent that all of abundance is attracted to you. Okay. Ask this light to expand past the city you're in. Ask this light to expand past the state you're in. Ask this light to expand past the country you're in. Okay. Ask this light to expand past planet Earth, infusing the whole planet with love, knowing that you were always connected to the oneness of it all. Okay. I'm going to do a couple of clearings just really quickly before we begin. Okay. So everybody here is a totally aware being, okay? So at some level, you know everything, and you are the only person who can see all parts of your reality. Just look around your field or feel inside your field. And just whatever this block is, that's making everything in your life maybe, or I should say everything, but anything in your life going the opposite of what you want, let's just ask that all the cross purposes, known or unknown, seen or unseen, to be deleted from your entire reality field. Okay. Across all dimensions, time and space and realities. Ask that all of these cross purposes, that we covered in one of the earlier weeks, we're going to ask that all the cross purposes to you actually just really getting happy, uncreate and delete all that. Okay. Anywhere you guys shrink from the idea of going forward, uncreate and delete it all. Anywhere you guys shrink from taking massive action, delete all that. Anywhere you guys shrink from being happy, delete all that. So today's going to be a great day. We're going to fill you up with a lot of love and just really monitor where you guys disconnect yourself from the energy of love. So I want you to just make a little checklist, a scale of 1 to 10, for yourself in these little categories. So on a piece of paper, just write this down. Whatever first comes to your awareness before you think too much. On a daily basis regarding your wealth, how much love, a 10 being totally filled, How much love do you put into your wealth? So when you think about wealth, do you think, "Get cranky," or do you think, "Oh, I love it?" The energy of your family, because you're surrounded by people in your life right? If you don't have a family, just put the people, just kind of look at it like the people that are around you, loving you every day, right? Now, on a scale of one to 10, how much love is in those relationships? So you can look at each individual if you want, or you can just kind of look at the group. That's sort of included with the people in your life. So on a scale of one to 10, how much love is in the energy field with the people in your life? Including coworkers, people you might hang out with, friends. Do you have a whiny complainy friend and all it is, is about whining and complaining and gossip instead of love, right? All right. So how much love do you guys surround yourself regarding the energy at work? So we're just going to say you walk into work and if it's your home office, then it's your home office. That's work. But think of your clients or think of the people you work with, think of the whole energy of work. Which we're trying to make play, right? How much you love do you surround yourself in that? Okay. The energy in your home. You walk in and it doesn't really necessarily matter, it's like the vibe, right? You walk in, you hate it. You walk in, you are neutral about it. You walk in, you feel love. And about health. When you think of your health, you think, "Oh my God, I hate my body. I got to lose 40 pounds," or "I love my body. It's amazing that I get to be here on the planet." Okay. And then how much love do you surround yourself with in basically focusing and creating the upgraded you? When you have to show up on these calls or do some of your mantras, what are you thinking? Are you thinking, "Oh, I got to do it," or are you thinking, "Oh, I can't wait to do it?" Okay. So people are asking, "What love do we give or receive?" And to me, it's all of it, okay? 'Cause the deal is this, all of it. So you are constantly giving and receiving love thing. Now, some people love to give and then that fills them up. So the energy and the quality of the relationships is totally loving. But if you have resentment or anger or anguish, 'cause you're always the one giving and not receiving, can you see how that would put a lower vibration in there? Because the whole point of this is this. Okay. So my one product is called Love or Above, right? And the reason it's Love or Above, is because the vibration of love, joy, happiness, are higher vibrations that act like a magnet to attract that which you want. So when I think of my business or helping you all, right? I don't think there's nowhere in my energy field that I think, "Oh God, I got to like help these people again." You know what I mean? Instead, I think, "Wow. I get to completely help facilitate you guys so that you guys can go live a life of your dreams. Truthfully, there's nothing more exciting for me than that, right? So I get to wake up every day and love what I do or I get to wake up every day and love where I live. I love my beautiful orange mountain in the back of my house. That turns salmon color every morning, right? Okay. So, but when you're in that field, that field of influence is going to help. Kind of be like the WD 40, like the extra gas power that fuels you to get through anythings that might come up. So when you're creating your new self, right? So gratitude is also another form of loving yourself. I actually think that when we're grateful, we're actually being the truest part of ourself because we're vibing at the vibe where, if we can be so grateful, that means we're so filled with love, compassion, kindness, vulnerability, honesty, truth, and these vibrations are really what pure source energy is, right? And that will catapult you forward. Since most people get kind of whacked in the love place is in the energy of families. 'Cause that's the first place that you learn love, right? So if that was happy for you, you probably imprinted, "I know what love feels like. I love love." If it wasn't so happy for you, you probably imprinted these contrary beliefs, false information. If you grew up with your parents always fighting, then love equals fighting, right? Which is not love. But inside you is a little kid soaking in your family's environment, you probably imprinted that I have to fight in order to get love. Which isn't really true, but that's probably in you. So every time you go to manifest something, you think, "Oh my God, I love this thing that I really, really want." So then you automatically, as a pattern, think I had to fight for it, right? Instead of letting it come through with ease. All right. So that's why we're going to focus for a minute. The family imprinting of how you took in love, alright? Okay. So I see, so you guys are already sending me some love notes. So just focus for a minute. When your family grew up, did they have abundance? And if not, I want to just list some of the messages that you got from that. And also, okay, so we'll start clearing some of the things I'm seeing from you guys. So Grace is saying, "So if your family environment was stingy or that there was not enough money, we can absorb that by default." The answer is yes, Grace. And if you have enough other beliefs that can pull you up the other way. Like there's some people who are, grow up in a poor family and they use that as the impetus to create wealth, right? You can grow up in a middle income family and think, "I am going to be a millionaire," and that will drive you. But yeah. You can for sure be impacted dramatically by what your family was thinking. See, you know what I clear most when clients come to me? What I mostly have to clear is everything that happened to them before the age of 7 to 10, it depends on the person. But yeah. 'Cause most of the stuff would just absorbed them. So anywhere you guys' parents loved money more than you, which has got to suck, uncreate and delete all of that. Anywhere your parents loved fighting about money more than they loved caring for you, uncreate and delete all that across all time, dimension, space and reality. If your family was stingy, uncreate and delete all that. So if they were stingy with money, they might've been stingy with love or you might've interpreted they won't get you things, therefore, they're stingy with love. So everything that is, uncreate and delete all that. Okay. If your parents always fought and were critical about money or how the other person spent money, anywhere you absorbed any of that. So now you're critical with your money and you could either rebel against their criticism and blow all your money or you could maybe just duplicate what they're doing. Okay, so any of you who are, is fighting with your spouse, exactly like your parents fought about money, uncreate and delete all that stuff. So Galena, I'm not sure what you mean all the way. So whatever that means, anything in the way of you getting rich, uncreate and delete it all. So everywhere you guys are blocking the whole receiving of money. 'Cause at the end of the day, if you can receive money, you'll get money. If you love money enough, you'll receive it. Okay. So everything that is, yeah, delete it all. Anything contrary to you guys receiving millions of dollars, hundreds of thousands of dollars, hundreds of dollars, thousands of dollars, everything that is, uncreate and delete it all. Okay, so yeah, anywhere you guys need love from your family because they weren't giving it to you. So you just became the kind of person that they needed so that you could get love from your family. And maybe that was a miserable person. I've seen that happen. Where you grew up in a family and they're miserable. And in order to get love, you have to complain and be miserable. Okay. So everything that is uncreate and delete all that. Jenny, you don't have to, she's asking, "How could I be grateful for a seller who used foul language today?" I have an understanding. You don't have to necessarily be grateful, but maybe you can be grateful that you yourself aren't in that vibration, right? So if you can find something positive about it like, "Wow, how cool is it that I am not in that vibration?" Okay? Or, "Wow, isn't it so cool that I don't have the stress level she does?" Or "Wow, isn't it so cool that I don't have to live with her?" Okay? Any of those things will move it up into gratefulness instead of worrying about why she did it. All right. So everywhere where money doesn't grow on trees and you don't have enough, uncreate and delete all that. Everywhere I have to save and pinch every penny and money is always a struggle, uncreate and delete all that across all time, dimension, space and reality. "Let's say a family that prays together stays together." So I know where she's coming from because in some families that means then you're ultimately linked forever and ever and ever. And then you never get your own life. So anywhere a family that prays together stays together, and then therefore you never get your own life, uncreate and delete all that. Everywhere you have to work 24 7, 7 days a week. And then, only then will you make ends meet. I'm going to ask you guys to push this on your wishlist. I'm going to ask you guys, what would it take for you to make the same amount of money or whatever your, whatever your projection is, if you want to 10 times it, and work only whatever, 30 hours a week, pick a number, that'd be kind of cool, right? Just see what happens. What would it take for you guys to not have to work hard for your money and everything in the way of that? Uncreate all that. Would it take for money to show up easy? Oh yes. You have. Maybe you are one of the middle kids or the younger kid and you always got the hand me down. So basically you weren't number one and you were always number 1, 2, 3, or 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, or last or middle. Okay. So any of you guys living from the vibe of, "I have to be middle or last and I'm not first?" That's actually my poor sister, who was in the middle, there was three of us. I was the oldest. I got kind of lucky. 'Cause I got the imprint of, "I was number one," but my poor sister, we've had to clear a lot of stuff on her about being the middle child. So and it was just because she was number two. Everywhere abundance was, a lot of great abundance was a cause of fighting. So therefore, you don't want it. 'Cause why would I want something that made me fight? Okay, everywhere your parents fought about money as the normal way to do love. Any of you guys, whoever did any of those things with your own spouse or mate, duplicated from your parents or any previous spouse or mate, uncreate and delete all that. There was never enough money coming in and you never knew where more was coming. Everything that is, uncreate and delete it all. Everywhere love is transactional. Yes. Withdrawal of love used as a behavior modification. So anywhere you couldn't get love, if you were naughty or you didn't do what mommy wanted or daddy wanted or any of those kinds of things, delete all that. Anywhere you guys didn't get the energy of love, delete all that. Anywhere you felt unimportant or unvalued, delete all that. If you never felt the vibration of love, you're going to have to walk around saying, "What would it take for me to feel gratitude? What would take for me to feel love? What would it take for me to feel joy?" Okay. So you're going to have to really imprint yourself with those energies. Okay. Everywhere money doesn't grow on trees, delete all that. Too many children, not so much money, never enough, all that stuff, uncreate it all. So yeah, so everywhere you guys are the whole problem as kids, you were the whole problem to why your parents were poor, right? Like your parents were rich until you came along and then you took all their money, all their life, blah, blah, blah, and you were the source of their whole problems. Okay. So any of you guys who took that in, uncreate and delete all that. So everywhere your whole life is, "I'm a problem," not like, "I'm a thing to be loved," uncreate and delete all that. Everywhere you're the advice given the family 'cause your parents were really not parents. They were basically the kids and you were basically the parent. And everywhere you're tired of being the parent to everybody on the planet, instead of just getting a life for yourself, uncreate and delete all that. Now some of you might love it. So there's nothing that wrong to that. Except for some people feel a little resentful 'cause they don't get filled up themselves. Okay. So many of you guys, who are the givers, what would it take for you guys to be excellent receivers? Okay. There. Delete all that. Lots of kids, lots of work, uncreate and delete all that. I can relate to the fighting lover wealth. Okay. So anywhere you guys struggle with love and money, uncreate and delete all that. Everywhere your dad made really bad choices. So now you don't even know what to do with money 'cause you're stuck in limbo, you're stuck in confusion. Any of you guys stuck in limbo or confusion, 'cause you don't know what to do with money because you didn't get the download, delete all that. Everywhere you had to starve, uncreate and delete all that. Feast or Famine, uncreate and delete all that. A lot of like any of your parents who are gambling, kind of like where you'd make a lot of money and then lose a lot of money, make a lot of money, lose a lot of money, all that, delete all that. Everywhere work is exhausting, uncreate all that. And work equals no time for your kids. Therefore, you're unimportant. Delete all that. Everywhere you wasted all your time and all your money and all your efforts, everywhere you waste, everywhere I'm not made of money, and I don't have enough. One more time. Delete all that across all time, dimension, space, reality. Everywhere you should not be a burden to your family. Like you really asked to be born, right? It's all your fault. You were born. You didn't have anything to do with it. Okay. So everything that is, uncreate and delete all that. Okay. Anywhere you guys have a vibe of burden or the thing of anger. Where your parents had to deal with you and you are now the angry thing that they have to deal with. Like they're mad about it, uncreate and delete all that. Okay. Everywhere people lied about money. Maybe your mom lied to your dad about money. Your dad lied to mom about money and you knew everything. And you're this poor kid in the middle of watching your parents lie about money. Okay. Delete all that. How confusing would that be, right? Ever a love isn't given easy. Ever a love is lacking. Delete all that. Everywhere you're sad about how much love you received, uncreate and delete all that. Ever a love was never enough for you. Any of you guys who are needy, some people grow up needy because they never got love, and then they kind of need people, and then they feel disempowered 'cause they never get love for themselves. So how many people here are needy? Uncreate and delete all the need and just fill up a source as if you've always had love your whole life. Source can fill you up with all the love that you never received from your parents. You can just literally ask, like right now, all the love that you never got from your dad that you really truly wanted. What would it take for you to receive that right now? Just fill up with that. Soak that in. Just imagine it coming from the light above, into your body, filling you with the whole template that I had so much love for my father. Now, the reason you would do that, some people are going, "Why would I do that?" Because the energy of father is kind of imprinted here that we need a father and a mother. So if you feel like you didn't get it, you're getting it from pure divine source energy. So you can get the equivalent of, as if source energy, father source energy, loved you enough to give you the energy and mother source energy right now, loves you enough to give you all the love that you never had, that you really want. So open up to the energy of mother's source energy, pure mother love. Yeah. Filling you as if you had love your whole life. Okay, everywhere your dad didn't pay child support and money should not be saved. Everything that is, uncreate and delete it all. Okay, everywhere money didn't stick, uncreate it all. Everywhere deals fell through when you grew up. Okay. Delete all that. Everywhere you never saw your dad 'cause he's always working, delete all that. Okay, so any other karma that you have with your mother that's linking you to money and love. So all karma with your mother. Karma's this unhealed stuff, this life or any other past lives, right? So any karma with your mother that's sticking in your energy field not deleting, delete all that. 'Kay, any other unhealed karma with your father, uncreate and delete all that. Now, if you have stepfathers, do those too. Or stepmothers, you can do those too. So any other karma with people who raised you, if they were not your biological family, delete all that. Ooh. Everywhere you got ripped off 'cause your holiday was a too close to Christmas. Your birthday was too close to Christmas and you got ripped off. Everything that is, uncreate and delete it all. Everywhere you feel ripped off about how much lack of love and nourishment and genuine soul nourishment your mother and dad gave you, delete all that. Everywhere you had to do something in order to earn love, delete all that. Everywhere you're like, if your mom got pregnant or something like this, therefore she got money. So anywhere you're the fruit of any monetary transaction or the fulfillment of your mother's monetary need. Okay, delete all the places where you feel a lack of love about that. Okay. Any other place never enough. Okay. Delete all that. Ever your father had to, was injured or hurt or out of work or a mother out of work, and you guys had a period of life where you had no money coming in, delete all that. Anywhere in this lifetime, you had a period of no money coming in and felt deserted by source and love. Okay, everywhere you had to be literally tied up or abused in any form and that was the only version of love you had. Everything that is, uncreate and delete it all. Anybody else who has abused emotionally, verbally, physically, and that is linked to your love energy, delete all that. So ever a love is abusive and unkind and unfit, delete all that. All right, so everywhere you just got married, your parents got married and you had to eat scraps, uncreate and delete all that. Everywhere I grew up, always wanting parents' approval and never receiving it. So now you're waiting for approval in the form of like manifestations to show up, to prove that you're worthy instead of knowing you're worthy and then asking for everything to show up from that place. Everything that is, delete all that. Okay, any other fear, guilt and emotional stuff that's coming up. Whatever the label is that you can feel that you might not know what it means, that's just coming up right now regarding the subject of not getting love, uncreate and delete all that. Everywhere you can't hang on to money. A need to get sick to get some attention from your family, uncreate and delete all that. Yeah, ever you guys had to get sick or have something, a problem happen in order to get attention. Everywhere one of your siblings always got everything and you didn't. Any other unhealed karma with any of the siblings that you have, asking for the deletion and the uncreation of all karma with siblings that's holding you back. And since we're doing the love, any mates that there's still some karma unhealed stuff with, with any past mate or current mate that's blocking your love and abundance from showing up, delete all that. So everywhere your parents had a lot of money, but you decided somewhere that you couldn't be like them or they made you feel like you weren't like them. Or you could have imprinted that "Mommy and daddy take care of me." And you never learned how to get the energy of taking care of yourself. Everything that is, delete all that. So all decisions that you guys made that keep money away from you, delete all those. Anywhere you only had the basic needs met, but yeah, not anything more than that, uncreate and delete all that. Irene is saying, "Who do you think you are? daughter?" Wow. Okay. Everything that is, uncreate and delete all that. Everywhere you have to go without that's the norm, delete all that. Yeah, everywhere you have to be just totally thrilled and happy that we love you. I mean, forget that we can't feed you. Okay. Delete all that. Okay. Roslyn just had a breakthrough. She said her mom always took her birthday money away from her "to buy me what she thought I needed or put away." Yeah. You know what, if any, yeah. That's one of the greatest woundings I've seen. When you give a kid money and then you have to teach them to be responsible with their money, you can't really control their money 'cause they think it's their money. I mean, maybe have a rule that 30% gets put away, the rest you can do for yourself. I know some parents that as soon as the kid got money, they make them put it all away and then the kid never learned how to handle money. It's crazy. Okay. So everything that is, uncreate and delete all that. Everywhere there's more than one kid and you guys were always in competition for money and love. And everywhere it wasn't fair. So everywhere really wasn't fair in the end. You know what I mean? One of the siblings got more than you. Can't hold on to it. You have to do an emergency. Emergency is always created every time you get extra. Delete all that. Everywhere you guys are saving for a rainy day, 'cause then that creates a rainy day. Okay. Uncreate all that. Okay. Everywhere it's affecting your current relationship where you don't like to talk about money with your spouse, 'cause really ideally you and your spouse would be in the same kind of plan. Like you guys would have a plan. You can keep your money separate, but at least have a plan or something, right? So you guys are creating some group energy towards abundance. So everywhere you guys can't talk about money, nobody can talk about money. And everywhere you guys don't have wills and all the financial details in order. 'Cause nobody wants to talk about any of that. Or my mate, won't talk about that. Or I don't want to talk about that. Okay. Delete all that stuff. All right. A penny saved is a penny earned and disposable money for nothing or money for fun is not around, uncreate and delete all that. Everywhere your sibling, one more time, got more than you. Okay. Everywhere you guys have to have some degree and then you'll get paid more money. So anywhere you think degrees equal money versus just street smarts equal money. Okay. So anything that is, delete all that. Okay. Yeah. You guys are, think you're dumb. Okay. So ever you guys think you're dumb with money or dumb or dumb luck or can't be that smart or can't be the smart to have this kind of life. Everything that is, uncreate and delete all that. A lot of energy in that. I would work on that. If any of you guys have anything about feeling dumb or not enough about your smarts, delete all that. Okay. Anywhere you guys had the whole families fighting against each other for money. And then people get divorced and they fight for money. And then parents dying and all the kids fight over the money. Any of that stuff. Everywhere the family screws each other for money. Basically. Ever the family becomes their own worst nightmare, delete all that. Everywhere you're attracting men or women who want to spend all your money. That's got to suck. Okay. So everything that is, delete all that. And everywhere you are a sucker and give it to them. Okay. Everything that is, uncreate and delete all that. So anywhere you feel badly about any of those transactions. So any money transaction that you still feel badly about and you still ruminate about, or still stuck in your consciousness, uncreate and delete all that. Any love transaction that you've ever had? Like I married that person. I dated that person. So any love transaction that you still feel regret over, delete all that. All right. Everywhere you guys never said, "I love you," or meant it at home. So suppressed feelings are everywhere. You said, "I can't believe it," or you went into shock. So everywhere you guys have all these suppressed emotions. Like I can't deal with it. I don't know. I can't believe it. I can't believe this just happened. I don't know what to do. I can't handle this. Any of those things are suppressed emotions behind the scenes. Okay. Uncreate and delete all those. So everywhere love is not enough. I wanted to just really get this main belief here. So uncreate and delete all that. Everywhere love is not enough, uncreate and delete all that. Want you to think for a minute. How do you communicate your desire to grow? Like if you want to grow in your life, if I say, "Oh, you have to change every part of your life. Is the first response that you guys get angry? Or is the first response frustration? Or is the first response what? So Karen had a light bulb moment. "I was angry and mean to my mother when she wouldn't buy me clothes. She gave in and wrote a bad check. Then, having to deal with the consequences with her dad. As an adult, I find myself spending for others, even if I don't have it." Okay. Good job, Karen. Good job. Okay. Anybody who's crying. That's just releasing. Good job, you guys. You guys are doing a lot. Okay. So everywhere you go into all these lower dimensions, okay, in order to create something different, uncreate and delete all those. Wow. A lot of energy on this. Okay. Everything that is, uncreate and delete all that. Okay. All the despair, fear, anger, worry, shame, ambivalence, apathy, depression, suppression, core beliefs attached to it, no desire. Everywhere you talk yourself out of things. All of the funny things that happen, uncreate and delete them all across all time, dimension, space, reality. Why is usually apathy, if you ask, why do I want to do it? Why bother? Why? Why? Why? There's usually some apathetic suppression or depression that happened somewhere. Okay. Are you living, being, and dreaming your abundance as if you have it? You know how they say that your, the amount of money you make is the equivalent of the five people you hang out with the most, okay? So any of you guys who don't think you can just kind of step in that whole dimension where you try it on. Okay. So you guys obviously, hopefully have things on your dream board or you wrote out your story of how you want it to happen. So if you want like a Mercedes, I'm just going to pick on material things for a minute. But if you want a Mercedes, why don't you go drive a Mercedes and check it out, right? Make it real. If you want to have extra wealth and you want to dress a certain way, why don't you try and close like that? Now, there's no reason why you can't dress like that in less expensive clothes. As we've had success stories of people finding clothes on sale that are nice clothes. So what if you could live it, be it and dream it as if you have it? Okay. So anything that's preventing you guys from trying on the reality basically, and acting it out for yourself, uncreate and delete all that. So that's your homework assignment. Your play, your play. I don't want to call it homework. Your play at home. Home play. What would it take for you guys to go try on some part of your reality that you haven't tried on yet? That you really want to try on. Okay? So what would it take for you guys to do that? So go home shopping, whatever that is. Okay. Do you guys laugh at your situations easily? Like if I have something weird happen, honestly, I really don't do emotional meltdown. I usually pretty much laugh at things. So anywhere you guys have an emotional meltdown as your first, second, and third reaction, everything that is, will you uncreate and delete it all? Okay. So I'm going to ask you to monitor where you do that. And every time you do a reaction, right? Notice that reaction. That means you're acting on some pattern, uncreate and delete it all. So think of the last reaction, like maybe the last really weird situation you had and then ask yourself what was your reaction? Okay. So everything that is, delete all of those. That's a lot of energy right there. Okay. Everything that is across all time, dimension, space, reality, delete it all. Okay. So Chris was asking, "Why do I feel numb about love and wealth?" Because somewhere you decided you couldn't receive it. So your numbness is an inability to receive. So I would work on what would it take for me to receive it and value myself enough to get it and care about it enough to have it and care about myself enough to have it. You're going to have to link it to something positive. Like freedom, fun, travel, something that you really love to do. And then it'll be a little easier for you, Chris. The other Chris, "I recently learned that many of the things that we pass up because of fear were actually miracle opportunities that the universe brought us." Yes. That is true. The universe is always giving to us. It's either A, giving us a chance to correct a program or a pattern by showing us what we don't want and/or it's bringing us what we do want. And oftentimes you might not know why it brought it in that form, but if you follow the path, you'll understand exactly 'cause it could be through a person who connects you to a person who connects you to a person, right? Okay. See, how do you try on a soulmate? Make sure you sign up for like a match or eharmony or you go out hanging out where guys hang out, Monica. Just try on and imagine. Do a lot of visualization being with a guy. Okay. All right. So Margaret, all you guys that are still stuck in some like thing where you don't thinking change your abundance and have money show up. Uncreate and delete it all. And I am curious if you're blocked in love, I'm wondering if you're blocked in money. So any of you guys that are blocked in both manifesting a mate or a happy relationship and/or manifesting money. Uncreate and delete all the places those are tied together. Okay. So everywhere you guys have the "it's too good to be true" as soon as the manifestation shows up. And everywhere you guys think the universe is like Santa Claus. Like it'll show it up. But then at the end he just gives you a lump of coal or something. So whatever that is, uncreate and delete it all. Christie, she was asking, "How do we handle debt collectors and empty bank account?" I would focus it on like, I have a clean slate. Okay. I wouldn't like, look at it like I'm broke. I would be like, I have a clean slate, because in truth you do. You get to start from scratch. If you're starting from scratch, how do you want it to look? And then I would also look into the laws because debt collectors can't collect things after a certain amount of years and things like that. Okay. So feeling a tightness after you did the clearing. So all the places where you guys have linked love and money, so you can't manifest abundance and you can't manifest a loving mate. Delete all that. Everywhere you feel unworthy to receive love and unworthy to receive kindness and are not valued. So everywhere you guys are not valued at the end of the day, or don't feel loved. There. 'Kay. Safer and good to receive love. Is safer and good to receive love in the form of abundance. Is safer and good for love to show up in all parts of your life and safer and good for love to show up in the form of everything on your vision board. Is safer and good for love to be the natural emotion that you have every day. So what would it take for love? So you guys, here's your homework a little bit. What would it take for you guys to feel love and joy? Okay. Would be a really big deal one. What would it take for you to love life in all its incarnations as you move forward? Like when you're changing things, you guys laugh at the things that show up, okay? Instead of going, "Oh God, I still suck." Blah, blah, blah. So everywhere you guys think you still suck and you can't get over it, uncreate and delete all that. Yes. What would it take for you guys to love life in all its current incarnations as you move forward? What would it take for you guys to live, be dream your abundance as if you already have it? What would it take for you guys to laugh at your situations easily and everything in the way of that? Delete it all. Okay. Any other karma or karmic imprint you guys have with your parents that does not allow you to love yourself more than they loved you. What would it take for you guys to believe you can live as you? The real you, right? Whatever version that is. Uncreate and delete all that. What would it take for you guys to see you yourself as abundance personified? What would it take for you guys to be abundance personified? So if your personified in it, you're acting abundantly as a natural talent. There. What would it take for you guys to create multiple streams of income? It's really like unlimited streams of income, right? Okay. There. What would it take for you guys to create unlimited funding? Okay. What would it take for you guys to amaze yourself with how quickly everything shows up for you? What would it take for you guys to achieve supernatural, incoming income and money? So I'm saying supernatural 'cause above natural, right? Okay. Supernatural, incoming money. Okay. What would it take for you to make all things easy? Okay. Uncreate all that. Okay. What would it take for you guys to make your life easy? What would it take for you guys to look at life like it's, I don't know how else to say it, like grace energy is actually like WD 40, it's kind of like slips through the universe and kind of opens doors. So what would it take for you guys to grace and bless your whole life, so that all parts of your life just all the doors open and everything becomes easy? All right. What would it take for you guys to be the lover of everything. Okay. Winnie, thank you for connecting. She said in this session, all the other sessions, she was calm. This session she's restless and agitated. Yeah. That's usually a, an energy that wants to leave. So kind of go inside a little bit and ask, "What awareness am I not willing to receive? What awareness am I not willing to receive that could change my life?" And then you'll kind of get a picture of maybe mom. It feels like it's attached to mom. Okay. So what would take for you guys to be the lover of everything? Okay. Trevor. So anybody from a different country that doesn't know Google, WD 40. It's like this, it's like this lubricant that makes things that squeak and stick like door jams and things like this, it opens them up. That's a good, that's a good question. I keep forgetting that I'm American and not everybody knows what I'm talking about. All right. Okay. "What if you experienced anger, rage after the sessions?" Christie, it's probably energy and emotions coming out of you. I would probably take maybe a little bit of a bath, like water kind of usually calms your emotional body. Saltwater is good. If you need to just like, basically a scream it out for 2 seconds, 20 seconds, 2 hours does get it out of you. Don't suppress it. Just get it out. And then don't judge however it comes out. All right. Now, Julia, that's yourself, by the way. It's not your mom. It's you. It's you suppressing you, okay? So it's you suppressing you. Okay. Any of you guys have left? Grace, your thing has to do with your mother. Okay. What would it take for you guys to be the emotional level of love and above all the time? What would it take for you guys to do what's needed to be the energy of love? What would it take universe to deliver for you guys all the love you desire with no restrictions? What would take for the vibrational energy of you to become unlimited resources and love? What would it take for the vibrational energy of you to become all the dreams that you desire? What would it take for the vibrational energy that love brings you all the money and flow of abundance? All right. Awesome. You guys did great. What vibrational energy can you be love personified in all of your life? So you guys did really, really amazing. I would hope that you guys could listen to this one again, because there's a lot of energy on the subject of love, okay? So all week it feels like for you guys for about a week and a half, all your love issues where you don't feel love enough to receive, is going to show up in your life, okay? And then you're just going to have to keep letting it flow. All right. Love you guys.

====================

LESSON 20: Clearing Lack Of Self Worth (Clearing Session Only)

So everybody close your eyes for a minute. Okay, and if you're driving, obviously do not close your eyes. Okay, see, sense, or feel the light 300 feet above your head. Okay, open the doorway to all of source energy, all of true abundance. Okay, allow this true abundance to trickle into your head, your crown, opening up all the divine knowledge, all the wherewithal, the whatwithal, and everything you need to do in order to Grab it, find it, keep it, attract it, and receive it. Okay, asking that everywhere in your third eye and your ears, you're connected again to true divine guidance. Asking that the universe always be abundant and work in your favor. Okay, ask the source energy to come through your throat, opening up your throat to communicate your true desires and have them be met. Ask this light to come into your heart, opening up your heart to receive that you are valued and loved enough to have all of your dreams and manifestations come true. Okay, ask this light to come into your torso, anything that makes you nervous about moving forward. Ask that to release. Ask this light to completely support you so you feel strong, confident, fearless, able to take massive action. Okay, ask this light to infuse you with a sense of power and confidence, knowing that all is well and it is only up to you to just ask and receive. Okay, ask this light to have you grounded in the trust that you are a creator and that you yourself can create and manifest the life that you truly desire. Okay, ask this light to ground that energy into the ground. Find the happy place in the center of the planet. Okay, the happy place in the center of the planet. Okay, and ask this light to bounce straight back up into you, right into your heart, radiating out all the way around your field. Okay. All right, so ask this light to radiate out in your whole field of influence past the building you're in, filling the building you're in with this pure source energy and your happy intent that all of abundance is attracted to you. Okay, ask this light to expand past the city you're in. Ask this light to expand past the state you're in. Ask this light to expand past the country you're in. Okay, ask this light to expand past planet Earth, infusing the whole planet with love, knowing that you are always connected to the oneness of it all. Okay, I'm going to do a couple of clearings just really quickly before we begin. Okay, so everybody here is a totally aware being, okay? So at some level, you know everything. And you are the only person who can see all parts of your reality. Just look around your field or feel inside your field. And just whatever this block is that's making everything in your life, maybe, or I shouldn't say everything, but anything in your life going the opposite of what you want. Let's just ask that all the cross purposes, known or unknown, seen or unseen, to be deleted from your entire reality field. Okay, across all dimensions, time and space and realities, ask that all of these cross purposes that we covered in one of the earlier weeks, we're going to ask that all the cross purposes to you actually just really getting happy, uncreate and delete all that. Okay, anywhere you guys shrink from the idea of going forward, uncreate and delete it all. Anywhere you guys shrink from taking massive action, delete all that. Anywhere you guys shrink from being happy. Delete all that. Okay, so we'll start clearing some of the things I'm seeing from you guys. So anywhere you guys' parents loved money more than you, which has got to suck, uncreate and delete all that. Anywhere your parents loved fighting about money more than they loved caring for you, uncreate and delete all that across all time, dimensions, space, and reality. If your family was stingy, uncreate and delete all that. So if they are stingy with money, they might have been stingy with love, or you might have interpreted they won't get you things, therefore they're stingy with love. So everything that is, uncreate and delete all that. Okay, if your parents always fought and were critical about money or how the other person spent money, anywhere you absorbed any of that, so now you're critical with your money, and you could either rebel against their criticism and blow all your money, or you could, you know, maybe just duplicate what they're doing. Okay, so any of you who are fighting with your spouse, exactly like your parents fought about money, uncreate and delete all that stuff. Anything in the way of you getting rich, uncreate and delete it all. So everywhere you guys are blocking the whole receiving of money. Because at the end of the day, if you can receive money, you'll get money. If you love money enough, you'll receive it. Okay, so everything that is. Yeah, delete it all. Anything contrary to you guys receiving millions of dollars, hundreds of thousands of dollars, hundreds of dollars, thousands of dollars, everything that is, uncreate and delete it all. Okay, so yeah, anywhere you guys need love from your family, and in order to get love, you have to complain and be miserable. Okay, so everything that is, uncreate and delete all that. Alright, so everywhere where money doesn't grow on trees and you don't have enough, uncreate and delete all that. Everywhere you have to save and pinch every penny and money is always a struggle. Uncreate and delete all that across all time, dimension, space, and reality. Let's see, a family that prays together stays together. So I know where she's coming from because in some families that means then you're ultimately linked forever and ever and ever and then you never get your own life. So anywhere... A family that prays together, stays together, and then, therefore, you never get your own life on create and delete all that. Everywhere you have to work 24 -7, seven days a week, and then, only then, will you make ends meet. I'm going to ask you guys to push this on your wish list. I'm going to ask you guys, what would it take for you to make the same amount of money or whatever your projection is, like, you know, if you want to 10 times it, and work only, whatever, 30 hours a week. Like, pick a number. That'd be kind of cool, right? Just see what happens. What would it take for you guys to not have to work hard for your money and everything in the way of that? Uncreate all that? What would it take for money to show up easy? Oh, yes. Maybe you were one of the middle kids or the younger kid, and you always got the hand -me -downs, so basically you weren't number one, and you were always number one, two, three, four, five, six, or last, or middle. Okay, so any of you guys living from the vibe of I have to be middle or last and I'm not first? Everywhere abundance was a lot of great abundance was a cause of fighting, so therefore you don't want it because why would I want something that made me fight? Okay, everywhere your parents fought about money as the normal way to do love. Any of you guys, whoever did any of those things with your own spouse or mate duplicated from your parents or any previous spouse or mate, I'm going to create and delete all that. There was never enough money coming in and you never knew where more was coming. Everything that is, uncreate and delete it all. Everywhere love is transactional, yes. Withdrawal of love used as a behavior modification. So anywhere you couldn't get love, if you were naughty or, you know, or you didn't know what mommy wanted or daddy wanted or any of those kind of things, delete all that. Anywhere you guys didn't get the energy of love, delete all that. Anywhere you felt unimportant or unvalued, delete all that. ever felt the vibration of love, you're going to have to walk around saying, what would it take for me to feel gratitude? What would it take for me to feel love? What would it take for me to feel joy? Okay, everywhere money doesn't grow on trees. Delete all that. Too many children, not so much money, never enough, all that stuff. Uncreated also. Yeah, so everywhere you guys are the whole problem as kids, you were the whole problem to why your parents were poor, right? Like your parents were rich until you came along and then you took all their money, all their life, blah, blah, blah. And you were the source of their whole problems. Okay, so any of you guys who took that in, uncreate and delete all that. So everywhere your whole life is I'm a problem, not like I'm a thing to be loved. Uncreate and delete all that. Everywhere you're the advice given the family because your parents were really not parents. They were basically the kids and you were like basically the parent. And everywhere you're tired of being the parent to everybody on the planet instead of just getting a life. for yourself uncreate and delete all that okay so any of you guys who are the givers what would it take for you guys to be excellent receivers okay there i delete all that lots of kids lots of work uncreate and delete all that i can relate to the fighting love or wealth okay so anywhere you guys struggle with love and money uncreate and delete all that Everywhere your dad made really bad choices. So now you don't even know what to do with money because you're stuck in limbo. You're stuck in confusion. Any of you guys stuck in limbo or confusion because you don't know what to do with money because you didn't get the download. Okay, delete all that. Everywhere you had to like starve, uncreate and delete all that. Feast or famine, uncreate and delete all that. A lot of like any of your parents who are like gambling kind of like where you'd make a lot of money. And then lose a lot of money. Make a lot of money. Lose a lot of money. All that. Delete all that. Everywhere work is exhausting. Uncreate all that. And work equals no time for your kids. Therefore, you're unimportant. Delete all that. Everywhere you've wasted all your time and all your money and all your efforts. Everywhere you waste. Everywhere I'm not made of money and I don't have enough. One more time. Delete all that. Across all time to mention space reality. Everywhere you should not be a burden to your family. Like you really asked to be born, right? It's all your fault you were born. We didn't have anything to do with it. Okay, so everything that is, uncreate and delete all that. Okay, anywhere you guys have a vibe of burden or the thing of anger, you know, where your parents had to deal with you and you are now the angry thing that they have to deal with, like they're mad about it. Uncreate and delete all that. Okay, everywhere people lied about money. Maybe your mom lied to your dad about money, your dad lied to your money, and you knew everything. and you're this poor kid in the middle of watching your parents lie about money. Okay, delete all that. How confusing would that be, right? Everywhere love isn't given easy, everywhere love is lacking, delete all that. Everywhere you're sad about how much love you received, uncreate and delete all that. Everywhere love was never enough for you. Any of you guys who are needy, some people grow up needy because they never got love and then they kind of need people and then they feel disempowered because they never get love for themselves. So how many people here are needy? Uncreate and delete all the need and just fill up with source as if you've always had love your whole life. You know, source can fill you up with all the love that you never received from your parents. You can just literally ask like right now, like all the love that you never got from your dad that you really truly wanted, what would it take for you to receive that right now? Just fill up with that. Soak that in. Just imagine it coming from, you know, the light above. into your body filling you with the whole template that i had so much love for my father now the reason you would do that some people are going why would i do that because the energy of father is like kind of imprinted here that we need a father and a mother so if you feel like you didn't get it you're getting it from pure divine source energy so you can get the equivalent of like as a source energy father source energy loved you enough to give you the energy and mother source energy right now loves you enough to give you all the love that you never had that you really want so open up to the energy of mother's source energy pure mother love yeah filling you as if you had love your whole life okay everywhere your dad didn't pay child support and money should not be saved everything that is and create and delete it all okay everywhere money didn't stick when you create it all everywhere deals fell through when you grew up okay delete all that Everywhere you never saw your dad because he's always working, delete all that. Okay, so any other karma that you have with your mother that's linking you to money and love. So all karma with your mother, karma is just unhealed stuff, this life or any other past lives, right? So any karma with your mother that's sticking in your energy field, not deleting, delete all that. Okay, any other unhealed karma with your father? I can delete all that. Now if you had stepfathers, do those too. Or stepmothers, you can do those too. So any other karma with people who raised you, if they were not your biological family, delete all that. Everywhere you got ripped off because your holiday was too close to Christmas. Your birthday was too close to Christmas and you got ripped off. Everything that is, uncreate and delete it all. Everywhere you feel ripped off about how much lack of love and nourishment and genuine soul nourishment your mother and dad gave you. Delete all that. Everywhere you had to do something in order to earn love. Delete all that. Everywhere you're like, if your mom got pregnant or something like this, therefore she got money. So anywhere you're the fruit of any monetary transaction or the fulfillment of your mother's monetary need. Okay, delete all the places where you feel a lack of love about that. Okay, any other place, never enough. Okay, delete all that. Everywhere your father had to like, was injured or hurt or out of work or a mother out of work and you guys had a period of life where you had no money coming in. Delete all that. Anywhere in this lifetime you had a period of no money coming in and felt deserted by source and love. Okay, everywhere you had to be literally tied up. or abused in any form, and that was the only version of love you had, everything that is, uncreate and delete it all. Anybody else who is abused emotionally, verbally, physically, and that is linked to your love energy, delete all that. So everywhere love is abusive and unkind and unfit, delete all that. All right, so everywhere you just got married, your parents got married and you had to eat scraps, uncreate and delete all that. Everywhere you grew up always wanting parents' approval and never receiving it. So now you're waiting for approval in the form of like manifestations to show up to prove that you're worthy instead of knowing you're worthy and then asking for everything to show up from that place. Everything that is, delete all that. Okay, any other fear, guilt, and emotional stuff that's coming up, whatever the label is that you can feel that you might not know what it means that's just coming up right now regarding the subject of not getting love, uncreate and delete all that. Everywhere you can't hang on to money. I need to get sick to get some attention from your family. Uncreate and delete all that. Yeah, everywhere you guys had to get sick or have something, a problem happen in order to get attention. Everywhere one of your siblings always got everything and you didn't. Any other unhealed karma with any of those siblings that you have? Asking for the deletion and the uncreation of all karma with siblings that's holding you back. And since we're doing the love, any mates that there's still some karma unhealed stuff with? With any past mate or current mate that's blocking your love and abundance from showing up, delete all that. So everywhere your parents had a lot of money, but you decided somewhere that you couldn't be like them or they made you feel like you weren't like them. Or you could have imprinted that mommy and daddy take care of me and you never learned how to get the energy of taking care of yourself. Everything that is, delete all that. So all decisions that you guys made that keep money away from you, delete all those. you only had the basic needs met but um yeah not anything more than that uncreate and delete all that irene's saying who do you think you are anastasis daughter oh wow okay everything that is uncreate and delete all that uh everywhere you have to go without that's the norm delete all that yeah everywhere you have to be just totally thrilled and happy that we love you i mean forget that we can't feed you okay delete all that Okay, Rosalind just had a breakthrough. She said her mom always took her birthday money away from her to buy me what she thought I needed or put away. Yeah, you know what? If any, yeah, that's one of the greatest woundings I've seen. When you give a kid money and then you have to teach them to be responsible with their money, you can't really control their money because they think it's their money. I know some parents, as soon as the kid got money, they'd make him put it all away and then the kid never learned how to handle money. Okay, so everything that is, uncreate and delete all that. Everywhere there was more than one kid, and you guys were always in competition for money and love. And everywhere it wasn't fair. So everywhere it really wasn't fair in the end. You know what I mean? One of the siblings got more than you. Can't hold on to it. You have to do an emergency. Emergency is always created every time you get extra. Delete all that. Everywhere you guys are saving for a rainy day, because then that creates a rainy day. Okay, uncreate all that. Okay, everywhere it's affecting your current relationship where you don't like to talk about money with your spouse, because really, ideally, you and your spouse would be on the same kind of plan, like you guys would have a plan. You can keep your money separate, but at least have a plan or something, right? So you guys are creating some group energy towards abundance. So everywhere you guys can't talk about money, nobody can talk about money. And everywhere you guys don't have wills and all the financial details in order, because nobody wants to talk about any of that. or my mate won't talk about that, or I don't want to talk about that. Okay, delete all that stuff. All right, a penny saved is a penny earned, and disposable money for nothing or money for fun is not around. Create and delete all that. Everywhere your sibling one more time got more than you. Okay, everywhere you guys have to have some degree, and then you'll get paid more money. So anywhere you think degrees equal money versus just street smarts equal money. Okay, so anything that is, delete all that. Okay, yeah, you guys think you're dumb. Okay, so every of you guys think you're dumb with money or dumb or dumb luck or can't be that smart or can't be the smart to have this kind of life, everything that is, uncreate and delete all that. A lot of energy on that. I would work on that. If any of you guys have anything about feeling dumb or not enough about your smarts, delete all that. Okay, anywhere you guys have the whole like families fighting against each other for money and then people get divorced and they fight for money and then parents dying and all the kids fight over the money, any of that stuff. Everywhere the family screws each other for money, basically. Everywhere the family becomes their own worst nightmare, delete all that. Everywhere you're attracting men or women who want to spend all your money, that's gotta suck. Okay, so everything that is, delete all that. And everywhere you are a sucker and give it to them. Okay, everything that is, uncreate and delete all that. So anywhere you feel badly about any of those transactions. So any money transaction that you still feel badly about, and you still ruminate about, or it's still stuck in your consciousness, uncreate and delete all that. Any love transaction that you've ever had, like I married that person, I dated that person, so any love transaction that you still feel regret over, delete all that. All right. Everywhere you guys never said I'd love you or meant it at home. So suppressed feelings are everywhere you said I can't believe it or you went into shock. So everywhere you guys have all these suppressed emotions, like I can't deal with it, I don't know, I can't believe it, I can't believe this just happened, I don't know what to do, I can't handle this, any of those things are suppressed emotions behind the scenes. Okay, uncreate and delete all those. So everywhere love is not enough. I wanted to just really get this main belief here. So uncreate and delete all that. Everywhere love is not enough. Uncreate and delete all that. Okay, anybody who's crying, that's just releasing. Good job, you guys. You guys are doing a lot. Okay, so everywhere you go into all these lower dimensions, okay, in order to create something different, uncreate and delete all those. Wow, a lot of energy on this. Okay, everything that is, uncreate and delete all that. Okay, all the despair, fear, anger, worry, shame, ambivalence, apathy, depression, suppression, core beliefs attached to it, no desire, everywhere you talk yourself out of things, all of the funny things that happen, uncreate and delete them all across all time to mention space reality. Okay, so anything that's preventing you guys from trying on the reality, basically, and acting it out for yourself, uncreate and delete all that. So that's your homework assignment. Your play, I don't want to call it homework. Your play at home. Home play. What would it take for you guys to go try on some part of your reality that you haven't tried on yet, that you really want to try on? Okay, do you guys laugh at your situations easily? Like if I have something weird happen, honestly, I really don't do emotional meltdown. I usually pretty much laugh at things. So anywhere you guys have an emotional meltdown as your first, second, and third reaction, everything that is. Will you uncreate and delete it all? Okay, so I'm going to ask you to monitor where you do that. And every time you do a reaction, right, notice that reaction, that means you're acting on some pattern. Uncreate and delete it all. So think of the last reaction, like maybe the last really weird situation you had, and then ask yourself what was your reaction. Okay, so everything that is, delete all of those. That's a lot of energy right there. Okay, everything that is across all time dimensions, space reality, delete it all. All you guys that are still stuck in some like thing where you don't think you can change your abundance and have money show up, uncreate and delete it all. And I am curious, if you're blocked in love, I'm wondering if you're blocked in money. So any of you guys that are blocked in both manifesting a mate or a happy relationship and or manifesting money, uncreate and delete all the places those are tied together. Okay, so everywhere you guys have like, it's too good to be true as soon as a manifestation shows up. And everywhere you guys think the universe is like Santa Claus, like it'll show it up. But then at the end, he just gives you a lump of coal or something. So whatever that is, uncreate and delete it all. Okay, so feeling a tightness after he did the clearing. So all the places where you guys have linked love and money. So you can't manifest abundance and you can't manifest a loving mate. Delete all that. Everywhere you feel unworthy to receive love and unworthy to receive kindness and are not valued. So everywhere you guys are not valued at the end of the day or don't feel loved there. Okay, it's safer and good to receive love. It's safer and good to receive love in the form of abundance. It's safer and good for love to show up in all parts of your life. It's safer and good for love to show up in the form of everything on your vision board. It's safer and good for love to be the natural emotion that you have every day. What would it take for you to love life in all its incarnations as you move forward? Like when you're changing things, you guys like laugh at the things that show up, okay? Instead of like going, oh God, I still suck, blah, blah, blah. So everywhere you guys think you still suck and you can't get over it, uncreate and delete all that. Yes, what would it take for you guys to love life in all its incarnations as you move forward? What would it take for you guys to live, be, dream your abundance as if you already have it? What would it take for you guys to laugh at your situations easily and everything in the way of that, delete it all? Okay, any other karma or karmic imprint you guys have with your parents that does not allow you to love your... more than they loved you? What would it take for you guys to believe you can live as you? The real you, right? Whatever version that is. Uncreate and delete all that. What would it take for you guys to see you, yourself, as abundance personified? What would it take for you guys to be abundance personified? So if you're personified in it, you're acting abundantly as a natural talent. There. What would it take for you guys to create multiple streams of income? It's really like unlimited streams of income, right? Okay, there. What would it take for you guys to create unlimited funding? Okay, what would it take for you guys to amaze yourself with how quickly everything shows up for you? What would it take for you guys to achieve supernatural incoming income and money? So I'm saying supernatural because above natural, right? Okay, what would it take for you to make all things easy? Okay, uncreate all that. Okay, what would it take for you guys to make your life easy? What would it take for you guys to look at life like it's, I don't know how else to say it, like grace energy is actually like WD -40. It kind of like slips through the universe and kind of opens doors. So what would it take for you guys to grace and bless your whole life so that all parts of your life, just all the doors open and everything becomes easy? All right, what would it take for you guys to be the lover of everything? Okay, so what would it take for you guys to be the lover of everything? What would it take for you guys to be the emotional level of love and above all the time? What would it take for you guys to do what's needed to be the energy of love?

LESSON 21: Clearing Financial Mess to Attract Blessings in Life

- Hey, this is Christie Marie Sheldon, and you're listening to a recording I did of a series of 24 live group sessions on clearing abundance blocks. Hey, welcome, welcome. Today is day 21 in the Unlimited Abundance Journey. And today, we're going to talk about some of your messes, all right? And everywhere you're avoiding being messy in your life, which could be a block. So grab a piece of paper so you can write down all your ahas and your what to dos later on. Be open to new abundance and let's set our intents for what you hope to achieve today. So what would you love, love, love to happen today for you? And what would you love, love, love to happen for the week? And what would you love, love, love to happen before the end of the Unlimited Abundance Journey? All right, set your intent on what you hope to achieve. Cool, cool, cool. All right, so let's bring the energy that you want to release to the forefront and let's begin. All right, what is your story? We got some fun, inspirational stories today. And the whole time you're listening, what I would love for you to do is just think, "What would it take for something like that to happen for me, right?" That or something greater. All right, Camille, a financial planner set a very specific goal when she started her Unlimited Abundance Journey. One of the first goals was to make $15,000 a month, and the second was to pay off her line of credit. Last year things were tough and she only wrote about a million dollars in new investments in the entire 12 months. Well, she just wrote $500,000, half a million dollars for the month of August alone. And it's only 21 days, and she sent this to me a few days ago, okay? So in less than 20 days, she wrote half a million dollars of business in the month of August. And remember, she only wrote a million dollars in the whole 12 months last year, and that was her goal. So she made her goal. Yay! And then she's been asking, what would it take to make another 15,000 this month? Love it. So she didn't stop. She says there is a potential for another half a million dollars in investments. And so she, when this happens, she'll be able to pay off her line of credit. So keep us posted. That is a great story. Oscar, an amazing tale of abundance. His day was really, really surprising and just build, lit up with abundance. Oscar started his day preparing for a long trail ride on his bicycle. Got to the parking lot, totally packed, no spot in sight, long line of vehicles, all of them looking for a space thinking, "Oh my God, we're not going to get a space, right?" He just said, "What would it take to find a parking spot now?" Next thing you know, a guy was walking out and said, "Hey, you want my spot? I'm leaving, right here." And it was right where he was. So he's at the perfect place at the perfect time. Feeling great, he took off on his bike, rode 20 miles, turned around. He was really hot and tired, so he asked, "What would it take to find a shady spot to rest and some cold water?" He rode around the next bend, there was a community group handing out ice water for free and under the shade of a big tree, so voila! Took a break, sipped some water, was thinking about work and asked, "What would it take..." Now notice he's doing this all the time, right? It's like a daily mantra, like a prayer. "What would it take to get some new client who could really use my services and buy my products now?" At that very moment, one of the volunteers handing out water walked over, started chatting and asked him what he does. Oscar told him that he did financial planning for small businesses. The guy immediately said, "You should approach my industry, it's a gold mine, and I'm surprised that nobody has yet." So by asking in that very moment, "What would it take to get some new client who could pay me now?" He got an insight, scoop and a tip. But he said it kept happening all day, this whole experience. He continued on his ride back home, Oscar got hungry and asked, "What would it take to get some food?" A few miles down the trail, he decided to take a break in an area with two benches, one bench was in the shade, and remember he is hot. So that would be the "logical choice," go sit in the shade. He felt driven to sit on the bench in the sun. While he was sitting there, two kids stopped, sat on the other bench. And when they got up to leave, they said, "Hey, Mister, you dropped your energy bar." Oscar was like "What?" He looked under the bench and there was a fully wrapped energy bar just waiting for him. So you know, this is about being in the flow. I mean, how Oscar is living is pretty much how I live my life, I mean, that's just how my life goes. And what would it take for your life to be so much in the flow like that? See, sense or feel the light, take your energy up 300 feet above your head. Okay, connect to pure source energy that totally loves you, totally aligns with your wishes and desires, completely wants everything to happen for you, no matter what it takes. Okay, allow the light to come through your crown, opening up for new awareness and also opening up all the files of anything that you don't want to change that is still a block to you. Okay, so all the things that are hidden from you that you don't want to change, let's open up those files and clear them. Let's allow the light to come into your third eye, opening things you don't want to see, your ears opening up things you don't want to hear, your throat opening up things you don't want to speak. Allow this light to come through your heart, opening up things that you might hate or don't love, that you don't maybe want to look at, maybe even places where you're not very nice to yourself. Okay, allow the light to come into your solar plexus, opening up anywhere you feel anxious, afraid or weary. Allow the light to come into your abdomen, your power center, what you're rooted in, opening up anything where you feel powerless, deflated, not enough, undeserving or blocked. Allow the light to come through your legs all the way into the center of the planet, connecting to the part of the planet in the center that's purely conscious, love and light. You are now supported from above and below. Ask this light from below to kind of bounce right back up into your heart and radiate out 360 degrees like a great central sunshine all the way around your body. Ask this light to open and expand all parts of you that are blocked. Ask this light to open and expand all the parts of you that are avoiding things. And ask this light to open and expand all the parts of you that are in denial. And open and expand all parts of you that lie to yourself at any level. And ask this light to open up all parts of the darkness in you. Allow this light to radiate past the building you're in. Allow this light to expand past the city you're in. Allow this light to expand past the country you're in. Allow this light to expand past the planet. Okay, what would it take for every one of you hearing any of these stories of Unlimited Abundance? If you haven't had your rock star moment yet, what would it take for you to have your breakthrough today? And everything in the way of that, uncreate it all? what would it take for you guys to not be so hypercritical of yourself and what's blocking you and everything in the way of that? Uncreate and delete it all. What would it take for you guys to open up any part of you that's avoiding the potential for a positive future? Yes, what would it take for anything in the way of your positive future to be deleted? So Amber is asking a good question. How long does our communication to the light last? Okay, so here's the truth, Amber. Let's just say you're at home and you don't have a moment to connect to light the way we just did. If you just imagine yourself expanded, 300 feet tall, connected to all things radiating a lot of light in two seconds, you're connected, okay? But the real truth is, if you really think about it is, you're always connected. When you make yourself larger though, you're a little bit more in command of your reality. When you make yourself shrink or contract, you're being a little victim if you can kind of see that. See, most people have given up their right to like free will. You know, they don't think they can change their future. So any of you guys who are sitting in the place where you think you can't really change your future for some reason, even if it's not conscious to you, maybe it's subconscious, maybe it's a parent thing, maybe it's a spouse thing, maybe it's like a, "I'm afraid to be too big for my britches thing." Whatever that is, okay, delete all that, okay? Anywhere else you guys are afraid to be the creator of your whole world, uncreate and delete all that. Everywhere you think it's sacrilegious to be the creator of your own world and join forces with yeah, the creative energy, okay, delete all that. Okay, everywhere you guys are weary and tired 'cause you're contracted and pretending that you're human and that you can't change things, delete all that. Yeah, so Amber, if you're working with a lot, if any of you guys are working with a lot of clients, like for instance, if I work with a client, I connect to the light, I connect them to the light. See, it takes more oomph if people connect to my light instead of connect to the light, right? So if a client is connected to the light and I'm connected to the light, there's double the power, right? Instead of trying to connect through me. So if you're working with clients, you ask them to connect to the light, you connect to the light, and then there's a lot more energy that can shift. And then after the session's done, then you just close all the doors to the client, you keep... They have your energy, you have yours, do a little blessing and a prayer, and then you need just make sure that they're not attached to you anymore. So one of the reasons why people won't change, some people, is because, I love that word be cause, be the cause, right? Some people won't change because it messes with your life. Some people are willing for their life to be a little messy. You know, the truth is, now it's really hilarious about those if you think about it. See the ultimate contradiction, people won't change 'cause it messes with their life. But then they don't really like parts of their life. So you might need different habits, new self-talk, new ideas, new thoughts, a new way of being and new actions that go along with this new version of yourself, right? And some people are afraid to mess up their life that much. Okay, so anything that stirred up in you guys, where you're afraid to mess up your life that much and actually be what you proclaim you want to be, will you uncreate and delete it all. Everywhere you guys are stopped, blocked, unsatisfied and unhappy with your life, but yet you refuse to let it get messy so you can transform it, transmute it into the next place you want to go with it, uncreate and delete all that across all time, dimension, space and reality. Anywhere you guys keep proclaiming, my life is a mess so then you keep creating messes that you don't want. Yeah, everything that is, uncreate and delete all that across all time, dimension, space and reality. Everywhere you've judged any part of your life as a mess, will you uncreate and delete all that across all time, dimension, space and reality. All right, so you guys showed up with your blocks today, so this is good. So I'm going to ask you this, what are you afraid to do because it will mess up for life? What are you afraid to do because it might mess up your life? And then type me some of your responses. And I have a couple of questions here. I'm going to answer too. If you showed up and you felt a little blocked is probably because it was for the session. Usually your energy for the session will get stirred up a day or two ahead of time. And Galena is asking, can somebody be blocked from being rooted in problems at birth? Yes, because sometimes what happens is, in the birth of us coming into the body, think of it, unlimited being crunched into a little body. And you know, some people have these stories about, they didn't want to come out or they came out too early and all these things. Those things can be blocked because it could be your overall point of view about life down here. Like some of you loved coming down here to earth and some people might, not so much, right? Yeah. Okay. So everywhere you guys are afraid. So have you all typed in everywhere you're afraid to decide on things quickly, uncreate and delete all that across all time, dimension, space and reality. And Javier, I'm wondering if you're afraid to make a decision quickly because are you really, really, really clear on your end result? So I'm asking you guys, if you have a clear vision board, if you have a clear, what do you want in your life, that will help you make decisions more quickly because you'll find out if it's in alignment, right? Okay, so everywhere you guys don't make decisions quickly because you don't know if it's in alignment or not, uncreate and delete it all. Everywhere you're overwhelmed and confused, uncreate and delete all that. Everywhere you're afraid to change jobs for whatever reason, uncreate and delete all that. Everywhere you guys are afraid to start a new business. Everywhere you guys are afraid to get rich, uncreate and delete it across all time, dimension, space and reality. Everywhere you're afraid to share your past with others, or share your story or open your heart and be vulnerable and open to people, will you uncreate and delete that, across all time, dimension, space and reality? Everywhere you're afraid of being vulnerable, which is who you are as a spirit. Remember being vulnerable and opening your heart means you don't have any guards and blocks around you. And because you don't have any blocks around you, your energy system is open and people can feel you, right? So everywhere you're afraid to be how people feel you, uncreate and delete all that. Everywhere you're afraid to leave the safety of the current job, okay, uncreate and delete all that. Now, what if you guys were thinking about job hunting, maybe the wrong way? Like what have you guys, like if you guys wanted to start a business or something, like what if you started it while you have a job? Like if you need to get clients and things like that, what would it take for you guys to like, get clients, increase your income and then quit your job. Okay, so everything in the way of you thinking you could do that, uncreate and delete all that. Or what would it take for you guys if you want a new job to literally just send out 30 resumes every couple of weeks? Everything in the way of that, will you uncreate and delete all that. Everywhere you guys are afraid to lose control, afraid to lose control means afraid to lose your reality, right? So everywhere you guys are afraid to lose your reality, uncreate and delete all that. Everywhere you guys are afraid to lose your safety and your security blanket, yes, uncreate and delete all that everywhere. Everywhere you guys are afraid to lose your security blanket that you worked so hard for, and that you hold in place every day. Because remember that whole thing I went into in the beginning of the unlimited abundance journey? It's like you guys have this, you're an infinite being and everything is changing in every two seconds, anyway. I mean less than that, right? Cause every molecule of your body just changed. Every breath you just took, just changed some energy in your body, every molecule of your life, you know, every molecule holding your money together is moving. So everything is changing. So think of how much power it takes an infinite being to keep their life the same, day in and day out. When in truth, everything is changing. Yeah, right? A lot of power. Uncreate and delete all that power you're using against yourself. Toiling away at the same thing over and over again. Everywhere you're afraid to be too good and too confident at managing your life, cause there might be repercussions for that for you. So whatever the secret fear is that you're afraid of, like maybe people won't like you, uncreate and delete all that. Or maybe it'll be too hard work, uncreate and delete all that. Everywhere you're afraid to get into a serious relationship, stand up for yourself, cause people might look at you like you're crazy. Okay, everywhere you're tired of your families, all looking at you like you're nuts. Okay, uncreate and delete all that. Everywhere you're so tired of people looking at you like you're crazy, uncreate and delete all that. Okay, I'm going to say this because some of you guys are sick and tired. How many of you guys are sick and tired of things not working out for you? Everything that is, will you uncreate and delete it across all time, dimension, space and realities. Okay. Margaret's saying she's doing it. Everything about her life is new and different. I love that, Margret. I love an email that says, my before picture is this, am I after picture is this. I love it. Changed my work. Everywhere Sharika is afraid to change her work. Okay, uncreate and delete all that. Everywhere you guys have all this energy that you invested in something, and even though it's not working because you invested so much energy in it, you don't want to change it, you want it to like make, what's not working work, in order to prove that you didn't waste your time, putting your energy in it. So you're afraid to let it go just basically, because you put so much energy in it. So everywhere you're afraid to just cut your ties, uncreate and delete all that. How many of you guys are hanging on to people like that? Relationships, right, where they aren't good for you, they haven't been good for you, they're non-supportive, but yet, because you invested so much time with them, you still need to keep them around. Uncreate and delete all that. Everywhere you're afraid to get clear, afraid to have success, uncreate and delete all that. Anywhere your parents did not want you to have success because it might... Now, some people were asking in the last session, why would your parents not want you to have success? Unfortunately, some parents are not happy, and they don't want anybody else to be around happy. Have you ever noticed a person who is like always complaining, trying to make everybody miserable around them? Yeah, they're like unhappy and they want everybody else to be miserable. So if you actually go get happy, then you would make your mother or father miserable, and then they wouldn't love you, right? Okay, so everywhere you guys are afraid to go get happy because you might still need love from mom and dad. Now, I understand that some of this might be subconscious to you, but some of you, one of the more powerful things is, the little kid parts of us that are still wanting or seeking something, admiration from our family, love from our family, that we might not have ever received, some of that stuff can hold us back. So anywhere there's parts of you guys that still don't want to get rich. Don't want to make more money than mom and dad. Don't want to get happy because they're going to pick on you. How many of you guys live in the critical families, where if you go get happy, they pick on you the whole way? If you lose weight, they pick on you. If you get happy, they pick on you. If you have love, they pick on you. If you get to have more money than them, they pick on you. And if you basically suck at life and you do life the way they do, then they leave you alone. So any of you guys living that kind of life, uncreate and delete all that. Everywhere you guys might start receiving admiration, recognition and love, and you're not used to it. So somehow, because you're not used to it, you would turn away from it, uncreate and delete all that. Anywhere you guys are not willing to love yourself enough, or love yourself more than you need love from any other person on the planet, uncreate and delete all that. Everywhere you're surrounded by so many negative people, uncreate and delete all that. Anywhere you don't think you can get out of it, uncreate and delete all that. All right. So Nicholas is asking me to speak about fairness. Do some people think, I did all my good stuff in this world, therefore I deserve to be rewarded. A lot of people have that belief, but what can happen is, you know, at the end of the day, it's not about fairness. Unfortunately, at the end of the day, it's how you've wired your reality, okay? And most people have a receiving problem. So usually the do gooders, the ones that give and give and give and give, they usually have a receiving problem. And then they are stuck in this whole rut, where they think the universe isn't fair, because the universe doesn't bring to them. When in truth, the real reality is, they aren't good receivers, because they think that they get love by giving and they forget to love themselves by receiving. We make it a polarity of give and take, but the universe is give and take all at the same time. Ultimately, if you're wired the correct way, as soon as you ask, you're given. Cause you basically, when you ask, you open up your energy field and say, Hey, show it up for me. But if you set your energy to always give and give and give and give, but you don't open up the receiving channels, then life might appear not fair to you. Now that's one angle. The other angle is, if you have your parents imprints in you and you could do all the good things in the world and do all the right things in the world, but everything you're imprinted before the age of seven to 10 years old, subconsciously that you downloaded from your parents, could be blocking you. That's a whole other subject, but that's the other block that could probably be blocking you. So I want you guys to check inside for a minute. This is a good awareness. So I'm going to ask it this way, on a scale of one to 10, 10 being, you can totally receive everything, even judgment from people, right? Okay. So one to 10 you can totally receive everything. How much can you receive? Yeah, some of you were like a 5, 6, 3 and a half. So that's your homework for this week. So write that down and work on being an excellent receiver. Okay now, how many of you a scale of one to 10, 10 being you totally give, you can give freely knowing that the universe always supports whatever you give? Okay. A scale of one to 10. Yeah, 10 being totally give, where are you guys at with that? Feels about the same to me, about a lot of fives and sixes. All right, so I am curious, what numbers did you guys get? A lot of eights and sevens and fives and threes. Few nines, good. A one. Okay, so that's your homework right there. Okay? So that's why I ask a lot of those kinds of questions in my head every day, to just kind of discern where I'm at. Okay. Marsha is an 11. I used to be a giver and not a receiver, so I had to really change that. I was doing a little bit of victim myself at one point in my life. I'm like, why am I not receiving? You know. Everywhere you guys are afraid that you'll create enemies by going forward, uncreate and delete all that. Afraid to go to the bank and ask to like refinance your home. So anywhere you guys are afraid to like, look at your finances, balance your books, look at your credit reports, get insurance, look at your insurance policies, all those things, uncreate and delete them all. Everywhere not fun to look at, uncreate and delete them all. Everywhere you're afraid to be humiliated if you go forward, uncreate and delete all that. Everywhere... Thank you, Jane for being honest. She has a common belief like, that she's, you know, that a lot of people have too old, too young to this, to that, right? So everywhere you're too old, too much of a failure, too much in despair, yes, uncreate and delete it all. Everywhere you guys are too young, too fat, too anything, too thin, not smart enough. Everything that is, will you uncreate and delete all that. Everywhere you guys think that you have these continuing loops that play over and over and over and over and over again that are called your stories... So Jane, your homework is to really rewrite your story. Even if you think you're making it up, and even if it irritates you, because I think you're going to work through some anger when you're doing that. So you're just going to have to say, everything that's my story, that I'm 62, uncreate and delete it all, because that's the story. You were saying that, you know, some people would say, oh, that's not a story. I want you to think about this. If I say I'm 20 years old, what picture do you have in your head of me? If I say I'm 50 years old, what picture do you have in your head of me? And that's because the universe mirrors back, you know, if you're 50 or able to do this, this and this, have you guys ever heard this story? And I don't remember the book this is in, so I would love to give credit, but I can't remember where I read this. It was a story about this tribe in some indigenous community. And the tribe was they had this belief going on, that the older somebody was the faster they ran. So the reality that became real in this community is, the old folks who were like 60, 70, 80. You know what we would consider old folks, ran faster than the kids who were young, okay, that were in their twenties. So they created this reality bubble of a group, community agreement, the older people ran faster than the younger people, and then that's what happened. So can you guys see that our beliefs are really what's creating our field of energy. So anywhere you guys think, oh, cause I'm female, I can't do it, delete all that. And I male, therefore I can't do it. So all these rules that you guys have about what an age looks like, delete all that. Everywhere you're afraid to be seen and heard and loved and cared for and like, yeah, delete all that. Everywhere you guys are afraid to be celebrated, delete all that. Wow, you guys have a lot of energy on that. Okay, so what would it take for you guys to look yourself in the mirror and like literally celebrate you? Like clap for you, go crazy and go, you look amazing. You are so amazing and say that to yourself in the mirror over and over and over again, until you believe how amazing you are. So everything that doesn't let you guys celebrate every little thing in your life, uncreate and delete it all. That's really why honestly, I do the inspiring stories, is just because it's like, when's the last time you guys were celebrated? I mean, seriously. I mean, yeah, we get our birthday celebrated, but you know, just something for no reason, celebrated for no reason. I mean, the last time most people is like in high school and school, right, school, college, graduations, those things. Everywhere you guys are afraid to celebrate your life, uncreate and delete all that. Everywhere you guys are afraid to receive acknowledgement for no reason. You know, cause the truth is, because you are you, you is the most important thing in your own life, so why shouldn't you be celebrated, right? Okay. Delete all that. Everywhere you guys are afraid to go for a ride, because you will lose what you know, and you're afraid that you won't find anything better, uncreate and delete all that. Everywhere you have to work super long hours to make ends meet, uncreate and delete all that. Okay, everywhere you guys are afraid to take bold action and try something new, uncreate and delete all that. Okay, everywhere you guys are afraid to take responsibility and still do victim, uncreate and delete all that. Everywhere you guys are afraid to lose what is left of your inheritance, Ooh, Sarah, uncreate and delete all that. Gosh, any of you guys sitting around afraid of like losing the last parts of the money that you have? That's why, remember that whole 10% savings thing I said, where you have to like save until you get a certain amount of money? Because the real truth is, this is why lottery winners lose their money. There's usually like a certain set point in everybody that once you have that set point, then you will be able to receive, you know, keep your money. And if you go below that set point, then you go into this whole afraid to lose it. That's one part of it. And then as you know, if your mentality of how much you think you're worth is lower than how much you have, you will figure out a way to spend it, blow it or lose it. So any of you guys afraid to spend it or to blow it, basically, so because you can't have a net worth more than what you think you're currently valued at, uncreate and delete all that. Everywhere you're afraid to lose your money, uncreate and delete all that. So Christy, if you have an abusive ex, there's a couple of things. I would keep putting him in a bubble of love and light and just really just keep talking to his higher self, asking for something to change. Sometimes that will work. Now, sometimes it won't. If in that case it doesn't, then I would just keep asking, you connect it to source energy, asking that you and your child be protected, can stop a lot of things ahead of time. So and then just keep disconnecting your energy from him every day and release any karma with him, uncreate and delete any karma with him for four to seven days. Everywhere you're afraid to ask the universe for help or your higher self for help, uncreate and delete all that. Everywhere you don't want a job, don't have a job and don't want to look, Gabriela, sometimes you just have to do whatever it takes to bring in some sort of cash. Because once you bring in the cash, it changes all your points of view. Have you ever noticed that when you just get over yourself and make a decision and just do something, that like would bring in cash, like at least you're not as stressed, and once you're not as stressed, then starting your own business is easier. I mean, sometimes it might not be exactly how you want it to be, but I've just noticed that usually, if you get money coming in from somewhere, then you feel better about it. And sometimes you have to take logical steps, like getting a job, to do that in order to just stop the other flow. And then at the same time you can work on your own business. It sounds like probably not where you want to do, but I would check inside and ask, is that your problem? Is part of your problem that you're just stuck in this, I don't know what to do and therefore nothing's manifesting? So either asked the universe to show you more than one profitable business solution, not just one, but more than one. Cause you're asking for the most, I would ask for a top 10 list of profitable. And when I say profitable, just say over whatever your number is, over 10,000 a month, over 100,000 a month. I think when you're saying the most profitable business idea, it's asking for one thing, I would ask for more than one thing, okay? And I would be a little bit different in my clarity. I would say that would generate me over X amount of dollars per month, and then get a top 10 list, and then see which one you love the most. Okay, Gabriela, everywhere you guys are sick and tired of waiting for people to do things instead of just doing it yourself, or finding new people to do it, right? What would it take for you to find new people who will actually do it, instead of waiting for the same people who aren't doing it. Everywhere you're afraid to raise your rates for fear of losing clients. So what would it take, Angela for you to generate a bunch of new clients at the new rate, and then you could gradually segue? You could do that as well. Just another option. Okay, everywhere you're still hanging on to some toxic things, uncreate and delete all that. Louise is asking if she should... I asked you guys to pick four targets, and the second one feels heavy. Is the second one feel heavy because it doesn't feel easy or do you still have blocks, Louise? It feels like the second one feels uneasy because there's a block to it, because somewhere you don't think it's possible. So I would keep working on what would it take for this to be possible? And then I would look at the phrasing of how I'm asking it to show up because maybe you're looking at it to only show up one way instead of multiple ways. Okay, so I would look at that. But be open to change. You don't have to keep sticking to something if it's not working right. Just kind of change things around a little bit. Sometimes unsticks it. I knew a rich guy, you know what he did? When everybody kept asking him for money, he had his assistant tell everybody I am not a bank, but I can happily make some recommendations for a bank for you. You know what I mean? So that's how he, he just didn't want to be a bank, right? That wasn't his business. Now, some people didn't like it. Right? Cause he's a rich guy, but you know what? Self-love goes a long way. Okay, everywhere you guys are the greatest toxin to your own life. Everything that is, uncreate it all. Natalie also had a breakthrough. She realized she had eczema on her hand. She put out to receive money. Interesting. All right. Good job, Natalie, and the realization. Javier had a realization that he used to work hard at the age of 14 through 18 to make money and give it all to his family. Yeah, good job. I love it, Javier. So I think that's it. Those young money issues, like those things that, you know, come to us when we're young, usually get programmed in the deepest. Okay, so Javier, everywhere your money is going to your family now, delete all that. Any of you guys, that's giving all your money, energy away to your family, uncreate and delete all that. Anywhere you guys are generating money for your family, but not for you, uncreate and delete all that. What would it take for you guys to generate money for you, which can support the family? But wouldn't it be cool if you just let the energy come into you first, and then you can give it out however you want. Instead of letting the family pull on your money. How many of you have the whole family connected to your money? Uncreate and delete all that. Javier, everywhere you have to give money to your family to pay the bills, uncreate and delete all that. Javier, everywhere you can't work for your own money, like you don't own your money. Any of you guys who are not owning your own money, uncreate and delete all that. There was a few other people. Wow. That's a lot of energy there. Okay, everywhere you guys are givers and not takers, uncreate and delete it all. Okay, I want you guys to say out loud, I am a taker, I'm a taker. I'm a taker. And everywhere you guys have judgment on I'm a taker, uncreate and delete all that. Everywhere you guys think it's not nice to be a taker, uncreate and delete all that. Well, who are the givers giving it to? Okay, everywhere it's not fair if you're a taker, it's not nice if you're a taker, it's not good if you're a receiver, uncreate and delete all that. Anywhere you guys aren't a taker, uncreate and delete all that. Anywhere you guys love to take, but you pretend that you don't love to take, uncreate and delete all that. Sarah, you could create some new babies, like meaning new businesses, new energies. You could play with kids for a living. You could take care of kids for a living, any of those things, whatever feels right to you. Ooh, okay. Everywhere you guys are married to conventional methods, uncreate and delete all that. Everywhere you ask for 5,000 euros, got it. But from, oh, everywhere, you feel like if you got, when you asked for money and you get it, and it came from your parents and you feel like you owe them something, uncreate and delete all that. Irene, everywhere you're afraid to show up in the world, and speak your truth, uncreate and delete it all. Everywhere you guys are afraid to show up, because you're afraid you'll be judged, uncreate and delete all that. Okay, so we'll do another one here. What are you guys afraid to become because it will mess up your life? It's not the doing now, it's the becoming. Everywhere you guys are afraid that you won't find honest people, uncreate and delete all that. Yes, Marcia, so I'm curious. She's asking, would asking for more than 4,000 in profit from my website be okay? Yeah, for sure. But I would also ask for the $4,000 idea to come every month and I would ask for any other idea that would generate, if it's me, what I would do is I would ask that, what would it take for my website to generate 4,000, 5,000, 6,000, 10,000 and everything in the way of that, uncreate and delete it off. I would ask for multiple amounts of numbers, not just the 4,000. For some reason, it feels like asking for one number, kind of blocks it. Okay, Jocelyn, everywhere you feel stuck in this low paying job and you've decided that that's how much you're worth, uncreate and delete all that. So Jocelyn, what would it take for you to either a, create your own business? Yeah, or b, get some other education of some form that would create your own business? Even if it's writing an ebook or doing a web blog, it doesn't have to be formal education, but it's money-making education. Okay, so everything in the way of that, uncreate it all. Everywhere you think you can't do it, uncreate and delete it all. Everywhere you guys have grief, anger and toxicity, uncreate and delete it all. Yes, Trevor, I've heard of the tall poppy syndrome, especially like in the UK too. Where if you get really popular and famous, then they want to attack you. So everything that is, will you uncreate and delete it all. Everywhere you guys are afraid to receive judgements on being famous, uncreate and delete all that. So you guys have to realize part of the game of being popular is there's negativity that comes with it. And what would it take for you guys to just, just right above it, laugh about it, and not really care about it? Okay, so what would it take for you guys to just not care? You know what I mean? Okay, everything that is, instead of growing all these hedges around you, so nobody knocks your poppies off. Okay, so everything that is, uncreate and delete it off. Anywhere else you guys believe in the tall poppy syndrome. So Christina, everybody, everywhere you guys are giving all your energy to your family, instead of just taking it for yourself. Like what if the universe is calling upon you right now to just take care of you for a little bit? Okay, it's like, what if you just take care of you and let everybody else do their own thing, because maybe you're enabling them. And maybe when you quit enabling them, then maybe they take care of themselves for a little bit. Okay, so just check inside, are you enabling anybody? And you're giving them energy that you could be using for your own growth and happiness. Okay, now there's, of course you have to take care of your kids and things like that, okay? Normal things. But you understand what I mean, right? So just, are you enabling somebody when they could be doing it for themselves? Everything in the way of that, uncreate it all. Everywhere you guys have reverse snobbery, no money, so better than rich kids who have it handed to them, right? Uncreate and delete all that. Everywhere hard work is more noble, uncreate and delete all that. All right, everywhere you're afraid to touch some money, uncreate and delete all that. Notice that wording, everywhere you guys are afraid to touch your money, uncreate all that. Everywhere you guys are afraid to make money, uncreate all that. Everywhere you have to make money, which means you always have to make it instead of having it. What would it take for you guys to have money, instead of needing it? Every time you guys say, I have to go make money, what would it take for you guys to say, I have money and money comes to me generously? So Sarah, if you married somebody who's a taker, you're going to have to visualize him every day in his own pillar of light, visualize you in your own pillar of light, and just say, no. Like you're going to probably have to clear four or five times a day everywhere you allowed him, 'cause you allowed him to take all your energy, and everywhere you gave all your energy. Now remember, you're an unlimited being, nobody can take all your energy, unless you shut off from the flow, right? And if you're around a needy person, if you just open up your flows and imagine like a fire hose, coming straight out your heart and just fill them with energy, they'll usually go away. Cause you just fill them up with light and then they'll usually kind of let go of your energy for a little bit. So everywhere you're saving pennies to travel, and your mom told you, no, that won't work. Everywhere confused that you could save your pennies and get what you wanted. Everything that is, uncreate and delete it all. Okay, everywhere you're afraid to be powerful and visible, uncreate and delete it all. Everywhere you guys are afraid to be passionate, uncreate it all. Everywhere you guys are afraid to be take charge, totally responsible, make all the decisions, and generally just kick ass. Everything that is, uncreate and delete it all. Everywhere you feel totally invisible, uncreate and delete all that. Everywhere you're afraid of becoming rich cause it would mess up your life, uncreate and delete all that. Everywhere you're afraid to be strong and energized, uncreate and delete all that. Afraid to be happy and abundant, uncreate and delete all that. Afraid to be more successful than colleagues, wealthier than my friends and family, vibrantly living and fabulously glamorous. I love that. Okay, everything that is, uncreate and delete it all. Somebody is asking me that they had to live a lie because they were in an emotionally abusive relationship. Is it possible to feel clean and honest? Well, I don't know what the thing is, but sometimes you can't tell emotionally dysfunctional people the truth, because it will cause harm to you. If that is the case, then I would love myself enough and probably not tell them the truth, which might sound contradicting to some of you. But safety is probably the most important thing. And then I would number two, ask why do I allow any of this to happen in my life? And I would uncreate all that. And then what I would do is I would get clean and honest with myself, which should shift it. So if you learn the last thing, you're not going to do it again, then be cool with that. But because you said emotionally abusive, that's the only reason why I'm saying you have to decide if it will create more harm to you than good. So for some of you listening, that's probably confusing, 'cause I know I'm going to get emails saying, she said it's okay to lie. But I want you guys to really hear what I'm saying, okay? Okay, so the truth at the end of the day is, if somebody is emotionally abusive, you're dealing with a crazy person. And why would you give ammunition to the crazy person who has a loaded gun in front of you? You know what I'm saying? So I just want to be clear what I'm saying. And again, let's all bless Sarah and ask that, whatever it takes for her to get out of her situation, so that she can move to something better, whatever help she needs or support around her, so that somebody can help and support her, so that she can move to the place where she can get really, really happy. Okay, whatever it takes for her to do that, we all bless you and we give you tons of love, tons of mojo, tons of power, so that you can really, really, really get the help. And is there anybody around you like a therapist or somebody who could help you? That would be awesome if you could look that up and try to figure that out. So what would it take for Sarah to get some support, some therapies, some something, you know, around you to help and support you. So if you have more than one thing to concentrate on, just pick four things that you really want to manifest and just work on those things. You can only do one task at a time, generally speaking. So I would like set a priority list. The easiest way I've ever gotten organized is by setting a priority list. Everywhere you guys are afraid to be too well-known, uncreate and delete all that. So whatever the most important thing, I want you guys to think, what's the most important thing you could ever manifest for yourself? Okay, so whatever came up for you, that's the thing you should go for right away. So Irene somewhere, you're giving away your power, and/or you're surrounded by takers, okay, or both. So everywhere you're surrounded by takers, uncreate and delete all that. And everywhere you're surrounded by stealers and thievers, uncreate and delete all that. And everywhere your fear of it is generating more of it, uncreate and delete all that. Okay, what do I do about financial disasters? Christina, it's a hard question because the thing is, if you guys are living with somebody who has a lot of money woes, at some level you guys have to really decide not to take on their energy, but still love them and help them. Like you know, if you love them enough to help them with tools, give them tools. If they refuse the tools, then you have to understand they're refusing change. And if they're refusing change, it's not going to be so easy for you guys to be, you know, happy together, right? You know what I mean? It's going to be a little hard. So you're going to have to keep really working on, what would it take for that for him or her to change, and what would it take for me to not slow my progress down and still stay happy and get happy. Everywhere you're afraid to be healthy and love your body exactly how it is, uncreate and delete all that. Okay, so any one else who's dealing with a partner or a spouse or a lover, who's like really their block and in their way in some way, okay, let's just send a lot of love and light to them so that they find a solution and that they love themselves enough to take care of themselves. And they love themselves enough to find a solution to not be emotionally blackmailed by that person or controlled by that person. Okay, so everywhere you have a colleague, and here the colleague is jealous. So anywhere you guys have jealous people around you wanting to steal your light, uncreate and delete all that. You have to understand, when you get a little bigger, some people might test the boundaries and see if you're still the same or if you really are that new person. So anywhere you guys aren't willing to put up with jealousy, even if it gets you what you want, uncreate and delete all that. Ella, maybe you could just be, you know, sometimes with jealous people, they'll use a couple of different tactics. You can be really, really super nice to them, but then if they stomp on you more, you can't be nice to them. But one of the ways to make jealous people feel bad is just be really nice to them, because then they have nothing to say to you. And then if they're a little wacky, maybe you could ask him if he's a little out of sorts, because he doesn't seem like himself. You know, maybe that coworker kind of nasty go, wow, you don't seem like yourself. You're so much nicer normally, what's your problem? You know what I mean? Just kind of like call it out like that, and see what happens. So Ella, maybe he just keep hearing jealous for some reason, I'm not sure why, but I would just say something like that to him. Like, Hey, you know, we used to like pal around. I really love you brother. You know, it's just say something kind of cool that's a little vulnerable and catches him off guard. And then just ask if he's stressed or what's going on. Maybe because you just say you love them or care for him, and you want to help them, or you know what I mean? Maybe he'll just change his energy a little bit with you. Gabriel, it feels like your energy is set on. I expect bad things to happen to me. So you have to... Any of you guys who have a belief, I expect really bad things to happen to me no matter what. Okay, everything that is, uncreate and delete it all. Everywhere you guys have a belief that bad things are going to happen to you no matter what you do or try, uncreate and delete it all. Everywhere you guys think you're bad. Everywhere you guys think you're evil. Everywhere you guys think you're unloved. Uncreate and delete all that across all time, dimension, space and reality. Okay, any other part of you that doesn't want to change because you think you're bad, evil or not nice to people, uncreate and delete all that. So Ella, I'm hearing he'll probably change within a month if you just keep sending some love to him. Okay, Sabrina, if people are abusive to you, stay away from them if you can. And if you can't, then you're going to have to deal with it in the moment. I can't really answer because I don't know, you know, specifically, you're going to have to just take it as each moment shows up. All right, what are you guys afraid to do, be or have, because your spouse, mate, families, bosses, or parents, won't like it? Okay, so everywhere you guys are afraid to be you and afraid that something bad is going to happen to you. Everything that is, uncreate and delete it all. Everywhere you guys are afraid, negative, malfunctioning versions of you are going to keep giving birth to themselves into perpetuity, and you will never get your other future self to show up. Uncreate and delete all that. You guys are making like little babies of yourselves, over and over and over again, stuck in time. Okay, everything you're doing to create all that, delete all that. How do I manage immediate family, spouse, always thinking something bad is going to happen when you're happy? Every time they put that thought around me, Bazel, I would just keep unreating and deleting it. Another technique, is that you can ask them to make a list of all the worst case scenarios they think will happen to you, and then kind of just talk to them about it and say, well, is any of these things ever happened? And the answer will be no. And then say, is there any way you can give that up since none of these things have ever happened? Usually if a spouse is like that, they might've had a childhood where they always had to learn how to worry ahead of time, so that bad things wouldn't happen. So you can check inside and see if that's the case. And if that's the case with your partner, then clearing on all the childhood trauma where they always have to worry about something bad happening that creates the worry in the future is probably where to go with fixing it. Can you clear your partners blocks on abundance? Yes. Yes, if they want it. That's the answer. All right, everywhere you guys are afraid to be rich, wealthy, or hear your guidance, uncreate and delete all that. Everywhere you guys afraid to know the truth, be the truth, have the truth and love the truth, uncreate and delete it all. Julie, I would do, what would it take for me to be a know it all? That's what I would do. Okay, so anywhere you guys are blocked in your intuition, what would it take for you guys to be a know it all, super aware, super healthy, uncreate and delete it all. So Christina, Paul has to choose to be successful for himself. There's some part of him that's locked in a battle with who he wants to be and who he was. So he's got a lot of clearing to do, a lot more than you might want to hear about. So he's got to work on his dad issues too. So everywhere you guys are afraid to go be so successful that you might lose all your friends and family, uncreate and delete all that. Anywhere you guys care more about them than you care about yourself, so you let them stop you, uncreate and delete all that. Give them the tools. Like let them listen to this. That's what I would do. Let's do one more big clearing you guys. What actions are you now willing to start? Okay, so what's one action you guys can do in the next couple of days that will bring you your abundance? Okay, what is one action that you guys can do? Relisten to the session? Yes. Okay, everywhere you don't value yourself, uncreate and delete all that. What would it take for you guys to be millionaires and know that you are worth it? Everywhere you don't want to wake up in the morning. Everywhere you don't want to have a life. Everywhere you don't want to be here. All those blocks, delete it all. Everywhere you don't want to deal with life and you're resistant to life. Everywhere you're resistant to living and being, uncreate and delete all that. Taking one hour to write a book, uncreate it 50 times a day, let go of anything that stops me, believe to receive. Okay. All of those are excellent. Okay, so what would it take for you guys to be the future happy version of yourself? And everything in the way of that, uncreate and delete it all. What would it take for you guys to totally believe and honor that you are worth it? And everything in the way of that, delete it all. What would it take for you guys to be willing to mess up your life and move it into the next reality, where you're being your future self? And everything in the way of that, uncreate it all. What would it take for you guys to let go of your stories that keep you stuck? Uncreate and delete at all. How many stories are you guys living? Uncreate and delete all those. Okay, anything else in the way of you guys living your life to the fullness of you? Uncreate and delete at all? Okay, what would it take for everybody this week to have some huge miracle breakthrough? What would it take for you guys to shift into the energy of your future self and love yourself enough to have true abundance? What would it take for you guys to have so much abundance that everything in your life just works for you? What would it take for you guys to just quit second guessing, quit thinking too much and just go take some massive action that generates a lot of money? And everything in the way of that, uncreate it all. Yes, what would it take for you guys to just quit thinking and go take some action? and everything in the way of that, uncreate and delete all that. Okay, what vibrational energy can you guys become to be willing to mess with your life and change it into a life you love? Deleting all excuses along the way. And everything in the way of that, will you uncreate and delete it all? What would it take for you guys to speed up all your clearing and just go take action and live your life and be happy? Everything the way of that, uncreate and delete it all. Okay. You can post some cool things on number above. You can post some things in the library area. Okay. Love you guys. I think you're awesome. I know you can have an amazing week and ciao for now.

====================

LESSON 21: Clearing Your Financial Mess (Clearing Session Only)

See, sensor, feel the light. Take your energy up 300 feet above your head. Okay, connect to pure source energy that totally loves you, totally aligns with your wishes and desires, completely wants everything to happen for you, no matter what it takes. Okay, allow the light to come through your crown. Opening up for new awareness and also opening up all the files of anything that you don't want to change that is still a block to you. Okay, so all the things that are hidden from you that you don't want to change, let's open up those files and clear them. Let's allow the light to come into your third eye, opening things you don't want to see, your ears opening up things you don't want to hear, your throat opening up things you don't want to speak. Allow this light to come through your heart, opening up things that you might hate or don't love that you don't maybe want to look at, maybe even places where you're not very nice to yourself. Okay, allow the light to come into your solar plexus, opening up anywhere you feel anxious, afraid, or weary. Allow the light to come into your abdomen, your power center, what you're rooted in, opening up anything where you feel powerless, deflated, not enough, undeserving, or blocked. Allow the light to come through your legs all the way into the center of the planet, connecting to the part of the planet in the center that's purely conscious, love and light. You are now supported from above and below. Ask this light from below to kind of bounce right back up into your heart and radiate out 360 degrees like a great central sunshine all the way around your body. Ask this light to open and expand all parts of you that are blocked. Ask this light to open and expand all parts of you that are avoiding things. Ask this light to open and expand all the parts of you that are in denial. And open and expand all parts of you that lie to yourself at any level. And ask this light to open up all parts of the darkness in you. Allow this light to radiate past the building you're in. Allow this light to expand past the city you're in. Allow this light to expand past the country you're in. Allow this light to expand past the planet. Okay, what would it take for every one of you hearing any of these stories of unlimited abundance? If you haven't had your rock star moment yet, what would it take for you to have your breakthrough today? And everything in the way of that, uncreate it all. What would it take for you guys to not be so hypercritical of yourself and what's blocking you and everything in the way of that? Uncreate and delete it all. What would it take for you guys to open up any part of you that's avoiding the potential for a positive future? Yes. What would it take for anything in the way of your positive future to be deleted? See, most people have given up their right to, like, free will. You know, they don't think they can change their future. So any of you guys who are sitting in the place where you think you can't really change your future for some reason, even if it's not conscious to you, maybe it's subconscious, maybe it's a parent thing, maybe it's a spouse thing, maybe it's like a I'm afraid to be too big for my britches thing, whatever that is. Okay, delete all that. Okay, anywhere else you guys are afraid to be the creator of your whole world. Uncreate and delete all that. Everywhere you think it's sacrilegious to be the creator of your own world. And join forces with, yeah, the creative energy. Okay, delete all that. Okay, everywhere you guys are weary and tired because you're contracted and pretending that you're human and that you can't change things. Delete all that. People won't change because it messes with their life, but then they don't really like parts of their life. So you might need different habits, new self -talk, new ideas, new thoughts, a new way of being, and new actions that go along with this new version of yourself, right? And some people are afraid to mess up their life that much. Okay, so anything that's stirred up in you guys where you're afraid to mess up your life that much and actually be what you proclaim you want to be, will you uncreate and delete it all? Everywhere you guys are stopped, blocked, unsatisfied. and unhappy with your life but yet you refuse to let it get messy so you can transform it transmute it into the next place you want to go with it uncreate and delete all that across all time dimension space and reality anywhere you guys keep proclaiming my life is a mess so then you keep creating messes that you don't want yeah everything that is uncreate and delete all that across all time dimension space and reality Everywhere you've judged any part of your life as a mess, will you uncreate and delete all that across all time, dimensions, space, and reality? Yeah. Okay. So everywhere you guys are afraid. So Javier typed in everywhere you're afraid to decide on things quickly, uncreate and delete all that across all time, dimensions, space, and reality. And Javier, I'm wondering if you're afraid to make a decision quickly because are you really, really, really clear on your end result? So I'm asking you guys, if you have a clear vision board, if you have a clear what do you want in your life, that will help you make decisions more quickly because you'll find out if it's in alignment, right? Okay, so everywhere you guys don't make decisions quickly because you don't know if it's in alignment or not, uncreate and delete it all. Everywhere you're overwhelmed and confused, uncreate and delete all that. Everywhere you're afraid to change jobs. For whatever reason, uncreate and delete all that. Everywhere you guys are afraid to start a new business. Everywhere you guys are afraid to get rich. Uncreate and delete it across all time, dimensions, space, and reality. Everywhere you're afraid to share your past with others or share your story or open your heart and be vulnerable and open to people. Will you uncreate and delete that across all time, dimensions, space, and realities? Everywhere you're afraid of being vulnerable, which is who you are as a spirit. Remember, being vulnerable and opening your heart means you don't have any guards and blocks around you. And because you don't have any blocks around you, your energy system is open and people can feel you, right? So everywhere you're afraid to have people feel you, uncreate and delete all that. Everywhere you're afraid to leave the safety of the current job, okay, uncreate and delete all that. Now, what if you guys were thinking about... job hunting maybe the wrong way like what if you guys like if you guys wanted to start a business or something like what if you started it while you have a job like we need to get clients and things like that what would it take for you guys to like get clients increase your income and then quit your job okay so everything in the way of you thinking you could do that on create and delete all that or what would it take for you guys if you want a new job to literally just send out 30 resumes every couple weeks Everything in the way of that, will you uncreate and delete all that? Everywhere you guys are afraid to lose control. Afraid to lose control means afraid to lose your reality, right? So everywhere you guys are afraid to lose your reality, uncreate and delete all that. Everywhere you guys are afraid to lose your safety and your security blanket, yes, uncreate and delete all that. Everywhere you guys are afraid to lose your security blanket that you work so hard for and that you hold in place every day. Because remember that whole thing I went into in the beginning of the unlimited abundance journey? It's like you guys have this. infinite being and everything is changing in every two seconds anyway. I mean, less than that, right? Because every molecule of your body just changed. Every breath you just took just changed some energy in your body. Every molecule of your life, you know, every molecule holding your money together is moving. So everything is changing. So think of how much power it takes an infinite being to keep their life the same day in and day out, when in truth, everything is changing. Yeah, right? A lot of power. Uncreate and delete. All that power you're using against yourself. Toiling away at the same thing over and over again. Everywhere you're afraid to be too good and too confident at managing your life because there might be repercussions for that for you. So whatever the secret fear is that you're afraid of, like maybe people won't like you. Uncreate and delete all that. Or maybe it'll be too hard work. Uncreate and delete all that. Everywhere you're afraid to get into a serious relationship, stand up for yourself because people might look at you like you're crazy. Okay, so everywhere you're tired of your family is all looking at you like you're nuts. Okay, uncreate and delete all that. Everywhere you're so tired of people looking at you like you're crazy, uncreate and delete all that. Okay, I'm going to say this because some of you guys are sick and tired. How many of you guys are sick and tired of things not working out for you? Everything that is, we uncreate and delete it across all time, dimension, space, and realities. Change my work. Everywhere Sharika is afraid to change her work. Okay, uncreate and delete all that. Everywhere you guys have all this energy that you invested in something, and even though it's not working because you invested so much energy in it, you don't want to change it.

There's usually like a certain set point in everybody that once you have that set point, then you will be able to receive, you know, keep your money. And if you go below that set point, then you go into this whole afraid to lose it. That's one part of it. And then, as you know, if your mentality of how much you think you're worth is lower than how much you have, you will figure out a way to spend it, blow it, or lose it.

So Christina, everybody, everywhere you guys are giving all your energy to your family. instead of just taking it for yourself like what if the universe is calling upon you right now to just take care of you for a little bit okay it's like what if you just take care of you and let everybody else do their own thing because maybe you're enabling them and maybe when you quit enabling them then maybe they take care of themselves for a little bit okay so just check inside are you enabling anybody and you're giving them energy that you could be using for your own growth and happiness okay Now there's, of course you have to take care of your kids and things like that, okay? Normal things, but you understand what I mean, right? So just are you enabling somebody when they could be doing it for themselves? Everything in the way of that, uncreate it all.

So if you have more than one thing to concentrate on, just pick four things that you really want to manifest and just work on those things. You can only do one task at a time, generally speaking. So I would like set a priority list. The easiest way I've ever gotten organized is by setting a priority list. Everywhere you guys are afraid to be too well -known, uncreate and delete all of that. So whatever the most important thing, I want you guys to think, what's the most important thing you could ever manifest for yourself?

LESSON 22: Clearing Illusions About Money

- Hey, this is Christie Marie Sheldon, and you're listening to a recording I did of a series of 24 live group sessions on clearing abundance blocks, and here's what we're covering today in session 22. First, are you living a life of illusion or monetary delusion? Today, we'll take you up on your illusions and shatter the fear-based ones. Are you money wise? Let's clear up your wisdom channel so that all of the flows and all of the channels to bringing in your shackles, which means money, align up so that your money can grow. and next, we'll take a look at how your spending opens up your future, your fiscal future, your future happiness. Your future is an open door with this kind of power at your fingertips. So let's begin. We're going to talk about if your spending aligns with your heart, and we'll talk a little bit more about that. It's going to be an exciting day. Grab a journal, a piece of paper, 'cause I'm going to have you write some things today, for sure. Be open to some new abundance. Today's going to be really, really exciting. We're going to get some things in line, get you a plan of action. Set an intent on what you hope to achieve tonight, and set an intent on what you hope to achieve by the end of the journey. So let's begin. Today is exciting. So we have, today, your inspiring stories, and I got quite a few of 'em today, again, a few really big ones. So here we go. Big shifts in the energy for Jack. He says his whole approach to money, his feelings about money, everything surrounding money has changed since starting the "Unlimited Abundance" journey. He says, when he started, his family's finances were a mess. They couldn't pay their bills. Their business wasn't getting any new clients, and his wife started tutoring to help make ends meet, and they were barely scraping by. A few weeks into the journey, things started to shift. First, Jack forcefully asked, he said very forcefully, what would it take to make $2,000 profit by the end of the July? Out of the blue, after months of no activity, a client was interested in some high-end speakers that he sells, and he closed a very nice sale. Between that and an unexpected tutoring client for his wife, he ended up with over $2,000 extra at the end of the month. Excited about his success, Jack did it again, asking what would it take for an extra five grand to show up at the end of August? Suddenly, more sales started coming in, and his wife tutoring business he said tripled for the month, and it looks like they are ready to close an extra 5,000 for August, and August isn't even over. So congratulations, Jack, that's got to be really, really exciting for you, and Margaret from Australia says she's done basically a whole 180 in her financial life since starting the journey. When she had started the journey, she had gone through $125,000 inheritance, sold an investment property and gold shares that valued $100,000. Her small business was spending more than it was bringing in, and her credit cards were maxed out. Here's what happened since starting the journey. They sold the business, enabled them to pay off most of their debts and buy a second car with cash. Her husband went straight into full-time work, making a larger salary than he'd ever, ever done before. They did a vision board together. The next week, her husband was given a week's paid vacation. They found a great deal for a long weekend at the beach, two nights and three days for only 60 bucks, saved $300. Margaret recently did her taxes and found out they're getting a $5,000 refund. So congratulations, Margaret. She's also setting up some new business, has clients that she's already sold for seminars, and has people approaching her for new business ventures. She says her life has totally changed. So what would it take for everybody listening to have the same thing happen for them, that or something greater? Kelly, working with some powerful energy, and she's been really doing some healing. Her sister, in the past, was rear ended in the car eight times. She finally bought a new car, has already been hit twice driving on the 405 in California. Kelly worked on her, clearing her energy, and her sister called her and laughed saying that it's really hilarious now because everybody's staying way behind her. So she reported that the clearing worked. Her brother had broken all the finger bones in November, couldn't move the last two fingers. She started working on him saying, yes, you can close your hand. It's easy. One week later, her mom called, and her brother can now close his hand. It only took a week. Shelly's mom had rheumatoid arthritis, a lot of pain. She'd been sending her blessing balls of light, and I talk about this in my "Love or Above" course, how to send blessings to people. Her mom dropped by the house, asked Shelly if she had done something because she woke up being able to use her hands, full of energy, no pain the very next day. Her mom called her from Vegas, asked if she should gamble that day. Shelly said she felt a strong intuition that she would win, called later, and mama had won $2,800. Her son fell in March, broke his foot, had been in pain since then. I must've said somewhere in one of the clearings that the family will accept a miracle. He did, and now his foot feels great. Love it. Good job healing, your family, Kelly. So these are inspiring stories. Mentally and emotionally, people are different, and finances are showing up for people. So that's really, really, really amazing. Let's go back a minute, and let's connect to the light first. So what would it take for you guys to connect to light right now? Okay, take your energy 300 feet up. See, sense or feel the light, okay, and just kind of open your heart to the light. Imagine a big beam of light's coming down into your head, opening your crown so that you can receive the vital information needed to connect your heart to your spending. Ask this light to come into your third eye, cleaning out so you can see everything that you need to release. Okay, ask this light to come in, clearing out everything in your hearing so that you can just receive divine advice, divine guidance, and know exactly what it is that you guys need to clear for your ahas. Okay, ask this light to open up all perspectives. Okay, ask this light to open up all perspectives. Okay, ask this light to open up all possibilities. Okay, ask this light to go into your throat, opening up all of your ability to communicate the truth to yourself, communicate the truth into your future, right? The truth is you're abundant, happy, healthy, alive, and well. Ask your throat to open up and release anything in the way of that. Ask your heart to open up so that you can be totally kind to you, loving to you. Ask this light to connect your heart and your throat so that you speak love into your money, love into your life, love into your future. Ask this light to connect into your solar plexus so any anxiousness can be lifted. Ask this light to come into your power center, stirring up and clearing up everything in the way of you living authentically powerful, being a loving, kind, guided, abundant, happy being. Ask the light to come into your root so that you're grounded in this new reality that you have it all, are it all, can be at all. Okay, ask this light to connect into the center of the planet, the place where it's purely conscious in the center of the planet. Ask this light to bounce back up. You are now connected above and below. Ask this light to radiate out your heart at 360 degrees, like a great central sunshine. Ask this light to open up and radiate unlimited potential, unlimited possibilities, all perspectives within your field so that you can see a new perspective of how to go forward in the world and how to generate your money. Ask this light to expand bigger than the building that you're in, radiating out again all possibility, all perspectives, unlimited abundance. Ask this light to radiate out past the city your in, connecting to all the people, all the places, all the ideas, all the events, everything that can help bring more abundance to you. Ask this light to connect out past the state you're in, connecting to all the people, places, things, events, ideas, and thoughts that can help you. Ask this abundance to radiate out past the country you are in, connecting to all the people, places, things, ideas, events, know how, knowledge, wherewithal, motivation, perspective, potential futures that can bring you exactly what's on your vision board. Okay, ask the light to come in, again opening up all perspectives, yes. Expand the flight past the planet Earth. So you're connected to the oneness of all, to the abundance of it all, so that all people, places, and things add to your life, add profit to your life, and you add profit to them. You are an excellent receiver of your true abundance. Let's just do a general clearing. So any anger, fear, worry, regret, shame, guilt, any of these lower emotions, uncreate and delete 'em all. Any dark energies that you guys are connected to for whatever reason, uncreate and delete all those across all time, dimension, space, and reality. Anywhere you guys are connected to anybody that's holding you back, please cut the cord now, uncreate and delete everything connecting you from anybody holding you back. Uncreate and delete all that across all time, dimension, space, and reality. Anywhere you guys are connected to any event in the past that in any way could block you, uncreate and delete all that across all time, dimension, space, and reality. Anywhere you guys are limited in your perspective of how you can see a new future, will you uncreate and delete all that, too? What would it take for you guys to open up to new perspectives, new ways of looking at things, new money, all the , commitments, and decisions that you guys have to stop yourself, block yourself, and not do harm to yourself, which therefore creates a fear that you're going to do harm to yourself, which makes you not want to change. Everything that is, will you uncreate and delete that across all time, dimension, space and reality? Any other dark dimensional doorways that you guys have opened, anything dark or shadowy, uncreate and delete all that, too. Okay, some of you guys are holding onto a lot of anger and frustration. So all the anger and frustration that's damning your energy, think of the word mad is dam backwards. So anywhere you guys are madding yourself and damning yourself, uncreate and delete all that across all time, dimension, space, and realities. Everywhere your whole perspective is on what you can't do versus what you can do, everything that is, uncreate and delete all that across all time, dimension, space, and reality. Everywhere you guys are focused on the past and not on the future, uncreate and delete all that. Everywhere you guys keep limiting what you look at, how much you see in your world, uncreate and delete all that. Everywhere you focus all your activity on things with diminishing return and no rewards, uncreate and delete all that. That feels better. You guys feel better. Today, we are going to talk about delusion. Actually disillusion is defined as free from illusion, which is really delusion. Are you free of the illusion with money? So I want you guys to think for a minute, okay? So just think about your money 'cause this is all about does your heart's energy match what you're spending things on? Are you loving yourself enough to spend your money wisely, spending it on things that bring you profit or bring you love or align you with your happy future? So right now, I want you guys to think for a minute, are you spending money on things you align with? So pick a recent day, like probably in the last week, a day that you spent some money, and I want you to list some of the things on your piece of paper that you spent money on. Now, of those things that you guys just listed, did you spend this cash on things that you aligned with and match your heart's desire? Was it something that you really needed and wanted? Did it align and match with like you know you have these vision boards, and these vision boards have some big targets on them. Did it align with all those things, and have you recently spent some money, just notice, on something that you didn't want nor use to fill a hole, like to fill a void? You guys should be considering, like everything in your life is an exchange of some sort, and you had to work for that money, right? You had to take your energy and put it into work to create that money. So are you spending it on something that feels good to you? So it's about conscious spending. So now let's go to the next one. Let's just think in the last three months, okay, and maybe you're different. So don't go back too far 'cause I want to get more of the current energy, all right?

Well, I want you to think of the energy of something you love, a pet, a child, something you just totally adore and love more than anything in the world. Okay, whatever that kind of energy is, I want you to think of having a stack of $100 bills in front of you, and this is your money, by the way, okay? So I want you to take that energy of loving a pet or an animal or a kid or something you love more than anything, your spouse, and that same kind of energy that's all soft and gooey, I want you to just love money. Just say money, I love you. What would it take for more of you to show up in my life? Money, I am so excited and grateful and happy that you are in my life. How do I get more of you? Money, it's the best thing that ever happened to me to have so much of you. How do I get some more of you? That kind of energy is how you love money. Okay, so I want you guys to think for a minute. This energy, can you get into a little bit more of the loving, and what if you loved your body that much? Okay, so your body is like a little pet. You got to take care of it. If you love your body that much, you'll actually feel emotionally better. Okay, everywhere, your parents, everywhere you guys are failures, uncreate and delete all that. How many of you guys have a plan about your money, okay? You really know on a monthly basis... Now, people don't look negatively sometimes about budget, okay? So I'm not talkin' about negative energy of budget. I'm talkin' about an action plan. What would it take for you guys to have an action plan that would allow you to follow through on creating more money? The link at the bottom here. Okay, so you guys can be millionaires, but it depends on what you want to do. So the way to be a millionaire is start a business and generate a lot of money. Now, in the book, "The Millionaire Next Door," they talk about most millionaires live pretty cheaply, and they save or reinvest all their money in their businesses, and what they do is, kind of like doctors and lawyers, they might spend all their money 'cause people think they have a lot of money, and they got to keep up with the Joneses. The millionaires next door made, on average, I think like 100,000 or something, and they just were really good at saving and budgeting their money, okay? They had a plan. They had an action plan. If you want to have a million dollars at 10% interest rate, and you want to do it in 10 years, you have to put $5,000 away, 20 years, $1,400 away, or you can go generate a business, right, but what the millionaires next door did is they lived conservatively, and when they got a boost in their income or their raise, they didn't change where they lived and increase their budget. That's what a common thing is people do. They get more money, and instead of saving more, they buy bigger things and spend more money. Now, look at Warren Buffet. How long has Warren Buffet lived in the same house? I don't know how old Warren Buffet is, but I'm assuming he's in his eighties. So he's got to have lived in the house for about 50, 60 years with his wife, and he's a billionaire, but he didn't change and get more toys and bigger cars and all that stuff. So are you guys willing to have a plan? That's what I'm saying, and do you actually know that they did this poll, I read this somewhere, that most people who are poor, what they think their retirement is going to be is they're going to win the lottery. Now, there's nothing wrong with the lottery, but can you acknowledge within yourself that, if you have to win the lottery, there's some part of you that feels a little powerless over your ability to go start a business or go do something and make a lot of money. So let's acknowledge that part of you for a minute. So the part of you that doesn't think that you're strong enough, more powerful or capable to go, just create a business and generate a lot of money, will you uncreate and delete all that across all time, dimension, space, and reality? Everywhere you guys are afraid to actually just go do something different, take some massive action, and just do whatever it takes to make a bunch of money, uncreate and delete all that. Everywhere you're afraid you're going to lose something or it won't work, uncreate and delete all that Okay, so I want you guys to connect up for a minute. I want you to think for a minute, if I was going to go make $1,000,000, I want you to ask this question to the universe, really deeply connected, if I was going to go generate $1,000,000 and it's not from the lottery, okay, if I was going to go generate $1,000,000, what is one industry I could do it in? Okay, everywhere you guys have a plan for the money coming in but you don't have a plan for how to get it, delete all that. So all these things, okay, so it seems like you guys have a plan.

LESSON 23: Clearing Fear of Scarcity Through Generosity

- Hey, this is Christie Marie Sheldon, and you're listening to a recording I did of a series of 24 live group sessions on Clearing Abundance Blocks. Today is session 23 Unlimited Abundance Journey. And it's an exciting day today. We're going to talk about sharing a certain kind of energy in the world and with yourself. So grab a journal, a piece of paper so that you can take some notes about what comes up for you and work on it this week. So let's be open to a lot of abundance, how about that? So let's take a moment and set some intent on what you hope to achieve. Like what would it take for you this week to have more abundance, more generosity, more love than it has ever shown up in your life, ever. Lots of energy there, I love it. Okay, so let's set an intent for unlimited abundance journey. So a few more days, let's just set a super-duper intent that everything that you wanted to have happen, we're going to ask that it show up in your life no matter what you think. So we're going to ask it to exceed your expectations, accelerate beyond belief, move past any of your fears and stuff, and just show up in your life, right? So what would it take for that to happen? What would it take for the universe and you to work together, to collaborate and make life be generous for you? So we have some exciting news today. Dasray manifested $18,500, here's how. So, her manifesting is still paying off. She also told us about her ex-husband that she was trying to release. He recently sends her some paperwork for a loan deferment on a car loan that she was a co-signer on. It is not the first time this happened and it upsets her every time he does it. So she decided she has some tools now and she asked, "What would it take for her ex "to trade in the car and get her off the loan?" Less than 72 hours later, ring ring ring, she gets a phone call and he had traded the car in on another new car and she no longer has to worry about the loan. So this is so amazing, wow! Between the extra income that she's brought in with her part-time job being released from the $8,500 car loan, she has manifested $18,500 since starting the unlimited abundance journey. So good job Dasray, I love it, love it. And what would it take for everybody listening to how something really cool like that happened for you too? All right, Teresa has manifested $8,650 in Little Miracles. Her health insurance was canceled when she called to renew it the company said they would waive the $250 renewal fee. She didn't ask for the fee to be rewaived but because she's vibrating at a different energy level from using all the tools they just saved her, they just offered, received a new mortgage coupon in the mail for the next year and when she checked it they had lowered the amount by $700 a month. So that's a savings of $8,400 totally out of the blue. The other day she was on the beach with the family. It was great and overcast, she was on the way and she said, "What would it take to get a sunny day at the beach?" So guess what happened, as soon as they pulled up, removed the gear, the sun came out and stayed out for a full four hours and they enjoyed the beach. So I'm loving this change in the weather thing going on. And on the way to the airport, they had a traffic jam in the Holland Tunnel, she has tools now, so she said, what would it take for the traffic to clear and get them to the airport by 8:00 AM? She said normally it takes like 45 minutes, but basically within minutes she said, what was like a massive traffic jam it began to clear and soon it was like they were the only ones on the road. So they arrived at the airport five minutes early. So $8,650 and an early airport arrival. So really good job Teresa, I love it. Okay, Georgia shared some really good news about her latest manifestations. A doctor found a tumor and said there was a reason to be concerned and she needed to have it tested right away. So while all this was going on, she asked, "What would it take to have the test results "come back clear showing no problems at all?" A few days later the test results showed exactly that, no problems or complications, yay! The tumor was benign. Then she was using the secret formula. What would it take for extra income to show up? And she's a jewelry maker and painter, she manifested 120 bucks in jewelry sales right away, $650 from the sale of three paintings and 240 bucks from a grand sale, so that's $1,010 total. She was thrilled. She has also traveled a long distance to attend a family wedding, In the past this would be very uncomfortable she said, and she'd feel out of place, like want to hide. How many of you have felt that? She said, "What would it take to go and have fun?" "What would it take to go and have fun?" And she did, she said she felt very welcome for the first time in a very, very, very long time and had a great time catching up with her family. So good job Georgia, we love that. Okay, so what would it take for all of you to manifest loads and loads of abundance for yourself exceeding all your expectations more than you've ever hoped to achieve, bypassing any of your beliefs? And any of you not open to receiving this kind of abundance and quality of life we ask that all of that stuff be deleted as well. All right, so let's connect to the light you guys. Okay, so close your eyes and obviously if you're driving please don't close your eyes. Okay, so take your energy up 300 feet above you. See, sense, feel, believe, imagine that you're connected to the light and imagine that this light forms a beam of light and just come straight into your crown. And today's about sharing energies. So you're going to ask this beam of light to start helping you feel the energy of generosity, of abundance, of love, of plenty, of more than enough. So we're going to ask this light to come into your crown opening all the knowing centers up so that you can know, see, believe, feel, and feel all your abundance and generosity. Asking the light to come through your throat so you can communicate the truth of who you are, which is you're an abundant creational being by nature. You are a creator being who creates abundance in your life. Okay, asking the light to come into your heart, opening you up so you can feel the energy of this abundance and generosity, and more than enough and power. Okay, asking this light to come into your solar plexus, opening up any nervousness, fear, and anxiety, washing it away so that you can feel who you truly are embodied in the energy of abundance. Asking this light to go into your power centers, opening up all the places where you feel a little disempowered, moving you to the place where you can feel abundance, feel generosity, feel a spirit moving through you. Opening up all your channels to receive all your abundance better than you ever expect. Yes, knowing that you deserve it in all ways. Asking this light to come into your roots so you're rooted in the new reality, the brand new reality, that you're completely different than you were yesterday, you're completely different than you were five years ago, you're completely different in your reality field 'cause now you're in the reality field called abundance. Plenty more than enough. Everything you ask for shows up for you. Okay, asking the quality of life to increase. Okay, ask this light to connect to the center of the planet, where it feels the happiest, the most liked, the most loved. Ask this light in the center of the planet to bounce straight back up into your body moving all the way up into your heart radiating out your heart like a great central sun 360 degrees all the way around. Ask this light to expand 10 feet all the way around you filling your whole field with the energy of generosity, abundance, plenty, more than enough, ease, lots of happiness, lots of love, lots of things are taken care of, okay, cool. Okay, ask this light to get bigger than the building you're in, filling the space with abundance, generosity, a magnet for more than enough to show up in your life. Ask this light to expand past the city you're in connecting to all the people in it, asking them to bring you everything it is that you are asking for, and ask that you can be of service to them bringing your gifts to them as well and they happily and easily will pay you in exchange for that. Ask this light to connect to everybody in your state, asking that anybody in your state who can happily receive service from you to show up asking that you gift them the gift of abundance back, okay. Ask this light to expand past the country you're in connecting to all the people in it, asking those that would happily be a part of your abundance creation, your new way of life, your new way of living, your happily ever after whatever that is for you. You're going to ask those people to show up in your life. And we're going to ask you to send a lot of blessings to them right now and ask them to show up now, okay. Asking the light to expand past the planet earth connecting to everybody on the planet earth sending them love and light, asking them to find you and give you money. And you will happily and easily gift them something in return as well. It could be energy, it could be time, it could be you just being you, okay, whatever that means to you. Okay, and let's just ask that again, that all your expectations increase, that everything shows up this week exactly how you want it completely and totally aligned better than you could have ever dreamed of connecting you to all the future abundance that you want in the future, we're going to ask that to just show up now. Let's ask it to show up now. So just say abundance come to me. Everything on my vision board come to me, everything I always wanted and dreamed and desired in my life show up now. Kind of affirmed gently that I am an excellent receiver of all my abundance. I'm an excellent receiver of all my blessings. I'm an excellent receiver, I can handle it all now, bring it on. Bring it to me with a lot of ease and fun, and laughter, and happiness, and joy, and celebration. Okay, so today we're going to fill you guys up a lot today. So today the filler up day. All right, okay, so I'm just going to ask you to just do an internal check, all right, an internal check. On most days are you more generous or more stingy? And I also mean this with yourself and with others. Okay, and then just kind of type in your answers so we can clear everything as it comes up for you. So are you generous or are you stingy? Okay, so any of you guys who have some stinginess maybe in treating certain members of your family, certain parts of your life, taking care of your body, taking care of your finances, whatever that is, okay. Anywhere you're stingy with yourself will you uncreate and delete that across all time dimension, space, and reality. So what are you guys stingy in? Everywhere you're stingy with your time? Everything that is, will you uncreate and delete it all? And the reason I'm bringing this question up, I'll give you guys a bigger picture. If you're stingy somehow it means that you don't think you have enough or that the universe isn't generous, okay. So if you have an overlighting belief that the universe is general she'll usually be generous. Okay, so anywhere you guys think that there's not enough in the world for you, and that there's only a small portion for you, everything that is, will you uncreate all that across all time dimension, space, and reality. How many places are you guys been limiting? How much time and effort you put into your life and you're stingy with letting your life be fully in you. Okay, everything that is, uncreate it all. So you think of what it would be like if you guys were totally in your power, right. So what would it be like for you guys to be totally in your power, radiating generosity, knowing that the universe will happily bring back to you that which you emanate, okay. It's about filling your body and your being with so much love that you're like a magnet that attracts more and more to you. Okay, so just think about that and everywhere you're unwilling to do that, will you please uncreate and delete all that across all time, space, and reality. Any of you that are stingy with money, so stingy with money with yourself, with other people, with your kids, with your family, okay. Everything that is uncreate and delete it all. Anywhere you like to heckle yourself on a daily basis and talk down to yourself, and barge yourself, and make yourself wrong, and beat yourself up, that's kind of stingy with love, right? You're not really being very gracious and loving to yourself. So everything that is, will you uncreate it and delete all that across all time, dimension, space and reality. Okay, so let's see, everywhere you tend to hold onto grudges. Okay, so everywhere you're holding grudges uncreate and delete all that across all time, dimension, space, and reality. Everywhere you guys are kind of like holding back and seeing the big picture, kind of getting the download here for a minute that if you're willing to be bigger than all your problems and filled with so much life, and so much zest, and so much celebration, what happens is more and more and more and more of that comes to you. But if you're filled with kind of negative whiny complainy kind of energy, right? Like, oh, this doesn't work, I'm such a shame. What's wrong with me? Like all those kinds of things, right. Then obviously, can you see how that energy would bring you back more of the same? Okay, so anywhere you guys do the whiny complaining thing at any level, okay, uncreate and delete all that across all time, dimension, space, and reality. What would it take for you guys to always know that just connecting to light can happen in two seconds. So if you're in the whiny crabby thing in two seconds what would it take for you to just go uncreate and delete all that? Okay, so anywhere you're unwilling to do that for yourself and you live in the energy of the feeling that you are a flawed human being, will you uncreate and delete all that? How many of you guys think you're flawed? All of the things that are wrong with you. So whatever you guys think you're flawed for whatever reason, just uncreate and delete all that across all time, dimension, space, and reality. How many other places you guys think you're flawed? Uncreate and delete all that across all time, dimension, space, and reality. How many core beliefs do you guys have that align you with the energy of I am flawed? Yes, uncreate and delete all that across all time, dimension, space, and reality. How many of you hate your life at some level? And you might not want to admit it but you hate your life. Okay, so everything that is, will you uncreate and delete all that across all time, dimension, space, and reality. So how many of you guys are stingy with how much time you spend with other people? Maybe you need some love from people and you're not letting yourself have it. Okay, everything that is, will you uncreate delete all that across all time, dimension, space, and reality. Everywhere you're stingy with a wiring yourself to believe that you can have everything you want, okay, everything that is, will you uncreate and delete all that across all time, dimension, space, and reality. There's not really an energy of too generous, Christina, unless it's taking something away from you. I mean, if it's being unkind to you, like there's generosity, but if at some level it's not kind how much generosity you do. And then yeah, that might be too generous. So anywhere you guys are unkind to yourself by giving more than you receive okay, uncreate and delete all that. You know what I do? I would change my belief more than I'm a really excellent receiver and everything that I generously give I receive a hundredfold back. Okay, let's everybody think about this for a minute. Okay, so what would it take for all of us to receive a hundredfold back or a millionfold back from everything that you give the world, right? Yes, everything you give and gift in the world that you give and gift of you, what would it take for you to receive all that energy back a thousand fold? So everywhere you guys worry too much about like the little things, about how much you spend on clothing or food or time, all that stuff uncreate and delete it all. Again, it goes back to that simple question. Like when I buy clothes you know what I do? It's kind of funny, I asked two questions. If I buy this will it make me profit? 'Cause if it makes me happy it might bring me profit, and then I do a cost per wearing. I measure it in my head, what's the probability that I'll wear this over 20 times. And if the answer is no I probably don't usually buy it. So I do a cost per wearing analysis in my head really quick. So that's all, it's kind of fun. I'm generous with others with my time and money, and then I find I'm not filling myself up, and then I get drained, and I get stingy with them. Yeah, 'cause that's like you're unloving towards yourself. So you have to be generous with you first to fill up to the brim with you and then give to others. Okay, so ever your real problem is you're stingy with yourself. Okay, uncreate and delete all that. Everywhere you're generous to other people because maybe you want love and approval and not so generous with yourself and hubby, uncreate and delete all that. Okay, everywhere you get blamed for everything that goes wrong in the world uncreate and delete all that. Stingy is just an energy field 'cause I want you guys to get here that abundance is an energetic model. So it's not necessarily about how much you give or don't give 'cause you can give time or energy like literally. Okay, I want you to just really think about this. So you're standing in the grocery line, you're buying your food. There's probably the cashier standing there, maybe the burger person, maybe there's somebody in front of your line and somebody behind you, so there's four people around you. Are you generous or are you stingy? You know what I mean, like are you emanating life and love or are you hiding and holding back and avoiding? So everywhere you guys are holding a grudge for not getting paid. Okay, so that's going to kind of hold your energy up, Kathleen. So I know it sucks if that happened, I really do, so I acknowledge that, but anywhere you're holding on to that grudge for any reason, everywhere it's not fair and right and good uncreate and delete it all, and any pattern that you created in your life that made that manifest for you, including your mom's patterns, uncreate and delete all those, and your dad's patterns, so uncreate and delete all those. Anywhere else you guys think you have flaws uncreate and delete all that. Everywhere you've been told to never expect to receive, see everything just remember your reality is wired how you want it to be wired. Okay, so if you have the point of view that you shouldn't expect anything back, like I never expect anything back necessarily from the person that I'm helping, do you understand? But I expect that it will come in some way for me. Do you understand? So it doesn't have to be from the exact person. Like if I help one person I might not get anything back from that one person but I do know that 150 other people will help me back later somewhere else. So I have this belief that it's kind of my responsibility to give and share my energy so that other people can have their gifts open too, and in doing that I'm basically generating a lot of energy towards helping the planet and I expect simultaneously that the planet will take care of me. And so it's like a mutual giving and taking all at the same time. It doesn't have to be with one particular person. I love being by myself, no, it's not stingy so much. You have to really Hellen think about that for yourself. Do you know what I mean? So it's kind of a judgment call. Do you feel generous in your life? If you feel generous and open-hearted, and you're full of life, and all your interactions with people are full of life then that's great. All right, okay, so everywhere you let your spouse control how much you give to yourself uncreate and delete all that across all time, dimension, space, and reality. Well, sometimes you guys have to fill up with yourself, see if you're filled with life you won't be tired, do you understand? It's okay to retreat and take care of yourself. So please understand again, this is about being filled with life is what I'm talking about. So everywhere you guys won't fill it with life but you would kind of give but resented at same time, okay any of you doing that will you uncreate and delete all that? Okay, so let's go to the next one. 'Cause you'll kind of see where I'm going with this in a minute. So do you guys, when you walk out in the world, are you feeling kind about life and people or are you feeling hurt by life and reacting and tucking and shielding yourself? So that's kind of stingy too, right? So it's like, do you walk out thinking the world as benevolent and going to help you or do you walk out in the world thinking I got to shield and hide myself 'cause people are going to want things from me, or they're going to push my button, or they're going to be unkind to me and they're going to voraciously attack me, right? Okay, so any of you guys thinking that the world is going to attack you and you should hide from it, okay, everything that is will you uncreate and delete all that across all time, dimension, space, and reality. How many of you think the world is unfair and unkind to you? So you don't want to show up for it. Okay, everything that is will you uncreate and delete all that across all time, dimension, space, and reality. Everywhere you're feeling inadequate or I am not enough. Oh, I'm going to clear this one. Everywhere you guys are givers and not takers because again, generosity means you also receive generous energy, right? You give generous energy and you receive generous energies simultaneously, okay. So anywhere you guys are givers but not takers 'cause you have to be both. Okay, what would it take for you guys to be an amazing taker? And everything in the way of that will you uncreate and delete all that. What would it take for you guys to be an amazing taker? Yes, so everything in the way of that, will you uncreate and delete all that. Anywhere being generous with people makes you dependent on them or they might want more later on everything that is will you uncreate that across all time, space, dimension, and realities. My mom says in some ways that the economy is too broke to buy from my website, then I try to counter that reaction with lots of people are still working and still buy gifts for wedding and stuff. Okay, so Mercy, anywhere you bought into the whole thing the economy is broken, uncreate and delete all that across all time, dimension, space, and reality. Okay, what would it take for the economy to be generous? I don't know where I read this, but somebody, I just read that if everybody spends like an extra, gosh! I wish I knew the numbers exactly. Let's just say 10, 20 bucks but they only bought things from the country that they live in, they would basically create so many jobs in that country that they live in and it would pretty much change the whole economy. So they were talking in particular about the United States, but they were saying that if we only buy American products it will basically change the whole economy and basically create a whole bunch more jobs. So anywhere you guys have bought into the reality that you don't have any control over it 'cause the point I brought up with that is you do have control over the economy at some level. If you're willing to take some sort of action that adds to the economy. Okay, so everything in the way of that uncreate and delete it all. Everywhere you guys react with your hubby, your kids, and your family, everything that is will you uncreate and delete all that. Everywhere you have a pattern where you give people a lot and then you get imbalanced because they become dependent on you. Everything that is will you uncreate and delete all that for yourselves. Okay, so do you guys love people or you avoid people? Where are you at with this? Are you so filled up with life and so balanced and so harmonious with yourself that you can love people and get plenty back? Okay, so any of you guys who are avoiding people, hanging out, hiding your gifts and talents and shielding yourself because if you're hiding your gifts and talents and shielding yourself you're not going to get paid as much money. Okay, so everything that is will you uncreate it and delete it all. People usually bring money to you, right? So if you want to create abundance you have to be willing to be seen and heard at some level. So any of you guys unwilling to be seen and heard at some level, and therefore you don't get paid. Everything that is will you uncreate and delete all that across all time, dimension, space, and reality. Okay, any of you guys who have body aches and pains, will you please just decide right now, ask your body what it's trying to show you. So all of you guys have a body aches and pains that are kind of talking right now., ask your body what is it trying to show you that you're unwilling to receive. Like maybe you don't love yourself. Okay, so Nancy, there's some sort of lack of love that you need to add to your life every day. Okay, so you need some more love. Okay, so everywhere you guys don't love yourself enough uncreate and delete all that across all time, dimension, space, and reality. What would it take for you guys to feel the energy of love? To get myself in this whole feeling of love I just kind of go I love, I love, I love, I love, I love. And everybody say this out loud, I love, I love, I love. I love myself, I love me, I love me, I'm generous to me, I love me. All your energy changed, I love it. Okay, everywhere you guys have a hard time letting other people help you will you uncreate and delete all that too. Everywhere you guys are avoiding letting the energy pass through your body and you want to have it get stuck in your body, everything that is will you uncreate it all. Okay, what would it take for you guys to just love the part of your body that's hurting and ask it to release the energy? Ooh, all right, okay, so do you guys know deep down that you can financially provide for yourself? Do you guys know deeply that you can financially provide to yourself? Okay, anyone who doesn't know deeply that they can financially provide for themselves, will you please uncreate and delete all that. So all those stories, all the indecision that's amounting to you guys not willing to step forward into your power. Okay, this is all about you guys pretending that you're weak and I know who you are. You guys aren't weak, you guys are powerhouses. So everywhere you guys are playing games with yourselves, and creating all these stories, and pretending you can't, and going into the flawed part of you instead of just deciding, you know what, "I'm going to get over this, and I'm going to fix my finances, "and it's going to happen no matter what it takes, "no matter what training it takes, "no matter what education it takes, "no matter what knowhow it takes, "I'm going to do whatever it takes to make some more cash "and know that I'm always "truly and totally financially a provided for it." Okay, so again, we're not going to go into too much body stuff. I was just being kind of nice there and kind of going in to it. But all the stuff that you guys have going on in your body that you don't want to let go of, that you want to label, and name, and make real, and make persistent, and keep it and label it. Okay, all that stuff, will you guys uncreate and delete it all across all time, dimension, space, and reality. The more you label it the more it wants to stay. Why don't you just call it this interesting thing that wants to go away right now. Okay, so everywhere you guys won't let go of the interesting things in your body 'cause you want to play with them, will you uncreate and delete all those across all time, dimension, space and reality. All right, so how many of you feel that you cannot provide for yourself financially? Okay, everything that is will you uncreate and delete all that across all time, dimension, space, and reality. Okay, I want you guys, like I think you guys are distracting from this. Okay, I want you to feel inside. Okay, because if we can get rid of this story this would be a really good story to get rid of. Feel inside and think about going into the future. Do you guys feel a thousand percent comfortable that you can make any amount of money that you would ever truly want to make? Okay, anybody who answered no to that question or maybe to that question will you delete and uncreate all the nos and the maybes across all time, dimension, space, and reality. Okay, so anywhere else you guys do not believe that you can know the truth about everything that you venture into, will you uncreate and delete all that across all time, dimension, space, and reality. How many of you are avoiding looking at your future and your future abundance and not moving forward because you don't choose to be financially independent. Okay, everything that is, will you uncreate and delete all that across all time, dimension, space, and reality. Okay, some of you guys are not letting go of your stories about this whole financially moving forward trusting that you can make anything you want. Okay, so any of you guys who have these stories that I'm blocked and stopped and I can't really make the kind of living that I want to make. Okay, so everything that is, will you uncreate and delete all that across all time, dimension, space, and reality. Okay, wow, it's a lot of energy. Okay, so any of you guys who are still thinking that you're poor, still thinking that you're poverty stricken, okay, everything that is, will you uncreate all that across all time, dimension, space, and reality. How many of you still believe that you cannot do it on your own? Okay, everything that is will you uncreate and delete all the stories and the reasons why. And at what age did you tell yourself the story that you needed help? Like the kind that you couldn't do it on your own. So everything that is, will you uncreate and delete all that across all time, dimension, space, and reality. All right, so all those pages they just kind of popped in your head When I asked that question, whatever was going on in that part of your life. 'Cause it's usually that you believe somebody else. So any of you that believed somebody else that you couldn't make a living or that life was hard or that you can't go forward, will you uncreate and delete all that across all time, dimension, space, and reality. Okay, how many of you have slowed yourself down on purpose? Okay, so to Jessy, anywhere you slowed yourself down, because it feels like you made a decision to slow yourself down, uncreate and delete all that across all time, dimension, space, and reality. Okay, anywhere you guys bought into somebody else's story about making money, making abundance, and making a living, and then making a life, uncreate and delete all that across all time dimension, space, and reality. Okay, any of you guys that are waiting for somebody to rescue you uncreate and delete all that across all time, dimension, space, and reality. What would it take for you guys to connect to the light and make it happen on your own? Okay, everywhere you guys are waiting to be rescued uncreate and delete all that. People can have rich parents or get inherited money. So maybe you don't have to justify receiving it. It just means you're an excellent receiver who is in the right place at the right time. So will you acknowledge yourself like you did it right at some level, your energy created that. So any of you that won't acknowledge that you created financial independence, everything that is, uncreate and delete all that. Okay, everywhere you guys live in the mindset of I don't have enough, uncreate and delete all that across all time, dimension, space, and reality. Okay, everywhere you guys created a scenario where you don't think you can pay all your bills for whatever reason. Okay, everything that is, will you uncreate and delete all that across all time, dimension, space, and reality. Anywhere else you guys created that you can't pay your bills, uncreate and delete all that across all time, dimension, space, and reality. Okay, everywhere you guys get stuck trying to figure out what to do next uncreate and delete all that. So I'm going to ask you guys to connect to the light right now. I want you to think of whatever business you want to have. Okay, so just think of you're having a business and you're generating, you know, you guys pick a number, 100,000, a million, I don't care what, okay. Think of how much you want. Okay, connect to the light and say no matter what I want my answer of what is my next step that leads me to this money? What is my next step that brings me that cash? Okay, Everything that is will you uncreate and delete all that. All right, anywhere you guys are increasing your spending but not your earning, so everything that is will you uncreate and delete all that? Okay, so did any of you get some answers what your next step is? Because sometimes it's just training. Sometimes it's calling to people. Sometimes it's doing something you found on the internet. Okay, so everything in the way of you guys knowing what to do next, there right there uncreate and delete all that. Okay, do you authentically know inside yourself that life is good and safe and right? Do you authentically know that life is good, safe, and right? Okay, any of you who do not think that life is good, safe, and right or fair to you? That usually means you have some God belief or a source to belief that the universe doesn't take care of you or God doesn't take care of you. So any of you guys who have a belief that God doesn't take care of me, or I don't take care of me, or my parents don't take care of me, uncreate and delete it all. Everywhere you have a fear of failure, which is really not feeling safe in the world, uncreate and delete all that across all time, dimension, space, and reality. How many of you are afraid to step forward knowing that you might fail. Uncreate and delete all that across all time, dimension, space, and reality. Anywhere you guys set yourself up to close off so you don't really have to really, really, really, really have to go out there. Everything that is, will you uncreate and delete it all. How many of you guys want to move forward? I want you guys to check inside for a minute, okay. I want you to like really, really, really, really feel inside, okay. When we're talking about your subconsciousness, okay. Check inside with all your subconscious stuff, and all your garbage, and all your patterns and say, "Am I really willing to move forward and change my life?" Are you really willing to do what's needed? 'Cause sometimes it's not a belief, it's just a choice. A powerful choice can change your life. Okay, so how many of you guys are really, okay, so we're going to clear this. Everywhere you're the one that messes up your life or it's harder than you imagined uncreate and delete all that. Okay, so what were the answers to that question? Are you guys really willing to go forward? Okay, so to go forward without real knowledge and lose is a lot of stupid, right? But maybe the forward is learning knowledge. Maybe that's the next step, right? So going forward means just doing the next step even if the next step is learned some skill, then that's the next step, right? Okay, so anything that came up that says, no, I'm not subconsciously, I'm talking to your subconscious here for a minute. All the hidden things, okay. So all the hidden things that said no, no, no, no, no, uncreate and delete all that. Okay, so people usually bring you money, usually in this world, generally speaking. So do you like people or are you afraid of people? Okay, so any of you guys afraid of people or afraid of taking money from people or afraid of connecting to people who could have an answer for you, who could have a tool for you, who could have an awareness for you or could it be your client. So any of you guys afraid of talking to people or meeting new people to get new clients and money and ideas and thoughts and feelings and all sorts of cool stuff, okay, everything that is, will you uncreate and delete all that? Any of you guys who are blocked by your father, so Roman, you're blocked by your father, everything that is will you uncreate and delete all that across all time, dimension, space, and reality. Any of you guys blocked by your mother's energy uncreate and delete all that across all time, dimension, space and reality. Okay, so Amy, so she's got to make a good point. She's saying that she likes to support people but she doesn't like to be out in front. Okay, so anywhere you guys are hiding behind the scenes, uncreate and delete all that. Anywhere you think it's risky to go forward, uncreate and delete all that. Now, you can be a behind the scenes for a little while if you need to learn something or mentor with somebody, right? But don't stay stuck there too long. Okay, so any of you guys who are afraid to go forward uncreate and delete all that across all time, dimension, space, and reality. Everywhere you're afraid to ask for the money or afraid to let go of your father or mother's energy, everything that is, will you uncreate and delete all that across all time, dimension, space, and reality. Okay, everywhere you only like people if they can help you could you uncreate and delete all that. Okay, now the reason that could be ineffective at some level JC, is because what if you're judging that they can't help you but maybe they actually really could, right? So it could get in the way because maybe you're cutting off 70% of the population and maybe 70% of the population could actually really help you 'cause you're already judging that they couldn't before they even show up in your life. Okay, so any of you guys blocking people by judging them before they show up in your life, everything that is, will you uncreate and delete all that? I don't really judge people. I just hang out with him a little bit or I feel their energy and decide, wow, if I hang out with them or can their energy support me in some way, and can I support them? You know it's like a big picture thing again. A big picture of knowing that the universe is generous and if you exude life and are full of life then really good things will happen to you. Okay, so again, it's about filling you guys with life. That's where I'm really trying to go in the session, where you think about you just show up in the world even if you're in the grocery store, even if you're the carwash, even if you're at your kid's school, you just show up being generous, kind, loving, a force of love and life, and from that place you attract a lot more good things to you. Okay, this is about creating a powerful attraction field that can change your life. Okay, everywhere you guys are afraid to step forward 'cause you might do something wrong, what would it take for you guys to help people and receive things as a benefit? Well, mom and dad stuff can sometimes be deep if you don't get the right thing, Louise. So sometimes like you and Roman, like Roman for sure needs to just start saying everything that basically wherever your father's energy didn't support me is what I'm saying, uncreate and delete all that. Everywhere my mother's energy didn't support me uncreate and delete all that. Is it possible to be so filled with light that it doesn't matter what you know or do. You mean in order to make money, yeah, the answer is yes. I mean, you might have to take some action at some point, you know, I don't know, I guess you have to know, 'cause you still have body and you got to move it around and meet people. It's got to come through some form. Everywhere you think people will take advantage of you, give your energy to them, uncreate and delete all that, 'cause nobody can take anything that you're not willing to give. Are you guys willing to take massive action without any outside support? Dregor, a little bit of Mom and dad, and like some girlfriend somewhere before. The female energy, that was a lover, you're blocked on that. So can you guys take massive action without any outside support? Okay, so Amber is saying sometimes she runs out of steam if she doesn't have somebody's energy around her as a cheerleader probably or to work with or something like that. Okay, so anywhere you would stop no matter what, like basically what I'm getting here is anywhere you would stop. Okay, anything that is, will you uncreate and delete it all? Any other actions you would stop yourself from taking uncreate and delete it all. Everywhere you believe you have no outside support. Okay, everything that is, will you uncreate and delete all that across all time, dimension, space, and reality. How many other places do you feel not aided or that the aid that you're seeking for will never come in the future. Everything that is, uncreate and delet it all. Everywhere you guys distract yourself so you don't actually have to finish. So that's usually a self-worth deserving thing usually. Okay, not all the time but usually. Okay, so any of that uncreate and delete it all, all the reasons why you guys would distract yourself instead of getting paid uncreate and delete it all. All right, everywhere you have unwanted outsiders, uncreate and delete all that. Everywhere you're still mad that your family didn't come to your rescue uncreate and delete all that across all time, dimension, space, and reality. So Kobe is somewhere around age 20ish, you should have stepped forward in your life and you stopped yourself. So you need to unblock there and you need to unblock your mom and dad, okay. So I would just say, what would it take for me to clear every implanted energy from my parents that has stopped me and anywhere I have decided to stop myself? Okay, so somewhere around age 20 you stopped yourself. Okay, are you allowing yourself to move forward abundantly in the world? Okay, everywhere you guys are not allowing yourself to move forward abundantly uncreate and delete all that. And the best, and this is where we're going to go today. But the biggest question is, do you guys feel abundant? Okay, do you know what it's like to feel abundant? So I want you to, we're going to close your eyes for a minute. Obviously if you're driving do not close your eyes. But I want you to picture yourself when you're abundant. Okay, and hopefully that's now, but what is your picture feeling and thought about being abundant? Like what are you wearing? Who are you with? Have you paid off your credit card bills? Do you have a million bucks in the bank? Everybody's picture is going to be a little different. For you it might be your next step which is maybe getting out of credit card debt, or maybe it's having a business, or maybe it's seeing your income increase. So pick a picture that's going to be juicy to you. Like really, really juicy that you can feel it. Okay, and just feel the energy of abundance. Okay, and what feelings are in your body? Are you loving it? Are you loving life? Are you filled with a lot of joy and spirit and spunk? Oh wow, you guys just changed energy a lot. Okay, what are you guys experiencing inside yourself? Okay, now this feeling that you're feeling. Okay, I want you to turn it up a little bit, make it Technicolor, make it more vibrant. Imagine there's a dial in front of you and you can make yourself feel it a little more. So this feeling, turn it up a little bit more. Okay, so what would it take for what you're feeling to be radiated in your field? What would it take for this energy to bring you everything you're asking for right now? What would it take for this energy that you're feeling? Basically just blow up the other reality and this is your new reality. Okay, so your new reality is generosity, abundance, kindness, fun, ease, joy, power, collaboration with others in a way that fits for you, collaboration with others in a way that's kind. All right, so ask that all the people that fit in this part of your life that brings you the generosity, whatever you're feeling, ask these people to show up in your life now and ask that you take on an action and show up in their life now too, because you take the action that meets them. Collaborative efforts bringing you abundance and cash. Okay, from this space, ask what is my next step that I have to do? Like, what am I doing when I generate this abundance? What am I doing? Okay, cool. What would it take for you guys to live in this space 24/7 as if this is the only space that you need to live in. Okay what would it take for you guys to really truly live in this space? 24/7 just live in this energy, and you'll manifest a lot of things. All right, good job. Okay, so you are this energy. Okay, so some of you might have heard of Dr. Emoto's crystals, where he blessed the water and since you're made a 70% water when you bless the water with love and gratitude and his abundance, and this joy, and this thankfulness, more good things show up in your life. So I'll explain the experiment for those of you who don't know. Basically a scientist took water, froze it, but before he froze it he put one bottle of water had the word anger, and one bottle of water had the word love and things on it. Blessed the one bottle, put anger in the other bottle. And then he photographed the crystals. And at the end of it all the anger one had blobby, ugly crystals like they didn't even form. And the one that was blessed and loved formed these gorgeous crystalline structures. When we're sending out energy of gratitude, thankfulness, and feeling this abundance, this love, this fun, this joy, more and more of that is attracted into our lives. Okay, so it's about filling in with the good stuff. So what would it take for you guys to be grateful and thankful for your abundance? What would it take to create abundance in all of your lives now? What would it take for you guys to do with needed to act abundantly in your life? What would it take to deliver all the courage you need to live generously? Live generously means living fully in your body. What vibrational energy can you become to have generous benefactors give you things. Vibrational energy can make you alive, well, and living abundantly. What vibrational energy can bring more and more abundance. 30 to 40 times a day, it can be all at one time. Say what vibrational energy kind of become to feel love abundantly. Okay, 'cause it's like really the love in all things is what's going to help you. You can post some fun things on the Love Above fan page or my Christie Marie Sheldon fan page, but let's do a big blessing here into your future so that all of you know, let's ask that all of you know that the universe is generous and kind and loving and supportive. So what would it take for you guys to know that the universe is loving, generous, kind, and supportive? Okay, what would it take for you guys to know and have something cool happen so you know the universe is loving, kind, generous, and supportive. Okay, so let's show some cool things up beyond your expectations, right? All right, chat for now, love you.

LESSON 23: Clearing Fear of Scarcity (Clearing Session Only)

Okay, so what would it take for all of you to manifest loads and loads of abundance for yourself, exceeding all your expectations more than you've ever hoped to achieve, bypassing any of your beliefs, and any of you not open to receiving this kind of abundance and quality of life, we ask that all of that stuff be deleted as well. All right, so let's connect to the light, you guys. Okay, so close your eyes, and obviously if you're driving, please don't close your eyes. Okay, so take your energy up 300 feet above you. See, sense, feel, believe, imagine that you are connected to the light. And imagine that this light forms a beam of light and just comes straight into your crown. And today's about sharing energy. So we're going to ask this beam of light to start helping you feel the energy of generosity, of abundance, of love, of plenty, of more than enough. So we're going to ask this light to come into your crown, opening all the knowing centers up so that you can know, see, believe, feel, and feel all your abundance and generosity. Asking the light to come through your throat so you can communicate the truth of who you are, which is you are an abundant, creational being by nature. You are a creator being who creates abundance in your life. Okay, asking the light to come into your heart, opening you up so you can feel the energy of this abundance and generosity and more than enough and power. Okay, asking this light to come into your solar plexus, opening up any nervousness, fear, anxiety, washing it away so you can feel who you truly are embodied in the energy of abundance. Asking this light to go into your power centers, opening up all the places where you feel a little disempowered. Moving you to the place where you can feel abundance, feel generosity, feel spirit moving through you. Opening up all your channels to receive all your abundance better than you ever expect. Yes, knowing that you deserve it in all ways. Asking this light to come into your roots so you're rooted in the new reality. The brand new reality. That you are completely different than you were yesterday. You're completely different than you were five years ago. You're completely different in your reality field because now you're in the reality field called abundance, plenty, more than enough. Everything you ask for shows up for you. Okay, asking the quality of life to increase. Okay, ask this light to connect to the center of the planet where it feels the happiest, the light, the most light, the most loved. Ask this light in the center of the planet to bounce straight back up into your body. Moving all the way up into your heart, radiating out your heart like a great central sun, 360 degrees all the way around. Ask this light to expand 10 feet all the way around you, filling your whole field with the energy of generosity, abundance, plenty, more than enough, ease, lots of happiness, lots of love, lots of things are taken care of. Okay, cool. Okay, ask this light to get bigger than the building you're in. filling the space with abundance, generosity, a magnet for more than enough to show up in your life. Ask this light to expand past the city you're in, connecting to all the people in it, asking them to bring you everything it is that you are asking for and ask that you can be of service to them, bringing you, bringing your gifts to them as well. And they happily and easily will pay you in exchange for that. Ask this light to connect to everybody in your state. Asking that anybody in your state who can happily receive service from you show up. Asking that you gift them the gift of abundance back. Ask this light to expand past the country you're in. Connecting to all the people in it. Asking those that would happily be a part of your abundance creation. your new way of life your new way of living your happy happily ever after whatever that is for you we're going to ask those people to show up in your life and we're going to ask you to send a lot of blessings to them right now and ask them to show up now okay asking the light to expand past the planet earth connecting to everybody on the planet earth sending them love and light asking them to find you and give you money and you will happily and easily gift them something in return as well It could be energy. It could be time. It could be you just being you. Okay, whatever that means to you. Okay, and let's just ask that again, that all your expectations increase, that everything shows up this week exactly how you want it, completely and totally aligned, better than you could have ever dreamed of, connecting you to all the future abundance that you want in the future. We're going to ask that to just show up now. Let's ask it to show up now. So just say abundance, come to me. Everything on my vision board, come to me. Everything I always wanted and dreamed and desired in my life, show up now. Kind of affirm gently that I am an excellent receiver of all my abundance. I'm an excellent receiver of all my blessings. I'm an excellent receiver. I can handle it all now. Bring it on. Bring it to me. With a lot of ease and fun and laughter and happiness and joy and celebration. Okay. So today, we're going to fill you guys up a lot today. So today is a filler -up day, all right? So are you generous or are you stingy? Okay, so any of you guys who have some stinginess, maybe in treating certain members of your family, certain parts of your life, taking care of your body, taking care of your finances, whatever that is, okay, anywhere you're stingy with yourself, will you uncreate and delete that across all time, dimensions, space, and reality? So what are you guys stingy in? Everywhere you're stingy with your time, everything that is, will you uncreate and delete it all? And the reason I'm bringing this question up, I'll give you guys a bigger picture. If you're stingy, that somewhere means that you don't think you have enough or that the universe isn't generous. Okay, so if you have an over -lighting belief that the universe is generous, you'll usually be generous. Okay, so anywhere you guys think that there's not enough in the world for you. And there's only a small portion for you. Everything that is, will you uncreate all that across all time, dimensions, space, and reality? How many places are you guys limiting how much time and effort you put into your life? And you're stingy with letting your life be fully in you. Okay, everything that is, uncreate it all. So you think of what it would be like if you guys were totally in your power, right? So what would it be like for you guys to be totally in your power, radiating generosity, knowing that the universe will happily bring back to you that which you emanate? Okay, it's about filling your body and your being with so much love that you're like a magnet that attracts more and more to you. Okay, so just think about that. And everywhere you're unwilling to do that, will you please uncreate and delete all that across all time, space, and reality? Any of you that are stingy with money, So stingy with money with yourself, with other people, with your kids, with your family. Okay, everything that is, uncreate and delete it all. Anywhere you like to heckle yourself on a daily basis and talk down to yourself and badger yourself and make yourself wrong and beat yourself up, that's kind of stingy with love, right? You're not really being very gracious and loving to yourself. So everything that is, will you uncreate and delete all that across all time, dimension, space, and reality? okay so let's see everywhere you tend to hold on to grudges okay so everywhere you're holding undergrudges uncreate and delete all that across all time dimension space reality everywhere you guys are kind of like holding back and seeing the big picture, you know, kind of getting the download here for a minute that, you know, if you're willing to be bigger than all your problems, and filled with so much life and so much zest and so much, you know, celebration, what happens is more and more and more and more of that comes to you. But if you're filled with kind of negative whiny complaining kind of energy, right, like, oh, this doesn't work, I'm such a shit, you know, what's wrong with me, like all those kind of things, right? then obviously can you see how that energy would bring you back more of the same? Okay, so anywhere you guys do the whiny, complainy thing at any level, okay, uncreate and delete all that. Cross all time, dimension, space, and reality. What would it take for you guys to always know that just connecting to light can happen in two seconds? So if you're in the whiny, crabby thing, in two seconds, what would it take for you to just go uncreate and delete all that? Okay, so anywhere you're unwilling to do that for yourself and you live in the energy of the feeling that you are a flawed human being, will you uncreate and delete all that? How many of you guys think you're flawed? All the things that are wrong with you. So wherever you guys think you're flawed for whatever reason, let's uncreate and delete all that across all time, dimensions, space, and reality. How many other places do you guys think you're flawed? Uncreate and delete all that across all time, dimensions, space, and reality. How many core beliefs do you guys have that align you with the energy of I am flawed? Yes, uncreate and delete all that across all time, dimension, space, and reality. How many of you hate your life at some level? And you might not want to admit it, but you hate your life. Okay, so everything that is, will you uncreate and delete all that across all time, dimension, space, and reality? So how many of you guys are stingy with how much time you spend with other people? Maybe you need some love from people and you're not letting yourself have it. Okay, everything that is, will you uncreate and delete all that across all time, dimensions, space, and reality? Everywhere you're stingy with wiring yourself to believe that you can have everything you want. Okay, everything that is, will you uncreate and delete all that across all time, dimensions, space, and reality? So anywhere you guys are unkind to yourself by giving more than you receive, okay, uncreate and delete all that. Everything you give and gift in the world that you give and gift of you, what would it take for you to receive all that energy back a thousandfold? So everywhere you guys worry too much about the little things, about how much you spend on clothing or food or time, all that stuff, uncreate and delete it all. Okay, so everywhere the real problem is you're stingy with yourself, uncreate and delete all that. Everywhere you're generous to other people because maybe you want love and approval and not so generous with yourself and a hubby, uncreate and delete all that. Okay, everywhere you get blamed for everything that goes wrong in the world, uncreate and delete all that. Everywhere it's not fair and right and good, uncreate and delete it all. And any pattern that you created in your life that made that manifest for you, including your mom's patterns, uncreate and delete all those, and your dad's patterns, uncreate and delete all those. Anywhere else you guys think you have flaws, uncreate and delete all that. All right. Okay, so everywhere you let your spouse control how much you give to yourself, uncreate and delete all that. Cross all time to intense faith and reality. So everywhere you guys won't fill it with life, but you kind of give but resent it at the same time. Okay, any of you doing that, will you uncreate and delete all that? Okay, so any of you guys thinking that the world is going to attack you and you should hide from it? Okay, everything that is, will you uncreate and delete all that across all time, dimensions, space, and reality? How many of you think the world is unfair and unkind to you? So you don't want to show up for it. Okay, everything that is, will you uncreate and delete all that across all time, dimensions, space, and reality? Everywhere you're feeling inadequate or I am not enough. Oh, I'm going to clear this one. Everywhere you guys are givers and not takers because, again, generosity means you also receive generous energy, right? You give generous energy and you receive generous energy simultaneously. Okay, so anywhere you guys are givers but not takers, because you have to be both. Okay, what would it take for you guys to be an amazing taker? And everything in the way of that, will you uncreate and delete all that? What would it take for you guys to be an amazing taker? Yes, everything in the way of that, will you uncreate and delete all that? Anywhere being generous with people makes you dependent on them, or they might want more later on. Everything that is, will you uncreate that across all time -based dimensions and realities? Okay, so Marsha, anywhere you bought into the whole thing, the economy is broken. Uncreate and delete all that across all time, dimension, space, and reality. Okay, what would it take for the economy to be generous? So anywhere you guys have like bought into the reality that you don't have any control over it, because the point I brought up with that is you do have control over the economy at some level if you're willing to take some sort of action that adds to the economy. Okay, so everything in the way of that, uncreate and delete it all. Everywhere you guys react with your hubby, your kids, and your family, everything that is, will you uncreate and delete all that? Everywhere you have a pattern where you give people a lot and then you get imbalanced because they become dependent on you. Everything that is, will you uncreate and delete all that for yourselves? Okay, so any of you guys who are avoiding people, hanging out, hiding your gifts and talents and shielding yourself, because if you're hiding your gifts and talents and shielding yourselves, you're not going to get paid as much money. Okay, so everything that is, will you uncreate and delete it all? People usually bring money to you, right? So if you want to create abundance. You have to be willing to be seen and heard at some level. So any of you guys unwilling to be seen and heard at some level and therefore you don't get paid, everything that is, will you uncreate and delete all that across all time to mention space and reality? Okay, so everywhere you guys don't love yourself enough, uncreate and delete all that across all time to mention space and reality. What would it take for you guys to feel the energy of love?

I'm generous to me. I love me. All your energy changed. I love it. Okay, everywhere you guys have a hard time letting other people help you, will you uncreate and delete all that too?

All the stuff that you guys have going on in your body that you don't want to let go of, that you want to label and name and make real and make persistent and keep it and label it. Okay, all that stuff, will you guys uncreate and delete it all across all time, dimension, space, and reality? The more you label it, the more it wants to stay. Why don't you just call it this interesting thing that wants to go away right now? Okay, so everywhere you guys won't let go of the interesting things in your body because you want to play with them, will you uncreate and delete all those across all time, dimensions, space, and reality?

Feel inside and think about going into the future. Do you guys feel a thousand percent comfortable that you can make any amount of money that you would ever truly want to make?

And hopefully that's now. But what is your picture, feeling, and thought about being abundant? Like, what are you wearing? Who are you with? Have you paid off your credit card bills? Do you have a million bucks in the bank? Now, everybody's picture is going to be a little different. For you, it might be, you know, your next step, which is maybe getting out of credit card debt.

LESSON 24: Attracting Wealth for Just Being You

- Hey, this is Christie Marie Sheldon, and you're listening to a recording I did of a series of 24 live group sessions on clearing your abundance blocks. And here's what we're covering today, session 24. Today, I'll teach you how to find some new talents and skills. Often hidden, we can be blocked because we shut off our talents. So, what if you could get paid for being you . Now that's a great job. Next we'll clear the blocks to any future talents showing up for you. You can always open the door to these new skills, and it opens up more fun, more evidence that the universe supports you, and more playtime opens up more financial success. Multi-universal beings , otherwise called "you," have more than one talent. So, we're also going to lift the shroud of energy covering your talents and contribution to the planet. What if you sharing you is the greatest gift you can give all of us? And what if you could get paid being that? So, let's begin. Hey, welcome, welcome. Today is so exciting. Day 24. I'm going to miss you guys. So, congratulations on hanging in there, and doing the work for yourself, and opening up to change, and all those beautiful things that you guys did. Today, let's set one more intent, okay, for what you hope to achieve today. What do you hope to achieve tonight? What is the final thing that you just really want to shift, no matter what it takes? Let's just put an energy into your future, so, over the next three months, let's set one more intent for you guys. So, whatever you want to achieve in the next three months, push that energy forward. Ooh. I can feel that. I love it. You guys are amazing at connecting now. Okay. So, my favorite part of the night, inspiring stories, and we have a couple of doozies. Okay. So, Anne emailed for the very first time, and she had a really cool story. She said she's finally coming out of her financial funk, and here are a few positive things that were flowing her way. So, she got free VIP tickets to a four-day conference in LA worth $3,995. She also won, she said, some free tickets to some shows. I don't know what that is, but she won some tickets to some shows. She's very impressed at how happy and light she feels. So, she feels happier and lighter, but listen to the cool thing that happened. She has like these real estate, these rental retail centers that she owns. And, you know, with the economy, some things have been left open, these leased spaces, for like nine months. For her, that was digging into the kitty bank, and the piggy bank , digging into the kitty, and she didn't want to do that anymore. So, you know, they were freaking out what to do, like, let go of the properties, keep the properties? What are they going to do? And if they let go of 'em, they'd lose money. So, she began the program with the one intention to get both of these retail spaces filled up with profitable clients. She was guided to change the brokers, and she just leased two spaces, one being their biggest space, which they had leased at a good price for a 10-year period. So, over the space of the contract, this will bring in over a million dollars in revenue. So, good job, Anne. So, I know for some of you, you're like, "I don't have real estate like that," but the thing is, imagine how much she was dipping into her pocket, trying to keep them overboard, right. They had a really big mortgage. So, Roman, from Seattle, wrote to tell me how positive things have been flowing his way since he started Unlimited Abundance Journey. He got a new job, which provided $5,000 signing bonus, and a $96,000-a-year salary. Good job, Roman. I love it. On top of that, he has three other offers on the table. So, he has an abundance of offers. He's repaired his strained relationship with his parents. He found a nice apartment in Seattle that he's currently moving into. He realized his relationships with women haven't been serving him, and he finally feels free and ready to move past some of the old issues. And he had a breakthrough realization about what's been holding him back in his development as a guitarist. So, good job, Roman. Lene's husband was diagnosed with cancer three years ago, and with all the treatments, surgeries, threw him in a, obviously a financial crisis, and she said, she's depressed, was depressed. She said her zest for living has returned. She's like, that's priceless to her. Decluttered her home, which, again, was like priceless, 'cause everything, cancer and stuff like that, basically she's been in stress mode for three years, right. When she cleaned out her house, she found two $100 gift certificates that she'd forgotten about. Took the time to sit down and work out a financial plan to get them out of debt. Asked what would it take to get our medical bills lowered? The very next day, the hospital called out of the blue, offered them a lower payment plan without her even asking, and cutting their monthly payment in half with no interest. Signed up for social security, and in October will receive an extra $800 a month. Asked what would it take to receive $5,000 in 30 days, and the very next day , I love these stories, she got a letter from the social security office informing her of a retirement account in her husband's name that he had forgotten about, and was worth $6,984.50. So, it was more than the 5,000 she had requested. So, good job, Lene. Today, ooh, let's connect to the light first. Let's close your eyes for a minute. And if you're driving, obviously do not close your eyes. Connect to the light 300 feet above your head, okay, so you sense or feel your connection to source energy, and know that you are part of it, and it is part of you. Okay. So, let's open to opening up your talents today, okay. Today we're going to open up your talents. Okay. So, let the light come into your crown, opening up any latent skills and talents that you want to get paid for, so that you know what to do, how to do it, and how to get paid, and are always guided. Ask the light to come in, opening up your true awareness, your hearing, your sight, your knowing, so that you know where and how to get paid for your talents. Okay, ask the light to come through your voice, through your throat, so that you speak the truth about who you are, what you're about, what your talents are, and how your light can shine in other people's lives, and help them, and get paid for it. Ask this light to come through your heart, opening up your heart to your heart-felt talents, your heart-felt guided actions to take in implementing strategies to make sure you get paid on your talents. Ask the light to come into your solar plexus, releasing any nervousness, any disdain for yourself, and anything that would block you from moving forward. Ask the light to come into your power center, opening up anywhere you feel less than powerful about using your talents and anywhere you really just won't proclaim, "Hey, I am an amazing, super abundant, completely talented being, who can make anything happen." Ask the light to come into your root, so you're rooted in the knowledge that you can go forward and manifest anything you truly desire, and nothing's really blocked, it's just all an illusion, and you can delete and uncreate the illusion, and create and generate another one. Ask the light to come through your feet into the center of the ground. All right. So, connect to the place in the middle of the planet, where it feels really, really happy, really conscious, really light, really filled with source. Ask this light to bounce back up like a mini trampoline, straight up into your heart, and ask this light to radiate from your heart 360 degrees all the way around like a great central sunshine, radiating out about 15 feet all the way around your field, filling your field with the ability to know, see, and hear, and get paid for whatever your talents are. Ask this light to expand out past the building you're in. Yes. Fill the space that you live and work in with the energy of, "I am super talented. I know how to get paid. I'm always guided." All right. Ask this light to fill in all the spaces in your town. So, radiate out past your city, your town, using this field of light to call in anybody who could happily use your talents, and pay you a lot of money for it. Ask this light that you can be of great service, heartfelt service, really, really connecting to people's heart, giving them what they deserve as well, which is great, abundant service, better than they've ever expected, so that they always want to do business with you again. Ask this light to radiate past your state, so that you connect to anybody else in the state who wants to know about you, hear about you, and use your talents, so they can receive your love, and you can receive their love. Ask this light to radiate past the country you're in, connecting to everybody that needs your services, use your talents, that recognize you, give you energy back, and you give them energy back. Okay. Asking the light to connect to anybody on Planet Earth, radiate the light all the way around Planet Earth, connecting to anybody and anything who needs your services, need your talents, need your skills, and you can happily and easily receive abundance and payment for it. All right. Awesome. How much is your talent worth? So, hopefully you guys have a piece of paper. I want you to write down right now, and then share some of these, like type 'em in to the control panel, type in some of your talents, your skills, and your know-hows, and what you can contribute to somebody's life. For instance, maybe some of you know how to heal. Maybe some of you are great advice-givers. Maybe you have a great mate, great husband, a great wife. You know the love thing. You have it down pat. Maybe you could help people with that. Maybe you're an excellent caregiver. Maybe you know how to build structures, and business, or good customer service, or any of those things. Maybe some of you guys are excellent organizers. Yeah. How many of you are great at teaching people how to meet a mate, or raise incredible kids, or get a great body? And I'm going to ask you to just be a little silly for a minute. And I want you to just list all the silly little talents that you don't think are, it could be like anything from juggling to, whatever it is. 'Cause you know what, who knows? You could get YouTube famous, right? And then get lots of people interested in what you do. All right. So, some people are good at calming and reassuring people, right? So you're connecting to their heart. Some people are good at teaching. We're going to ask you to dig a little deeper. So, everywhere you guys don't think you have any talents to contribute. So, I want you to think, what are you really good at? Are you good at being nice to people, so you'd be excellent in some sort of customer care? Are you good at talking to people? Are you getting good at seeing what somebody needs before they know they need it? Are you great with animals? Writing, painting, creating songs, feeling motivating and inspiring. Great listener. Yeah. Good organizer. How to be creative. Yeah. Okay. So, any of you guys who like your first instinct was, "I don't have any talent or skill"? Okay. So, everything that is, leave it all. Anybody listening, maybe, are you good at dressing? Are you good at fashion? Are you good at makeup? I mean, what about the YouTube sensation, I forget her name, but she makes six figures 'cause she does all these makeup videos, and then people join her, and then she puts advertising on the YouTube, right? So, just because of a little makeup skills, and I think she's Asian, she makes six figures, right? Yeah, are you good at reading people, knowing what's up? Okay. Any other place where you guys can't even think of one talent? Okay. Everything that is, want you guys to uncreate and delete it all. And any of you kind of blocked on this, I'm going to ask you to go ask five of your friends, or maybe your mom and dad, what you're really good at. Wedding planning. Yeah. Contributes excitement and advice, so that they can enjoy their day. Business coaching. Great listener, can read energy. Life coach, teacher, educator, organizer, pet loss grief counselor, good, photographer, coaching people how to negotiate. Wow. That's a cool talent. Brilliant and engaging speaker and presenter. Good. Healer, coach, yoga teacher. If any of you are blocked, just think back to what was really fun to you when you were a kid. So, for instance, Grace loves to cook and clean, and be a great wife. A great nurse. Love it. Listener, teacher. Good at being silly. Good at stories. All right. Knowing how to teach how to use body energy to enhance life. Good. A good listener. Good psychic advice. Gardening. Can grow any plant. Babies adore her. Good. Good sense of humor, that'll go far, right? Can do energy healing, and I can also be a singer. Good. Awesome at customer service. A healer, cook, cleaner, wife, and mother. Cleaning person. Okay, cool. So, now, I'm going to just do a couple more clearings here. Karen says she's able to spot the diamond in a pile of junk. I love it. That's a good trait. It's like looking for the possibilities in everything, right? How many of you are good at seeing the possibilities in everything, or seeing how to make money in the middle of anything? All right. So, now we're going to go to the next section. Now, all your talents that you listed, how much would somebody pay you for this talent? Okay. And I'm going to force you guys to label it. So, break down each talent. So, some of you put, "I'm good at using my imagination and creating things." All right. So, think of something you could contribute to somebody, right? Everybody think of one of the things that you said you're really good at. Now, I want you to ask, just intuitively, if you had to put a price in dollars on that to how much somebody would pay you for that, how much would somebody pay you for that, if you could figure out a creative way to market it? Okay. So did any of you guys get a surprising answer? Okay. So, let's see. Some of you got, 300,000 per year with your talent. Hey, maybe you guys can, when you type 'em in, just put how much it is, and what you were doing. So, then we can kind of like all share. Therapist, $100 an hour. Healer. Okay. $300 an hour.

I actually wish they would, somebody would teach little kids how to do that, right? I mean, think of what the confidence you could build if you could teach any little kid how to make friends so they never have to feel lonely again, right? Okay. More than what I'm currently charging, is what Margaret got. Good. How to heal people by a start clearing for 30 to 50 an hour. Okay. Good. Surprised by your answers. So, Karen, why are you surprised by your answer? Gail says by getting projects implemented she made 500K in her last corporate job, so she's hoping the 200K is for one client only, and that she has five of them. Good job. Okay. Cool.

Okay, what would it take for whatever numbers you guys came up with, what would it take for them to triple? Okay, and everything in the way of that, uncreate and delete it all. Okay. Everything in the way of you guys going forward taking massive, massive action, and connecting the dots to make it happen, uncreate and delete all that across all time, dimension, space, and reality. How many of you are not listening to your guidance, and are procrastinating? Okay. Everything that is, will you uncreate and delete all that across all time, dimension, space, and reality? How many of you don't have a clue how to get paid for something that you really want to love to do? Okay. Everything that is, will you uncreate and delete all that across all time, dimension, space, and reality? How many of you are pretending that you don't know how to do it, in order to stay stuck? Uncreate and delete all that. Okay. How many places? So, Sheila, how many places are you stopping yourself? It's because you think you have to know it all, so you... You have a weird belief. Let me see what it is. You don't know it all, but you think you know it all, which is blocking any new awareness. I know it sounds really funny. Okay. So, any of you guys having anything going on where you think that, it's going to sound kind of funny, but if you think you know it all, sometimes it doesn't leave an energy or a space for something new to show up. Okay. Okay. So, anywhere you're afraid to know the answer, afraid to know the truth, afraid to hear something different than what you truly want, so, you're blocking it at any level, uncreate and delete it all. And everywhere you grew up, and you guys were told that you were so wrong, and so pathetic, when you grew up, like you were somehow wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong. Okay. Everything that is, will you uncreate all that? How many of you feel that you're wrong, so you can't get an answer? Uncreate and delete all that. Okay. Any other place where you guys are limiting how much money you can connect to? Okay. So, Sheila, what I'm going to ask you to do is just kind of make it up, if you could really just put what you want. If you don't get a direct answer, just put what you want to make. Okay. 'Cause you're an infinite being. You can generate whatever you want. Okay. So, everything in the way of you guys generating what you want, uncreate and delete all that. Yeah. There, okay. Everywhere love is not going to help you, or love in the past never helped you, so, if you love what you do, it won't work. Okay. So, anywhere you guys took a hit on something you love, uncreate and delete it all. Anywhere in the past you were stopped doing something that was really, truly your gift and talent, and you stopped yourself. Or somebody has stopped you. Maybe your parents stopped you. Okay. Everything that is, will you uncreate and delete it all? Any of you guys who wanted to go to school for a certain thing, and then your parents told you you couldn't, or maybe you didn't have the money to do it, and you stopped yourself, uncreate and delete all that, across all time, dimension, space, and reality. Any other business idea that a spouse, or a mate, or anyone in particular talked you out of that you knew you should have went and did, uncreate and delete all that across all time, dimension, space, and reality. Everywhere you think you need like some huge education, or you're not professionally trained, uncreate and delete all that, across all time, dimension, space, and reality. What if the fact that you're not professionally trained actually allows you to see other possibilities that somebody who is professionally trained might not see? Like, what if you could come up with a better system, because you're not bogged into that way that everybody else does it? And maybe because you don't do it the same way, and you approach it differently, maybe people will pay you more. So, anywhere you think that because your education, you're not educated, it limits you, uncreate and delete all that. And anywhere it's truly guided that you need more education and you're stopping yourself uncreate and delete all that. All right. Energy healing, 1,000 an hour. Integrative MD, 400 bucks an hour. 200 bucks. Psychotherapy. Love it. Okay. Anywhere these prices are way too high for Canadian clients, everything that is, uncreate and delete it all. There's always a niche of people. I know wealthy people, and if something's good, they'll pay anything for it, if they really love it. Okay. Everything that is, uncreate and delete all that. All right. Telling my story. 500K or more. All right. Informative articles online, 1,000 a year, or more. Okay. Everything in the way of that, uncreate it all. Okay, baking cakes. All right. Margaret's saying, "I'm currently charging 97 an hour, but what came up was 1,000 an hour." So, she says, "I already feel 97 was a lot. How can I ask for 1,000?" It's about packaging, Margaret. Anything is about packaging. You just have to package it so that enough people want it at 1,000. So, it's about packaging. So, start thinking about packaging that price. I had one of these friends who's a business consultant. And he said the most brilliant thing. He goes, "Decide how much you want to charge, and then build the package around that. Don't like build the package and then decide how much it's worth, right." So, John, your mom is in the way. Your mom's energy somehow stopped you and misguided you, so you don't trust you all the time. So, you got some stuff with women. Okay. Uncreate and delete all that across all time, dimension, space, and reality. Okay. So, if you guys feel like there's an education, maybe it's true, authentic guidance that you need more education, so, if that's true, why don't you think of a plan right now of how long it'll take. So, if any of you guys really, really, really, truly need more education, how long will it take you to get it? Okay. So, everything in the way of you guys actually just doing it, uncreate and delete all that. Okay. Everywhere you guys procrastinate, because the answer's too simple, and you want to complicate it. So, Colleen, I think you want to complicate it, instead of just making it easy. So, anywhere you guys want to complicate it, and create some confusion, create a little drama in front of you so that you don't have to actually just go for it, uncreate and delete it all, and anywhere that's what your parents did, they created some drama in front of you, so you learned how to be a human being like that, uncreate and delete all that. Okay. So, anywhere you guys have a self-esteem issue, where you're afraid to ask people for how much money you just came up with, so, I want you guys think for a minute of whatever your number is. I want you to imagine that there's, like your customer avatar in front of you, okay. So, it's the ideal client, and/or it's the ideal client. So, you know if you have hundreds of clients, I want you to picture the ideal client, so that's your customer avatar, okay. I want you to ask that avatar, that customer, ask them if you want to make 500,000 that year, or 20,000, or whatever it is from them, $1,000 an hour. Ask that person for that much money, and then see them saying, "Yes, I will happily do that." Okay. So, whatever your customer avatar, think of them. Okay. And say to yourself, "I'm brave enough to ask for this, and everything in the way of that, I uncreate it all. I'm courageous enough to ask for this," and everything in the way of that, uncreate and delete it all. "I can deliver how much this is worth to them," everything in the way of that, uncreate and delete it all. "I'm powerful enough to generate this in my life," uncreate and delete it all. "And I'm powerful enough to be guided to see how I have to package myself in order to make this happen." Everything in the way of that, uncreate and delete all that too. If you never knew what you're good at, then what you're going to have to do is go find out. You know, when I went to the college, I mean, seriously, I went to college initially for finance, 'cause I thought, "Well, if I go to school for finance, at least I'll figure out money, and then I'll figure out how to make it." Along the way, it was a little boring to me. You know, I felt like there was some other bigger thing that I was supposed to do in the world, right? But, you know, I stuck with it, and I did what I needed to do, 'cause sometimes you need foundation that's pretty strong. You know, what happened is, life guided me to all the people, places, things, ideas, and events that opened me up to the next thing in my life, which is what I'm doing right now, which is what I love. But if I hadn't had all those experiences with money, and manifesting, and abundance, and all those things, I don't think I would have been as in tune with people of how to help them get it, right. Okay. So, it just feels like, sometimes you have to live a little. So, write down, if some of you are blocked on what you are good at, why don't you just try some things, and see what you like about it? So, that's my suggestion. Like, live a little . You know, there are people every day who get paid to play. There are people who get paid to surf. There are people who make a living taking people on hikes. There's people who get paid a living taking people on adventure tours. So, not everything has to be boring. You know what I'm saying? Okay. So, all the stuff that's coming up for you guys that says, "Oh, I can't do it," including, "I don't know how to market, I don't know this. I don't know that. I don't know this." Everything that is, uncreate and delete at all. Okay. Good job. You guys really let that go. Okay. Because the thing is, is this is just your next step that's coming up. So, now you've got a true awareness of, "Oh, I can make that much money doing this." So, now your "What would it take," is, is, "What would it take for me to make this? And what would it take for me to have the exact know-how?" Okay. So, everything in the way of that, uncreate and delete it all. What would it take for you guys to have the exact know-how? Trevor's asking a question. He's saying he wants to do private placement programs. They're invitation only, create huge profits, but causes people's brains to close down, and not accept. So, the first thing I would do is before I actually met with anybody, I would always, always, always do, "What would it take for me to exactly know what this person needs to know, or hear from me, in order to say yes to this opportunity?" So, that's like the first thing I would do. And I'd meditate on what they need to hear in the middle of the sales process, right. The same thing if you guys are looking for another job, or talking to a client, you have to ask, "What does that person need from me that I can deliver? And then how do I need to communicate it in a way that they can receive it?" And if people's brains are closing down, then I would keep asking, "What's a better sales process?" So, if people don't understand things, you're right. Have you guys ever noticed that when you use big words, or if people don't really understand what you're saying, they shut down, in this energy healing business, sometimes people's eyes glaze over, right? So, I had to learn how to communicate in a way that the average, everyday folk could understand, right. That's why newspapers are written in fourth-grade language. So, think of, if you were explaining what you do to a fourth or fifth grader, how would you explain it to 'em? Okay. So, even if you think your clients are super, uber smart, I would still make it really simple. Okay. So, Lucy, so now that has come up with clients before. She's saying, "I live in a place where people, where the incomes are low." Okay. So, you have a couple of choices here. You can take your stuff online, where you can do it anywhere in the world, and you could create an online business, and then you're not subject to everybody that lives around you. You can move, if you really want like a certain kind of financial abundance that you might not be able to get there, you could do that. Or, you could just keep asking, "What would it take me to make, be the wealthiest person in town? What do I have to do in order to do that?" Right. And then just see what comes up from that. Now, you don't have to be the wealthiest person in town, but I would just think big and see what shows up. So, if you guys are having hard times getting certain clients at a certain price, you're going to have to work on, "What would it take for me to package it different? What would it take for me to explain it different, so that people so want what I have to give them?" You know, when you're selling people things, what they want is, they want an end result, right. They want lost weight. They want love. They want money, and they want it easy, right? Okay. So, everything that's blocking you guys from deciding that "I am an infinite being, and I can create enough energy around me to attract the right person, place, or thing that gives me the best advice to help me get paid more." Okay. Everything in the way of that, uncreate it and delete it all. Anywhere I am blocked in marketing, let's just say, I ask for a dream, a thought, an idea, or something that pushes you over the hump, so it makes it easy for you, and everything in the way of that, will you uncreate it all? So, Roman, everywhere you think men are more powerful than you, so, any of you guys who think that other people are more powerful than you, any of you who have that belief, uncreate and delete it all. And anywhere you think your mom and dad are still more powerful than you, uncreate it and delete it all, or anywhere you guys think a spouse is more powerful than you, uncreate and delete all that. Okay. So, I'm going to do this again. So, pick one more of your talents that's on that list. Okay. Anywhere you guys are stuck on the failures, and you're stuck on how much to charge, uncreate and delete it all. Okay. Pick one more thing. All right. So ask, "If I were to develop those talent and skill, and really, really get paid what I'm worth for it, how much would somebody pay me for it?" Okay. So, everything in the way of you guys knowing what to do with this information, uncreate and delete it all. So, now I want to ask one more question, while you're here. What are the first eight steps I have to take in order to get paid this amount? Some of you guys are freaking out 'cause I said eight steps, right? Okay. What are the eight steps? Pick one. Pick one step you could take to make it happen. Maybe it's research. Maybe it's putting up a website. Maybe it's calling two people. Maybe it's raising your prices. Okay. Sometimes if you, somebody is asking, "Why didn't I get this job interview?" 'Cause maybe there's a better one for you. Okay. So, I wouldn't get so hung up on it. Just look at it like a numbers game. So, everything in the way of you guys getting the job, or focusing on the failure. Okay. Uncreate and delete all that. All right. So, I'm going to just answer some of your questions that are coming up. Ivan wants to know, he feels good at helping people bridge the gap to get them from where they are to where they want to go. "How do I know I actually have a talent to do this?" We charge 150 bucks an hour. That's called coaching, Ivan. So . so decide what you want to coach people in. And do you want to coach 'em in business, health, love, relationships, any of the above? Yep. So, and then just ask, how could you meet new people that would happily pay you? So, you can go to self-improvement seminars and meet new people. You can go to meetup groups and meet new people. And when they ask what you do, just offer 'em a free consult and say, "Hey, you know, I help people get what they want in life. I'll do a free consultation with you, and see if it works for you." Terrance, what's blocking you is a decision to not know everything, because your mother didn't want you to know things. So, everywhere you guys are blocking yourself from knowing things, 'cause your mothers and fathers didn't want you to really know what was going on with them, so they blocked your intuition, uncreate and delete all that. Okay. Everywhere you refuse to see yourself doing something different that could make you a lot of money. Everywhere you guys are stuck on your identities so much. I want you guys to imagine that you were like so rich, like I'm talking Bill Gates rich for a minute, okay. So, just think of what it would be like to be Oprah rich, Bill Gates rich, Richard Branson rich, Donald Trump rich. Any of those people that inspire you. Now, try on one of your favorite people, and kind of feel what they feel about wealth. So, the first thing they feel about wealth is it's easy. Now, you have to understand, Oprah never had days off, really. You know what I'm saying? Like, she sort of had days off, but you know, for the last, however many years she did it, I don't know, I think it's 20, 30 years of doing it, she had to show up every week at the studio. So, it was kind of quote, quote, I don't want to say "hard work," 'cause she loved it, but she did have to show up in her life, right . 'Cause if she didn't show up, TV shows weren't going to get shot. So, any of you guys who think that, "Oh, I just don't want to do it," and you're kind of like letting yourself off the hook, instead of pushing yourself a little bit, uncreate and delete all that. Yeah. So, if you guys don't like the phrasing that I'm using, I did this about talent and skills, 'cause some people don't think they can get paid on their talent and skill, and the thing that they love. Use whatever phrasing, Carmen, makes you happy. If it's, "Get paid for being me," you can do that. Okay. Everywhere you guys want to get out of this and not do it, 'cause now you have awareness. Now you can't stay stuck anymore, right, 'cause now you have something new, and any of you guys that are shooting it all down, and going, "Oh, I can't do it. That'll never happen. This is crazy. Why would my higher self tell me to do this?" Okay. Everything that is, uncreate and delete it all. So, sometimes people get a little overwhelmed, 'cause they think they're supposed to be doing something big, and not that you have to do something small, but start focusing on what you love, Carolyn, and then maybe the big thing comes out of that. How can you charge to write eulogies? Actually, I know somebody who has a website that has a list of marriage proposals, full of all the things that people don't know how to write, and he's figured out a way to make money off of that, through, I think Google AdWords, and I think people then pay him to privately write those things. I don't think that's a bad idea, JC. I know somebody who makes money doing that. Maybe you can expand it, not just to eulogies, but maybe to weddings, and all sorts of other things. Write people's speeches. Okay. Now, Adriana has something that's common. Sometimes people have many talents, so they don't know where to focus. I once made a list of all the ways I could make money, and it was a pretty big list. I can think of a lot of ways I could go make money, but you just have to pick one that inspires you in the moment, and just follow that. Okay. So, Sarah, that's your answer, then, whatever you feel good about, do that. Okay. Margaret's excited. She sees what her next step is. Okay. So, Sarah, you're going to have to ask, what would it take to make a lot of money doing it? Okay. So, Janie's going to write some books. A breeze in the middle of your chest is probably, it just feels like your heart's opening to accept the download. A pinch in your chest is you're trying to stop yourself, Sarah, okay. Amy had a realization she's been resisting what would it take, 'cause she didn't want to be like her brother. Okay. Everywhere you guys are afraid people won't love you if you're really successful, uncreate and delete all that. John, I answered your question. Weirdly enough, your money blocks are about your mother. So, somehow your mother talked you out of doing what you wanted to do, and you don't think it's possible to change your situation at some deep level, okay? So, there's a place where you don't think you can change. Everywhere you guys don't think you can change, uncreate and delete it all. And any of you guys have mom and dad karma still that's blocking you, so, anything unhealed with mom and dad that somehow sabotages you, and makes you stop yourself, 'cause you still want them to love you, even if being small, it makes them love you, okay? Uncreate and delete all that. Anywhere you guys are staying small so you can have your parent love you. Anywhere that's your foundation, uncreate and delete all that. All right. Party clowns. That'd be fun. Getting paid for painting. Problem-solver. Love it, Wanda. Channel herself to people personally. Love it. Meditation and life coaching, love it. Real estate transactions, 10 a year. Love it. So, Jenny, that means you're going to go out and meet new people, right, so people love you, and they want to give you their property, knowing that you will totally take care of it. Sharon's saying her intuition's telling her she can make 200,000 a month . Wanda, why don't you guys just get out there and just do it. Everywhere you guys just won't take any of those eight steps that you kind of got a download of. Now, if you didn't hear every eighth step, you've still got the download of it, so, anywhere you guys are blocking that knowingness and download of it, uncreate and delete it all. But basically, at the end of the day, the next step is usually meet more people who will pay you. Right? So, how can you guys meet more people who will pay you? That's the question. What would it take for you guys to meet a lot of people who will pay you? Okay. And everything in the way of that, uncreate it all. Errol, what would it take for you to generate a lot of people coming to pay you? Everything in the way of that, uncreate and delete all that. Okay. Elizabeth, energy. Your father is blocking you somehow. Age 11, age six, and age five. Everywhere you guys don't think you're worth enough, uncreate and delete all that, across all time, dimension, space, and reality. Okay, Lucy. Just ask your higher self right now, just tune in, what would be the one skill you should focus on right now that would make you the most amount of money with the most amount of fun, with the most amount of lightness? Everything that is, uncreate it all. Everywhere you don't feel like you deserve to get paid for your talent, uncreate and delete it all. Everywhere you guys think that people oppose you. You know what I mean? Like if your parents were kind of critical, then you might think, "Oh, people don't like me." So, any of you guys who have the belief, the thought, the feeling, the idea, that people don't like you, or that you don't like people, uncreate and delete all that. Okay, good. So, Grace, what you do, Grace is asking a question, "How do you be consistent with showing up and getting it done, especially if you're tired?" Well, the first thing you do, is you take a little vacation when you need it. Okay. But the second thing you do is, "What would it take for my energy to be light, and for this to be easy?" And then just focus on one thing a day. Okay. Like, just say, "What is one thing I can do today that will bring me closer to my goal?" And don't focus on 20 things, 'cause that can be overwhelming, and tiring, but just focus on one thing. One thing a day that's closer to your goal. One thing. Okay. And everything in the way of that, uncreate and delete it all. So, your little motto, your little sticky note, is, "What is my one thing today that I can do that can improve my life?" So, Sarah, for some reason you like not knowing things, so everywhere you're pretending to not know, for whatever reason, uncreate and delete all of that. All right. So, you guys are answering some really cool things. Like people are rebranding themselves at higher prices, going to galleries. Some people are playing in nature, fishing, organizing. Love it. Solving problems. Love it. Pranic healing. Love it. Okay. So, Shereen just had an idea. She used to teach a lot of classes at her old job, and coach people on workspace organization. She could, yeah, you could start a blog. Why don't you start a blog about some really cool workspace organization, and maybe people will pay you to organize their whole companies? That would be awesome. And then you could even bring in your whole energy thing. You know, bring in the whole energy part of it. Wouldn't it be cool if offices were set up where everybody had good energy? Love it. Hey, so, at the end, I'm going to ask you to just pick something. At the end of the day, you can ruminate, and ruminate, and ruminate, but what would it take for you guys to just pick one thing? For a little while, get good at that, get some money with that, and keep it going, and/or pick another thing and get that, and then you can do, you won't have to be bored, you can have multiple streams of income. Yeah, so, Colleen, no, I always thought at some level I was supposed to do something big. I mean, I kind of actually really did think that when I was a kid, I had this awareness that nothing made sense, and I'm supposed to fix it , which is kind of funny. But anyway, it feels if you feel that, that would be accurate, but you have to start somewhere. So, I didn't let the bigness of it, see, sometimes the bigness of it stops you, 'cause you always worry about the bigness of it. So, what if you just decide, "How can I help 100 people right now?" And once you figure out how to help 100 people, then you'll know, from that one thing that you're doing, what works, what doesn't, and then you'll know how to go help 100,000 people, right? Okay. So, just start with the thing that helps 100 people, and then branch out from there. Okay. So, body twitching is just releasing. All right. Raising your rates fills your stomach with butterflies. Amber, could that be excitement? What if that's excitement? Don't make a wrongness out of it. Feels exciting. "Why do I feel tired about money?" 'Cause you don't like having to think about money. So, somebody brainwashed you to not think about money. Like, "I'm a girl. I don't want to think about money." Everything that is, delete all that. Anxiousness is just the energy stirring up so you can clear it. So, Grace, you don't have to be in the middle of the physical fitness with them. You could just coach them to lose the weight, right? Let's go to the next one. What person, or type of person, would happily and easily pay you for the skills? So, pick one of your things, and ask what type of person would happily and easily pay for your skills? So, everywhere you guys would let fear stop you, I mean, seriously, fear is just the pattern, so, everywhere you would let the pattern called fear, which is really just a pattern, it's like energy, it's just nothing. Do you know what I'm saying? So, everywhere you guys would let those silly little nothing energy patterns stop you from being your greatest self, will you uncreate and delete it all? Anywhere you guys would rather listen to the monkey mind, your excuses, and your patterns, instead of listening to your heart, your higher part of your being, and just say, "Hey, my true awareness is I can go make a million dollars this year. That's my true psychic awareness. Everything in the way of that, I'm going to delete it all. And I'm not going to listen to all the other stuff that's going to come up and argue with me. I'm going to just delete everything that comes up and argues with me." So, when you guys got these numbers, and then you decided, "Oh, I can't do it." Okay. Everything that is, will you uncreate and delete it all? Everywhere you're arguing with yourself, which is really just these patterns. It's just patterns. It's nothing. Okay. Everything that is, uncreate and delete it all. Everywhere your illusion and delusion is stopping you from going and creating the big bucks, uncreate and delete all that, across all time, dimension, space, and reality. All right. So anywhere you guys bought anybody else's point of view that you're nothing, uncreate it and delete it all. Anywhere else you bought anybody else's point of view that what you do you deserve nothing for, uncreate and delete all that, across all time, dimension, space, and reality. How many places are you avoiding the future because you don't want to get paid? Uncreate and delete it all. Everywhere you're stopping your future so you don't get paid, uncreate and delete all that. You know, what's really funny is, I heard some of you guys are stopping your future so you don't get paid, and you don't get laid. That's what I heard . Okay, so, anywhere you guys are stopping your future so you don't get paid, or you don't get laid, okay, everything that is, uncreate and delete all that. Okay. Everywhere you guys are listening to your patterns instead of listening to your higher self, uncreate and delete all that. Okay. So here's the real truth. Okay. The real truth is, is you guys actually really do know what you should do. So, I want you to just like, get really big right now, 300 feet tall, I want you to get out of your mind for a minute, and I want you to just end your reality, kind of be above your reality. Just go into true awareness. Okay. Pretend for a minute that your higher self, God, whatever your word is, your higher self, or God, was going to deliver you the most profound message you've ever had in your life. Okay. And ask, "What am I supposed to do that generates the most amount of money for me right now?" Lydia's saying, "You should see my awesome decluttered garage." She healed her blocks from her horrific childhood. Love it. Okay. So, Frank said his music is calling. Growing up as a kid, told to get a real job. Okay. So, screw the real job, Frank. Like I know people who get paid writing songs for people, right? Or, maybe you could do some sort of inspirational meditations, and do your music. You know what I mean? So just ask, "How could I get paid doing my music?" And maybe make a list of 20 ways you can get paid doing music, and then pick one of those things and focus on it a little bit. Okay. So, some of you guys are your own teacher, want to teach people how to read. Okay. Some of you guys have got some insight about dreaming up better clients, finishing some work. Love it. All right. So, what would it take for you guys to attract the kind of people who would happily buy your services, and everything in the way of that, can you uncreate and delete it all? What would it take for you guys to happily generate and create the people who would happily pay for your services, and everything in the way of that, uncreate and delete it all? What would it take for you guys to generate money on the web, generate money in your town, generate money anywhere in your life? Okay. And everything in the way of that, uncreate it all. What would it take for you guys to be a magnet for opportunity, drawing to you the right people, places, and things, to happily and easily open every door imaginable to you, and everything in the way of that, uncreate and delete it all? So, Roselyn paid off all her debts. That's great. Yes. So, yes. Abundance is opening up. Okay, cool. Sarah is getting an image that since she has not been able to help her husband with his problems, then she thinks she's not good at anything. Yeah. Actually that's a good realization, because sometimes if you take all your energy helping other people, and they don't change or shift, you can't take all your energy into one person. You know what I mean? And sometimes those closest to you don't want to move. So, what would it take for you to take all your talents and skills, and instead of doing it for free, you get paid helping people? Okay, everything in the way of that, uncreate it and delete at all. All right. So, Trevor is going to help people. Get paid for telling stories. Love it. So, Wanda, I would not listen to my partner. I would just not care. I would just go charge what I want. So, anywhere you guys are letting one person stop you. I mean, seriously, like I want you guys to really, really get this, okay? So, you guys are like letting a silly fear pattern stop you. You're letting one person stop you. I mean, the thing is, is you don't have to tell that person what you're doing. Just go do it. It's your life, right? And if they get mad, so what? So what? You know what I mean? That means they're not supporting you. And so just keep saying, "What would it take for me to go do this anyway, regardless of whatever this other person that I love is trying to stop me?" 'Cause you're letting their negativity win over your life. So, anywhere you guys would let somebody else's negativity win over your life, uncreate and delete all that. So, what would it take for all, this is a really good awareness, Wanda, okay. So, everything in the way of you guys getting paid more, uncreate and delete it all. Everywhere you're waiting for somebody's approval, instead of just making it happen, uncreate and delete all that too. Oscar says, "Act bold and unforeseen forces will come your way." I love it. All right, you guys are doing good. So, now, can you guys see that, okay, anywhere you guys are blocked, in any other section of your life that is stopping you from just manifesting the perfect clients, and for you to get paid with your talents, uncreate and delete it all. So, here's your homework for the week . What would it take for you guys to get paid for your talents and know exactly how to make a lot of money? Okay. So, Shelly, you feel sad about this, 'cause there's an energy of anger leaving your body, so that you can actually just go do it. Okay. So it's just a processing energy. Kay wants to know, her husband just received $400 from out of nowhere, and he wants to know if she's doing her magic on him. I love it. Cool. Margaret's happy, 'cause she can see how this will focus and change her energy so she can attract wealthy clients. I love it. 'Cause you just have to be the energy of wealth if you want to get wealthy clients, right? So, if you just know who you are, feel totally confident, wealthy people will resonate with you. So, what would it take for you guys to be just totally confident in who you are, and what you offer, and everything in the way of that, uncreate and delete it all? And the other part of your homework is asking your energy avatar, like your character, the avatar of your perfect client, you're going to practice asking that person for money, okay. And then you're going to see him or her telling you, "Yes." Okay. So, anywhere you guys aren't getting any direction, for whatever reason, uncreate and delete it all. Glenda, it feels like you don't want to move, at some level. So, any subconscious attack energy, where you feel like if you move, you'll be attacked, uncreate and delete it all. Anywhere you guys have a fear of being attacked, so you won't move forward, uncreate and delete all that, across all time, dimension, space, and reality. What would it take for you guys to get paid for your skills and talents? Everything in the way of that, uncreate and delete it all. What would it take for you guys to generate money with your talents? Everything in the way of that, will you uncreate and delete all that across all time, dimension, space, and reality? What would it take for you guys to do what's needed to ask people to pay you for your skills, and everything in the way of that, uncreate and delete it all? What would it take universe to deliver all the courage to be paid more for your talents, and everything in the way of that, uncreate and delete it all? What vibrational energy can you become to have generous benefactors giving you things, and everything in the way of that, uncreate and delete it all? What would it take for you to generate wealthy clients who pay you money? Everything in the way of that, uncreate and delete it all. What would it take for you guys to body, mind, soul, emotional body, to have everything line up where you take massive action in spite of any pattern, or person, who comes in the way of it? And everything in the way of that, uncreate and delete it all. What vibrational energy can allow you to be paid for your skills generously? Uncreate and delete it all. What vibrational energy can bring you more and more skills and talents, and everything in the way of that, uncreate and delete it all? I'm going to bring up one more thing about being paid. It just kind of popped in my head. So, John, you would say, "What would it take for anything that I'm allowing for my mother to influence my life, uncreate and delete it all? Anything I'm allowing for my father to influence my life in a way that stops my money, uncreate and delete it all. Anywhere I'm allowing myself to influence my life in a way that stops my money, uncreate and delete it all." Remember how I had you guys think of your perfect customer? So, just call it the perfect customer. You're going to ask the perfect customer, "How?" And you're going to practice that you're asking that person for money, and they happily give it to you, doing your talent and skill. So, Glenda, you felt attacked by your mom's energy, 'cause you were thinking, "She's not happy, so she must not be happy with me." And then that felt like attack to you. And then somewhere around 17, 18, and 20, you felt like stopped or blocked from moving forward. And then somewhere you had a hubby, or a boyfriend, or something that kind of stopped you. Okay. So, those are all your blocks. So, I want to talk about this for a minute, 'cause Wanda brought up a really great point. If you don't resonate with how much you're asking for, there's two things that are going on. Like if you're charging too little, this is going to sound funny, but if you're charging too little, you'll get resentful. If you're resentful, you won't generate the kind of right clients for you, if that makes sense. So, for a long time I was charging like, not as much as what I do now, but the thing is, as I watched my energy, I was getting drained. I was getting tired. I was getting cranky. I was feeling like out of alignment, okay. And then when I raised my prices, 'cause it came into my awareness, what was really going on, is I felt like I was worth more, but I was charging less, so, therefore, I felt ashamed of myself, and because I felt ashamed of myself, it was kind of lowering my vibration, right. Okay. So, if you're not in alignment, like if you're charging too little, it'll actually block your money. So, Wanda, I'm actually hearing 75 bucks an hour. So, why don't you go try that for a little bit, 'cause you'll draw in a different kind of clientele. So, any of you guys that are holding yourself back by charging too little, instead of moving into the energy of abundance, and the free-flowing energy of abundance, and the joyous energy of abundance, uncreate and delete all that. Okay. So, anywhere you guys feel sucker-punched in any way, like some sort of energy of like, "I can't get paid that much, and I'm not worth it," uncreate and delete all that across all time, dimension, space, and reality, All realities that are coalescing to this moment, okay. So, this is the moment you guys can change your life, right here, right now. This is the moment where you, as an infinite being, unlock all the doors to your abundance. This is the moment where you let go of your freakouts, your fear patterns, and all the other internal stuff you guys have going on, stopping you. So, everything that is, person, place, thing, event, idea, thought, feeling, justification, conclusion, evidence, any childhood trauma, or anything locked in your energy fields, that are stopping you from moving forward, and charging what you want, using your talents and abilities, uncreate and delete all that, across all time, dimension, space, and reality. All right, cool. Thank you, Sarah . Okay. So, 30 to 40 times a day, what vibrational energy can you become to get paid for being you? And you're still in process. I know you guys are going to make a lot of money this year, so, I love it, love it. I think you guys are amazing. I completely love and adore you, and appreciate so much that you guys have showed up for yourself. Okay. That's what I admire about you guys, that you're willing to just work through your stuff, be over it once and for all, and never have to have the same complaints in your life again. And then you can go get paid everything you're worth. I have one little poll. All right. Since, if you could label how much you have manifested since the beginning of the journey, and put it in dollar amounts, like including like savings and all those kinds of things, what have you generated? You guys have generated some money. That's lovely. And the really cool thing is, is you've changed your foundation. So, what I know most of all, is that you'll never be the same. How cool is that? And what I know most of all is that you have tools now that you can change anything in your life. All right, love you bunches, and many blessings.

LESSON 24: Clearing Blocks to Welcoming Abundance (Clearing Session Only)

Today, let's set one more intent, okay, for what you hope to achieve today. What do you hope to achieve tonight? What is the final thing that you just really want to shift no matter what it takes? Let's just put an energy into your future. So over the next three months, let's set one more intent for you guys. So whatever you want to achieve in the next three months, push that energy forward. Woo, I can feel that. I love it. You guys are amazing at connecting now. Let's close your eyes for a minute. And if you're driving, obviously do not close your eyes. Connect to the light 300 feet above your head, okay? See, sense, or feel your connection to source energy and know that you are part of it and it is part of you. Okay, so let's open to opening up your talents today, okay? Today we're going to open up your talents. Okay, so let the light come into your crown, opening up any latent skills and talents that you want to get paid for so that you know what to do, how to do it, and how to get paid and are always guided. Ask the light to come in opening up your true awareness, your hearing, your sight, your knowing, so that you know where and how to get paid for your talents. Okay, ask the light to come through your voice, through your throat, so that you speak the truth about who you are, what you're about, what your talents are, and how your light can shine in other people's lives and help them and get paid for it. Ask this light to come through your heart. Opening up your heartfelt talents, your heartfelt guided actions to take in implementing strategies to make sure you get paid on your talents. Ask the light to come into your solar plexus, releasing any nervousness, any disdain for yourself, and anything that would block you from moving forward. Ask the light to come into your power center, opening up anywhere you feel less than powerful about using your talents and anywhere you really just won't proclaim, I am an amazing, super abundant, completely talented being who can make anything happen. Ask the light to come into your roots. So you're rooted in the knowledge that you can go forward and manifest anything you truly desire and nothing's really blocked. It's just all an illusion and you can delete and uncreate the illusion and create and generate another one. Ask the light to come through your feet into the center of the ground. All right, so connect to the place in the middle of the planet where it feels really, really happy, really conscious, really light, really filled with source. Ask this light to bounce back up like a mini trampoline straight up into your heart. And ask this light to radiate from your heart 360 degrees all the way around like a great central sunshine. Radiating out about 15 feet all the way around your field. Filling your field with the ability to know, see, and hear. and get paid for whatever your talents are. Ask this light to expand out past the building you're in. Yes. Fill the space that you live and work in with the energy of I am super talented. I know how to get paid. I'm always guided. All right. Ask this light to fill in all the spaces in your town. So radiate out past your city, your town. Using this field of light to call in anybody who could happily use your talents and pay you a lot of money for it. Ask this light that you can be of great service, heartfelt service, really, really connecting to people's heart, giving them what they deserve as well, which is great, abundant service. Better than they've ever expected so that they always want to do business with you again. Ask this light to radiate past your state so that you connect to anybody else in the state who wants to know about you, hear about you, and use your talents so they can receive your love and you can receive their love. Ask this light to radiate past the country you're in, connecting to everybody that needs your services, use your talents, recognize you, give you energy back, and you give them energy back. Okay, asking the light to connect to anybody on planet Earth, radiate the light all the way around planet Earth, connecting to anybody and anything who needs your services, needs your talents, needs your skills, and you can happily and easily receive abundance and payment for it. All right, awesome. How much is your talent worth? I want you to write down right now and then share some of these, like type them into the control panel. Type in some of your talents, your skills, and your know -hows and what you can contribute to somebody's life. So everywhere you guys don't think you have any talents to contribute. Okay, everything that is, will you guys uncreate and delete it all? Now, all your talents that you listed, how much would somebody pay you for this talent? Okay, and I'm going to force you guys to like label it. So break down each talent. So some of you put, you know, I'm good at using my imagination and creating things, all right? So think of something you could kind of contribute to somebody, right? Everybody think of one of the things that you said you're really good at. Now I want you to ask, just intuitively, if you had to put a price in dollars on that to how much somebody would pay you for that, how much would somebody pay you for that if you could figure out a creative way to market it? Okay, so did any of you guys get a surprising answer? Okay, what would it take for whatever numbers you guys came up with, what would it take for them to triple? Okay, and everything in the way of that, uncreate and delete it all. Okay, everything in the way of you guys going forward taking massive, massive action and connecting the dots to make it happen, uncreate and delete all that across all time, dimension, space, and reality. How many of you are not listening to your guidance and are procrastinating? Okay, everything that is, will you uncreate and delete all that across all time, dimension, space, and reality? How many of you don't have a clue how to get paid for something that you really want to love to do? Okay, everything that is, will you uncreate and delete all that across all time, dimension, space, and reality? How many of you are pretending that you don't know how to do it in order to stay stuck? Uncreate and delete all that. Okay, how many places, so Sheila, how many places are you stopping yourself? It's because you think you have to know it all, so you have a weird belief. Let me see what it is. You don't know it all, but you think you know it all, which is blocking any new awareness. I know it sounds really funny. Okay, so any of you guys having anything going on where you think that, it's going to sound kind of funny, but if you think you know it all, sometimes it doesn't leave an energy or a space for something new to show up. Okay? Okay, so anywhere you're afraid to know the answer, afraid to know the truth, afraid to hear something different than what you truly want, so you're blocking it at any level, uncreate and delete it all. And everywhere you grew up and you guys were told that you were so wrong and so pathetic when you grew up, like that you were somehow wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong. Okay, everything that is, will you uncreate all that? How many of you feel that you're wrong so you can't get an answer? Uncreate and delete all that. Okay, any other place where you guys are limiting how much money you can connect to? Okay, so everything in the way. If you guys are generating what you want, uncreate and delete all that. Yeah, there. Okay, everywhere love is not going to help you or love in the past never helped you. So if you love what you do, it won't work. Okay, so anywhere you guys took a hit on something you love, uncreate and delete it all. Anywhere in the past, you will stop doing something that was really truly your gift and talent. and you stopped yourself. Or somebody stopped you. Maybe your parents stopped you. Okay, everything that is, will you uncreate and delete it all? Any of you guys who wanted to go to school for a certain thing and then your parents told you you couldn't, or maybe you didn't have the money to do it and you stopped yourself, uncreate and delete all that across all time to mention space and reality. Any other business idea that a spouse or a mate or... in particular talked you out of that you knew you should have went and did? Uncreate and delete all that across all time, dimension, space, and reality. Everywhere you think you need like some huge education or you're not professionally trained, uncreate and delete all that across all time, dimension, space, and reality. What if the fact that you're not professionally trained actually allows you to see other possibilities that somebody that's professionally trained might not see? Like, what if you could come up with a better system because you're not bogged into the way that everybody else does it? And maybe because you don't do it the same way, you approach it differently. Maybe people will pay you more. So anywhere you think that because you're not educated, it limits you, uncreate and delete all that. And anywhere it's truly guided that you need more education and you're stopping yourself, uncreate and delete all that. All right. Energy healing, $1 ,000 an hour. Integrative MD, $400 an hour. 200 bucks psychotherapy. Love it. Okay, anywhere these prices are way too high for Canadian clients. Everything that is, uncreate and delete it all. There's always a niche of people. You know, I know wealthy people, and if something's good, they'll pay anything for it if they really love it. Okay, everything that is, uncreate and delete all that. All right. Telling my story, 500K or more. All right. Informative articles online, 1 ,000 a year or more. Okay, everything in the way of that, uncreate it all. So John, your mom is in the way. Your mom's energy somehow stopped you and misguided you so you don't trust you all the time. So you got some stuff with the women. Okay, uncreate and delete all that across all time to mention space and reality. Okay, so if you guys feel like there's an education, you know, maybe it's true authentic guidance that you need more education. So if that's true, why don't you think of a plan right now of how long it'll take. So if any of you guys really, really, really, truly need more education, how long will it take you to get it? Okay, so everything in the way of you guys actually just doing it. Uncreate and delete all that. Okay, everywhere you guys procrastinate because the answer is too simple and you want to complicate it. So Colleen, I think you want to complicate it instead of just making it easy. So anywhere you guys want to complicate it and create some confusion, create a little drama in front of you so that you don't have to actually just go for it, I can create and delete it all. And anywhere that's what your parents did, they created some drama in front of you so you learned how to be a human being like that, I can create and delete all that. Okay, so anywhere you guys have a self -esteem issue where you're afraid to ask people for how much... money you just came up with. So I want you guys think for a minute of whatever your number is. I want you to imagine that there's like your customer avatar in front of you, okay? So it's the ideal client. Okay, I want you to ask that avatar, that customer, ask them if you want to make $500 ,000 that year or $20 ,000 or whatever it is from them, $1 ,000 an hour. Ask that person for that much money and then see them saying yes. I will happily do that. Okay, so whatever your customer avatar, think of them. Okay, and say to yourself, I'm brave enough to ask for this, and everything in the way of that, I uncreate it all. I'm courageous enough to ask for this, and everything in the way of that, uncreate and delete it all. I can deliver how much this is worth to them, everything in the way of that, uncreate and delete it all. I'm powerful enough to generate this in my life, uncreate and delete it all. And I'm powerful enough to be guided to see how I have to package myself in order to make this happen. Everything in the way of that, uncreate and delete all that too. Because the thing is, is this is just your next step that's coming up. So now you've got a true awareness of, oh, I can make that much money doing this. So now your what would it take is, is what would it take for me to make this? And what would it take for me to have the exact know -how? Okay, so everything in the way of that, uncreate and delete it all, what would it take for you guys to have the exact know -how? Okay, so everything that's blocking you guys from deciding that I am an infinite being and I can create enough energy around me to attract the right person, place, or thing that gives me the best advice to help me get paid more. Okay, everything in the way of that, uncreate it and delete it all. Anywhere I am blocked in marketing, let's just say I ask for a dream, a thought, an idea, a something that pushes you over the hump so it makes it easy for you. And everything in the way of that, will you uncreate it all? So Roman, everywhere you think men are more powerful than you. So any of you guys who think that other people are more powerful than you. Any of you who have that belief, uncreate and delete it all. And anywhere you think your mom and dad are still more powerful than you, uncreate and delete it all. Or anywhere you guys think a spouse is more powerful than you, uncreate and delete all that. Okay, so I'm going to do this again. So pick one more of your talents that's on that list. Okay, anywhere you guys are stuck on the failures and you're stuck on how much to charge, uncreate and delete it all. Okay, pick one more thing. All right, so ask, if I were to develop this talent and skill and really, really get paid what I'm worth for it, how much would somebody pay me for it? Okay, so everything in the way of you guys knowing what to do with this information, uncreate and delete it all. So now I want you to ask one more question while you're here. What are the first eight steps I have to take? in order to get paid this amount. Okay, some of you guys are freaking out because I said eight steps, right? Okay, what are the eight steps? Pick one. Pick one step you could take to make it happen. Maybe it's research. Maybe it's putting up a website. Maybe it's calling two people. Maybe it's raising your prices. Okay, sometimes if you, somebody's asking, why didn't I get this job interview? Because maybe there's a better one for you, okay? So I wouldn't get so hung up on it. Just look at it like a numbers game. So everything in the way of you guys getting the job or focusing on the failure. Okay, uncreate and delete all that. So any of you guys who think that, oh, I just don't want to do it. And, you know, you're kind of like letting yourself off the hook instead of pushing yourself a little bit. Uncreate and delete all that. Okay, everywhere you guys want to get out of this and not do it. Because now you have awareness. Now you can't stay stuck anymore, right? Because now you have something new. Any of you guys that are, you know, like shooting it all down and going, oh, I can't do it. That will never happen. This is crazy. Why would my higher self tell me to do this? Okay, everything that is, uncreate and delete it all. Okay, everywhere you guys are afraid people won't love you if you're really successful, uncreate and delete all that. Everywhere you guys don't think you can change, uncreate and delete at all. And any of you guys have mom and dad karma still that's blocking you. So anything unhealed with mom and dad that somehow sabotages you and makes you stop yourself because you still want them to love you, even if being small makes them love you. Okay, uncreate and delete all that. Anywhere you guys are staying small so you can have your parent love you. Anywhere that's your foundation, uncreate and delete all that. What would it take for you guys to meet a lot of people who will pay you? Okay, and everything in the way of that, uncreate it all. Or what would it take for you to generate a lot of people coming to pay you? Everything in the way of that, uncreate and delete all that. Everywhere you guys don't think you're worth enough, uncreate and delete all that across all time, dimensions, space, and reality. Ask your higher self right now, just tune in, what would be the one skill you should focus on right now that would make you the most amount of money with the most amount of fun with the most amount of lightness? Everything that is uncreate it all. Everywhere you don't feel like you deserve to get paid for your talents uncreate and delete it all. Everywhere you guys think that people oppose you. You know what I mean? Like if your parents were kind of critical then you might think oh people don't like me. So any of you guys who have the belief, the thought, the feeling, the idea that people don't like you or that you don't like people uncreate and delete all that. How do you be consistent with showing up and getting it done especially if you're tired? Well the first thing you do is you take a little vacation when you need it. okay but the second thing you do is what would it take for my energy to be light and for this to be easy and then just focus on one thing a day okay like you know just say what is one thing I can do today that will bring me closer to my goal and don't focus on 20 things because that can be overwhelming and tiring but just focus on one thing. One thing a day that's closer to your goal. One thing. Okay, and everything in the way of that, uncreate and delete it all. So Sarah, for some reason, you like not knowing things. So everywhere you're pretending to not know, for whatever reason, uncreate and delete all that. So body twitching is just releasing. Alright, raising your rates fills your stomach with butterflies. Amber, could that be excitement? What if that's excitement? Don't make a wrongness out of it. It feels exciting. Why do I feel tired about money? Because you don't like having to think about money. So somebody brainwashed you to not think about money. Like, I'm a girl. I don't want to think about money. Everything that is, delete all that. Anxiousness is just the energy stirring up so you can clear it. So everywhere you guys would let fear stop you. I mean, seriously, fear is just a pattern. So everywhere you would let the pattern called fear. which is really just a pattern. It's like energy. It's just nothing. You know what I'm saying? So everywhere you guys would let this silly little nothing energy pattern stop you from being your greatest self, will you uncreate and delete it all? Anywhere you guys would rather listen to the monkey mind, your excuses, and your patterns instead of listening to your heart, your higher part of your being, and just say, hey, my true awareness is I can go make a million dollars this year. That's my true psychic awareness. Everything in the way of that, I'm going to delete it all. And I'm not going to listen to all the other stuff that's going to come up and argue with me. I'm going to just delete everything that comes up and argues with me. So when you guys got these numbers and then you decided, oh, I can't do it, okay, everything that is, will you uncreate and delete it all? Everywhere you're arguing with yourself, which is really just these patterns, it's just patterns, it's nothing. Okay, everything that is, uncreate and delete it all. Everywhere your illusion and delusion is stopping you from going and creating the big bucks, uncreate and delete all that across all time, dimension, space, and reality. All right, so anywhere you guys bought anybody else's point of view that you're nothing, uncreate it and delete it all. anywhere else you bought anybody else's point of view that what you do you deserve nothing for uncreate and delete all that across all time to mention space in reality how many places are you avoiding the future because you don't want to get paid uncreate and delete it all everywhere you're stopping your future so you don't get paid uncreate and delete all that You know what's really funny is I heard some of you guys are stopping your future so you don't get paid and you don't get laid. That's what I heard. Okay, so anywhere you guys are stopping your future so you don't get paid or you don't get laid. Okay, everything that is, uncreate and delete all that. Okay, everywhere you guys are listening to your patterns instead of listening to your higher self, uncreate and delete all that. Okay, so here's the real truth. Okay, the real truth is you guys actually really do know what you should do. So I want you to just like get really big right now, 300 feet tall. And I want you to get out of your mind for a minute. And I want you to just end your reality, kind of be above your reality. Just go into true awareness. Okay, pretend for a minute that your higher self, God, whatever your word is, your higher self or God was going to deliver you the most profound message you've ever had in your life. Okay, and ask, what am I supposed to do that generates the most amount of money for me right now? All right, so what would it take for you guys to attract the kind of people who would happily buy your services and everything in the way of that? Can you uncreate and delete it all? What would it take for you guys to happily generate and create the people who would happily pay for your services and everything in the way of that uncreate and delete it all? What would it take for you guys to generate money on the web, generate money in your town, generate money anywhere in your life, okay, and everything in the way of that uncreate it all? What would it take for you guys to be a magnet for opportunity, drawing to you the right people, places, and things to happily and easily open every door imaginable to you? And everything in the way of that, uncreate and delete it all. So what would it take for you to take all your talents and skills and find, and instead of doing it for free, you get paid helping people? Okay, everything in the way of that, uncreate and delete it all. So Wanda, I would not listen to my partner. I would just not care. I would just go charge what I want. And so just keep saying, what would it take for me to go do this anyway, regardless of whatever this other person that I love is trying to stop me? Because you're letting their negativity win over your life. So anywhere you guys would let somebody else's negativity win over your life, uncreate and delete all that.

Okay, and everything in the way of that, uncreate and delete it all. Okay, so anywhere you guys aren't getting any direction for whatever reason, uncreate and delete it all. Glenda, it feels like you don't want to move at some level. So any subconscious attack energy where you feel like if you move, you'll be attacked, uncreate and delete it all.

What vibrational energy can bring you more and more skills and talents and everything in the way of that? Uncreate and delete it all. I'm going to bring up one more thing about being paid. It just kind of popped in my head. So John, you would say, what would it take for anything that I'm allowing for my mother to influence my life? Uncreate and delete it all. Anything I'm allowing for my father to influence my life? in a way that stops my money, uncreate and delete it all. Anywhere I'm allowing myself to influence my life in a way that stops my money, uncreate and delete it all. So any of you guys that are holding yourself back by charging too little, instead of moving into the energy of abundance and the free -flowing energy of abundance and the joyous energy of abundance, uncreate and delete all that. Okay, so anywhere you guys feel sucker punched in any way, like some sort of energy of like, I can't get paid that much. And I'm not worth it. Uncreate and delete all that across all time, dimensions, space, and reality. All realities that are coalescing to this real, this moment.

So 30 to 40 times a day, what vibrational energy can you become to get paid for being you? And you're still in process. I know you guys are going to make a lot of money this year. So I love it. Love it. All right. Love you bunches and many blessings. Please continue to the next unlimited abundance journey session.

MEDITATION: Morning Meditation

- Hi, welcome. This is Christie Marie Sheldon. Thank you so much for joining me today. I'm going to walk you through an amazing morning meditation that I do every morning, and I call it Connecting to the Love of all Things, connecting to the love of all things in your life and your day. And once you start to get the hang of this, you will see that pretty much you can do this in five to seven minutes, you know, to start your life off on the right foot. What I've noticed is that the more people do this and start connecting to the love of all things in their daily life. That's about raising your vibration. That's about living in the energy of what I call love or above. And ultimately, the goal is to live in this kind of energy 24/7. So when I say it takes five minutes, I'm saying it takes about five minutes just to connect to that kind of frequency. But then, you have to breathe it and live it and allow it and love it. Basically, 24/7, that's the goal. And then you'll be astonished at how easy things just show up for you, how the serendipitous moments just kind of explode around you, or how abundance is attracted to you, or people start actually looking at you. I kind of call it when you're filled with light and love or above energy 24/7, it's sort of the instant charisma technique. So I want you to do this with me. I'm going to take you through it a little bit more slowly. But again, once you get used to this, you'll start pulling this kind of energy pretty rapidly, and then you just start living it 24/7. Okay, so for right now, so you tune in a little deeper. I'm going to ask you to close your eyes and then take your energy up where you see, sense or feel the love of all things. I've noticed that there's a dimension about 300 feet above your head where people naturally connect to when they connect to the light or when they pray, or when they say, "Hey, I want to connect to God or spirit or source," whatever your word is for that. So just tune into that vibration, 300 feet above your head, where you see, sense or feel light and the love of all things. And I want you to imagine there's a big door there and only you can shut it because it's naturally always on. And I want you to just open it or if it's already open, I want to just turn up the flow. And then I'm going to ask you to allow this light to come into the top of your head. So we're connecting this spiritual, highly transformative, light-filled, love-filled energy. We're going to ask it to start coming into your crown, the top of your head. And we're going to ask that the love and the bliss of all things flow into your crown opening up the connection. So now, you're going to be connected and learn how to connect to the love of all things. So allow this to just flow through you, flow in you, flow around you. Kind of like a rain shower, it just starts filling you. You want it to flow through the connection of your third eye so that you can see the world from the love in all things. And allow this light and love, this higher vibrational frequency, to come into your ears so that you can hear when you're talking to people or hear in the world the love behind everything they're talking about, so that you can hear the love in all things. And allow this light to come through into your throat so that you, yourself, when you're communicating in the world, you're communicating from the vibration of love or above, communicating in the vibration where your love in all things comes through your voice. It comes through the way you look and feel about things. And allow this light to come into your heart. That's higher vibrational energy. And start filling your heart with the belief, the feeling, the knowing that the love in all things can come through you, be around you, be attracted to you, show up on your doorstep. So allow the light to fill your heart so then you believe in the love of all things. And allow this light to come into your abdomen area. And I want you to allow this light to come in so that you feel safe and secure in this higher vibration, in emanating and radiating and attracting to you the love in all things. And allow this light to come into your stomach area so that you're really congruent with what you do and what you say and what you believe and how you act and how you stomach the world, you know, that you're congruent really aligned. You're being it. You're being the energy of the love of all things. And allow this light to come into your rear area so that you're allowing the love of all things to move through you and move you in the direction of more and more of the love or above energy. And allow this light to come through your legs, your knees, your feet. And allow this love of all things kind of higher vibrational energy to allow that you move in the world through your feet, that your movements are congruent with the love of all things. Now, we want to connect to the center of the planet so that you're, you know, as above, so below. So that the spiritual light permeates you and then starts attracting and manifesting things on the planet for you that show up as love or above kind of energy, higher vibrational energy. So allow this light to come through your body and into the center of the planet. And believe it or not, in the center of the planet, the planet also support you in manifesting, creating, having, and being loved. So connect to the space in the center of the planet where it just feels like a big warm hug. And some of you might even take a breath when you first connect to this energy. So it seems like a little ball of light in the center of the planet that just feels like love. It feels like support. It feels like help. It feels like, how can I help you? How I support you in whatever your direction is? And I ask this light, which feels kind of like mother's love, to start coming right back up. It's going to start filling you from below, and it's going to start coming up into your body. So allow this love of all things, supportive, planetary energy, to start pulling up into your feet and your knees and your hips and your heart so that you're truly grounded in this energy of the love in all things. Once it meets your heart, I'm going to ask you to start filling your whole field like a big sunshine with the energy of the love of all things. Higher vibrational energy needs you to be loved, needs to fill you and then need you to radiate it out so more and more and more people are attracted to it. And the goal being that you live this energy 24/7. So start radiating this love and light, this love or above energy, the love in all things around your body in a 360-degree circle. So now we're going to picture, some of you might not be able to picture, so just feel or know, or imagine, or picture, whichever you can do, a big ball of light in front of your heart, okay? So imagine you're holding out your hands and you might want to physically do this right now. Just hold out your hands and in front of your heart, and I want you to start using your heart's energy, this connection that you have going and the love of all things that's pulling into your body. I want you to just start filling a ball of love inside your hands and we're going to start labeling this your day. So this is your day today, okay? And we're going to start filling your day with love or above energy. And we're going to ask that you start filling this day that you're going to have in front of you. You're going to fill it with that all of your needs are met in a loving, abundant way. And I want you to not limit this. I want you to see this as a big ball of possibilities, that this love can show up from anywhere. As long as it's loving and kind to you, you are open to receiving it: from happy exchanges with people, from material objects, you know? Maybe money does kind of comes through into this love of all things, right, through material aspects. Allow the love of all things to permeate your time so that you have more than enough time to get everything you need accomplished. And allow this love of all things to start filling up your body so that every cell is just vibrating and happy and alive and healthy. And allow the love of all things to start filling up your relationships with people. So all your interactions that you're going to have in your day, see that your vibration is so magnificent that it just puts people in a happy state as soon as they see you, as soon as they connect to you. And people bend over backwards because they want to, because they feel so happy around you, that they just give you the world. And I want you to feel that in this light, in this bubble of light in your day, that you're completely supported and that all your needs are met ahead of time before you even know to ask for them. So we're going to ask that every interaction be filled with love, every transaction be filled with love, that every opportunity be filled with love, that every communication be filled with love, and that anything be possible as long as it's in the energy of love, love or above. And you can bring into your day any other quality that you would like right now. So maybe you want some kindness or playfulness. All of these are qualities of the love or above energy. Maybe you want people to be kind to you. Maybe you want a resolution to a problem. So in this bubble of love, see the problem instantly vanish, and it is replaced with the energy of the harmonious, perfect solution. And ask this light to bring you more and more of whatever it is that you want to put forth in your year, in your month, in your week. Joy, how about joy? Love or above energy is joyful. So allow those energy of joy to permeate your day. How about resilience? Maybe you need a little extra backbone. That's loving, you know? Having a little backbone is loving. So see yourself pulling in this energy of resilience, of power, of the joy in creating. Okay, when you feel like your day is filled up, I want you to not disconnect from the light anymore. I want you to just go through your day thinking of this bubble, of the love of all things that's permeating your day. And we'll literally just radiate it out to everybody you see and meet. And think about it and report back on Facebook and let me know what happens. Okay, you guys, don't disconnect. Stay connected. Love you bunches. And let me know what happens for you. Ciao for now.

MEDITATION: Evening Meditation

- Hi, this is Christie Marie Sheldon and welcome to the evening meditation. Like you take a shower every night before you go to bed, it's vital that you clean up your energy at the end of the day. You'll notice that you start having more peaceful sleep, a lot of your anxieties will seem to kind of melt away and you'll probably wake up feeling a lot more refreshed if you do this evening meditation. So let's start by connecting to the love of all things. So take your energy up 300 feet where you see, sense or feel the light and again, this light is what we all know and all intuitively connect to when we pray for something or we ask the universe for help. And so I'm going to ask you right now to connect to this light, the love of all things, the love for yourself, the love for humanity, the love for being on the planet and we're going to ask this flow to start opening and coming into your head. So if you imagine, for some of you you might already have the door open and it's starting to kind of flow and shower down into your field of energy. If you haven't opened the door just open it or turn the flow up so that the love of all things starts flowing into your crown, increasing your connection to this higher vibrational energy. So allow this light, this love, this peace, this joy to start coming into your crown, opening the connection and washing away anywhere where you disconnect or anywhere where you don't want help from the universe or anywhere where you feel that you can't be guided or you shut down your guidance, okay. And allow this light to come into your crown and open all those things up again. And allow this light, this higher vibrational lover above light to come into your third eye, washing away anywhere you don't want to see the truth in all situations. When we see the truth through loving eyes, we generally have compassion for ourselves and others about what the truth really is. You know, at the end of the day, we're all trying to do our best down here and if we, you know, do lower vibrations, it's usually not that we're bad people, it's just that we have some wounds that might need to be healed. So allow this light to kind of come in so that you can see the love and have the understanding of the truth in what you're seeing in front of you. Okay, and allow this light to go into your ears, washing and clearing away anywhere you might block yourself from hearing the truth or hearing guidance. So ask the lover above energy to come in and wash away any blocks to hearing the love in all things and allow the light to now come into your throat, opening it up any like anger, frustration, fear, resentment that you might be holding onto about what you did or didn't communicate throughout the day. And allow this light to come into your heart and allow this light to open your heart to feeling that higher vibrational lover above energy, the love in all things. And allow it to wash away anywhere you feel again, resentment, panicked, afraid, fear, any lower vibration, apathy, guilt, shame, any of it. Next, allow this light to come in and wash away anywhere in your stomach area where you don't feel safe. Allow the love of all things and the lover above energy to come into your stomach area, washing away anywhere you're not congruent with who you want to be and how you want to show up in the world. And allow this light to come into your root opening up anywhere you feel that you can't stand in your power, that you can't do what you want to do. So allow the lover of all things, the lover above energy to come into your root kind of opening up your ability to see what path to take, to know and be guided on what the solution to your seemingly insurmountable problems might be. And allow the light to wash through your hips and your legs and into your feet so that you move in a very grounded, guided love or above kind of way so that you are following the energy of love versus following the energy of fear. And allow this energy to wash all the way through you into the center of the planet and connect to the place where it feels very safe and secure, where you feel like you're just being hugged. Where you feel like you're just being held, where you feel safe. And there's a cool light that happens right here, so bring this dimensional light, this lover above energy, this lover above forced if you will, this love and all things kind of energy that the planet wants to bring into you and allow this like an elevator to just come right back up your feet, your hips and into your heart and now you're connected from above and below in the energy of the love of all things, a higher vibrational lover above energy. And see your heart like a big central sunshine and allow this light to radiate out all the way around you 360 degrees like a big, big sunshine, and fill your field with this energy, this cleansing, abundant, loving energy and just see it washing away any other debris that you picked up from your day. So sense that right in front of you is a big elevator. Some of you might see it, some of you might just imagine it and some of you might know it. However it comes in your senses is perfectly fine. However, it shows up for you, we're all wired differently as far as our intuitive senses, so just sense an elevator right in front of you and I want you to push the button and I want you to open the door. And I want you to notice that there's a garbage can in this elevator. And I want you to think about something today that bothered you. You know, maybe it was a communication with somebody, maybe it was because you were stressed out and you didn't get something done, maybe it's because you snapped at somebody. Whatever it is that bothered you today when I asked that question, I want you to imagine taking your hand and pulling that garbage out of your energy. So it could be inside your body, it could be to the right of your body, it could be to the left of your body, it could be behind you or it could be in front of you because your soul is bigger than your body. Your body is inside your soul. So take your hand, feel where that... Just kind of whatever comes up for you, like "ooh, I think it's right in my stomach "or right in my heart," whatever was bothering you and just literally pull that gunk out and drop it in the garbage can. Sayonara! Okay, and now I want you to think of any other thing that bothered you today. Any other thing, see your sense or feel where it is in your field, take your hand and literally just pull it out of your field and drop it in the garbage can. And you might notice like stringy energy comes out or maybe it's kind of hard or solid, whatever it is or however it shows up, it's okay. Just take it out, put it in the garbage can. Let's ask this, anywhere in your field where you don't feel the love of all things or you don't... You feel like some lower energy, fear, worry, anger, angst, whatever it is, I want you to notice what comes up when I ask that question. So what else is kind of hanging out there that needs to go? And then take your hand, pull it out of your field, drop it in the garbage can. Say see you later. Okay, now I want you to notice, do you have any energy where you feel lacking or wanting something? So I'll give you an example. If you say to yourself a lot, "I want more money, "I want more time, I want more blank, blank, blank." Whatever that is, the lack actually takes up a space inside of you, okay. So wherever this lack or wanting is what you're saying to your reality or your universe is I don't have it, which then the universe will reply, "well, you don't have it so I'm not going to bring it to you." Because the universe is kind and loving and just follows your instructions. So I want you to feel wherever you feel a lack or a wanting, whatever your common thing is that you probably think every day and wherever that energy is I want you to grab it, pull it out and drop it in the garbage can. Every day you probably think, "I can't do this, "I shouldn't do this, I couldn't do this, "I want to do this but I can't do this, this never happens," so those are your stops, okay. So when I bring that file up, where are your stops in your energy field? Where are all your I can't, I wouldn't, I couldn't, I shouldn't? Okay. I want you to pull those out and drop them in the garbage can. Alright, now anywhere you don't feel worthy. So if you ever say to yourself, "well, I don't really deserve this or this or this." And you might not say it out loud, but you might beat yourself up. You might say, "oh, you look like crap today." Or "I don't think I deserve to go ask my boss for a raise" or "I don't think my mate really likes me very much today." Okay, those are worthiness issues, so wherever you don't feel worthy, I'm going to ask you to light that up, take your hand and grab that energy and then drop it in the garbage can. Okay, so any other place where you feel out of communication with people... You know, usually our greatest problems are usually with other people where we feel misheard or not understood or we might have some place where we don't like them and where we think they don't like us. You know, people are the mirrors to what's going on in our own reality, right? We attract certain people who might do certain things to us, or we might attract certain people who are supposed to teach us how to stand really in our power you know, or to say no to something. So whatever these relationship blocks are that kind of come up when I bring this up, I want you to feel wherever you feel those, grab them with your hand, pull them out of your field and you don't need those energies in your field at all and drop them in the garbage can. Okay, and while you're at it, any other thing that comes up that really just annoys you or is frustrating or blocking you, I want you to take that, take it in your hand, pull it out, drop it in the garbage can. Okay, so now I want you to hit the button, close the door, and you'll see that there's a button that has a little heart. So we're going to take... Push that button and the elevator is going to take this energy up to the love above energy, the love of all things and it's going to drop it off there, okay. So just kind of see it go all the way up, up, up, up, 300 feet above your head and you might just see the light kind of transmute it or you might see them pull out the garbage can like a guide or an angel or something like this, pull out the garbage can and just empty it. Okay. Next, I want you to see your sense that there's going to be a gift that comes into the elevator and this gift, I call it The Lover Above Gift Box and it's filled with all the solutions to the things that you let go of, okay. Because some of the things that you let go of were "a problem to you," right? And so we're going to fill you back up now with the energy that's basically the opposite of it, that's the higher frequency, that's the lover above energy, that's the love of all things kind of energy. So see your gift box and push the button, ding! Open the elevator door and allow this gift to show itself. And I want you to grab it out of there and I want you to take the energy in the box and put it inside you. So you might want to just dump it into your heart, or you might want to take your hands and you might see objects in it and take all those objects, like whatever they are and literally ask, what are they for? What gift is this for? And then put them in your heart. So I'll give you a little space here to pull all of that stuff into your energy feel and just take it in like I deserve this lover above energy, I deserve the love of all things, I deserve the solution to any "problem." I say problem lightly because we don't want to create problems, we want to create solutions and happy endings. Or happy new beginnings even. Okay, so allow this light to come in and fill you up, radiating it out 360 degrees all the way around you and allow this gift box to fill you with the highest expression of you, all the formulas for success, compatible life choices and anything else you might feel you need. Maybe super confidence, maybe resilience, maybe happiness, maybe just some more love, kindness, whatever it is. So allow this energy into your field and then just relish it and go to sleep knowing that it will work inside you implementing new strategies overnight and then when you wake up, you'll probably have a new frame of mind, a new framework, that's allowing you to hold more and more and more of the lover above energy. See the goal here is to let go of all resistance, all lower energy, so that it's easy to live in the lover above energy. You see, it's not always easy to live in the lover above energy if you're holding onto a bunch of crud. That crud takes up space, so we have to clear it out so that in the space of you, you're only holding the highest frequency of love. Okay, have a lovely, lovely sleep and evening and tomorrow morning if you have any cool things show up or happen for you, please post them on the Facebook fan page. We would love to hear the cool things that have happened for you. Okay, goodnight, many blessings, ciao.

MEDITATION: Blessing Ball of Light Exercise

- I play with energy for a living. I spent all of my time assessing vibration. It's just kind of fun to me to just sort of notice what's up in the world. I like to get creative and see what happens. For instance, sometimes I ask, "If I add this energy to my life, what comes in? If I add this person to my life, what's my life look like?" I have zero stress on manifesting. I just ask the energy of whatever I desire to show up and pretty soon, it usually shows up in physical form. And you can do this too. Again, you're the creator. But this place-pull approach keeps you out of the lower vibrations of fear, worry, and anxiety. I had a client who used what I'm about to teach you to pull in her mate and get a great love life. She had tried for over a year to call on her mate, yet she was still worried and anxious about it. I asked her guides how to keep her in her creator herself. And I was told to give her this exercise. I call this the Blessing Ball of Light. I have since shown a lot of clients how to do this with their families and I received some really positive feedback. So let's start with blessing your day and your kid's day. A blessing is a high vibrational energy that comes from your heart. It's about adding love to the mix and seeing things work out. I calibrated the energy of myself giving somebody a blessing and it calibrated as high as 760. It all depended on the words and intent that I used. The lowest frequency was 625. And that was just by me saying, "I bless you," to somebody. It didn't matter who. But as long as I had that energy in me and I really felt it, it's just not words. It's feeling it. I bless you from my heart. The 760 was me saying, "I bless you with pure love and light. I bless you with pure source energy." And again, I did this with a feeling of it in my heart. "I bless you with pure love and light, and I bless you with pure source energy." And when I measured it, blessing was higher than peace and joy. I do this as soon as I wake up in the morning. I connect to the light. I allow it to come into my heart. I picture a ball of energy and I call it my day. And I pull in it everything I really choose for my day. Then I place it in my heart and I send the energy out to my day, smoothing everything out with ease and joy and abundance. Because you are a creator creating your life, you can make changes to your day ahead of time. To do this for another individual like your children, give them another ball of energy. Separate them because they have their own life and their own needs. I measured that the average child of the people who bought this program, ages 0 to 11, who did the blessings and the energy ball with them, it would raise our kids consciousness 180%. If their age 12 to 17, the average was about 85%. You see, after age 11, kids really develop their own independence and energetically pull away from their parents. It's important that you embrace the child around 10 to 11 years old and really help them bridge this gap in development. It's one of the most important ages. You can include your interactions with them in the ball of light because they are a part of your day. They're a part of your life. But give them their own ball of energy and their own energy field when you were really blessing them. And better still, of course, teach them how to do it and walk them through it. Kids as young as four and five can do this. So here's how it works. Now, you can play with this, but most often I do it this way. So look up and connect to the light. Let the light in. Fill your whole body as we did, with your head, your shoulders, your heart, your torso, your arms, your hips, your leg. And let a column of light form around you and let the grounding energy move into the center of Earth, connecting to the center of the planet. And picturing there a sense of the ball of light that's about 10 inches across in between your hands. And kind of push and pull it. You can feel that there's a ball of light in your hands if you push and pull with your hands a little bit. Just feel this ball of light and put a mental label on it called my day. If you're doing it for your child, label it your child's name and their day. Labeling, it makes it clear to the universe what you're creating. Let whatever color it wants to be show up. Some days it'll be different. And you can ask your guides what the color means and why did it show up in that color. But some general guidelines are green is for healing and abundance, gold or pink for love, gold for your Godself. I've seen it brown sometimes when somebody needs grounding or red for material and needs being helped. White is quite common. And all the colors of the rainbow are held in the spectrum of white. Sometimes I've seen multicolors or rainbows. I'll just ask what it means. Never assume anything. They could be different in different days. You can face your hands together and push and pull again until you can kind of feel the energy of this energy ball in your hands. And after a bit, you'll probably feel the ball of energy. Most people do. The way you get a visceral feel of the ball and the lights is to do it this way. Now, after you've labeled it my day, calling your guides and angels and ask for assistance on what to add. Just say, "Guides and angels, can you help me add whatever would be lovely to my day?" Then just start adding what you desire your day to be like both on energy quality. So choose things closer to joy, love, celebration, gratitude, blessings. You know, some ease and nice might be fun. And add anything else you wish to show up in your life today: people, places, things, gifts, friendship, loving comments, compliments, attention. It'll just come into your awareness. And while you're imagining it, you're creating it. It's how creation works. Imagine it long enough and it'll show up. If you have clients, see the kind of energy you need for them for the day. If you need love, add love. And see everyone who thinks of you receive love, joy and gratitude just by thinking of you or being with you. I've been putting this in my energy field for the last year or so. And a friend of mine from LA called up one day and said, "The strangest thing happened in meditation this morning. I sent you some energy and you sent it right back to me. It's all great." She goes, "I spent a lot of people energy over the years, but nobody's ever returned it. It was kind of out me. It felt good again." Again, that was confirmation to me that my spiritual gifts work because I had been putting in my energy field that everyone who thinks of me receives love, light, peace, joy, and gratitude from me, right? If you need guidance all day, maybe see the word guidance go into your bubble or see a specific guide and angel do it. If you need focus for a test of your child, add focus. Got a busy day? Add completion to your project. If you need the phone ringing off the hook bringing you money, add phone ringing with people wanting to bring you money. If you have an issue with a person or a longstanding unforgiven thing, see kindness and forgiveness going into your bubble. You can add smooth sales, a smooth road ahead. See yourself having fun with your children and your mate. If you need any help on your health, ask for a healthy lifestyle. Ask for great health to show up and your body to morph into a happy, healthy size, whatever your body wants to be or whatever your body says a happy, healthy, and however many pounds. You can bless your space. You can bless your office. You can bless your car, your home. Fill it up with a rainbow of good vibes kind of energy. You can add extra energy and oomph to your body for the day. So keep filling it with joy, love, consciousness, plenty of abundance and health, wealth, and happiness, ease, joy with your family, friends, coworkers. See people receiving you well. See your mate telling you they love you. See your children joy-filled. Just add whatever your heart desires. And when it feels full, then just be with it for a moment and add the energy of, "I bless myself with pure love and light. I bless myself with purified source energy. I bless myself with pure love and light. I bless myself with purified source energy. I bless myself with a pure love and light. I bless myself with purified source energy. I bless myself with pure love and light. I bless myself with purified source energy." Now, if it's for your child, obviously, just say your child's name and, "I blessed my child with pure love and light. I bless my child with pure source energy." And you can even do this while you're driving. I bless strangers, mailboxes, you name it. I have probably blessed it. And why do I do that? Because I love the vibration in my body. And it helps with manifesting and getting your life to look a certain way. And when you feel complete, put your blessing ball of light into your heart. See your day radiating out to your heart, projecting wherever you intend all the way around you. It's your reality coming into your creator self, emanating from the heart of the matter. You are the creator that's choosing the matter. I'll give you some other examples in the future of things you're can ask for. If you know your child has a particular thing they need help on, like being grounded in the world, add that. If they need super confidence, add that. Just see it pouring into the ball of light and filling your child's body with the elixir of super confidence and everything goes well. Or if your kids need new friends, see these friends coming into your lives. I had a mom call me and her child had ADD and could not sit still in class. So she started using this and in a few days she noticed a difference in her kid. She put a ball around the child so the child feels focused and peaceful. She was guided that he needed to exercise for a half an hour, so she saw him doing that as well. I hear reports that it works for people. I was out of the country teaching the class and we did this blessing. This woman found her lost passport and her last necklace in a bag. And she had looked there five times earlier that day. It wasn't there earlier. And after she did this, it was there. What she did was she added finding her passport and her necklace in the blessing ball of light. And then she found it. If you have a mate, be guided in how to bless their day. I believe you can do those for people. Just keep it on the side of what is the happiest and best, good for them. You could just have a ball of light that says happiness, ease and joy, happy travels, fun with the family, ease with the boss. Obviously, the best thing to do is to ask your mate to start blessing their own day. I had a client who told me there's no way her husband would do this. I just laughed. And I had her ask him if he was opposed to using the light in his life. He said no. So she got him to push and pull his hands until he could feel the energy of the ball of light. And then she asked him to fill it in with whatever he needed. He did it. He thought it was funny, but he went along with it. She called in her angels and said, "Please let him know this works." So he went to work. And he had a boss, who was always hard on him, actually compliment him that day. He called to tell her about it. He thought it was very interesting the boss did that. She reminded him to do it for a while and to visualize his day a success. One day, I went to play Bingo with a friend. We like to do it to just practice manifesting. I usually win. So try it out sometime. So we bless the space and we use the energy of grace. Grace is like WD-40. And it adds to whatever you're doing. Right after I finished doing this, a man working for the Bingo parlor walks over to me and hands me a bouquet of flowers. And all he said was, "These are for you." And I kind of looked and go, "Thanks." And I started laughing. And he went back to work handing out tickets to everyone. I said, "Why?" And he said, "Well, you just deserve these." So read into it, whatever you will. But out of 50 other people in the room, right after I sent out grace and blessings, why did he come over and hand me flowers? I bless my purse and wallet, more money seems to show up right after I did. At one time, I walked into my closet, put on my jacket to go to the movies. I hadn't worn it in a year. I put my hand in the pocket and I pulled out $20. It worked that quickly. So that was my wish for you, that you do the blessing ball of light and more and more blessings and higher vibrations come into your life.

MEDITATION: Heart Center Awakening Meditation

- This meditation is to open and awaken your heart center. Get in a comfortable position. And when you are ready, close your eyes. Take a deep breath, and relax. Take another deep breath, and relax. Look up. Go up to where you can connect and feel the light. Allow the light to come into your body and fill your head, fill your face, fill your ears, fill your brain, and let the light move into your throat, your shoulders. And allow this liquid light to move through your arms, your elbows, and out your hands. And allow this light to continue from your throat down into your chest and your heart space. Feel it going deep into your ribcage, your abdomen, filling in all the nooks and crannies with light. Allow this light to move into your hips, your thighs, and move the light into your knees, your calves, and your feet. Allow this energy, this light to move into the ground, and send a beam of light through the earth and connect to the center of the planet, where it feels the happiest. Feel this earthly, loving support and allow the earth to give something back to you, and send some energy up this beam of light, right into your own heart. You're inviting in the highest light source from below and above. It's vibrating at the highest rate, vibrating from pure consciousness. And when you're ready, connect to your heart, where both lights are meeting, and breathe in light through the middle of your heart, and allow this light to expand out into a bubble of light, filling your heart center with pure loving consciousness. Connect to your heart and think, I love, I love, I love. I open and receive the energy of more and more love. And take another deep breath, and breathe in light through the middle of your heart, and allow it to expand out around your body into a bubble of pure, loving energy, surrounding and encompassing your body. And think, I love, I love, I love. I open and receive the energy of more and more love. Breathe in light through the middle of your heart, and allow it to expand out, filling your body with more and more love. And feel, I love, I love, I love. I am open to receiving more and more love. And take another deep breath, and breathe in light through the middle of your heart, and allow it to fill in the bubble of energy surrounding your body. Allow this energy to move in between the spaces of all the spaces, in between the molecules and the cells, in between your DNA, your RNA, your mitochondria, creating perfect spheres of love. I love, I love, I love. Allow this light to infuse all the atomic and subatomic levels, and generating vitality in all ways. I love, I love, I love. Breathe in light through the middle of your heart and allow it to fill in the energy that is you, filling you with pure loving consciousness. I love, I love, I love. I receive more and more love. Know that you can always return to this space of love at any time. You just have to breathe it in the center of your heart and allow it to expand within you. I love, I love, I love.

MEDITATION: Clearing Past Beliefs

- How many times a day do you ask, "What would it take?" You know how that thing about unconsciously competent, it's like I've been doing it so long that I all of a sudden intend for everything to happen, I really am choosing my life all day long, consciously choosing it, you know? If I'm working on somebody, what I'm choosing is for all their blocks to release. If I'm eating food, I'm choosing for it to be a nourishing, rewarding experience. If I'm calling somebody on the phone, I'm choosing for it to be nourishing and rewarding. So, everything in my life is pretty much what I make. Maria says, "Do we need to say what would it take "out loud and focused?" Well, for sure, Maria, you have to believe it when you're saying it. So if it feels like if you say it out loud, you believe it more, and focused, it feels like you believe it more. So for you, I would say, definitely. But eventually what'll happen, I hear, is you won't have to say it out loud, you'll just believe it. "Should we focus on one thing at a time?" Here's the thing, the thing you guys is you can't do too much, and you can't really do it wrong. Okay? So I'll give you an example of a what would it take session that I would do for myself, in the evening. So, let's just say I was trying to manifest an extra 10,000 this month, okay? So, we'll just focus in on abundance for a minute. But I would just say given how I know what my business is like, I would say, "What would it take for an extra 10,000 to show up "by the end of September?" I would say, "What would it take for me to generate "500 new clients finding my website? "What would it take for the 500 clients who find my website "to feel the love and light that I wish to impart on them? "And what would it take for them to want to share "in my Love or Above toolkit?" And everything in the way of that, uncreate it all. "What would it take for everybody who sees me, "hears me, looks at me, finds me, feels love, "light and blessings from me, "and wants more blessings in their life from me?" Or I could be specific, I'd say, "What would it take for a speaking gig to show up "that puts me in front of 2,000 new people? "And everything in the way of that, uncreate it all." So, I sat down one day and I said, "What would it take for me to reach a million people, "or over a million people?" And literally within a couple days, I got a phone call to be on one of the biggest radio stations in Los Angeles, and I was there, I was on this station for about a year, every Sunday night, so it could've been 30 million people that I reached, right? Can you see how I'm not really focusing on one thing? I might have an overall thing that I'm focusing on, and then when I feel complete with that one item. So, I hope that clarifies, you can't really do it too much. Okay, Maria wants to know why she's procrastinating, 'cause she's just afraid to move forward. It's just this little fear about moving forward, you're waiting for some big aha, instead of just going, "Shazam!" Okay, so everywhere you guys are afraid to move forward, uncreate and delete all that. Anywhere you guys are waiting for somebody to hereby inaugurate you, or say you're it, or give you permission to go forward, everything that is, uncreate and delete all that. JC is asking if she's procrastinating because she's afraid, or just lazy. And actually you're not lazy, I heard you're a little angry, 'cause you really want to change, but you're afraid to change, and you're angry that you have to change, because you still, at the end of the day, wanted everything to happen the way you wanted it, and now you're a little angry that it's not going to happen the way you want it. So, you're actually kind of a little angry is what I'm hearing. So, anything in the way of you guys moving forward, 'cause you're a little angry that you have to change, uncreate it and delete it all. Yeah, how many of you guys are angry 'cause you actually have to change? Everything that is, we uncreate and delete it all. Everywhere you guys are mad 'cause things in the past didn't work out the way you wanted it to, everything that is, we uncreate and delete that, across all time, dimension, space, and reality. What's the best thing to do when you notice that you're believing that nothing will change? Well, it's kind of like you're going to have to do two things, you're going to have to say, "What would it take "for everything in my life to change?" And you're going to have to say, "Everything in my life "that's stopped or stuck, I uncreate it all, "delete it all. "Everything I'm avoiding, I uncreate it all," 'cause usually if you're stuck, you're avoiding something. So, I would do change, clear changing, clear what you're avoiding, and clear what you don't know. Annette wants to know, this is the same question I have Annette, by the way, "Why are some people "so against changing themselves? "Do they have some intractable belief "that keeps them stuck? "Do they not have enough desire for a better life, "or perhaps believe they are not capable of changing?" So Annette is asking really the most profound question, and the real truth of the answer is, I want you guys to all tap into yourself right now, so connect to the light, be 300 feet tall, connect to the heart of the matter, the truth of the matter, the part of you that knows everything. I want you to ask, "Why am I refusing to change?" And what I'm hearing is most people have a conclusion, which is a belief by the way. They've made the conclusion that I have no idea how to change, which is not true, because if you really think about it, you guys are changing at every moment, of every second, of every day. You breathe, you change, right? Okay, so any of you guys who taught yourself, "I have no idea how to change," uncreate and delete all that. Anywhere else you guys bought the lie I have no idea how to change, uncreate and delete it all. Everywhere I have no idea how to change and I don't want to change, uncreate and delete it all, and everywhere your misery is more important than your gratitude for your life, uncreate and delete all that. Christina asked a really good question again, "When I do muscle testing, the questions for the present "are mostly correct, and the questions projected "into the future are a little more inaccurate." And that is true, do you know why? This is why I don't really like reading people's futures. Because you're an infinite being, creating multiple futures, all at the same time. If you read your future, and you don't choose that future all along the way, then that future won't show up. So, you have to understand, in every now moment, you are creating your future. So, that's why it's important to always be present choosing things that you really, really, really want to have, versus saying things like, "This doesn't work "and I can't move forward." So, Christina's saying, "A guide showed up in a dream "and was talking but there was no sound." So, everywhere you blocked the message, 'cause you were afraid of getting help, uncreate and delete it all. Everywhere having guides would be scary to you, uncreate and delete it all. I hear anywhere you guys shut off your connection to the light, and to your guides, and your higher self, uncreate and delete all that, across all time, dimension, space, and reality. How many of you are depressed? So, anybody who's depressed and suppressed, not willing to be 300 feet tall and be over it, uncreate and delete that across all time, dimension, space, and reality. What if I feel as though I'm not connecting with any level of the light? Well John, it's actually impossible for you to not be connected, 'cause you are light. So, I want you guys to all get that you are light-filled, soul-filled beings and pieces of the light, in a way. So, you're all connected to the light, but I can answer the question, because it feels like you don't feel, at some level, that you are worth it. So, it feels like John, what it really feels like to me is that you somewhere disconnected yourself and decided life was hard, or not easy, or not good, and I'm not sure if you remember when you really disconnected from that. But anywhere that is, uncreate and delete that, across all time, dimension, space, and reality. And it seems like you turned down your feelings, so everything in the way of you feeling life, or allowing it in, uncreate and delete that across all time, dimension, space, and reality. If you start to feel down and things are not coming fast enough, what do you do? You know, what I do is I just keep doing a what would it take? So, I went to this seminar, it was a seminar on negotiating, and he wanted to prove to us that we are all able to negotiate many things from anywhere, at any time, even a normal store, like a Nordstrom's, or a Macy's, or something like that. So, what he did as part of the exercise is he sent us to the mall, and he told us that we had to negotiate and buy three items at a negotiated price, less than what they were marked. So, you have to imagine, there's 500 people that he just sent to the mall. So, I went into a couple stores, and I was trying to negotiate things, and you have to understand, the people have already met 20 people trying to negotiate things. So, all these shop owners are going crazy, 'cause they're like, "Why is everybody trying "to negotiate things with me?" Right? I decided deep down inside myself that no matter what it takes, no matter what it takes, I'm going to be a winner in this exercise, just for my own personal benefit, even when there's obstacles in my way, I'm going to make the choice to make it happen. So, as soon as I made that choice, deep down, I was guided to go into the health club, there was a health club there in the mall, and nobody was going into the health club, 'cause there was a certain kind of nutrition that I liked to take. And so, I went to the back where the store was, and I said, "Hey, do you have this brand of nutrition?" And they did. So, I basically negotiated and bought three things, and I got two free tee shirts on top of it, I got some extra gifts and bonuses. And so, I basically got five things, instead of the three. I walked outside the mall, and I was asking everybody how they did, and they said, "Oh, I didn't do so well," and they were giving me all their excuses, like "This doesn't work, and there's too many people, "and the shop owner's this, and I couldn't make it happen, "and blah, blah, blah, blah." For me, it was just proof inside my own self, it was like a cellular imprint that just kind of came over me of, "Okay, now I know what it feels to basically exceed "my expectations," and so, there's a certain feeling in my body when I think of that story that I can go to at any time to kind of create that energy into my future. Everybody listening, I want you to just think for a minute of some time when you really made something happen and it totally excited you. So, just think of a moment when you made something happen and it completely and totally excited you. Or something you want, and it completely and totally thrilled and excited you. Or a gift you got for your birthday, or Christmas when you were a kid and it completely and totally thrilled and excited you. Okay, so the cellular memory of that, what would it take for the cellular memory of that to increase? What would it take for all that to increase in your life? But that moment, that feeling of pure joy, and love, and all that, that's the moment that you can go back to at any time and just really, really create for yourself a generous, abundant future. So, her question originally was, "If I start to feel down about things, what do I do?" I go into that energy of, I'll do whatever it frickin' takes in order to make this thing happen. So, it's like a determinism that's so deep rooted that I'm going to make it happen. That's personally what I do, and then I take action. Everywhere you guys are blocked in taking some sort of action, or some affirmative stance that I'm going to do whatever it takes in my life, then create and delete all that. David wants to know how he can break free from the block that's holding him back from being his true self. "How can I break free from a block that's holding me back?" You know David, I'm actually just feeling like you need to move into the higher vibration energy a little bit more. It just feels like you need to just really be joyful and happy, and then everything kind of comes from that. So, I would play a little more. Grace is saying, "at one point I said the left side "of her body was related to mom, is it cleared mostly?" Yes, but it feels like Grace, you just have to say, "What would it take for me to love my body "and for my body to love me?" And have a relationship with your body. Think of your body like a pet, and love it every day. So, it feels like you just need to really, really love your body, and ask it, and talk to it, and ask it to tell you things about what it needs. 'Cause your body will happily show you what it wants for food, what it wants for exercise, what it wants to drink. You know, your body will happily show you those things if you ask it questions. That's generally how I do my life is I ask everything questions and it will tell me. Anka, "So what is the unfinished business "that I still have with my family? "Why do I get so irritated whenever I talk to them "over the phone?" Anka, it's because they have a really kind of negative vibe sometimes, it feels like their energy is they don't like life either. So, you're just going to have to, whenever you talk to them, you're going to have to uncreate and delete everything that makes you mad about it. Sarah's asking a question, "Can our spouses be the blocks? "I think I should leave him, but I'm still finding it "hard to trust myself. "He's very negative." Nobody can block you unless you allow it, but oftentimes people will be blocked by their parents or a spouse because they want the spouse, or their parents, to love them. And in order to get love, you lower your energy to meet where they are, instead of getting over them and being bigger than they are, and allowing them to catch up to you. So, anywhere you are blocking yourself, so it's not that he blocks you, it's that you're blocking yourself, so you don't have trust yourself, so you don't have to make a choice to leave or not leave, because then you can remain incompetent and incapable, and then it won't be your fault. So, really what you're doing is you want to be a nice person, and you don't want to be the one that hurts anybody. So, everything that is, uncreate it across all time, dimension, space, and reality. So, Sarah, if I were you, I would do what would it take for me to clear all my blocks to believing that he's more important than me? What would it take that would make me genuinely and truly happy in my life? And then I would focus on growing myself before I left the marriage, so I would focus on myself until I got really strong, and then make the decision from a place of strength. I'm going to say that with a caveat to anybody listening who just heard that, if you're being abused, obviously do not stay in an abusive situation. You know, it feels like somebody's going to take what I just said and think that, I dunno, I just picked up that somebody might be being abused, and you shouldn't stay in anything that's abusive, good question Sarah. Isabelle wants to know how to release a family curse that her sister was told exists in her genetic lines? I would just keep saying, "What would it take "for whatever's blocking me and my family "from moving forward? "Uncreate and delete it all." So, any of you guys listening that have genetics blocking you, uncreate and delete that across all time, dimension, space, and reality. All of you guys who are listening who have no hope for the future because you keep choosing to procrastinate your future, and deny that you are the chooser of it, everything that is, uncreate and delete that across all time, dimension, space, and reality. Okay, "How can I get friends when I never had anyone? "I do not know what to do. "What I've been doing is not working." Okay Sabrina, that's a really great question. You know, and if any of you guys are parents, by the way, I would really suggest this. I think confidence can be taught to kids, I remember this little shy little girl, and I watched her interacting, I was at a friend's house, and I watched her interacting. And I came across this little girl through friends more than one time, and what I noticed is she always hung out by herself, 'cause she really didn't know how to go get friends. So what I did is, one time without the adults around, or embarrassing her, I just had a little chat with her, and I said, "Hey, do you know how to make friends?" And she's like, "Well, nobody likes me." And I go, "Oh, well, why do you think that?" She had an older sister who was always kind of hitting her and doing all those kind of things, so she thought nobody liked her. So, she wasn't going to get new friends. And so, what I told her is, I gave her a couple little tips, I said, "Look, it's easy to play with people "if you just kind of compliment them, "tell them something you like about them "and ask if you can play." So, I taught her how to compliment people to kind of open the door, because who's going to really shut the door, if you say, "Oh, I like your dress," or, "Oh, you're so pretty," or "Oh, blah, blah, "blah, blah, blah." And so, I had her practice with me, a couple times, and I saw this light bulb come back in her eyes, and it's like she got the download, you know? So, the reason I'm bringing this up is 'cause I see a lot of kids and they just don't have the confidence to go talk to people. And I think it's a skill that you can teach them. So, that's the way it felt like to tell that girl is talk to her about complimenting somebody, and it opens them up. And so, she got really good at complimenting people at first, and then it opened people up, and then they could see who she was, that she was a lovely girl. Any of you guys who have problems creating friends, manifesting friends, or feel blocked by the life skill to create new people to like you, everything that is, uncreate and delete it all. So, let's just say that I don't know you, but I notice something that I really like about you, and it's genuine. So, I say, "Wow, that is," for girls, we love shoes, and clothes, and handbags, right? So, "Wow, that's a really great handbag you have, "where'd you get it? "I love it." Or, "Wow, you have such style." Or if you're a guy, you could just say something about, "Wow, you're a bright light," or, "Wow, you're kind of glowy today." So, practice complimenting people, or being grateful for something. Like what if you guys practiced giving a couple compliments to your family members? That would seriously change your family life if you complimented your family. So Sabrina, that's my answer to you. So, you're going to have to put yourself in places where you can meet new people somehow, you could do coffee shops, you know, the book, "How to Win Friends and Influence People", he basically talks about how in any conversation, if you just talk about the other person and ask what's important to them, more than talking about yourself, people basically want to be seen by other people. And the way to make a lot of friends is to really be open to receiving them. See, the reason people tell me all their problems is 'cause my energy is set to the place where I can receive people. No matter what junk they got goin' on, I don't judge them, I just love them. So, that's what people feel from me, that I don't do judgment, and I just love people. So Sabrina, I would just really try to get out in public a little bit more, and go to coffee shops and just start talkin' to people, and then somethin'll happen. Aliyah's, "What do I do to get rid of an ex out of my life?" You're going to have to just keep booting him out for a little while, and the only way to do it is trust it and do it, and trust it, and do it, and trust it, and do it, and eventually somewhere, he'll go away. So, Aliyah, really, really, really, the most important thing I can tell you right now is you really, really, really just have to do the work and know that it'll work. So, you might not be there all the way yet, but I promise you, if you keep just doing the work, eventually it all turns around. 'Cause you're talking yourself out of doing the work by not trusting yourself. But you should be proud of yourself. Nicholas, "What can I do to bring more fun to my life?" I took a comedy class at UCLA, because I thought it'd be really funny to be psychic and a comedian at the same time, 'cause I actually still think that would be funny, but then my business picked up so much that I didn't have time to pursue both. I was trying to get the download about what fun is, or what comedy is, or what funny is, because there was some block that I had about seeing what was funny. Because what was happening is a lot of people were trying to be funny by the negative way, and I didn't want to be funny the negative way, I wanted to be funny the positive way, kind of like Ellen, like Ellen DeGeneres. She's funny the positive way. And everybody in my class, it seemed like they were doing funny the negative, pessimistic way, and I'm like, "I can't do that funny. "I don't want to do that, I don't want to pick on people," you know? I got this download, I realized that fun and funny is actually just an energy field, and if I held this energy field in my field, and I told stories, people would laugh for no reason. And I'm thinking, "God, this is so not funny, "why are they laughing?" And it's because I brought in the energy of funny. So, at that point Nicholas, what I really, really, really realized is the energy of fun is just an energy, and if you can embody that, you can have fun doing anything. So, now I know the logical part of everybody listening is going, "Well, how do I embody fun?" So, I would just say, I would just do over and over again, what energy of fun can I receive that would change my whole life? And everything in the way of that, delete it all. What energy of fun can I receive that would improve and upgrade my whole life, and everything in the way of it, delete it all. And the other thing that I have done in the past, I will go hang out with little kids, 'cause little kids have fun energy, and then I will duplicate whatever they're doing. Kids have fun doing anything, so you know, it's just kind of a certain energy frequency is really what I'm trying to impart upon you. So, you know how at the mall they have the place where the little kids are playing? Go play with the little kids. "How can I heal a sick pet?" Basically, you can bless a person, you can bless a pet, you can bless an animal, you can bless a plant, you can do all those things, but they have to be open to receiving. I want you to think about nature, nature is very open to receiving, usually a lot more than us, because we have more points of view. So, how do you heal a sick pet? Well, it depends. I mean, a sick pet can be sick because of either toxins from their emotions, that they pick up from other people around them, or they can be toxic from whatever you fed them, or whatever they've ingested in their body, right? So, you have to either heal it from food and nutrition, or from energy. And so, I'm just hearing in your case, I hear it's a little of both. I mean, I think that the dog, the body needs to be cleaned out at some level, with nutrition, so you might want to go talk to a vet about that as well. "What do we do to help our society, "which seems to be more entitlement-driven, "while not contributing to the growth of society "as a whole?" That's a really great question. Yeah, you know, it's really funny, I was reading an article today about this guy who basically he was a principal, and what he did is he gave up his salary, it was a long story, but let's just say he basically gave all his salaries and benefits back to the school district, which over his lifetime would be like $820,000 so that it could help balance the budget and keep a lot of the school programs going. They were interviewing him, and he does all this philanthropic things on a very low salary. And people are wondering, how does he do that? And there's not that many people like him. So, it just kind of showed me the same energy that you're talking about William, which is, why can't we all be kind to each other and somehow contribute? There's different levels of contribution, there's contributing to ourself, and you could do this. I mean, this is kind of how I look at my life, I ask, I make a little goal list for my year, and I ask, what can I do to contribute to myself? That's question number one, question number two, what can I do to contribute to my family? What can I do to contribute to the world? What can I do to contribute to nature and everything that supports me? And so then, I just make a choice every year, what that would look like in my life, and I kind of break down when I say contribute to society, I have two pictures, I have my local society, where I live, and I have the big picture society, like the world. And so, I break it down into what I can do to help in all those different levels. But that's a really great question, because when you're a giver, when you give, you're also receiving at the same time, if your flows are totally opened. So, when I'm giving, when I'm doing all this unlimited abundance, you guys can probably imagine that I'm also receiving the downloads, right? So, my giving creates this flow where I'm also receiving simultaneously. So, giving and receiving simultaneously is obviously the ultimate goal. It's a really good question William, I would encourage you guys to really think, the next six months, what can I do to contribute to my family? What can I contribute to my society? My town, my state, that kind of thing, and then, what can I contribute to the world? And what can I contribute to nature? 'Cause I think Mother Earth needs blessings and attention from us, we really do. Arthur's saying he hit a wall. You know, thank you Arthur for phrasing it the way you did, you said, "I hit a wall, what is the shift "that needs to happen? "And can my challenge also contribute to others?" So, thank you Arthur for including all of us in your thing. It feels like it has to do with your mom, an imprint in your mother that you can't really receive. So, I would do everywhere my mother doesn't let me receive things, uncreate and delete it all. Everywhere I lowered myself to fit my mom's model, instead of my own, I uncreate and delete all that too. And everywhere I can't see what my next step is, I uncreate and delete all that. So, I would just keep deleting and uncreating everywhere your mom's energy blocks you from receiving for a couple of weeks, and then I would say, what would it take for me to be an excellent receiver of my good? What would it take for me to be an excellent receiver of my finances? What would it take for me to be richly rewarded? And what would it take for me to reap what I sow? JC wants to know if there's some universal mantra, what you could do, what would it take for all of my life to be joyful, abundant, happy, loved, and kind to myself? Every day and every way, my life is better, and better, and better is a good one. Sarah Del, you're asking a really great question, so she's asking, "Why can't you just go bam, "and clear everything all at once?" So, there's two sides to that story. So, the answer is you could go "Bam," if you're really, really, really willing to let it all go and just go to the next level, and bump into the next self. So, there's always a part of yourself that's totally attuned, totally perfect, totally aligned, that you can just go, "Shazam," and just kind of bump into it. And then you might ask, "Well, why don't I?" If you guys go back to the day when we connected to your future self, that would be the best way to probably get into that self, the one that's happy, alive, well, abundant, and already made it. If you have 3,000 thoughts a day, and 3,000 thoughts a day times 20, 30, 40, 50, 60 years, you can see, that's why you're a little stuck. But the truth is, these energy clearings have changed people way quicker than anything I have ever seen, truthfully.

MEDITATION: Clearing Fundamental Blocks

- Hi, this is Christie Marie Sheldon. Thank you so much for joining me. You know, in this session, I'm going to help you clear the reasons why you identify with less abundance than you truly deserve. Your abundance energy is set to the exact level of your current income and savings and debt. And I want to help you shift that very energy sticking you to these old energy patterns. You know, limits to how much abundance you are allowing, keeping, having, generating, and creating are examples of what I want to help you clear. Are you aware that your energy can have a blueprint and a foundation lying beneath the surface? And no matter how much effort you put forward, this blueprint, this foundation will actually limit your businesses and your ability to make money. Now, if you were to energetically tap into this blueprint, into this foundation, you're going to see some ways that you have made the doors to life and your abundance either energetically open or close. And you might be wondering, can this blueprint, this foundation, can it shift? Well, yeah. If you're willing to see the various events and times in your life that these limits got imprinted into your blueprint, into your foundation. Core beliefs about life come into your field when you're young. In fact, mostly your limits are placed into your energy by the time that you're seven. Your personal history can block your life because these occurrence and the realities that you believed happened. They did happen, and that's why you believe them. So if you, for instance, believe that mom and dad's story is about money and about abundance, you know, maybe one such example might be that you can't have enough money, or maybe they had a belief that they were broke or poor, or maybe you had to witness your mom and dad's stress about money. Then this made it more real because you historically saw it. It imprinted into your reality. You made it more real. You made it part of your blueprint, your foundation. You know, everyone's family history is different. I've even seen people who grew up wealthy and because their parents gave them everything, they had a blueprint or a foundation that made them believe that they had no idea how to make money for themselves. You know, it's always different for everyone, these abundance blocks. Life is not a fixed energetic limited concept. You know, life is this creative flowing thing. And you're the creator being who happens to have a body to animate and live life through. Now, some examples of energetically proper beliefs to have are, I can have more than enough, that there's plenty of resources available to you. Another example of a really great belief is that you are able to create your life your way, that life is something I deserve to manifest in my direction, in my own way. You need to know and believe that you're the creator being in a body that can make stuff happen. Now, energy is the main component. You can believe logically that these things are true. You can hear my words and think, "Christie, I know that, but my life is still not working." And that's because your blueprint is hiding some secrets. Your blueprint is filled with these undercover foundational things that you were printed from the past. And they're the ones that are blocking you. It's not logical what I'm speaking of, it's energetic. It's what you feel about money. Your life is not static or fixed in one place. You're constantly making judgments and decisions about life all day long. You're always either contracting against life and reacting against life, or you're creating life. You might even be complaining about your life and this can reinforce your subconscious beliefs that you might have down there, that life is hard, that money is hard to keep, that you're not abundant, or life isn't working out for you. When these things come out of your mouth, when you speak of money, it's also a large clue as to what is inside you. You know, the underlying energy though, is the most important thing. The words can sometimes show you what's deep inside you, you know, complaining energy, for instance, might have underneath it a belief that it's impossible to fix my life, or it's not easy to fix my life. You know, because if it was easy, you wouldn't be complaining about it, you'd actually just go do it, right? You know, think of the Nike slogan, "Just do it." So if you're complaining, that's a clue that you might have some imprinted foundational belief that's kind of messing up your life. Now, let me ask you a question. When you wake up in the morning, are you happy to go to work? Are you happy about your life? Are you waking up alive and well and full-throttle moving towards your deepest, juiciest desires? An answer of no to any of those things means that you're blocked somewhere. Now, the energy that I'm speaking of can be modified. These blocks can be modified if you know how to. And I'm teaching you these concepts so that you can move into what I call in my "Love or Above" program, the love or above energy field. And this is the energy field where all the things in your life basically are lined up on full power, allowing you to be in the complete positive, abundant flow in your life. You know, if you're not happy in some area of your life, the problem is the blueprint, the foundation, period. That's it. You have some other core belief or blueprint that's in the way. And I think that most people are not spending near enough time cleaning up this foundation, this blueprint, they're just complaining, or procrastinating, or going with the energy of I don't know what to do. Right? Which is very, very disempowering. That's why I want to teach you these techniques so that you can move through it. People will say to me, "Christie, why, I've worked on some of these things." But yeah, you haven't found the exact thing in your blueprint that's the problem. You know, your foundation that you've been living in has been there for however old you are, 20, 30, 40, 50 years. And maybe you never ever went into your subconscious, looking for the exact answer as to, what the heck is down there? And I'm going to lead you into this abyss of unconscious energy blocking ideas and concepts, and move you into the energetic equivalence of abundance and fun and pleasant energy, enjoyment about money and debt, and income, and work, and more. Your life depends on this being fixed. Your life depends on you being active and playing full out, participating in finally getting to these root programs and shifting them once and for all. Your life is not going to change until you identify and corral out all the old junk that's waiting underneath your flow and creating the problems in your life. Your life is the beliefs that you imprinted or laid into your blueprint, into your foundation. Your life is composed of a bunch of false ideas and gunk that's making you unhappy. Your life is going to change only if you put the effort in it to change. You have to actively participate in making life a new way for you. So the whole journey is about scouting out the blocks, eliminating them, and farther down the road, and it could be a week, it could be today, it could be tomorrow, who knows, but farther down the road, you're going to see that was totally and completely worth it. It's going to take some effort, but it's a worthy effort. You deserve it. Don't you think you deserve it? I certainly do. Part of the problem is that people can't find their subconscious blocks. And I say to people, "Check out your language." When you're speaking about abundance and money in your normal, everyday life. I want you to remember that your language is the key factor in creation. Your language is also showing you how you think about things. I want you to believe that your language is the main component in shifting your life. That's why I use energy clearing statements mixed with your total commitment, your intention in energy shifting. And I use these clearing statements to make your life whole and beautiful. And in the energetic model that creates abundance and more than enough to go around. I like to think of money like the concept of energy. If I'm putting out the right energy, I make life happy for me. I like it. I make it more abundant for me. You know, if you walk around kind of complaining, or whining, or beating yourself up, or judging yourself, or even attacking yourself, then you become stuck in this energy of, I can't, I won't, I wouldn't, I couldn't, I shouldn't, maybe not, or even no. I don't want you stuck in that kind of energy. And your language helps point out where you're at. You know, I want you to laugh and enjoy the energy that you put out, not judge it. Most people look at energy like a light bulb that it's either on or off. And I look at energy like a dimmer. You know, with a dimmer, you can just turn it on brighter, and brighter, and brighter, and brighter. And all of that is basically the components to what finding these blocks is all about, clearing them, eliminating the gunk that's in the way. And you keep turning on your energy brighter, and brighter, and brighter, and brighter. You know, money is just a choice, cleaning out and finding these foundational things is just a choice. If money is your main complaint in life, it means that you're in the energy is somewhere of, I'm not worthy of more. You're turning down, you're taking that dimmer and you're turning down the most valuable resource you have, which is yourself. And so we want to turn the most valuable resource, yourself, we want to turn that light up brighter and brighter. On a daily basis, I want you loving money, loving abundance, love to make it, love to keep it, love to accumulate it, love to have it, love to share it, love to prosper in it. And I want you to just know that there's more than enough to go around, and if I can get your energy there, and I know I can, as long as you willingly participate, you're going to see huge changes in your life. The energy of I can't and I won't, and I couldn't, and I shouldn't are all the energy blocks. That's why you have to look at your daily languaging, your daily kind of energy, how you feel about money or life or work when you go for it or don't go for it. A block can come in many forms. A block can really slow down your manifesting and, you know, your life is the main energy flow. If your life is energy up, loving and enjoying everything, and happiness is your natural state, then you were in the flow, baby. If your life is in the flow of love, you create a cool kind of resurrecting energy that moves mountains of old gunk out. You know, this higher vibrational energy that I speak of that you have to pour within you moves a lot of stuff out rather quickly. You know, your life depends on you being happy. Your life depends on you being in the energy of yes, and go for it, and up-ness, and just do it. Your life depends on you creating, you know, creating love or above energy in your daily routine. Your life depends on making new ideas about money come true in your life. And you are the most important thing in your life. Now, in order to recover your talents in life, and I look at it like a recovery, right? If you look at kids, they naturally know how to enjoy life or play with life. They naturally know how to bring friends and people to them. They naturally know how to share. They're doing all sorts of, you know, I have plenty and I'm going to make things happen in my life. And so I look at it like we're recovering your natural talents and abilities that somehow somewhere got programmed out of you. So if you have fears that life is not going to be easy or the way you want it, then these energies are your freedom blocking beliefs. So can you see that if you're desiring a new life, you have to find and demolish the very beliefs that are stealth, hidden and blocking your very dream life. So are you ready to start identifying some of these? I'm going to start with a few basics so that you can scout around. And here's the thing, I want you to find these blocks right away. And I'm going to show you how your subconscious knows the answers to where some of these things are. So I'm going to ask you right now to go get a pen or a paper, or if it's not too distracting, I want you to type on your computer. Do whatever the natural flow is that would be the least distracting and the most supportive energy, okay? So put it on pause. Get your computer out or get a pen and paper. Okay, now I'm going to ask a question and then I'm going to have you trust whatever first pops into your mind and I want you to write it down. Just write down the things that come to mind, whatever it is. Even if it doesn't make logical sense, write it down. Don't go get hung up in, why did this come to the surface? What does this mean? I want you to just write it down. Your mind is going to want to distract you maybe and get you into this energy, what's that mean? Why, why, why? That's because your mind sometimes doesn't want you to find the blocks and it'll actually try to distract you. So tell your mind, thank you so much for caring for me, but I'm in charge today, and we're going to find out some new info about myself. And, you know, you could look at your mind like a recalcitrant little child and just tame it for a moment. Okay. So ready? First thing that comes to mind. Any longer than that, you're doing some sort of distraction. Okay. So write this down, whatever first comes to your mind when I ask this question. What is one belief you have about money? I believe that money is what? And I'm going to ask this question again, just kind of in a free flowing manner. And I want you to write down everything that comes up. I believe that money is. I believe that money is. Okay, write down the next thing that comes up. I believe that money is. I believe that my money is. I believe that my money is. I believe that money is. I believe that money is. Okay, and I'll phrase it a little differently, but what is one other belief that you have about money? What's another belief about money? What's another belief about money? Okay, money is. Okay, so hopefully you got a good dozen or so of those. Now, I'm going to ask another question. What is one belief that your mom or the motherly figure that you grew up with had about money? I'm going to just say mom from here on out, but substitute it with a motherly figure if you didn't actually grow up with your mother. Whoever was around you most caring for you. What is one belief my mom had about money? Okay. I'm going to rephrase it. My mom believed, blank, about money. My mom believed money is. My mom believed money is. My mom believed money is. What is another belief that your mother had about money? What was your mother's feeling about money? Did she like it? What's another feeling your mom had about money? Okay, good job. Okay. Now I'm going to ask you another question. And I'm going to use the word dad for your actual father, or if you grew up with a different father figure, I'm going to say dad, but just let that person come to mind, okay? What is one belief that your dad had about money? What is another belief your dad had about money? My dad believed money is. My dad believed money is. Okay, my dad believed that money is. My dad believed money is. Okay, and now let's just see if it stirred the pot. And I'm going to ask one more question. But I want to see, sometimes when we ask other questions, it kind of stirs the pot. I want to see if something else comes up. But what is one other idea that you have about money? So for you, money is what? Money is. Okay, scale of one to 10, 10 being totally thrilled and happy, zero being completely over it. Okay, on a scale of one to 10, how much do you enjoy money? Okay, a scale of one to 10, 10 being completely and totally thrilled and happy, how much do you like spending money? Scale of one to 10, 10 being totally happy, how much do you like keeping money? On a scale of one to 10, how much do you like controlling your money or being in charge of your money? Scale of one to 10, how much do you care for your money? In "Unlimited Abundance" you're going to learn some tips and tools for clearing some things. I'm not sure if you're listening to this bonus after you've already started "Unlimited Abundance," or if you're going to listen to it in the beginning. But here's the thing, we're going to have to now clear everything that came up that was negative about what you believed about money or what your parents believed about money. But now you have a list. Over the next seven days, you're going to look at one of those beliefs that are negative, obviously. And you're going to, so let's just say one of the negative beliefs is I have no money. You'll say, everywhere I believe that I have no money, I un-create, it delete it and transmute it across all time, dimension, space and reality. And then you're going to fill in with the positive. So part of the foundation, you're going to delete the old, you're going to put in the new. So then you would say, what would it take for me to know that I have more than enough time, money and resources available in every moment? Okay, so if the belief was, I have no money, so you'll say, everywhere I believe that I have no money, I'm going to un-create it, delete it and transmute it across all time, dimensions, space and reality. What would it take for me to know that I have more than enough time, money and resources available in every one moment? Alright, so what I want you to do is do these now. So take the first negative one and you say, everywhere this is true for me, you know, whatever the statement is, everywhere this is true for me I un-create it, delete it and transmute it across all time, dimensions, space and reality. And then I want you to rephrase it and rewrite it. What would it take for, and then write it down as the positive. What would it take for this to come true in my life? Okay, and take the next negative statement. And you can say, everything that I believe that's true about this, I un-create it, delete it and transmute it across all time, dimensions, space and reality, and then rewrite it into the positive. What would it take for, you know, the positive, for me to believe that I have more than enough time, money and resources in every moment. So over the next seven days, rewrite those, go through those right now. It'll probably take you at most 15, 20 minutes. It's not that much to invest in yourself. You completely and totally deserve it. You are enough. And it's just about reactivating some of your talents and tools for clearing things, for intending things, for choosing to look at your foundational things, kind of straighten it up a little bit and pull the old gunk out, put the new positive foundation blueprint belief in, and you're going to be on your way. So it's going to be so exciting for you guys. Please send me lots of Facebook love, because I want to know what's happening for you after you do this experiment. You know, just say, "Hey, Christie, here's what happened for me. I did your thing, and all of a sudden I could feel these weird things shifting. or all of a sudden I realized that my belief was imprinted by my mom. It's not even really my belief in the first place." Alright? So go to facebook.com/christiemariesheldonfans, F-A-N-S, christiemariesheldonfans, F-A-N-S. Send me some Facebook love, let me know how you're doing. And I send you many, many blessings to you. Thank you so much for participating in this program. I can't wait to hear about all your wins and the cool things that you're manifesting. Please let me know. Part of what inspires me in this world is really seeing people get it, okay? That's really my main motivation in life is that people who previously thought that was there was no other option, now, all of a sudden, know that they're a powerful creator being in a body who can make stuff happen. And so please share that love with me and tell us what's happening for you. Alright, much love and many blessings, and ciao for now. Bye.
